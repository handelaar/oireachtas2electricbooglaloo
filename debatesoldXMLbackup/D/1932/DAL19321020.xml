      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if in view of the fact that seventy unemployed men resident in Clontarf are debarred from obtaining employment on the building of the Clontarf sea wall, through the operation of a bye-law enforced at the sole discretion of the City Manager, which restricts Corporation work of a temporary character solely to men whose names are inscribed on a Register of a Labour Bureau, established under this bye-law, will he introduce proposals for legislation or take any other steps whereby such bye-laws shall be subject to confirmation by the Corporation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made careful inquiry into the matter raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The works at Clontarf to which the Deputy refers are being carried out by the Dublin Corporation at the expense of the general city rates.  The regulations of the Corporation provide that the labour for such works shall be recruited through the Corporation Labour Bureau which is available for the casual employees of the city as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that registration in the Bureau (which is designed to have lists of men available for casual works undertaken) is regulated by previous service and the allocation of employment to individuals depends on the priority of their claims and the suitability of their services for the works proposed.  It is not evident that the City Council desire to alter the regulations in the matter and nothing has <Col N="152" /> been adduced which would warrant my seeking to interfere by legislation with the procedure.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware of the conditions attached to the expenditure of the Government Relief Grants and the general position of the unemployed in relation thereto.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>

      <P>(An Clár) asked the Minister for Education if teachers in the English speaking districts are permitted to use English in the infants' classes in the National Schools; if so, whether he can state the official programme for English for such classes, whether the teaching of this programme is subject to inspection, and, if so, whether the reports of the Inspectors are considered satisfactory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the programme for infants in National Schools and the introductory notes, pages 22-24 inclusive, of the Report and Programme of the National Programme Conference&mdash;a copy of which I am sending him.</P>
      <P>The provisions of this programme require that the work of the infants' classes between the hours of 10.30 a.m. and 2 p.m. is to be entirely in Irish where the teachers are sufficiently qualified, and the aim to be achieved is stated to be the gradual extension of the use of Irish in the teaching of infants until in all schools the work of the infant classes will be entirely in Irish.  To meet the actual conditions existing and the circumstances of a period of transition, the programme also provides that a teacher who is able to teach Irish but unable to use Irish as a medium of instruction, is to teach the language as a subject for one hour a day at least, and is to use Irish as much as possible as the school language.  In such a case English would be used in varying degrees in the teaching of subjects (other than Irish), viz., Kindergarten, Arithmetic, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme does not contemplate the teaching of English as a subject in infants' classes during the <Col N="154" /> hours indicated, and there is no official programme for English in these classes.  Consequently the remaining part of the Deputy's question does not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if it is intended to introduce proposals for legislation to amend the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, on the lines suggested by the deputation representing the Cork and Munster Licensed Trade Protective Association which waited on him on the 8th June last and, if so, when such proposals will be introduced?</P>

      <P>In view of the lack of anything like general agreement, up to the present, on the subject of further amendment of the Licensing Laws, and the pressure of more urgent Government business, I cannot hold out any hope of early legislation in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister state if he is prepared to get rid of certain anomalies?  Will he state whether, for instance, the borough of Cork enjoys the same rights or privileges as other towns in regard to the extension of hours on the occasion of hurling and football matches and so on, and whether he would consider the advisability of extending to the borough of Cork the same facilities as are extended to Thurles and other boroughs in the Saorstát?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally I am not opposed to certain amendments of the Licensing Laws which seem to me reasonable and I would be inclined to consider the special matter mentioned by Deputy Anthony.  But unless there was something like a general demand by all Parties here for legislation on <Col N="155" /> those lines, I do not see that there is much substance in any promises that I would make at the moment.  I say that because of the congestion of Parliamentary business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister to consider that there are only four cities in the Free State that cannot avail of the Licensing Laws on Sundays.  These cities must close their places at 5 o'clock, after which no traveller is supplied.  Because of that, Cork City is failing in the bringing of those matches to Cork.  I am sure Dublin would have the same complaint to make.  It is rather unfair to those cities.</P>

      <P>This is a formal Bill to give sanction according to the usual procedure to the Financial Resolution which was passed in July last proposing a customs duty of 5/- per cwt. on flour imported into the Saorstát other than flour imported under license.  I suggest that as this is a preliminary step discussion might usefully be deferred until the Bill embodying that scheme comes before the Dáil.  That Bill will be circulated to-day or to-morrow.  In the meantime it is necessary to get this Bill passed and I propose that we pass it through all its Stages to-day so that it can go to the Seanad in time to become law within the period fixed by the Constitution. This Bill will cease to operate when the main Cereals Bill comes into effect.  Consequently it represents merely a temporary device to facilitate the development of our flour milling industry and to prevent forestalling <Col N="156" /> before the main Bill comes into law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephByrne" hpid="Mr. J.J. Byrne Mr. J.J. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking to this measure yesterday I drew the attention of the House to the lack of evidence that existed as to the necessity of the introduction of this Bill.  The Minister in dealing with the Bill explained its provisions very fully but adduced, as far as I could gather from his speech, no justification for the measure that he had introduced into the House.  We all know that it is very popular especially for any man connected with the House or for anybody in politics to shout &ldquo;profiteering.&rdquo;  It is a cry that appeals to the unthinking throughout the country.  But if commercial people and the people generally of this State are to be dealt with by a drastic Bill such as that which the Minister has just introduced, to my mind it is only fair and reasonable that the Minister should inform the House of his reasons for the introduction of the Bill.  Nobody for a moment will deny that it is a very far-reaching measure and that it means an imposition of a heavy nature by the public authority on private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated in the course of his speech that numerous complaints of high prices had been received and <Col N="157" /> these complaints have been sent to the Minister, but the Minister added naïvely &ldquo;that the information is such that I would like to have it investigated.&rdquo; Even the Minister cannot accept these statements, or the accuracy or truth of the complaints that have been sent to his Department from the various consumers who have been affected.  If it were our complaints and if these complaints are justified surely the proper steps to have taken would be to see if unduly high prices had been charged by the commercial community before the introduction of this Bill.  What we are in fact engaged in doing at the present moment is introducing a Bill to deal with so-called profiteering, but no evidence has been given to this House that this profiteering exists.</P>
    <P>Now as one who has some experience in business I would like to point out to the Minister and I am sure that the Minister himself knows that there is a certain percentage of the purchasing public in this country most unreasonable in their demands.  There is a certain percentage of the public judging their value on the principle of what I may term &ldquo;Woolworth's Stores.&rdquo;  No allowance for quality, no allowance for durability, no allowance for anything but price, and I can speak with actual experience and say that I have known members of the ordinary public being offered goods at pre-war prices and stating that the prices charged were excessively high and that the prices asked were too dear. Now it is upon evidence of this kind that we have had this measure introduced into the House.  I know it will be, as is always the case, that the Labour Party always submits to anything that hits the commercial man. Although the Labour Party stands for the imposition of these things upon the commercial community of the country I do not think they are so free from blame that they could take up this attitude that this Bill is justified and that no complaints can be levied against the Labour section of the ordinary public.  Now the Minister referred to these numerous complaints. I am credibly informed when the Commission was set up to examine and inquire <Col N="158" /> into these things that a single consumer appeared before the commission to tender evidence of profiteering. I believe I am credibly informed in making that statement that not a single consumer came before the commission to tender evidence of profiteering and in Page 128 of the Report dealing with the causes of high prices it states &ldquo;no doubt consumers are justified that the prices levied on groceries and provisions and the existence of high prices may be explained by other causes than the excessive profit taking of which we found little evidence, and it is upon a case like this that we have brought in a Bill to fix prices for the selling of commodities throughout the Irish Free State.&rdquo;  What I want to ask the Minister is this, is the commercial community not entitled to the same fair and equitable treatment as any other portion of the community? Are they not entitled to receive equal justice with the Labour section of the community and is it because they are not strong enough from the voting point of view that they are to be dealt with in an entirely different manner from other sections of the general public?</P>
    <P>If this Bill was necessary we want to hear from the Minister before this debate concludes some proof as to the necessity for the introduction of this Bill.  Up to the moment he has given us no proof whatever and as I pointed out before the thing that makes me feel uneasy is this that this is only a preliminary canter to what is going to follow.  We are aware that a Commission has been set up to deal with the licensing of shops and as I stated in my speech on yesterday judging by the personnel of that Commission it is an almost foregone conclusion that the licensing of shops will be held to be necessary by the findings of that Commission.  If shops are to be licensed, if the prices for commodities sold are to be fixed by a controller for whom it would be quite impossible to be familiar with every phase of the commodities for which he has got fixed prices, what do you think the ultimate price of the commercial community will be.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that the farmers <Col N="159" /> of the community are unduly hit by the present existing economic conditions and I for one thoroughly agree with that statement but I want to point out the other side of the case and that is that the commercial community&mdash;the business community&mdash;are hit just as badly as the agricultural section of the community.  I want to point out to this House that for every pound paid in rates and taxes the commercial community have got to find £2 in comparison with the ordinary man in the street.  The exorbitant rents which we traders have to pay has been a complaint of many years standing.  In addition to that we have the Dublin Poor Relief Act which presumably operates throughout the rest of the Free State in another guise and when they find money for poor relief and feeding the destitute they are certainly providing a very considerable sum of money that goes into the coffers of the State.  On top of this the controller is to come in and fix prices upon commodities about which I have already stated he knows nothing whatever and there is no justification given by the Minister for introducing this Bill except to say that he has received certain complaints with regard to high prices throughout the country.  Here in the very Report dealing with the Bill.  I have pointed out that the Commission has found that it is not justified in finding that high prices of profiteering has been established as a result of their inquiry.  Why the Bill?  There is only portion of this Bill which is perhaps justifiable.  That is the portion of the Bill dealing with the fixation of prices for protected commodities.</P>
    <P>What I want to ask this House is this: Is it fair first to introduce this Bill and to make in addition a threat of charging £200,000 or £250,000 by way of licence duties to the ordinary 40,000 retailers in the Irish Free State who are in just as precarious a position under existing economic conditions as are the agricultural community. In fact I notice in one portion of the Report that it refers to the licensing of shops as a speedy means of putting out of business a certain <Col N="160" /> number of inefficient businessmen.  No definition has been given of the word inefficiency in the course of that Report.  It would be very interesting to know from the Minister what in his opinion he considers an inefficient business man.  I say throughout the country those engaged in the commercial community are unable to produce agricultural products at an economic price.  I do not for a moment attempt to charge the agricultural community with inefficiency. I want to point out that the agricultural community have many advantages over the ordinary business man. The land in the first instance has been bought out at a huge sum of money for the agricultural community.  There is a very large proportion of its rates and taxes paid through derating. There is in addition to that the Agricultural Credit Corporation which advances capital for various purposes and is there a single one of these advantages arising under the present economic system to any man engaged in business or commerce?  Business men have been able to pay their 20/-in the £.  They have been able to educate their families not at the expense of the State but at their own expense.  They have been able to make just a fair livelihood, and the mere fact, as I referred to yesterday, that only something like 10,000 people are able to pay income tax out of 40,000 people is clear and positive proof that profiteering does not exist for where there is profiteering there is undoubtedly profit.  If there were profits you could leave it to the Finance Department to find that those profits exist and to see that a fair share of them came into the coffers of the State.  I do not wish to antagonise any section of the House in my criticism of this Bill.  I do not wish to antagonise the Labour Party any more than any other section of the House.  All I ask is a fair and equitable deal for the business community in any legislation that is passed.  I assert without fear of contradiction that the Bill we are now passing through the House is a Bill not justified, a Bill that will not be productive of good results, a Bill that <Col N="161" /> will be very harmful to the retailers of this country, who as I have already said, are just as entitled to fair play as any other section of the community. Now we all know that the circulation of money in this country was never worse.</P>
    <P>We are faced here by this Bill fixing prices and we are facing this other thing, the licensing of shops, which will come from this Commission. Where are business men going to find the extra £200,000 or £250,000?  I would like the Labour Party to answer that question.  At the present time the business community are only finding working expenses, rates and taxes and general upkeep, with the greatest possible difficulty, and if you put any further burden on them you are going to put a great proportion of them out of business.  Of course this report frankly confesses that the licensing of shops has that object and that object only for its purpose, but what I want to ask the Minister is this, if you put 10,000 business men out of business what is going to become of them? Where are they going to get a livelihood? Where are they going to provide for their children?  They have no insurance stamps, they have no stamped cards to go to the Labour Exchange, and they are going to be absorbed. How?  Anybody looking for a job at the present time knows, especially any man who has been in business for himself, that the chances of employment for a business man who is bankrupt and put out of his business are non-existent.  Is the House going to pass this measure in the face of a state of affairs like that?  I want to draw the attention of the House to other very important factors that go to the charging of high prices and to which no reference at all has been made.  One of the commodities that is going to be valued by way of a fixation of prices is bread.  Now did the Minister read the report dealing with the labour element in the production of bread?  Will the Minister explain if he thinks it is fair to fix prices for the commercial end of the business and to leave the labour end go free?  Will the Minister explain to this House how it is in the city of Dublin that the weekly <Col N="162" /> product of the Irish bakers on an average is twelve sacks of flour per week, that in Belfast it is twenty-four, that in Liverpool it is twenty-seven, that in Manchester it is thirty-eight, and that the hours of labour are 48 in Great Britain and 46 in the Irish Free State? Now if bread is manufactured at the rate of 38 sacks in Great Britain, and there are 12 sacks manufactured in the Irish Free State does the Minister honestly not think that that end of the question is entitled to his most careful consideration in the framing of legislation in this Bill?  We all know that to-day in many instances labour is getting something like 300 per cent. over pre-war by way of wages and any man engaged in business knows that the maximum average charge is 100 per cent. over pre-war, and that in a great many instances trade is so bad that a large percentage of commodities is actually sold at pre-war prices.  This is the section of the community that has been called profiteers.  Let us have fair play and fair treatment of the question.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to refute any statement I have made in the course of this debate.  I do not wish to exaggerate the position in any way.  I deny that profiteering exists.  I rely upon this report that has dealt with the whole question, which establishes that fact in portion of the report, and I also want to remind the Minister that similar legislation has been introduced in other countries, and that after it was in operation for a very short period of time they were exceedingly glad to get rid of it and wipe it off the Statute Book.  I think this House ought to profit by the experience of other countries.  I suggest that no useful purpose is going to be served by passing this measure through the House, and I say you are going to inflict very severe hardship upon a very deserving section of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>While appreciating the fact that dealing with a subject of this kind presents very considerable difficulties my complaint about this Bill is that it does not go <Col N="163" /> far enough.  I regret that on reading the Bill and hearing it explained I see in it a very obvious hesitancy to take any strong measures, and I complain, I think with some reason, that there are altogether too many avenues of escape for the person who has been proved to be guilty of an offence under the provisions of the Bill.  Take the provision by which the controller gives twenty-one days' notice to somebody whom he proves to have been charging excessive prices, to mend his ways.  It is clear that in the case of some commodities the whole supply that would be the subject of excessive charges would have been exhausted in that time, and that at the end of that time there does not appear to be any remedy except to begin all over again. That period should be shortened, and there is in my opinion no case for making that period any longer than, say, seven days.  I cannot see any justification whatever for a provision in the Bill by which the employer&mdash;the owner of the concern&mdash;has a good defence in law as regards profiteering, if he can show that the offence has been committed by an assistant.  In the licensing business the owner of the licensed business is responsible for a breach of the law, even if it has occurred without his knowledge and that breach is due to negligence on the part of his assistant. I regret that much of the good which would accrue as a result of a measure of this kind cannot be obtained if certain amendments are not inserted in the Bill before it leaves this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole burden of Deputy Byrne's speech is that there has been no profiteering.  If that is so the Bill is not going to do any harm.  It would be altogether an inoffensive piece of legislation, and I cannot see any substance in his complaint in that direction.  While he has made that case he has not taken up any specific instance or given us any details to substantiate this statement.  I propose to do something in that direction. I am a member of a board of assistance and recently we were considering a contract for the supply of prime beef, beef that should pass the <Col N="164" /> doctor's inspection, for a small hospital in West Cork.  The number of patients normally in that hospital would be from a dozen to twenty, and we accepted a tender for prime beef at 3d. per lb., to supply twelve or fifteen patients in the local hospital. I want it to be clear that the tender was not for supplies to the County Home where there would be 300 or 400 persons.  It was for the supply of beef for twelve or fifteen persons. Meat was being sold in that town over the counter at something like three times that price and in connection with beef, mutton and bacon, one having any shred of common sense has only to relate the retail price that the producer of such commodities obtains in the open market to what is being charged over the counters to find ample and complete evidence of profiteering.</P>
    <P>One does agree that a reasonable profit is necessary.  Business could not be carried on otherwise and there is, of course, always the honourable exception.  A number of honest people who only require a fair profit are in business and one must also take into consideration the fact that people in business have to meet such things as bad debts, establishment charges, costs of staffs and things like that, but, in the case of meat, the people in the business employ scarcely any staff.  One or two individuals carry on the business and there can be no case made for the altogether too big discrepancy between the retail charges for such commodities and the price which is paid for a beast when purchased at the markets or fairs.  I do not propose to give any further instances but, in regard to the items I have mentioned, if there were no other case, action of this kind would be justified and I hope that the Minister, when giving us this Bill finally, will remedy the defects and put an instrument into the hands of the public that will arm them against what is going on in this connection all over the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Bill because I think it is a necessary part of the policy of a Government in a State where, due, perhaps, to excessive <Col N="165" /> tariffs in various directions, there is an imminent danger of a rise in price corresponding to the amount of the tariff.  I think that there is an absolute necessity for the Government to guard against what every consumer claims is a very heavy charge by the middleman for the commodities which he distributes.  That may be due to the fact that there is a very large number of middlemen&mdash;far more than is necessary.  There are far more distributors, in proportion to the population, than there are producers. There are too many distributors and too few producers, and, due probably to the overhead charges which these numerous distributors have to bear, they probably make it up by putting it on to their profits.  It is possible that such things as bad debts, mentioned by the last speaker, may have a good deal to do with it, but I feel that this Bill is a necessary part of the policy which the Government would have to undertake if they are to keep down the very serious danger to the community of increasing the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agricultural community have been mentioned by Deputy J.J. Byrne, and I have no hesitation in saying that, at the present moment, they are not able to pay the various sums mentioned by him&mdash;land annuities or rates.  There is a very big falling off in the payment of both, and I cannot attribute that to any other cause than the fact that they have to pay a very large sum in outgoings for their requirements. It is utterly impossible for the agricultural community to carry on their work of production, if the costs of their requirements are to be as they are, at the present stage, without any control.  Reference has been made by Deputy Byrne to the fact that there has been no evidence given by the consumer.  I am not surprised at that because the consumer is absolutely unorganised.  There is no movement short of the co-operative bring before the Government the grievances which many of them have to bear and evidence is not wanting when we know that profits are often 100 per cent.  In the case of potatoes, <Col N="166" /> in the case of butter, in the case of meat&mdash;undoubtedly, meat is an instance of a commodity in which huge profiteering is going on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and a considerable amount more.  In the city of Cork there is an organisation now which has brought down the price of meat by over 4d. a lb. and they are paying the farmer a generous price for his animals.  It has been my experience, as a member of more than one hospital committee and board of public assistance, that contract prices show a very marked difference from ordinary retail prices, and that when a contractor is also a retailer, he will contract for the various boards of assistance, hospitals and other public bodies, and even hotels, and will give a very considerable reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that it is certainly a wise act on the part of the State to step in and protect the general body of the community who have neither the organisation nor other means of protecting themselves from undoubted gross overcharging. Wherever an effort has been made to bring consumers together or to bring any particular section of the community together, there has been an immediate and marked reduction of the price which they have had to pay for their bulked orders when those orders are bought in bulk. There is one undoubted fact which, I think, cannot be denied on any side of the House, and that is, the innumerable persons who are engaged in distribution&mdash;and there is a marked tendency to increase the number.  There is a tendency not to engage in manual labour and it is looked upon as a very desirable thing to open a shop whether or not a person has the skill to carry on that work.  The desire is there and I think it would be a very good thing for the State to step in and endeavour <Col N="167" /> to control prices where the consumers' interests are at stake.</P>
    <P>Then there is the case of the poor. We had a demonstration yesterday which shows that unemployment is increasing and that poverty is increasing and I am getting evidence of it from my own constituency.  I have every sympathy with those men.  It is the poor who have to give the highest prices and it is the poor who get probably least value.  They probably get an inferior article at a very much higher price.  Where they pay ready money they are an undoubted advantage to the country.  I feel that in protecting their interests the State is doing something of undoubted value which will avert what would be a national disaster, because, where the cost of living is increasing as it is, the people to suffer will be the poor, and I welcome the Bill as a means of curtailing that.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to bread. In whatever direction the fault lies&mdash; whether it is the fault of the distributor or the worker&mdash;I believe it is a matter in respect of which it is the bounden duty of the State to investigate, and, if possible, to control prices. It is the staff of life and under no circumstances can the State turn a deaf ear to the appeal of the worker or disregard the growing tendency to increase the price of that article.</P>
    <P>I mentioned four articles, butter, potatoes, meat and bread.  The cost of clothing is another article that will have to be vigorously controlled.  If manufacturers are to get a fair price for the cloth it is the duty of the State to see that that price is not exceeded, whether in the manufacture of the cloth, or on the finished articles, as well as on boots.  The general public, which is not able to protect itself, unless by the formation of co-operative societies, should be protected by the State.  If the objects of the Bill are so good, and if the effects likely to accrue so desirable, I have no hesitation in supporting it.  Even Deputy Byrne, who is usually a vigorous speaker, made, I think, more or less of an apologia for the distributor.  I think the Deputy was not able to make <Col N="168" /> a very strong case there, as behind his mind lay the fact that there was the necessity of protecting those on the other side.  Whatever my previous criticism of the Government may have been, I have no hesitation whatever about supporting this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this Bill because I believe the main, if not the sole, object of it is to humbug people who are feeling the pinch at the present time. and to humbug people like Deputy Brasier, who want to be humbugged. It is impossible for a Bill of this sort to have any real effect in bringing about a reduction of prices, or in preventing what is called profiteering. If the Bill had any purpose that might be successful, and if it is the intention of the Government&mdash; as much of their policy would seem to indicate&mdash;to increase in every direction the power of the State; to bring everything under State control, well, this Bill will give them a large new field of activity.  It will give them power over business and individuals, and power to exercise coercion through new channels; and power perhaps to conscript political support.  If that is the object of the Bill then I am sure it will serve its purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the purpose of the Government, as the speeches of some Ministers would indicate, is to go on to the collective State then they will get an excuse out of this Bill, because it will absolutely fail to bring any benefit whatever to the consumers.  It is possible for the Government to use that as an argument for starting the State factories that some Deputies talked about, and starting the State shops which ought to follow from the State factories.  If they do that, as happened in Australia and other places, they will be able for a time to benefit consumers by charging them again in their capacity as taxpayers.  I do not know whether that is one of the objects behind the Bill, but if not then I say it has been introduced in a spirit of complete cynicism, exactly in the same spirit as the election pledges that were given concerning the reduction of £2,000,000 in taxation and other things.  It is done simply to deceive <Col N="169" /> a foolish and gullible people who were looking for relief, who need relief, and who are willing to swallow any sort of promise given them.</P>
    <P>There are circumstances in which a Bill of this type might do something. If in some period of very special emergency there was some sudden shortage of supplies, or something of that nature certain benefits could be got by controlling prices.  During the European War we had control of prices but the object then was not to reduce prices.  Nothing was further from the desire of the British Government at the time than to reduce prices.  The sole policy was to raise prices to a position where wages would go up continually and get the stimulus to inflation.  The purpose of controlling prices was simply to regulate the increase in prices. If there was a system of rationing a Bill such as this would probably be a necessary complement, but we are not in a position where rationing is required, or where we need take the very special measures that would be necessary to get a fair distribution of goods. I think in any normal circumstances nothing can be done for the consumer by this sort of machinery. That is pretty generally the view of those who have had any experience of this sort of control, and of those who have studied the matter.</P>
    <P>The Bill is divided roughly into two main divisions.  One division deals with the wholesale and the retail trade and the other with manufacturers.  In his Second Reading speech I think the Minister scarcely attempted to justify the part of the Bill that deals with the distributors, whether wholesale or retail. He rested his defence of the Bill practically on the part that deals with manufacturers.  If there was anything at all to be said for the Bill&mdash; and I think there is practically nothing to be said for it&mdash;it would be in respect to the part that deals with manufacturers. The idea that profiteering can be dealt with, or needs to be dealt with by State intervention, is really a fatuous idea, as&mdash;except, for instance, in respect to medicants or alcoholic liquor&mdash;anybody can start a shop.  No licence or permission is required, and <Col N="170" /> if there are high profits to be made in any sort of shop over any prolonged period, then there are plenty of people who will come in in an attempt to get a share of the spoils. There can be no real control of prices except on the basis of competition that profits will bring.  People are not at all confined to the enterprise of private individuals.  Combinations of people can distribute goods if big profits are being made out of such distribution. Some Deputies referred to the fact that recently there have been certain combinations of people engaged in distribution and that the cost, which was simply phenomenal, fell on the primary product and was not followed immediately by a reduction in the prices charged by retailers.  There is always a lag in these things, and that lag gives an opportunity to new groups of people to come into trade and to bring about an adjustment in retail prices.</P>
    <P>Everybody in town or country has a choice of shops.  A person in a town can go from one to another shop.  A person in the country may not travel from one shop to another, but he will have what we have noticed, the travelling shops coming to his door.  You are not going to have combination amongst all the people engaged in travelling around the country with goods to get prices which give abnormally high returns.  You may have a lag sometimes when the price of the primary product falls.  You will always have that before retail prices fall to a corresponding degree.  You have these things automatically regulated, and you cannot get them better regulated by any sort of Governmental action. If profits are high or if there are undue profits, there will always be someone to come in to share in the gold mine.  These big profits cannot continue except for a week or two, or for a month or two.  If prices are not due to undue profits but due to bad organisation or distribution you will find that that cannot be dealt with by this Bill.  In practice, it will not be possible for the Government to deal with that position by this Bill.</P>
    <P>If in some districts there are a dozen shops where there is only trade for <Col N="171" /> one shop, and if that is what is keeping the prices up, it will be found in practice that you cannot use the powers in this Bill to drive eleven of those shopkeepers out of trade.  If you were to do that you would have difficulties which the Government could not face&mdash;the difficulties of bankruptcies, the difficulties of unemployment, the difficulties of drastic wage reductions.  If it were the intention to reorganise distribution by forcing prices down regardless of whether or not distributors were making profits, I say that after a very short trial the powers would fall&mdash;would necessarily fall&mdash;into disuse.  Not only will it not be found possible by means of any powers in this Bill to bring prices down below the levels to which they will be brought by competition, but I believe that actually the putting into operation of a Bill such as this will tend to have, in some very minor degree I admit, the very sort of effects that price control had during the War. I believe that it will raise the average level of prices.  Shopkeepers will have to fight the representatives of the Controller or the representatives of the Commission, they will have to meet together and make their case and put up their representations, and that organisation, for the purpose of making representations with the object of protesting against regulations or orders that are issued and for getting modifications of them, will very easily lead to the formation of far closer rings than exist at present. One of the things that this will do is that where you have free competition, where you have no organisation amongst traders, you will force them to form unions or societies and to stand together and to a certain extent get regulation by them that did not exist before.  Every time and at every point, while the Bill is being put into operation, it will be impossible to consider only the case of the thoroughly efficient distributor.  No matter what the intentions may be, you will have to consider&mdash;the human factors will lead to a consideration of&mdash;the less efficient distributor and prices will <Col N="172" /> always have to be fixed at the average price at which the retailer can manage to sell his goods, and there will be a tendency for all shopkeepers to put their prices up to the fixed price.</P>
    <P>The scheme, so far as these countries were concerned, was invented and put into operation for the purpose of regulating the calculated increase in prices.  I do not believe that it can be used to reduce prices.  Whatever the intentions of the Government may be, if the powers are used they will produce combinations and lead to an increase in the average prices rather than to a reduction of the average.  The Bill will cost something &mdash;it depends on the amount of activity that it is intended shall take place under it.</P>

      <P>There are going to be extra charges on the community. There are going to be increases in taxation.  The very charges that may be put on the retailers as a result of contesting the decisions of these authorities and in preparing their cases for them&mdash;all these sort of extra charges that are going to be borne directly by the State and to be forced on the retailers will have to be borne by the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the part of the Bill dealing with manufacturers, I think that in all probability it will be quite as ineffective, so far as giving any benefit to the customer is concerned, as the other parts of the Bill.  If you are dealing with combinations of manufacturers, it will not be easy at all to reduce the prices.  It will be found that it will be provable that a particular manufacturer is making no undue profits.  It will be provable that he is just able to earn interest on the capital invested and to keep his hands employed, and it will not be possible to say that if A and B are making an identical article that A is to sell it at one price and B at another. <Col N="173" /> Those dealing with the one commodity will have to be allowed to sell it at the one price, and that will be the price that will allow the least efficient of these manufacturers to carry on. There will be all sorts of camouflage and it will not be possible to ascertain exactly all the cost or all the profits and it may be taken that in 99 cases out of 100 there will be no possibility in dealing with any group of manufacturers of reducing the prices charged.  If you are dealing with a monopoly where there is one individual firm operating, there will be very considerable difficulties, although perhaps not as much as in the case of a group.  There will be many ways and means available for the manufacturer to swell his charges and at the same time avoid penalization for these overcharges.  If there is a case where a single manufacturer, who has been given a monopoly by a tariff, is making undue profits, it should not be dealt with in this way. It should be dealt with by an adjustment of the tariff.  It should be dealt with by a consideration of the tariff in all its bearings and either by dividing the commodity into classes and varying the amount of the tariff in that way, or by a time limit, or by whatever method examination would show to be necessary.</P>
    <P>If any regulation is necessary to deal with the prices of manufactured commodities, it is only a condemnation of the methods adopted by the Government in the imposition of tariffs.  If the tariffs were imposed in the way in which they ought to be imposed, no such necessity would arise and I think that the way to deal with any profiteering that may arise in protected industries is to adjust the tariffs.  If you have very considerable interference with manufacturers in this Bill in the protected industries, you will not get the increases in production that are required.  The country is going to have to bear the burdens which the tariff will impose and will not get the benefits in the way of increased employment that might come from the tariffs.  I believe that the Bill is entirely worthless.  It is introduced, I am satisfied, with no real conviction <Col N="174" /> as to its necessity and with no real belief in its efficacy.  It is generally the case that a lot of people who have not considered the matter and felt the pinch talked about profiteering and believed that profiteering was something that could easily be cured by Governmental action whereas profiteering can only be cured by commercial action.  If there is prolonged and serious profiteering it is certain to be cured by commercial action.  A lot of people of various kinds and in various places in the country became possessed of the idea that it was very easy to distribute and to make big profits out of distribution.  We had co-operative stores established and people who established them, in many cases, were not long in finding out that distribution was not the easy and highly profitable thing they thought it was. If there were these enormous profits in distribution or in profiteering to talk about this would be the best action to be taken to check it and if necessary to kill it by any suitable way in which it could be killed.  If the Government set out to do it they are only going to create a much greater evil, and in the long run, and, perhaps immediately, to leave the consumer much worse off than he was before.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather amazed at Deputy Blythe attempting to defend the successful gombeen men in the country.  This Bill has been called for, not politically, but by the supporters of every Party in this House. There is no doubt about it that scandalous profiteering has been going on.  Farmers' produce has been sold at three times what it was purchased for not alone here in Dublin, but throughout the country.  The unfortunate people are not getting fair play in any sense in this respect. Deputy Blythe has attempted to draw red herrings across the trail.  He said, first of all, this Bill increases the power of the State.  Anybody who sat in this House, for the last few years, and remembers the Bills introduced, and passed by Deputy Blythe and the Executive Council of which he was a member, would come to the conclusion that a further increase in the power of the State could only be <Col N="175" /> done by establishing a dictatorship and Deputy Blythe and his Government were near doing that.  Then he told us that this Bill was intended to find jobs for political hangers-on and &ldquo;down-and-outs.&rdquo; I have seen some of Deputy Blythe's &ldquo;down-and-outs&rdquo; for whom jobs were created working in my county.  Talk of that kind comes well from Deputy Blythe. Anybody in this Dáil who remembers the last Pensions Act passed two months before the general election must surely smile when he hears Deputy Blythe's allusion to jobs for &ldquo;down-and-outs.&rdquo; If all the people who got pensions in Monaghan from June 1927 to September, 1927, were brought together I would be surprised if the number was not enough to sweep, not alone the British Army, but the whole of us into the sea.</P>
      <P>But to get back to this Bill.  The last Government in February, 1926, appointed a tribunal to consider prices.  That tribunal was set up at great cost to the State.  They held 54 public sittings, 24 private sittings, and they examined 379 witnesses.  All these witnesses from different parts of the country came to Dublin to give evidence and had their expenses paid for out of the public purse.  We find that the first statement the Commission made was that a permanent tribunal should be set up to control prices. They said further &ldquo;We have satisfied ourselves that in certain areas consumers have to pay high prices for particular articles of food, bread, meat and milk and that an excessive margin of profit is secured.&rdquo;  That tribunal reported in 1927 and from 1927 to 1932, the unfortunate consumers were left without redress and the profiteers were left to gather an increased margin of profit.  This Tribunal was set up at great cost to the State. Surely to goodness it was not set up without some definite information being in the hands of the Executive Council that profiteering was going on. Public money was expended in preparing this report but no action was taken by the Executive Council.  The unfortunate people continued to be fleeced from 1927 to 1932 and no action whatever was taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> Of course I realise that the gombeen man pays up fairly well to the election fund; and he can afford it.  If he makes a profit of £300 or £400 extra for five years because of the failure of the Executive Council to act on the report of the Tribunal set up by themselves then he can afford to contribute fairly decently towards the election fund when the time comes, and no doubt he does so.  Take the price of bread!  Is there any Deputy who will say that the price of bread, in the last six or seven years, has any relation whatever to the price of flour.</P>

      <P>Yes, but this relates to the control of prices.  I am most anxious to give all the information in my power.  The price of milk in a <Col N="177" /> particular town in my constituency was under the control of a milk ring for a considerable period. The price quoted there for that period was 2/- per gallon.  The people succeeded in having it reduced to 1/4 per gallon and it could be sold at 1/4 at a very good profit to the producer. I do not know the price of milk here in Dublin but I am sure there are Deputies here who could give us first hand information on that point.  I am sure that on the benches opposite, Deputy Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll could give the price paid by the consumer and Deputy O'Leary the price paid to the producer and they would come very close to the mark.</P>

      <P>Because like Deputy O'Leary, I was not able to look after it myself.  I always speak the truth. You can take any other article produced in the same line.  I can take an article about which we had a very considerable agitation at every election, and something that was definitely used during the last election against Fianna Fáil.  I take the price of stout, which concerns everybody. I believe you are all anxious about it. All farmer Deputies in the House will remember that from 1918 to 1922 the price paid to the farmer for barley was something round about 52/- per barrel.  The price of stout at that time was the very same as it is to-day. The duty on stout was also the same as it is to-day.  Last year the price of barley was 14/6 per barrel, showing a difference of 37/6 as compared with 1922, which was not passed on to the consumer.  There is one specific article.  I have made it out in pints, myself, and I find that the brewer could afford to reduce the price of stout by 2½d per pint and have the same profit as in 1920.  I am not making any statements here that have <Col N="178" /> not been very well borne out by the Food Prices Tribunal.  They state, for instance, that the net profit on Guinness's stout went as high as 33.8 per cent.  When you compare that profit with the price the producer gets for his barley I think that a case can be made out not alone for this Bill but a case can also be made out for placing a lot of oily-faced gentlemen in jail. The only complaint I find with the Bill is that it does not go far enough.  I know of shopkeepers who come in to start in towns, and they are considered most unsuccessful if, after two years in a little shop, they are not able to get a house by the seaside and a motor car to take them to town every day&mdash; successful hucksters.  They would be considered most unsuccessful if they could not do that.  I think Deputy Anthony could bear me out in some of these facts if he likes to do so.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blythe said that there was no case for the Bill.  A case was made for the Bill in 1927 before the Tribunal set up by the late Executive Council, but no steps were taken by the late Executive Council from 1927 to 1932 though that Tribunal was paid for out of the public purse.  Then Deputy Blythe made another case.  He said that the Bill would raise the level of prices.  Was it in order to raise the level of prices for the shopkeepers that he set up his Tribunal?  I think there is nothing wanted so much at the present day as a Tribunal to see that unfortunate consumers are not fleeced, as undoubtedly they have been fleeced.  It is about time it ended.  I would urge on the Minister that he is not going far enough in this Bill.  I think there should be a definite system of fines and a definite system of jail without fines for individuals who are found guilty of gross profiteering, that is after they have received one warning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this profiteering is carried on to a scandalous extent by some shopkeepers. I must say that it is only some shopkeepers who go in for it, but undoubtedly they are there.  I, for one, would take these gentlemen who batten on the poverty of the poor and place them where they should be put&mdash;inside the four walls of <Col N="179" /> a jail.  It is the only place for them. I am very glad the Minister has introduced the Bill, and I hope that he will remember that even fines are not sufficient punishment for these gentlemen. I suggest that after a warning has been given, in the case of a second offence at any rate, an offender should be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of any period from a month to twelve months.  I see some of these gentlemen who come into town very lean, who start operations very lean, and who grow big corporations in four months as a result of the prices they charge the poor.  You would find that these corporations would go down very quickly if they got a spell inside a jail.  I am sure it would do them all good.  I confidently recommend it to the Minister as a cure for profiteering.</P>

      <P>In discussing this Bill we should remember that this is not the first attempt that has been made to control prices.  I think it was in the fourth century that one of the earliest attempts was made by the Emperor Diocletian.  Following on bad prices consequent on a bad harvest an attempt was made to regulate the price of practically everything. Women's ordinary clothes, the clothes which they wore when they attended special functions, the price of food, the price of ducks, workmen's wages&mdash; all were regulated, but the attempt at control was a failure.  I do not propose to make an historical survey of Price Control Bills, but we can all remember what happened during the late European war when a price was fixed for rabbits.  The price of rabbits was considered too high.  A price was fixed for them and the rabbits disappeared.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>To come down to some of the points in this Bill, there is no definition of what a contract is.  I do not know what the Minister has in his mind, but apparently both contracts in the retail trade and in the wholesale trade are going to come under review. <Col N="180" /> I think the Minister will have to specify what he means by a contract.  The next matter I wish to direct the attention of the Minister to is the provision in Section 18 with regard to an investigation before the Commission.  Apparently there is no machinery for allowing trade associations to be represented. I would respectfully submit to the Minister that where there are trade associations the quickest and the easiest way of getting on, if the trade associations are prepared to take up the matter and deal with it for their members, would be to have it placed in their hands.  No doubt the Minister will consider that point.  A reading of sub-section (2) of Section 19 gives the impression that the Press are going to be excluded from these trials or investigations. Well, it might conceivably be considered advisable, at certain sittings, that these should be held in private, but surely that could be brought about by some sort of resolution leaving the ordinary sittings of the Commission open to the Press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter I wish to bring to the Minister's attention.  Apparently contracts are expressly excluded from Part 4.  Later in the Bill, under Section 1 of Section 38, it is mentioned that &ldquo;nothing in Part 3 or Part 5 of this Act shall affect such contracts or any of the terms thereof.&rdquo;  Why is a contract excluded from Part 4?  Another matter I would like to bring to the notice of the House is the position the Controller is in.  Apparently the Controller in certain cases can make a price certificate on the report of an inspector. I have no doubt that the Price Controller will be an experienced person.  He would want to be.  At the same time, without in the slightest suggesting that he might have any bias, it would be possible for him to make a mistake, and therefore I think that the price should be fixed in the name of the Commission so that persons would be enabled to appeal to the Commission if they thought they were aggrieved by the price certificate of the Controller.  I do not know whether the Minister thinks that in certain special instances&mdash;I do not suggest that this should be encouraged&mdash;<Col N="181" /> if a manifest injustice should be done either to an individual or an association there should not be the right of a further appeal.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I desire to call attention to, and it is that &ldquo;any notice or certificate required ... to be served on any person may be served by delivering it to such person or by leaving it with a person over sixteen years of age at the premises where such first-mentioned person carries on business, or by sending it by registered post to such first-mentioned person at such premises.&rdquo; Does that mean it will be a good defence to a charge under this Bill to say that the price having been fixed no notice was served on this particular person.  I do not know whether there is very much in that or how far prices will be fixed in consultation with the trade concerned over an area.  Certainly if this Bill is to have any chance of success, where every other Act of the kind has failed, it would appear as if the very closest attention ought to be given to the machinery for working it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>There probably is a reason for the introduction of this Bill, but there is just the possibility that it may have very serious repercussions. It is extraordinarily difficult to say what is a fair profit.  Adam Smith in his &ldquo;Wealth of Nations,&rdquo; dealing with prices, stated, I think, that it was generally understood throughout the world that businesses in which there was a small turnover were allowed a larger share of profits than businesses in which there was a considerable turnover.  He also stated, I think, that as regards business of a very unpleasant nature, such as butchering and other business of that description, that it was customary that the profit in the case of these was larger than is usually charged in other trades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The danger I see in this Bill is this: We have throughout the country a considerable number of small shopkeepers, people who are just managing to make a fairly decent living out of shopkeeping.  Their turnover is small. To enable them to secure a fairly <Col N="182" /> decent livelihood as a result of their trading they have to charge probably a shade more on articles they sell than would be charged by the larger stores. It is possible that the effect of this Bill will be to drive these people entirely out of business.  Take the case of chemists.  It is a standing joke all over the country that chemists' profits are really beyond what are reasonable. Probably the reason given by Adam Smith would account for that: That no one goes to a chemist unless necessity compels him, with the result that his turnover is small, consequently his profits have to be larger than if he were doing a big business.  If as the result of the operation of this measure the chemist is limited to a comparatively small profit, then I am afraid you will have very few chemists' shops in the country.</P>
    <P>A considerable number of small shopkeepers probably will be driven out of business, with the result that business will be concentrated amongst a smaller number of the larger establishments. Of course that may be very desirable.  Some Deputies a moment ago mentioned the fact that perhaps the Bill would have the effect of driving a considerable number of traders out of business because they will not be able to compete with the larger houses.  I think some Deputies stated that co-operative societies could be established. I know something about business.  This may seem strange, but often and often I have seen the individual trader beat the co-operative stores in price.  I know plenty of cases, in which individual shopkeepers were able to cut the price charged in the co-operative stores, and I think it is the experience generally of people throughout the country that the co-operative stores have not been a success.  I suppose what is everybody's business is nobody's business.  There is hardly a town in which the keen, local shopkeeper cannot beat the co-operative prices.  I think that this talk of profiteering is greatly exaggerated. Here and there excessive prices have been charged.  Amongst the shopkeepers, as amongst other classes, there are unscrupulous people and these people occasionally overcharge <Col N="183" /> the public.  But I think there was no reason at all for the outcry which was raised.  There is not a street in the city of Dublin in which you will not find a dozen people carrying on the same class of trade.  If shopkeeper No. 1 is charging too much, shopkeeper No. 2 is there to cut him and shopkeeper No. 3 is there to cut him, in turn.  So far as I know, there is no combination amongst these people to keep up prices.  There is competition and, while competition is the life of trade, it is also the protection of the consumer. Shopkeepers are keen enough to realise that if they charge a fair price they will do a better business. From time to time shopkeepers advertise goods at certain cut prices, so that the consumer is fairly adequately protected.  If this Bill is going to save the community from the unscrupulous shopkeeper, it will serve a good purpose and I welcome it.  I intend to vote for it, but I can see a danger if it is carried to excess.  If the provisions of the Bill are carried out to the extreme point, there is a danger that a considerable number of people at present making a living in Ireland will be driven out of it.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the matter to which I should like to direct attention.  We often hear the complaint that there are too many officials in this country.  It is just possible that we are going to add to these officials. Some Deputy said that the Bill would be used to provide jobs for political hangers-on.  I do not think that will be so, but it is just possible that we will add to the number of officials. Then, certain cranky, vindictive people will keep sending complaints to the Commission because they have a grievance against a certain shopkeeper or shopkeepers.  In that way a good many people who are endeavouring to make a fair and honest living will be constantly harried and worried.  There is another danger.  A number of people are being carried on credit.  What is going to happen if shopkeepers shut down credit&mdash;if, as a result of the operations of this measure, shopkeepers are driven into the position that they can no longer give credit?  The results <Col N="184" /> will be very serious.  In the end, of course, it may be good for the country. I think there is too much credit given in Ireland, and that it would be far better for the customers of the shops if less credit were given.  That is one of the causes of extravagant living.  But it has helped in bad times many a person to carry on who would otherwise have gone under.  If many shopkeepers are forced to close down credit as a result of the operation of this measure, it will be a serious matter.  These are all potential dangers, and I hope that those who will be charged with the administration of the Act will take cognisance of them.  If not properly administered, the Act might be a cause of grave danger.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am supporting this Bill, and I welcome it as a serious effort and genuine endeavour on the part of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to protect the citizens against exploitation by way of profiteering. At the same time, I wonder if the Minister has the full support of his own Party for this measure.  I am impelled to ask that question by the two lines of thought disclosed by the speeches of Deputy Corry and Deputy Goulding.  We heard Deputy Corry talk of the scandalous profiteering which is going on.  The Minister, in his opening statement&mdash;he had, I presume, given a good deal of thought and examination to the matter and he should know his subject&mdash;was rather dubious as to whether or not there was profiteering in any shape or form in the Free State.  Deputy Corry tells us that there has been scandalous profiteering.  That is an advance upon what the Minister suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary cost of the farmers' produce has been mentioned.  In any system of costing we must allow for the expense of distribution.  If we take any article of commerce, we will find that the primary costs are relatively small when we take the final cost into consideration.  The cost across the counter may appear to be altogether out of proportion to the primary cost of the commodity.  So long as the farmer and the ordinary producer remain what they are, we must have somebody to distribute <Col N="185" /> their goods.  Any tyro in economics will admit that.  We have not yet reached the stage in this civilisation of ours when the producer is his own distributor.  Deputy Corry was allowed to introduce matters which I considered extraneous but, of course, the Ceann Comhairle is the better judge of that.  He spoke of the cost to the State of pensions, and accused the last Government of distributing a lot of money, by way of pensions, to their hangers-on in Monaghan and elsewhere.  I draw the attention of Deputy Corry and other Deputies to the fact that we have on the Order Paper to-day another Pensions Bill. I shall not say anything about the merits or de-merits of the measure, but when this Bill becomes law it will add very considerably, indeed, to the national outlay by way of payments to persons whom Deputy Corry thinks should not receive these emoluments. It is that kind of confused thinking and absurd reasoning that has led many people in the State astray as regards the ultimate results of measures of the type we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>The fact has been stressed that a Prices Commission was set up some years ago.  That Commission cost a good deal of money, and I am not aware that all the witnesses who gave evidence before that Commission had to come to Dublin.  So far as my recollection serves, there was a certain itinerary laid down for that Commission. The Commission sat in the City of Cork.  Evidence was given before that Commission in the City of Cork.  The amount of apathy that was displayed in connection with it was rather disapointing to me and to many others who felt that there was a popular clamour for that Commission. There was a reluctance to give evidence before the Commission in Cork.  I understand that the Commission were in session for at least one hour before any witness came to give evidence.  I hope that the same apathy will not be manifested in connection with this Bill.</P>
    <P>A question has been raised as to the relation of the price of flour to the price of bread.  Here again we have <Col N="186" /> evidence of loose thinking; no regard at all to the facts.  Although I am supporting this measure, I think we will want to be clear as to its purpose. We ought to be clear, for instance, as to the relationship that flour bears to the loaf.  Deputy Corry should know that those engaged in the bakery trade have to buy in advance.  It is not because the price of flour falls by so many pounds or shillings per sack in the month of January, say, that the baker can immediately reduce the price of his loaf and give the advantage of the reduction in the price of flour to the consumer.  The same thing applies to nearly every other commodity with which the ordinary merchant has to deal.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, another phase to this question of the control of prices to which I am sure the Minister has given attention, or to which his attention has been directed, namely, the very large number of shops in the Free State.  We have, I believe, more shops per thousand of the population than any other country in Europe.  That results certainly in competition, which appears to be very dear to the mind of Deputy Good.  But does the consumer get any advantage from that kind of competition?  In some cities, at any rate, experience goes to show that after a good deal of competition, from which, of course, we must conclude that the consumer at least got some benefit, it has resulted after a time in the formation of rings.  Rings may be placed in two categories.  We may have a ring composed of a number of small distributors who agree not to sell certain commodities below a certain fixed price.  Then there is the other type of ring on a larger scale, with still greater ramifications, known as the combine.  One of the difficulties I see facing the Minister is in the matter of these large combines, highly capitalised organisations as they are; how the Minister will be able to deal with that class of combination.  I take it that the general purpose of the Bill is to keep prices at a reasonable level, the word reasonable to be translated in an equitable way; that is to say, having first computed the primary cost, that a fixed rate of profit should be <Col N="187" /> allowed to the distributors.  In that rate of profit, whether he be a large or a small shopkeeper, some allowance should be made to the shopkeeper who gives any kind of reasonable employment.</P>
    <P>The small shopkeeper, who has no paid employees, but only his own service or the services of his family, can hardly expect as great a profit as a larger shopkeeper, say, in O'Connell Street, Dublin, or Patrick Street, Cork.  I feel, therefore, that the Minister's path is beset with a number of difficulties, but he will have behind him, I have no doubt, in his endeavour to secure that the poorer classes particularly will not be overcharged&mdash;I think that is the word he used himself &mdash;the very best elements in this country.</P>
    <P>Personally I am very glad that the Minister has introduced the measure because on former occasions when discussing the Finance Bill and other measures in this House, the Labour Party have been particularly active and have frequently stressed the importance of having a measure of this kind introduced.  Personally, I have not departed from that line of thought and of action and I welcome the measure because of what I have suggested. I feel that the Minister, as I have said, will have a fairly difficult task, but I have confidence that he will be able to surmount the difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>With Deputy Murphy, who has already spoken for the Labour Party, I welcome this Bill.  I do not believe, of course, that it will do everything that ought to be done in connection with ensuring a fair price to the consumer, but I do, nevertheless, believe that it represents an honest and a greater step than has yet been taken to bring prices down to a reasonable level.  Deputy Blythe indulged in a rather extravagant attack on the whole Bill and, of course, disgraced his speech by saying that the primary purpose of the Bill was to provide jobs for the political down-and-outs. I would imagine that on the latter subject Deputy Blythe would <Col N="188" /> have kept silent in any case.  It was quite clear from listening to his speech that it was more than an attack upon the Bill.  It was one long apology on the part of Deputy Blythe for the late Government for having done nothing whatever to endeavour to curb the greed and rapacity on the part of certain shopkeepers who, at all times, are willing to exploit the miseries and batten on the sufferings of the poor. It is quite clear that had Deputy Blythe's Government continued in office they would have taken the view-point that Deputy J. J. Byrne expressed in his speech last night.  Leave traders' profits alone, keep cutting wages, is the philosophy that Deputy Byrne preached to the House last night.</P>
      <P>The one portion of Deputy Blythe's speech with which one can agree is his reference to the multiplicity of shops. There is little doubt that economically our system of production and distribution is lobsided.  We have, perhaps, too many people engaged in distribution and too few people in production.</P>
      <P>The multiplicity of shops inevitably produces a certain abnormal expenditure in the matter of distribution, which, in turn, shows no fair relation to the cost of production.  This Bill will not remove that deficiency.  That deficiency can only be removed by a licensing of shops; but a mere licensing of shops which permitted unrestricted profiteering would not help to reduce the disparity between the cost of production and the cost of distribution.  In any case, this Bill does in some measure go a distance towards bringing within reasonable compass the distribution costs which at present take such a heavy toll out of the price of retail commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill, there are many defects in it.  Deputy Goulding's conscience was very generous with his head.  His speech consisted of an attack upon the Bill, prefaced by a declaration that he proposed to vote for the measure.  How the Deputy can vote for it after pointing out and actually digging the pitfalls in the Bill is something that I do not pretend to <Col N="189" /> understand now.  There is a sort of mock innocence betrayed in Deputy Goulding's speech and also in Deputy Byrne's speech last night.  Their statements were simply a sweeping defence of the honesty of traders.  While I am not prepared to say, and the Labour Party has never said, that the trading community, the shopkeeping community as a whole, can be branded as dishonest&mdash;I do not believe they are&mdash; nevertheless, I believe there are within that community people who are not above exploiting the sufferings of the poor if it enables them to get rich quicker than they ought ordinarily to get rich.</P>
    <P>There are many defects in the approach made to the problem by this Bill.  The one that seems to me to be more prominent than any other is the supposition that there are uniform prices charged for commodities.  There seems to be an implication that it is the uniform price that is too high, whereas it very frequently happens that the complaint of the purchasing community is not against the uniform price of the commodity, but rather against isolated and individual instances of profiteering.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That circumstance does not seem to be provided for adequately in the Bill.  The complaints that most people hear are complaints by individuals that certain shopkeepers are exploiting this consumer or that consumer or perhaps exploiting a whole series of consumers where the circumstances are conducive to that exploitation.  The machinery laid down in this Bill for dealing with that type of complaint could, in my opinion, be considerably strengthened.  What is the procedure to be adopted?  The person is to make the complaint to the Controller of Prices, and an inspector is to investigate the complaint.  If he is satisfied it is well founded he is to communicate a certain notification to the person overcharging.  One of the things which is to be done in the notice is that the shopkeeper is to be told that he must give an undertaking within twenty-one days to charge a <Col N="190" /> reasonable price in future.  Why should a shopkeeper found guilty of profiteering be given twenty-one days within which to consider whether he will charge a reasonable price?  If it is a case of profiteering&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is ascertained by the Controller of Prices that it is a case of profiteering, why should a trader be permitted to continue exploiting the sufferings of the people for twenty-one days?  I suggest the Minister ought to divide the twenty-one days by seven, or even by twenty-one, and the Controller should serve a peremptory notice on these people to the effect that, having been found guilty of profiteering, they must immediately give an undertaking to charge a reasonable price.  There is no case whatever for permitting them to continue to charge an excessive price for twenty-one days.  The suggestion in the Bill amounts to giving them twenty-one days' notice and that seems to me to be particularly ineffective.</P>
      <P>Profiteering is an indefensible evil and the method of punishment of the individual shopkeeper who exploits the community is not sufficiently drastic in this Bill.  I would be quite willing to suggest that on a first offence a person should be peremptorily told that he must undertake to charge a reasonable price, and on a second offence he ought to be dealt with very severely, not merely by means of a fine or imprisonment, because both can often be ineffective, but by a definite obligation on the part of the defaulting shopkeeper to exhibit in a prominent place in his window an indication that he is on a black list for charging excessive prices.  I suppose we will be told that that will be novel, and there is no precedent for it.  But who wants to deal with shopkeepers, who charge absurdedly high prices, on the basis of precedent or the avoidance of novelty? People found guilty of profiteering should be dealt with, not in a timorous manner, but in the vigorous manner wisely suggested by Deputy Corry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;the late Deputy Bryan Cooper, Professor Busteed and Deputy Martin Roddy.  After a long examination of the whole problem the Commission furnished a very lengthy report. This is portion of the report:</P>
      <P>The outstanding impression left on our minds is the need for continuous investigation and supervision of prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Commission was not representative of the Fianna Fáil or the Labour Party.  The Commission was presided over by Senator Brown, and the outstanding impression left on their minds was the need for continuous investigation and supervision.  We have <Col N="192" /> that testimony from a group of people who were not, when that report was written, concerned with making a flowery and shallow show to the public for election purposes.  I claim that this Bill is justified by that particular portion of the report.  Then, almost as if they knew that Deputy Byrne was going to speak, they go on to say:</P>
    <P>Excessive profit-taking is, in some instances, the cause of unduly wide margins between the price received by the producer or importer and the price paid by the consumer, though it is not the sole cause.</P>
    <P>It appears that there were, and that there are cases of excessive profit taking.  It is admitted by that report that there were such cases.  What is the objection to the passing of an Act of Parliament to curb the rapacity of those people engaged in this excessive profit taking?  There is one suggestion I would like to make to the Minister and that is that there should be an obligation on shopkeepers, in relation to prices or any other commodity, to exhibit price lists in their shops so that the consumer going in&mdash; whether that consumer happens to be a cash or a credit consumer&mdash;may know in advance what price he is going to be charged for certain commodities.</P>
    <P>Might I suggest also as a necessary part of this Bill that shopkeepers should be required to give a receipt for any commodity sold over, say, the figure of 2/6.  That would furnish conclusive evidence that a transaction took place.  It would furnish conclusive evidence of the price paid for a particular commodity, and I think it might occasionally bring a blush of shame to the cheeks to some of our shopkeepers who want to charge fancy prices because they have no record left of that transaction except the record that is left on the mind of the person who has been fleeced by their avarice.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with fuel, clothing, and food.  While the Minister has power to extend the schedule I think he might well have added at the outset drink.  That is one of the commodities to which this Bill might apply.  And not merely intoxicating drink, but all <Col N="193" /> non-intoxicating drink.  There is quite a considerable agitation for years on that subject, and it seems to me to be one of the matters that at least ought to get investigation.  I would suggest to the Minister that he might consider that at a later stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>This profiteering presses most on the credit customer.  Yesterday a deputation of the unemployed in the city or a deputation representing the unemployed saw the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and called attention to the evils of the food ticket.  I do not want to debate the merits of that question now, but I do want to say this, that glaring cases were quoted of the fancy prices which these unfortunate people, compelled to exist on food tickets, were charged by the shopkeeprs in certain areas. These people have a vivid recollection of the extent to which they are exploited. They are people who cannot afford to be exploited.  There was abundant evidence yesterday from these people that if they had ready cash they could buy at better prices than the price at which they were buying under the food ticket.  Now, in those particular instances ready cash was assured to the traders, because it came along later in the form of a draft from the local authority.  You have instances such as that where advantage is taken of the consumer by the shopkeepers, and these people had no remedy.  But now they have a remedy under the present Bill.</P>
    <P>On the whole the Bill is to be commended. It will do something to make the dishonest trader line up with the honest trader.  I am glad to say that the majority of the people engaged in the retail trade are honest people.  I only regret that Deputy Byrne and others who spoke on the same lines did not draw a distinction between the honest and the dishonest trader. One is rather tempted to gather from Deputy Byrne's and Deputy Blythe's remarks that it does not matter what the character of the trader is.  They want to protect them all without giving adequate protection to the consumer. It seems to me that both Deputies regard the passage of this Bill as something which they do not <Col N="194" /> like, because during their ten years in office they made no such effort to protect the interests of the consumer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess at the outset that I approach this Bill with an open mind.  There was a reason undoubtedly on behalf of the people of country districts especially for a demand for some inquiry into the prices prevailing.  I do not think that any of the speeches to which I have listened have convinced me one way or another as to whether this Bill is going to mend matters or whether perhaps it might not make matters worse. I was interested in learning that there were some 44,000 shopkeepers or retailers in the Saorstát.  This would provide, I think, a shop for every sixty or seventy of the population. That would give a very extremely small section of people to every shop.  It seems hard to know how a shop is going to exist on a clientele of perhaps sixty or seventy people.  If we consider this aspect of the question, the number of shops and the number served by each, we must be convinced that this State is over-shopped.  Possibly the remedy may be found not in this Bill but in a Bill lessening the number of shops, but I do not think that this is a matter that should be brought about by legislation.</P>
      <P>We have had recently in the country attempts made by people themselves to cut down the prices charged by certain shops.  The people succeeded in successfully cutting down the prices charged.  I believe that it is mainly by combination amongst the people themselves that anything tending to reduce prices can be brought about.  Deputy Corry confined himself mainly to retailers of agricultural produce.  These would be in the main the sort of cases to which I would like to refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry to say that I cannot agree with my colleague, Deputy Byrne, that there are no instances of profiteering amongst shopkeepers in this country, nor can I agree with other Deputies that shopkeepers are notorious, generally, for profiteering.  I should rather accept the standard of honesty embodying retailers, generally, that was spoken of by Deputy Norton when <Col N="195" /> he said that there were only isolated instances of profiteering.  I think that is a rather true definition of the state of affairs.  There are only isolated instances of profiteering.  Then I should say that the case against the Bill is rather emphasised.  Because if you take an ordinary street, and if there are only isolated instances of profiteering, you will probably find that there is in that street only one profiteer.  What is the remedy for profiteering?  Leave the profiteers severely alone.  Deputy Norton said that the punishment in the Bill was not severe enough for the profiteer.  I agree.  My punishment for the profiteer would be the punishment we heard alluded to very often, recently, in this State, the punishment of boycotting.  We hear a lot of &ldquo;boycott this&rdquo; and &ldquo;boycott that,&rdquo; but we hear nothing about boycotting the man who deliberately attempts to wrong his fellow countrymen, and he is the man whom the word &ldquo;boycott&rdquo; should be directed to.  I say that is the cure for profiteering, if profiteering exists, and I believe Deputy Norton has put the case very fairly when he said that there were only isolated instances.  I believe the instances of profiteering amongst retailers are very few.  There are what would appear to be instances of profiteering amongst retailers who are forced to trade on a credit system.  Deputy Norton alluded shortly to that in his reference to the ticket system of relief in Dublin, but it is to the ordinary credit system I would like to allude.  There are shopkeepers whose main customers are credit customers, paying perhaps every three months, six months or twelve months; many of them not paying at all; and it is because of the bad debts and the interest on capital that the retailer trading in that way is compelled to charge, possibly, a greater price for his goods than the cash trader charges, and Deputy Norton, referring to Labour in his speech, said that, perhaps, the workers were the people who were mainly victimised.  I rather deny that.  I believe the worker is in the main the cash buyer in this State, <Col N="196" /> and the cash buyer ought to be and should be the person who runs the least risk of profiteering, because the whole market is open to him, the whole extent of the traders, except the isolated instances of profiteering referred to by Deputy Norton.</P>
    <P>I believe that any attempt to control prices by legislation must fail.  We have had the instance of the Tribunal of Prices.  Now, I said a moment ago that there is on an average one shop for every 65 people in this State, and when we eliminate the man's own family the average clientele of a shop in this State would be perhaps 50 to 60 people, many of them relatives, and the rest friends of the shopkeeper, and it is because of the loyalty of friends and relatives of retailers in this State that certain smaller retailers have been able to exist.  It is because of the loyalty of friends and relatives of retailers that the Tribunal on Prices was not able to get evidence of profiteering when they inquired into this matter three or four years ago, and the same circumstances will prevail no matter what Bill the Minister brings in, and no matter what legislation we produce. The public will not come to give evidence.  Deputy Anthony said in Cork it took an hour to provide one witness.  The same conditions prevailed in Limerick.  We had an outcry about profiteering, and what happened when an inquiry was held?  Not, I should say, one per cent. of the community&mdash;I am exaggerating when I say one per cent.&mdash;came to give evidence on behalf of the consumer, but we had lots of evidence on behalf of the retailers.  Why was the lack of interest?  Why this failure at that time when prices were higher than they are now?  Why the lack of evidence on behalf of the consumer?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">

      <P>No case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with that.  It was mainly because the clientele of the various shops were friends and relatives, men and women who will never be induced to give evidence in that respect.  Every one of us who lives in the country knows that most of the shopkeepers, large and small, in this State, have originally come from the land, as I might say. <Col N="197" /> The farming class has produced the greatest number of retailers in this State.  Take any ordinary sized town, such as Limerick and Cork&mdash;Deputy Anthony would not like to hear me refer to Cork as an ordinary sized town &mdash;and take the ordinary shopkeeper there.  He is born, and bred perhaps, in the country, with a number of intimate friends and relatives doing business with him, and it would be very difficult to get some of those friends and relatives to cease trading with this man.  It was because of that fact that there was a reluctance to give any evidence on behalf of the consumer at the previous Committee that was set up to inquire into this.</P>
      <P>I very much fear that there will be lack of complaints under this Bill when it is brought into operation.  If there has been a demand for some attempt to control prices in the State there has been a greater demand by the people of the State for another thing, to reduce the number of officials and inspectors in this State.  We heard it said down the country often: &ldquo;There are too many inspectors.  There is an inspector for this and a controller for that.&rdquo;  There is, and there are too many inspectors, too much control over the individual everywhere, I really believe.  If State control of every single business is to be increased we will shortly have arrived at the position when not only will there be one shopkeeper for every 65 or 70 people in the State but there will be one official or one inspector for a lower number than 65 or 70 people in the State.  We will be overrun with officials of every description.  The people are, I might say, damned from officialdom in this State.  I think the Deputies on the opposite benches will agree to that. If you hear one complaint more than another down the country it is that there are too many officials, too much interference by Departments and Governments and everybody else with the ordinary trader, and even with the ordinary farmer.  The people do not want any more of it.  It will not succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said when I started to speak that I approached this with an open mind. I have not heard any speech on it that <Col N="198" /> would convince me one way or another. My own impression is that the Bill will not succeed for the reason I have stated, that there will be reluctance to make any complaints.  We have had no two members even behind the Government agreeing to this measure. Deputy Corry said he was confining himself to the truth.  Possibly he was; there is a tax on yarns.  Deputy Norton spoke definitely opposite to his colleague.  &ldquo;I do not agree with my colleague,&rdquo; Deputy Byrne said.  No two on this side of the House agreed on it.  With a measure on which no two agree its prospects are doubtful.  I am quite convinced that the prospects of success of this Bill are very doubtful. I hesitate to vote against it and I am reluctant to vote for it.  I find myself, in common language, between the devil and the deep sea.  I believe, on the whole, the arguments against the Bill have been greater than the arguments for it, and my present intention is to vote against the Bill unless at a later stage in the debate someone makes a greater case for it than has been already made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Ministers disappear I just want to say a word about this Bill.  This Bill is a fraud.  There is an old and respected practice in China of saving the face, and the Labour Party seems to have taken a lesson from that quarter.  We are at present engaged in saving the face of the Labour Party.  The Labour Party, who themselves have been explaining that in this country and every other country tariffs mean increased cost for the consumer, tariffs mean a rise in the cost of living to the poor, tariffs mean a transfer of taxation from the rich to the poor&mdash;that is the Party which for the last six months has helped Fianna Fáil to put a tariff on everything. Now I am one of those who would have been glad to give Fianna Fáil's economic policy a fair chance, subject to the reservation that they should not make the task of the farmer absolutely impossible by taxing the raw materials of his industry.  The Labour Party has consistently helped Fianna Fáil to put a tax on Indian meal, put a tariff on galvanised iron, on all farming implements, artificial manures.  In fact, <Col N="199" /> every single thing the farmer uses in the struggle he is making to make ends meet has been tariffed, and tariffed with the assistance of the Labour Party, and it is to save the face of the Labour Party that this Bill is being introduced. It is to enable Deputies Murphy and Norton and the other Labour Deputies to go down the country and say: &ldquo;You were told the tariffs would raise the cost of living&mdash; look at this beautiful Bill we have&mdash; that is how we are going to prevent the cost of living going up.  If anyone tries to raise it we will use the Bill.&rdquo;  But they forget that the Minister for Industry and Commerce always introduces a little reservation when he is asked if this tariff will not increase the cost of a particular commodity; he always says it will not increase the cost of a commodity provided that some unforeseen circumstance does not arise, such as an increase in the cost of raw material.  That is the bland argument that the Minister for Industry and Commerce usually puts forward whenever he is challenged with the fact that a commodity which he has tariffed has gone up in price to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say the Minister has not the reputation of having a very soft heart, but it is a source of satisfaction to me to realise that his anxiety for the feelings of the Labour Party has been such that&mdash;on a foundation laid by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party when they were engaged in a little eye-washing, when they were setting up Commissions (for the purpose of eye-washing) on profiteering&mdash;on the foundation made by them he has raised this noble edifice to protect the consumers who are going to be mulcted by the tariff policy of the Fianna Fáil Government; that tariff policy which I say has been put into operation with the assistance of the Labour Party in this country.  I am not going into this Bill in detail, but I think it is interesting to note that the versatile Deputy Corry entered the lists with his lance couched for anyone who would suggest that this Bill was not necessary, but when he was asked why it was that he went out of the milk distributing business, when <Col N="200" /> he started a little profiteering business of his own in Cork, he did not answer. The Minister tosses his head.  I am not surprised he tosses his head at Deputy Corry's arguments, but it would be well for him to remember that Deputy Corry is the only member of his own bench who had the effrontery of supporting him.  The only other Fianna Fáil member who got up told him what I have told him, that this is eye-wash.  It is a fraud.  I may have to refer to other items of eye-wash&mdash;at a later date in this House&mdash;eye-wash for the benefit of the Labour Party.  I want to draw the attention of members like Deputy Bennett who still has doubts as to the virtues of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I always believe all Deputies in what they say.  I am sometimes too credulous.  There is a provision in this Bill that any individual can make a complaint under the terms provided in the Bill to the Commission, under Part 4, Section 27, alleging that there was sold or offered for sale to him at unreasonably high price a scheduled commodity. Whereupon the trader who has had the privilege of this public spirited individual's trade is put upon his proof to convince the Commission of a series of facts before he can be acquitted of the charge made.  He must prove that he used due diligence to prevent the commission of the acts alleged to constitute the offence.  He must prove that the act alleged to constitute the said offence was not committed by him personally or that the act was done without his consent, connivance or wilful support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any irresponsible nuisance can file a complaint with this Commission; and take a case of this kind, suppose milk is a scheduled article and a price per gallon is fixed, any irresponsible lunatic can go in and purchase a half pint of milk which will be charged at a certain price; if that price be multiplied out into gallons it may prove that the price charged for a half-pint of milk at a gallon rate is above whatever the scheduled price is provided <Col N="201" /> for by the Commission.  I do not for a single moment suggest that the trader would be convicted at all.  The Commission would hear his case and probably acquit him of any such charge, but observe that the trader must go to all the expense of appearing before the Commission and establishing his case&mdash; he is in that danger. Oh, the Minister says, no, but, unfortunately, under the provisions of this Bill that danger is ever present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy gave the Bill very close study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may take it I have given the Bill all the study it deserves.  I well know what the purpose of this Bill is.  I have described it already, it is a fraud and it will never operate effectively.  It is simply a sop to the Labour Party, but if it were to operate, and I am now trying to convince Deputy Bennett who is of two minds, I want to show him as fraudulent and as absurd as it may be there are dangers in it, and if it is to be put into operation it could be used as an instrument of prosecution for perfectly honest towns-people; furthermore, this Bill is being passed for the purpose of suggesting that the commercial community of this country consists to a considerable degree of people who are battling with the poor and needy&mdash;that implication is false, and any person who has any practical experience of commercial transactions either in a wholesale or in a retail, knows perfectly well that though any incompetent fool may attempt to profiteer for a short time, the ordinary effective competition of efficient and sensible business men next door to him will soon put an end to it and a much more effective and far less expensive end than this Bill will ever do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another thing and it is a danger which the Deputy himself thought of.  We have a Housing Commission set up recently at the expense of £2,000 a year, £1,000 for the Chairman and £500 a year for each member. We are going to have another Commission set up here and we are going to have all the officials and all the inspectors trotting around inquiring into <Col N="202" /> our business and poking their noses into things which do not concern them, and we will pay for the privilege of having them.  As Deputy Bennett said a while ago, if there is one thing you hear at every meeting which you attend in the country it is &ldquo;What do we want with all the officials?&rdquo; It was the one thing which Fianna Fáil always concerned themselves with, and we heard them say that they would not be long in office when they would put an end to all those inspectors and economise in public money.</P>
    <P>Here is another fertile egg, and when this one is hatched it is not two chickens that will come out of it, but 200, and every hanger-on of the Fianna Fáil Party will be rallying around the door of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to see if he cannot lend a hand to throttle the profiteers who are battening on the poor, and the unfortunate poor, and the taxpayers of this country will have another load put on their backs in order that a certain gang of discontented gentlemen may get jobs and that their silence may be purchased.  That is the danger. These are the considerations that ought to weigh with Deputy Bennett when he is in doubt as to whether the Bill should pass or not.  Let him forget that his own Party did a bit of eye-washing in their day and that they had their price of admission and that they discovered a mare's nest.  Ministers frequently do, and, when it becomes necessary to forget particular things, Ministers seem to do strange things.  Deputies sometimes do strange things when they come into this House. What they say in Galway or Donegal very often bears little resemblance to what they say or do here in Dáil Eireann.  Let Deputy Bennett forget his past, or the past of his Party, in respect of price fixing, in any case, and let him honestly come out and say that the ordinary operation of trade is, to his knowledge, to my knowledge, and to the knowledge of every reasonable man, the most effective way of controlling prices, and that the ordinary operation of a healthy public opinion will prevent any people or any body of persons from profiteering at the expense of the poor.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="203" /> If you believe that there is profiteering in milk, at the expense of the poor, let the facts be ventilated.  Let the public know the facts and the force of public opinion will do more to bring an end to it than any such Bill as this.  Public opinion in this country is quite prepared to undertake work of that kind, and if it was more engaged, in putting an end to abuses of that kind than in others, to which perhaps, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will not permit me to refer now, the Government would be very much better employed than in promoting Bills of this kind.  There are circumstances, I believe, in which public opinion should be informed and in which public opinion should be marshalled, where men such as Rank and Co. attempt to corner the flour trade in this country, or in cases where a milk ring deliberately attempts to hold up the poor, and deprive them of what they are entitled to.  The proper weapon with which to put an end to that is to marshal public opinion, to publish the facts and to call on public opinion to operate.  It will operate, and operate effectively, and it will operate without all the dangers and without all the expenses of a measure of this kind.  I have no hesitation in saying that the truth of the position is that the Minister knows these things as well as I do, but he has to produce a little eye-wash; he has to save the faces of the Labour Party, and he produces this fraud to us.</P>

      <P>We have had a few foolish and one or two sensible speeches concerning this Bill.  Sitting here listening to them, I have been trying to find out what exactly is the attitude of Deputies opposite in relation to it.  I think the suggestion which was made that their main trouble in relation to it is that they themselves did not introduce it, is fairly correct. Deputy J.J. Byrne quoted at great length from the Report of the Food Prices Tribunal.  That Report was published in&mdash;could the Deputy give me the date?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, 1926.  It was the Report of a Tribunal established by the Government which he supported, and issued in 1926, and it emphasised the need for continuous investigation of prices.  It referred to the fact that some evidence of excessive profit-taking was brought to its notice.  It made a number of recommendations by which the ordinary purchasing public might be protected against profiteering tendencies on the part of distributors, and it was published in 1926, and no action was taken on the Report.  Deputy J.J. Byrne, who is studying the Report now, reading it in great detail, and analysing the significance of every word in it, might have done that five or six years ago when he was in a position to influence the Government in power at that time to get action taken on the Report.  This Government has been only six months in power and it has produced this Bill, because it is convinced that this Bill is necessary.  We have been told that there is no profiteering.  Deputy J.J. Byrne, who, earlier to-day, was waving the Communistic or Bolshevist emblem and demanding State maintenance for all the unemployed in Clontarf, later came into the House and took on his broad shoulders responsibility for every shopkeeper in Ireland.  &ldquo;There is not a dishonest man amongst them&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

We do not know if there is any general tendency on the part of shopkeepers to profiteer or to avail of the exceptional circumstances created by the imposition of tariffs or the temporary scar-city of a particular commodity to get excessive prices, but we want to find out.  I think that it is the function and duty of the Government to find out, and it is because the Government heretofore had no means by which complaints of that kind could be investigated that this Bill has been introduced. This Bill gives a means of investigation of these complaints, and I say that any consumer, any purchaser in the country who is of opinion that he is being charged an unreasonably high price for some article of common necessity, has a right to look to the Government to have his allegation investigated, and, if his allegation <Col N="206" /> is found to be correct, has a right to insist that he should be refunded the amount of overcharge and that some punishment should be meted out to the offender.

      <P>When introducing the Bill I mentioned that I was convinced no useful purpose would be served by a periodic price examination such as the late Government indulged in. The setting up of a commission to carry out a spasmodic investigation of prices of a particular commodity in an area at long intervals is of no value whatever.  It is a waste of money, and Deputy Byrne knows that quite well. The report of the Tribunal from which the Deputy quoted cost a considerable amount of money, and that report was quite valueless in the sense of action being taken.</P>

      <P>Yes, if we were to assume that up to 6 o'clock this evening every shopkeeper in the country never attempted to charge an excessive price. <Col N="207" /> We have to face the fact that the possibility might arise and if it should there should be machinery to investigate the complaint.  That is the case, particularly in a country in which a protective policy is in operation.  We have been told that the purpose of the Bill is to disguise the fact that the cost of living has gone up in consequence of tariffs.  Day after day Deputies ignore public documents and continue to talk nonsense in order to discredit the Government.  Deputies should read the Trade Journals that were sent to them by post last week.  If they will look at the cost of living index figure they will see that between May and September the cost of living in the Free State fell more proportionately than in any other six months in the past ten years.  That is the fact.  I stated yesterday that ugly facts kill beautiful theories.</P>

      <P>Deputy Blythe advanced the extraordinary theory which, on analysis, proves to be the same theory as that of Deputy Byrne. Deputy Byrne says there is no profiteering, but Deputy Blythe says that if there is profiteering the means proposed in this Bill are not the means to deal with it; that we should allow ordinary commercial action to settle it. I think Deputy Dillon advanced the same theory.  If there is any substance in that theory, there should be less profiteering in this country than in any country in the world, because, as Deputy Bennett and Deputy Norton pointed out, there are more shops here per head of the population than in any other country in Europe.  If competition, for instance, and a large number of distributors has the effect of preventing unduly high prices, this should be the cheapest country to live in and there should be less profiteering than anywhere else.  Is not that the fact?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Byrne must see the fallacy of Deputy Blythe's argument. I am using the argument Deputy Blythe used, that if profiteering took place it would be corrected by additional people opening shops.  If that is the case we should have no profiteering in comparison with other countries, because we have a larger number of people operating shops in proportion to the size of the country than any other country in Europe. Consequently there should be more competition and less danger of profiteering if what Deputy Blythe said was a fact.  Deputy Blythe and other Deputies spoke about the hardships that might be imposed on shopkeepers by this Bill.  Again let me say that a shopkeeper who does not profiteer need not be worried about the Bill.</P>

      <P>We watered it down deliberately, if I might say so, in order to prevent any danger of hardship being inflicted in mistake on an honest trader who is merely earning a reasonable profit.  What is the procedure? Deputy Dillon, of course, refers to the possibility of a trader selling in excess of the price fixed by the Prices Order, and of having to deal with some nuisance who sent in a complaint and appeared in person before the Commission. Quite obviously the Deputy did not read the Bill, because when a price fixing order is made in relation to any <Col N="210" /> scheduled commodity, it is not then the village nuisance will be dealing with the shopkeeper who charges in excess of the prices, but a member of the local Civic Guard.  The shopkeeper will not have to appear before the Commission in Dublin, but before a local magistrate.  It is only in relation to a commodity in respect to which a price fixing order has not been made that the question of complaint and investigation by the controller arises.  In the case of any such commodity where a purchaser alleges he was charged an unreasonably high price he can complain to the controller, who may refuse to investigate the complaint on the ground that it was frivolous.  It is reasonable to assume that a large number of complaints which will reach the controller will be frivolous, or will be of such a nature that they cannot be properly investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the controller is satisfied that the complaint is one which should be investigated he will have it investigated, and if the result is such that the shopkeeper was in fact charging an unreasonably high price he notifies the shopkeeper to that effect.  According to the Bill the shopkeeper has 21 days in which to reform, within which he will undertake in writing not to charge an unreasonably high price again, and to refund to the person overcharged the amount of the overcharge.  If the shopkeeper does that the matter ends. If he does not, but persists in maintaining the same unreasonably high charges for the same commodity, a certificate is issued, and here is where, as Deputy Dillon suggested, we are endeavouring to bring the force of public opinion into the matter.  A copy of the certificate is served on the shopkeeper and the public are notified by a notice published in newspapers circulating in the district, that, in the opinion of the organisation established by the Government, the prices charged by the particular shopkeeper for specific articles are unreasonably high.  If, following the publication of <Col N="211" /> that certificate, the shopkeeper persists in charging that unreasonably high price he becomes liable to prosecution and punishment, and only then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain why a shopkeeper who has been found guilty of profiteering should not be punished but given an opportunity to give an undertaking within the twenty-one days that he will not overcharge again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We can argue that on the Committee Stage.  I have explained that we deliberately modified that section so as to prevent any possibility of injustice arising, or of hardship being inflicted undeservedly upon a shopkeeper who was not in fact guilty of profiteering.</P>
      <P>These are, I think, the main points that have been advanced.  I am quite certain that there is no Deputy in this House who is not satisfied that we should have a continuous investigation into the manufacturer's price in the case of protected commodities.  There is nobody in this House who has arisen to say that, in his opinion, such an investigation should not be made. In fact, from the discussion previously made on this subject, I think it will be admitted that every Deputy in this House would like to see such an investigation take place if only to establish the fact that such a procedure was not necessary.  I think they will admit that if we are going to have any valuable examination into this question of prices and overcharging, we must have a continuous investigation. A body equipped with the powers of the High Court could demand evidence and carry out its investigations continuously for a long period, and I think that it will be admitted that if the legislation establishing that authority is to be of any real value, there must be power for the Minister for Industry and Commerce or for some authority other than the investigating authority to fix prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not anticipate that many cases will arise&mdash;if in fact any will arise&mdash;in which it will be found necessary to resort to this power.  I believe that <Col N="212" /> long before that stage has arisen they will have succeeded, by mobilising public opinion or by private representations to the guilty parties, in having any such tendency to excessive profit-taking corrected.  We have been told that during the European War the attempt at price-fixing was not a success.  That question has to be considered in relation to the circumstances of the time and what was attempted by the price fixing in the War.  I deny, however, that our experience or the experience of other countries at that time is any sure guide to action in the present day. During the course of that European War we had rapidly rising prices, and the attempt at fixing prices was made during that period.  To-day, instead of rising prices, we have falling prices. I say that the experience of price control obtained during such a period cannot be applied to such a situation as we have here at the moment.  It may be that this attempt to fix prices will not be as effective as we hope, but nevertheless, I think it will do good, and at any rate, it certainly should not be condemned until it has been tried.</P>

      <P>Yes, and if a price-fixing order were made in relation to a particular article, and if it could be sold at a lower price we would see it advertised in the Press that it could be obtained below the fixed price.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so, and I have already explained the reason why I do not think so.  During the war years that was the case undoubtedly. <Col N="213" /> During that period, when a maximum price was fixed, that also became the minimum price; but they were years during which prices were rising and, in addition, they were also years of shortage.  These are two essential points of difference.  Now, instead of prices rising, they are tending downwards, and it certainly is not shortage that the world is suffering from. Instead of a shortage, the world is suffering from over-production, if anything. I do not anticipate that any of the bad results attendant on the price-fixing attempts of the War years will come from price fixing attempts at present; that is, if it should be necessary to resort to price-fixing at all.  But I do not anticipate that we ever will have to use these powers, because the knowledge that the powers are there will so enforce the powers of the Commission to obtain these things that the results will be obtained by representation or publicity if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A suggestion was made that we should require shopkeepers to publish price lists of the goods they are offering for sale.  I gave that suggestion very considerable consideration and, as Deputies know who read the report of a former Prices Commission, that body also deal with the matter.  At first sight there are obvious difficulties. First of all, there is the fact that there are various qualities in articles of the same description and it would be practically impossible to distinguish between all the various qualities and put them publicly in the window or outside the door of the shop.  Secondly, shopkeepers engage in the sale of articles of common necessity such as those scheduled in the Bill as well as in a great variety of articles which they practically could not enumerate. There is another difficulty, perhaps peculiar to this country.  There is the desire which the average Irish farmer or the average Irish rural dweller has to make a bargain.  He goes into a shop and he asks what is the price of the particular article he wishes to buy, and if it is 1/6 or 2/6 he tries to beat down the price and the shopkeeper, in anticipation of this, generally puts on 2d. or 3d. in advance in order to be able to come <Col N="214" /> down a little, and his customer goes away quite satisfied.  If we were to compel that shopkeeper to publish that list of prices, it is inevitable that he would include 2d. or 3d., or a certain percentage, to take off for the benefit of his customer, and in some cases he might get away with more than he should.  Consequently there is a likelihood that by compelling them to publish price lists in that way, we would encourage rather than discourage excessive price-taking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider getting traders generally through the country to mark their goods in plain figures?  I think he knows that there is a practice where there are secret marks on the goods offered for sale and the purchaser is absolutely at the mercy of the retailer in that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been considering that, and I am endeavouring to bring in an amendment in the Committee Stage which will enable an order to be made requiring that to be done and the goods to be marked in plain figures upon the recommendation of the Committee after investigation. There are some difficulties in framing an amendment of precisely the form I want, but I hope they will be overcome.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton asked why was not drink included amongst the articles to be investigated.  In so far as drink is a food it is included.  We include in the schedule articles which are necessaries&mdash;food, clothing, fuel, etc.&mdash; and the Executive Council is given power under Section 3 to add to the list by Order if the occasion should arise.  I do not think there are any other points.</P>

      <P>It was suggested by Deputy Blythe, and I was surprised to hear the suggestion also coming from Deputy Dillon, that one of the purposes of this Bill was to make some more jobs.  There are some people with such warped and spavined minds that they cannot think of anything being done honestly, or that it could be evident that some people, occasionally, do public acts for honest motives.  I may assure those Deputies who are filled with this suspicion of which they have no proof, that it will not be necessary to appoint any additional officials on the passage of this Bill.  Some suggestion was made that this Bill was the first step in some nefarious scheme to turn this State into a collective State and to deprive people in established industries of their livelihood.  That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit to the Dáil that it is good for the State to have power to make investigation, and nobody should object to that investigation, and least of all those against whom admittedly vague and general charges of profiteering are directed at the present time. I am quite certain the majority of shopkeepers and manufacturers and wholesalers will welcome the introduction of this Bill and will be only too <Col N="216" /> glad to have the circumstances of their business investigated.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister how he intends to administer this Act in some respects. For instance, what is to be the standard of the article?  A man may not be charged for profiteering if he sells an inferior article which is an imitation of the dearer article.  The price of boots, at the moment, is not much more than when the heavy tariff was imposed, but that is because they are selling an inferior article.  In the same way in regard to beef and mutton, if a man sells a seven-year-old cow as the best beef he can sell it at a lower price, and he will not be charged with profiteering.  If any steps were to be taken against him investigation would be required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to prices being fixed by Ministerial order; that will be only in the last resort.  Long before that stage the Commission will be endeavouring by private representation to the parties, or public action of one kind or another, to induce the parties to avoid further profiteering.  If they found that there was no way except to fix prices, then it is for the Commission to recommend the particular manner in which the Order should be made and the difficulty to which he referred would be met.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle of this Bill is pretty clear.  It is to provide wounds pensions, disability pensions and dependent pensions, as an extension of the Army Pensions Bills of 1923 and 1927. The Army Pensions Bills of 1923 and 1927 provided wounds pensions and disability pensions for men who were wounded during the Black-and-Tan war and for members of the National Army who were wounded during the civil war, and their dependents.  This Bill will provide for those who fought on the Republican side in the civil war the same classes of pension as were provided for those who fought during the Black-and-Tan war and during the civil war in the National <Col N="219" /> Army.  The Bill bears its meaning on the face of it and it does not require very much explanation.  In order to secure that no one except a person properly entitled shall get a pension, every applicant will have to go before a Military Service Registration Board and will have to prove, in the first instance, that he has really had service which entitles him to a pension.  Then having been certified as having the necessary service, he will have to go before the Army Pensions Board and will have to stand an examination there as to the extent of the disability from which he suffers.,</P>
      <P>If a person gets a certificate from the Army Pensions Board that he suffers disablement to the extent of 20 per cent. in the case of wounds, and to the extent of 80 per cent. in the case of disability, due to disease, he will be entitled to a pension on the scale set out in the schedules attached to the Bill.  We have altered the scales from those that were set out in the 1923 and 1927 Pensions Acts.  Instead of making a difference between officers and men, and of, say, giving £200 maximum to an officer and, say, £100 maximum to another rank, we are treating all on the same standard, that is, three-quarters of the maximum. We are treating all as volunteers.  If a person was married before he received wounds, or before a certain date in the case of disability, he will become entitled to a marriage pension. If he dies while in receipt of a marriage pension his widow will be entitled to a certain allowance.  There are a number of cases where men were wounded in the past.  Their wounds were slight, but they had to undergo hospital treatment.  Some of them suffered a great deal for a while, but they are not now suffering disablement to the extent of 20 per cent.  In those cases we provide under Section 10 for a gratuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 12 contemplates allowances to dependents and widows.  In cases where there are not widows but other dependents, of men who have died from wounds or disease before certain dates, they will come under this. Under sub-section (4) of Section 12 <Col N="220" /> there is provision for men who married after a certain date after they were wounded or after a certain date in the case of disease.  Where a man dies the widow will be entitled to a gratuity of £112 10s., that is three-quarters of the old rate in those cases.</P>
    <P>The payment of pensions will not commence from the date of the receipt of the wound, but as from the first of April of this year.  It would be too heavy a burden to go back and pay men pensions from say 1916, 1921 or 1922.  The pensions, when granted, will date as from 1st April this year. The section that sets that out is in keeping with the whole spirit of the Bill which is to relieve future distress amongst men who suffered or amongst their dependents.  Everyone knows that throughout the country a lot of bitterness has been created because certain men were badly wounded or neglected, and also because their dependents are not being properly looked after.</P>
    <P>The paragraphs which follow Section 15 provide for a time limit for making applications, that is 12 months from the passage of this Bill.  We consider that 12 months is a fair time to allow dependents to make application, or if a man has been injured in the past then he has plenty of time within 12 months to make his application.  Sections 18 and 19 deal with the finality of awards, and give the Minister power, in certain cases within a few years after a final award has been made, to re-open the award when he thinks that the disablement of an applicant has increased to a fairly large extent.  It is stated in Section 20 that certain sections of the 1923 and 1927 Acts are applicable to this Bill.  The sections of the 1923 and 1927 Acts refer to hospital treatment.  They give the Minister power to provide hospital treatment for men who have applied for pensions as well as artificial limbs. They prevent men assigning their pensions away, and deal with forfeiture in certain cases.  They also provide for travelling expenses, and in a case say where a man in receipt of a marriage pension is not looking after his wife, then the Minister can direct that the pension be paid directly to his <Col N="221" /> wife.  All regulations made in connection with this Bill will have to be laid before the House.</P>
    <P>Part 3 of the Bill deals with the amendment of previous Acts.  The previous Acts were loose in some respects, and the Public Accounts Committee reported from time to time that they should be amended.  We are amending them in this Bill.  To give an instance.  In one section of the 1927 Act, if a man had a pension and he owed a debt to the Minister for Defence, a sum equivalent to the debt could be withheld from his pension.  We are extending that so that if he owes a debt to any other Minister or any other Department of State his pension can be withheld.  A number of Deputies will know from their own experience that great hardship has occurred in a number of cases where awards were marked final under the 1923 and 1927 Acts.  You had members of the National Army and members of the Volunteers in the Black and Tan period going before the Pension Board and the Board making up its mind that disablement had not reached the maximum.  They marked the pension final award.  In such cases there is no power residing in the Minister or in anybody else to re-open the award even though subsequent disablement increased very much.  Some men got pensions on the basis of 50 per cent. disablement, and although later on their disablement increased to 100 per cent. nothing could be done for them. We are taking power in this Bill to re-open such final awards in all cases where the applicant proves to the Minister that his disability increased to a certain considerable extent, that is, in excess of 10 per cent. or there-abouts.</P>
    <P>There are a few other sections in the Bill which follow the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee. Section 26 will compel all applicants under the 1923 and 1927 Acts to apply now for whatever pension they think they are entitled to, and if they fail to do that their cases cannot be considered after 12 months.  I explained at the outset that the rates of pension are three-quarters of the maximum <Col N="222" /> payable to officers under the 1923 and 1927 Acts.  That applies to the rate given to a man himself and to his wife in the case of marriage, as well as to allowances granted to dependents.  It is not estimated that more than £25,000 will be needed to meet the requirements of this Bill in this year. In the first year a number of gratuities will be paid that will not recur in the future.  Personally, I do not think that even next year there will be more than £30,000 spent, and I believe it will be very much less.  At present about £47,000 is spent on wounds and disablement pensions.  I think the sum payable under this Bill will be very much less.  The sum is not a very great one to ask the Dáil for, but the need of the people who will come under this Bill for pensions is very great.  I believe it will be good national work to set about alleviating the distress of people who are entitled to pensions and gratuities under this Bill.  It will, in a large measure, help to abolish the memory of past dissensions, and it will create a lot of happiness in a great number of homes throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The Minister made reference to previous Pensions Bills and indicated the period to which they referred.  The previous Pensions Bills referred, in addition, to 1916&mdash;the Rising period.  The Minister has said very little with regard to the persons for whom this Bill is intended.  I think something requires to be said on that. The Government Press of the 19th October dealt with the matter.  In a sub-leader headed &ldquo;A People's Tribute,&rdquo; they said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Pensions Bill, the text of which was made available for the public yesterday, will come as a boon to many patriotic homes throughout Ireland&mdash;homes that have given both breadwinners and sons and daughters to the struggle for independence. But the importance of the Bill is not this so much as the principle which it establishes.  It records the decision of the Irish people that those who have striven in arms for liberty not only from 1916 to 1921, but in the subsequent defence <Col N="223" /> of the Republic are truly our great citizens.  It records, too, that it was not a part or a province of Ireland which was battling for national Government in that whole period, but the Irish nation.  In other countries those who have fallen for freedom were held up to their own generation and are held up to the generations which followed as ideal types of men and women.  In America families whose forebears were associated with the ridding of that great Continent of British domination are to-day, for that reason, held in particular respect.  That is true of other nations such as Belgium and the countries of South America.  In this country, our soldiers of freedom have often gone without recognition not only in their own day, but by succeeding generations.  A few who are in the public eye are known, the many are nameless and forgotten. The Pensions Bill, published yesterday, seeks to end an ingratitude of which the nation has been up to now guilty.  Many refused to avail themselves of similar acts of the late Government on the grounds that it was not being faithful to the ideal for which the lives had been given and the wounds proudly borne.  All those can feel to-day that it is a people's tribute and not a tribute of any party or section that they are being asked to accept for the noble service with which their names will always be associated.</P>
    <P>That is an addendum from the Government Press to the Minister's speech in introducing this Bill.  The Bill proposes to give pensions greater by approximately one-half to those who, the Minister says, fought on the Republican side during the civil war, than were given by this House to the rank and file of those who, in the Army, fought for the preservation of the national institutions.  In my opinion, the Bill requires to be somewhat documented in order to correlate its terms, the persons to whom it is to be applied and this House, as the Parliament of the nation.</P>
    <P>The Treaty between this country and Great Britain was approved on the <Col N="224" /> 7th January, 1922.  The Provisional Government was formally established on the 14th January.  The British authorities formally handed over the reins of Government to the Irish Provisional Government on the 16th January. On the 16th June there was a General Election for the purpose of setting up the Provisional Parliament. At that election, 128 members were elected to fill that Parliament and, of these, 36 were persons who repudiated the institution that was being set up and actually absented themselves from the work; 36 out of 128 represents a percentage of 28.  In the meantime formal military operations were undertaken by the assault on the Four Courts on 27th June, and by the subsequent fighting in O'Connell Street, ending on the 3rd July, in which 52 persons were killed and 190 wounded. The head of the Provisional Government, General Collins, was killed on 22nd August, and Parliament opened on the 9th September.  Three months after formal military operations had been undertaken&mdash;namely, 27th September&mdash;the Parliament was asked to give the military authorities power to set up military courts in respect of certain offences relating to arms and power to execute the sentence of death.  In the meantime&mdash;on the 16th September, 1922&mdash;a body met calling itself the Irish Republican Army Executive, which then consisted of 16 members, including Messrs. Tom Derrig, Seamus Robinson, Seán Moylan, Michael Kilroy, P.J. Ruttledge and Frank Aiken.  At that meeting on the 16th September, 1922, an Army Council was set up, consisting of 5 members and including Mr. Tom Derrig and Mr. Frank Aiken.  On the 26th October the following official communique, as it was called, was issued.  It is headed Dáil Eireann, Official Communique (English translation):</P>
    <P>Dáil Eireann, the Parliament and Government of the Republic, met yesterday in secret session, the former Deputy Speaker presiding. A Clerk of the House was appointed and the following resolution passed:&mdash;(1)  Whereas the Speaker (Ceann Comhairle) and the other appointed Executive Officers, in disregard <Col N="225" /> of their duties and in open disobedience to the mandamus of the Supreme Court have refused to summon Dáil Eireann, the duly elected Parliament and Government of the Republic.  And whereas, notwithstanding their oaths and public pledges to maintain the Republic, these officers abetted by other members of Dáil Eireann have in this and diverse other ways endeavoured illegally and unconstitutionally to subvert the Republic and its Government, Dáil Eireann, and with foreign aid have joined in traitorous conspiracy and armed revolt with that intent, pretending to establish a so-called Free State and a Provisional (Partition) Parliament, the creatures and sub-ordinates of an alien legislature and purposing thus to destroy the independent sovereignty of the nation and the integrity of its ancient territory.  Therefore, we the faithful Deputies of Dáil Eireann assemble to maintain the Republic and to secure the continuity of independent Government for the whole of Ireland in the name of all loyal citizens of the Republic and by the express wish of the soldiers fighting in its defence call upon the former President, Eamon de Valera, to resume the Presidency and to nominate a Council of State and Executive Ministers to assist him in carrying on the Government until such time as the Parliament of the Republic is allowed freely to assemble or the people are allowed by a free election to decide how they shall be governed.</P>
    <P>(2)  That Eamon de Valera be hereby appointed President of the Republic and Chief Executive of the State.</P>
    <P>(3)  That the following nominated by the President be hereby appointed a Council of the State:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The President, Austin Stack, T.D.; Robert Barton, T.D.; Count Plunkett, T.D.; J.J. O'Kelly, T.D.; L. Ginnell, T.D.; Seán T. O'Kelly, T.D.; Seán O'Mahony, T.D.; Mrs. O'Callaghan, T.D.; Mary MacSwiney, T.D.; P.J. Ruttledge, T.D.; Seán Moylan, T.D.; M. P. Colivet, T.D.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="226" /> (4)  That pending the next meeting of the Dáil we hereby empower the Council of State to sanction such Ministers and Executive Officers of State as the President may nominate and may have the Council's approval.</P>
    <P>Dublin, 26th October, 1922.</P>
    <P>The Press at the time contained the information that on 31st October, long before any executions were carried out, the Irregular Acting Assistant Chief of Staff writing to the Command Adjutant proposed for Mr. de Valera's decision &ldquo;The issuing of a proclamation declaring the Provisional Government illegal and that after a certain date anyone attending their Parliament was liable to suffer a traitor's fate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Dated the 3rd November, 1922, the following proclamation was issued:</P>
    <P Just="Center">GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PROCLAMATION.</P>
    <P Just="Center">(Translation in English).</P>
    <P>Whereas an unconstitutional and usurping Junta, set up at the dictation of the British Government and calling itself the &ldquo;Provisional Government of Ireland,&rdquo; is and has been pledging the credit of the nation without the sanction of Dáil Eireann, the Parliament and Government of the Republic, and contracting debts and liabilities in various ways, including the purchase of military supplies and war material, and is further seeking to create vested interests by filling vacant offices and making appointments to new offices;</P>
    <P>And whereas the so-called Provisional Government has been proclaimed an illegal body by the Government of the Republic;</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is hereby proclaimed and notified to all whom it may concern that all such debts contracted or to be contracted, and appointments made, or to be made, by the said Provisional Government without the sanction of Dáil Eireann, the Parliament and Government of the Republic, are, and shall be <Col N="227" /> illegal, null and void, and will not be recognised by the State.</P>

    <P>On 13th November, 1922, Eamon de Valera, as President, addressed the following letter to each member of the Army Council and to the O.C. Northern Command:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A Chara,</P>
    <P>I have nominated the following Cabinet: Finance, Austin Stack; Home Affairs, P.J. Ruttledge; Defence, Liam Mellows; Local Government, S.T. O'Kelly (Donal O'Callaghan to be substitute Minister); Economic Affairs, Robert Barton (Seán Moylan to be substitute Minister, with M.P. Colivet in reserve).</P>
    <P>In regard to Defence, the Chief of Staff agrees that for the present the best plan would be that his name and mine should appear on any official document relating to the Department of Defence.  The President can look after Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>Had Mr. Childers not been arrested it was my intention that he should be Secretary of the Cabinet and Director of Publicity.  I should like that he be regarded as nominally filling these positions.  Substitutes can be selected by the Cabinet.</P>

    <P Just="Center">PROCLAMATION.</P>

    <P>Whereas in consequence of representations made by the British <Col N="228" /> Government to the Government of the Republic of Ireland in the course of the war waged by the British Government against the Republic, a truce was, on the 11th day of July, 1921, arranged between the Irish Republican Army and the Army of His Britannic Majesty, and thereupon negotiations for a Treaty between Ireland and Great Britain were entered into, and delegates appointed by the Government of the Republic of Ireland went into conference with representatives of the British Government, and an instrument entitled &ldquo;Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland&rdquo; was signed in London on the 6th day of December, 1921;</P>
    <P>And whereas on the 7th day of January, 1922, Dáil Eireann, under the influence of duress and the threat of renewed war by Great Britain, passed a resolution purporting to approve of said instrument;</P>
    <P>And whereas the said instrument implied a surrender of the sovereignty of Ireland and could not be, and is not, binding on the Republic of Ireland; and could not be, and was not ratified or approved in the form of law by Dáil Eireann, the Government of the Republic;</P>
    <P>And whereas any such purported approval was <i>ultra vires,</i> and accordingly null and void and of no effect;</P>
    <P>And whereas in the month of June, 1922, certain persons in Ireland known as the Provisional Government of Southern Ireland, purporting to derive their authority under the said instrument, and at the instance of and coerced by the Government of Great Britain, rose in rebellion against the Republic;</P>
    <P>And whereas the Government of Great Britain furnished and has since continued to furnish these rebels and their adherents with arms, equipment, and expert military aid;</P>
    <P>And whereas it is expedient and necessary for the safety of the Republic and the independence of Ireland, that the said Articles of Agreement, which were never binding on the Republic, or on the people <Col N="229" /> of Ireland, should be formally repudiated;</P>
    <P>It is hereby decreed and declared that the resolution passed by Dáil Eireann on the 7th day of January, 1922, purporting to approve of the instrument entitled &ldquo;Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland,&rdquo; dated the 6th day of December, 1921, be, and the same is hereby rescinded and revoked, and that any Act, matter or thing purporting to be done thereunder is void and of no effect;</P>
    <P>And it is hereby further decreed that the persons known as, and styling themselves the Provisional Government of Southern Ireland, and their adherents, are, and shall be deemed always to have been, an illegal body, and that each and every such person is guilty of rebellion against the Republic;</P>

    <P>And whereas by decree dated the 19th day of September, 1920, a Land Settlement Commission was established;</P>
    <P>And whereas certain persons calling themselves a Provisional Government have entered into a conspiracy with other enemies of the Republic to divide this ancient nation and dismember its territory and to subvert the Republic which they were sworn to defend, and in furtherance of such <Col N="230" /> conspiracy have made an alliance with the British Government and with arms, munitions of war, and money supplied by their British Allies have fomented a rebellion against the Republic;</P>
    <P>And whereas in the course of said rebellion the so-called Provisional Government and their associates are endeavoring to re-establish in this country the old British Courts owing allegiance to the King of Great Britain;</P>
    <P>And whereas they now purport to set up in twenty-six counties of Ireland a system of District Courts acting under the authority of the King of Great Britain, and intended to supersede the Courts of the Republic;</P>
    <P>And whereas these British Courts, whether in their old form or their new disguise, are an illegal usurpation of authority, an infringement of the sovereign independence of the Irish people, and a danger to the Republic;</P>
    <P>It is decreed by the Government of the Republic that all British Courts purporting to exercise jurisdiction within the territory of the Republic, whether known by the name of the King's Courts or District Courts, be, and the same are hereby suppressed;</P>
    <P>And it is decreed that any person purporting to exercise jurisdiction in a Court hereby suppressed, or instituting, defending, or appearing in any action or proceeding in such a Court without licence from the Minister for Home Affairs of the Republic, or otherwise encouraging, aiding or abetting the exercise of jurisdiction by any of the Courts hereby suppressed shall be deemed to be an enemy of the Republic;</P>

    <P>All these persons are affected by the proclamations of 17th and 18th November, 1922.  The &ldquo;War News, Poblacht na hEireann,&rdquo; No. 101, was issued on 25th November, 1922, and in <Col N="233" /> it is printed a list of The Murder Members.  This is what it contains:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In view of the secret slaughter on Friday week last of four young Republican soldiers and yesterday of Staff-Captain Childers, I.R.A., after their so-called &ldquo;trials&rdquo; by the Secret Murder Courts set up by Richard Mulcahy with the approval of the Kildare Street Partition Parliament we now remind the public of the names of the men who voted in favour of &ldquo;President&rdquo; Cosgrave's motion approving the principle of the setting up of these &ldquo;Courts.&rdquo;  The names in their own official Parliamentary Report of 27th September are as follow:&mdash;</P>

White, James Burke, Michael Doyle, T. Carter, Andrew Lavin, Alec McCabe.</P>
    <P>The copy I hold in my hand is a copy sent to Deputy J.J. Walsh with his name marked on it as No. 1. Underlined are the following words: &ldquo;But history will not be slow in this case, and the awakening will come very rapidly.  Let there be no doubt about it ... England's bidding.  ... No person who is in any way responsible for this act must be allowed to evade responsibility. Renegade soldiers.  ... And there is only one means by which the <Col N="234" /> Nation can cleanse itself&mdash;the casting out and just punishment of these and all other Irishmen who make their country a by-word through a cowardly subservience to the English enemy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On 30th November, 1922, a further instruction was sent to the O.C.s all Battalions by the Chief of Staff who, under Mr. de Valera's letter of 13th November, was co-operating with him in all defence matters.  It is headed &ldquo;Enemy Murder Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To O.C.s all Battalions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  All members of &ldquo;Provisional Parliament&rdquo; who were present and voted for Murder Bill will be shot at sight.  Attached find list of names.</P>
    <P>(2)  Houses of members of Murder Bill, Murder Gang and active supporters of the P.G.&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is, the Provisional Government</P>
    <P>&mdash;who are known to support the Murder Bill decision will be destroyed.</P>
    <P>(3)  All Free State Army Officers who approve of Murder Bill and are aggressive and active against our forces will be shot at sight, also all ex-British Army Officers and men who joined the Free State Army since 6th December, 1921.</P>
    <P>(4)  Individual action on paragraphs 2-3 will be ordered by the Brigade O.C.</P>
    <P>(5)  To be duplicated and transmitted to the O.C. all Units.</P>
    <P>That was an order from the Chief of Staff and there was a footnote on it which said: &ldquo;On day of first execution an order to shoot at sight members of the Provisional Government was issued in Dublin, 1-2 Brigades, since an opportunity was not got to put same into effect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A list of members of the Provisional Parliament who voted for the &ldquo;Murder Bill&rdquo; was attached to this instruction and they were ordered to be shot at sight.  The list is as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>On the 4th December in another issue of the &ldquo;Poblacht na hEireann War News,&rdquo; No. 107, there is a letter signed Eamon de Valera, in which the &ldquo;Manchester Guardian,&rdquo; Manchester, England, is told that &ldquo;the Irish electorate did not decide for the Free State last December.&rdquo;  There are in that issue two letters or warnings issued.  One is to the Speaker of this House and the other is to the Chairman of the Irish Parliamentary Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Speaker&rdquo; and Labour.</P>
    <P>A warning from the I.R.A. Chief of Staff.</P>
    <P>The letters given below which have been sent from the General Headquarters of the Irish Republican Army speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>To: Mr. Johnson, Chairman Irish Parliamentary Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Sir,</P>
    <P>I am sending you herewith copy <Col N="237" /> of letter I have sent to the Speaker of the Provisional Government of Southern Ireland.</P>
    <P>You as spokesman have given the approval of your Party to the present policy of the so-called Provisional Government.  We are satisfied that your attitude does not reflect the overwhelming opinion of Labour in this country.  You must know, however, that your action gave sanction to the executions and to the continuance of the &ldquo;mad dog&rdquo; policy. We would therefore impress upon you the necessity for realising your responsibility in this matter.  The continued participation of your Party in the proceedings of this Illegal Parliament can only be construed by us as intentional co-operation with enemy forces in the murder of our soldiers, a great proportion of whom are drawn from the ranks of Labour.</P>
    <P>Chief of Staff (for Army Council).</P>
    <P>The second letter is:</P>
    <P>To &ldquo;the Speaker&rdquo; of the Provisional Parliament of Southern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Sir,</P>
    <P>The illegal body over which you preside has declared war on the soldiers of the Republic and suppressed the legitimate Parliament of the Irish nation.</P>
    <P>As your Parliament and Army headquarters well know, we on our side have, at all times, adhered to the recognised rules of warfare.  In the early days of this war we took hundreds of your forces prisoners, but accorded to them all the rights of Prisoners of War and over and above treated them as fellow-countrymen and former comrades. Many of your soldiers have been released by us three times, although captured with arms on each occasion. But the prisoners you have taken you have treated barbarously and when helpless have tortured, wounded, and murdered them.  We have definite proof that many of your senior officers, including members of your Parliament, have been guilty of most brutal crimes towards the I.R.A. prisoners and have reduced <Col N="238" /> your soldiers to a state of savagery in some areas.</P>
    <P>Finally you are now pretending to try I.R.A. prisoners before your make-belief Courts.  You have already done to death five after such mock ceremonials.  You now presume to murder and transport the soldiers who have brought Ireland's victory when you, traitors, surrendered the Republic twelve months ago.</P>
    <P>Next to the members of your &ldquo;Provisional Government&rdquo; every member of your Body who voted for this resolution by which you pretend to make legal the murder of soldiers is equally guilty.  We, therefore, give you and each member of your Body due notice that unless your Army recognises the rules of warfare in the future we shall adopt very drastic measures to protect our forces.  (Signed)</P>
    <P>Chief of Staff (for Army Council.)</P>
    <P>That letter was directed to the Chairman of this Parliament, which at that time consisted of 128 members, of which 36 persons who had been elected by the people did not recognise it.  The remaining 92 were dealing with the business here.</P>
    <P>On the 9th December a further issue of the &ldquo;War News,&rdquo; No. 111, reported the assassination of Seán Hales and the attempted assassination of An Leas-Cheann Comhairle of this Assembly. It read:&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Center">SEAN HALES.</P>
    <P>On Thursday, December 7th, Seán Hales, Commandant in the Free State Army and member of the Free State &ldquo;Parliament,&rdquo; was shot dead in the streets of Dublin.  At the same time, Padraig O Maille, another member, was wounded. Commandant Hales fought bravely against the British Empire during the first War of Independence as an Officer of the Irish Republican Army. He survived that war to meet his death in the cause of the British Empire, a cause which is not worth the sacrifice of one Irishman's life. For this cause Seán Hales voted away his country's independence, on the 7th January last, later consummating his treacherous act by <Col N="239" /> deserting his old comrades in arms to join the British arms and equipped levies of the so-called Free State.  He was a high officer in this Army when in July last, on the orders of England, it shattered the last chances of national unity by attacking the forces of the Republic and plunging the country into the cruellest of civil wars.  Since June, Seán Hales continued to fight against these forces which included his own brother, Commandant Thomas Hales, now in a Free State prison, while day by day the Free State military authorities were piling up a record for savagery and tyranny unequalled in any country in the world.  Two fellow members of Hales (Harry Boland and James Devins), who with him had been elected in May to a National Coalition Parliament with a mandate for peace, have been murdered in cold blood, 30 other members of the same Parliament are either imprisoned or being hunted down, defamed, maligned, persecuted; prisoners were being tortured or shot out of hand.  Continuing as a member of the Provisional Parliament which had usurped this National Coalition, Seán Hales, on September 27th, participated in the most appalling crime by voting for the setting up of murder courts, which have already done to death secretly eight Irishmen, one of them a member of the Dáil which Hales dishonoured.  The men who are engaged in carrying out this diabolical work for England have been solemnly warned that they cannot do these things with impunity.  The vengeance of an outraged people is at hand.  We again warn them and appeal to them&mdash;for England is not worth it&mdash;and they are merely devising their own traitorous and shameful doom.</P>
    <P>The record of P.O Maille is in nearly every respect the same as that of Seán Hales.</P>
    <P>A letterpress refers to this action of the shooting of Seán Hales as a just extermination of one of their own treacherous band.  In a further issue <Col N="240" /> of &ldquo;Poblacht na hEireann, War News,&rdquo; 122, issued on 28th December, the following Christmas greeting is issued:&mdash; The President's Christmas message&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the House is considering the Army Pensions Bill.  That inevitably goes back to 1922.  Whether that entails the whole history of the civil war I have grave doubts, and I would ask the Deputy to consider that.  If every document connected with 1922 is to be gone into on both sides of this House I cannot see an end to this discussion within a week.</P>
      <P>The Deputy might bring the quotation of such documents into relation to the Bill before him.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not giving in any way the history of the civil war, but I am producing documents which show who were acting and the background of authority that was behind those persons for whom pensions are proposed in this Bill, and the relationship of those who were responsible for these actions with this House.  I have kept myself strictly to documentation such as was necessary to relate this Bill here to the authority of this House and the persons for whom pensions are intended to be provided under this Act.  The message is headed &ldquo;President's Christmas Message.&rdquo;  The following Christmas message was addressed by President de Valera to the soldiers and citizens of the Republic:</P>
      <P Just="Center">GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC.</P>
      <P>Greetings to every soldier and citizen of the Republic as we consecrate ourselves in youth to the achievement of the independence of our country and pray for our comrades who have fallen in the fight let us now thank our Almighty God so as to enlighten us that we may do His will and obtain His blessing on all our efforts to bring to our harassed people the liberty, peace and happiness they need and desire.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Government and the Army command.</P>
      <P Just="Right">(Signed) Eamon de Valera.</P>
      <P>Christmas, 1922.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> I have indicated the authority and the instructions under which an attack was made on this institution, instructions being explicity issued by the person called Chief-of-Staff, who was co-operating with the person called the President, to shoot at sight a certain listed number of persons belonging to this House a fortnight before the message of peace and goodwill was issued in the name of the soldiers that were carrying out this work, the soldiers that were instructed to find and to shoot Seán McGarry.  Not being able to find the Deputy, the soldiers went to his house, and this is the official version given in &ldquo;War News,&rdquo; No. 116 published in reply to other Press accounts of what happened there. It says:</P>
    <P Just="Center">THE TRUTH ABOUT THE BURNINGS.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Press reports of the burnings of the house of Seán McGarry the accounts are grossly exaggerated.  The following are the facts:</P>
    <P>At McGarry's a next door neighbour interfered and considerably delayed our men.  The women in the house were told to take themselves and their children outside several times.  They became hysterical.  Our men proceeded to set the house alight and naturally believed that the women had taken the children out as they had ample time to do so. One of our men returned to the house to see that all was right and found the house was in flames and the occupants all out.</P>
    <P>That is the official report of how the soldiers acting under instructions of the Chief-of-Staff when they could not get the Deputy they were instructed to shoot, at night, sought out his house where his wife and family were and burned the house, burning to death one of his children and partially burning another.  Four days after that the following letter was issued by the Acting O.C. of the Dublin Brigade to Mr. Martin Fitzgerald, 91 to 93 Abbey Street, a member of the Oireachtas:</P>
    <P>In spite of repeated warnings you have refused to obey Orders issued <Col N="242" /> to you on several occasions by Command H.Q. and G.H.Q., I.R.A. You were clearly told either to (a) hand your paper over to Free State Provisional Government to be run by them as a Free State organ or (b), to be a free Press.  You have refused to do either and have instead persisted in your campaign of misrepresentation against the I.R.A.</P>
    <P>You are therefore ordered to leave Ireland before 12 o'clock noon on the 8th December, 1922.  The penalty for refusal to obey this order or for being found in Ireland after 12 o'clock noon on the 8th December, is death.</P>
    <P Just="Right">(Signed) J.F.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Acting O.C., Dublin Brigade.</P>
    <P>The letter is taken from the &ldquo;Freeman's Journal&rdquo; of 9th December, showing you how a member of the Oireachtas stood by his responsibilities as a representative of the people.  As the Presidential message of goodwill was printed on 28th December, 1922, in &ldquo;Poblacht na h-Eireann War News,&rdquo; the New Year started by an attack on the house of Mr. Walter Cole, the Deputy who was down under sentence to be shot at sight.  On 14th January President Cosgrave's home was destroyed by burning.  On 13th February Kevin O'Higgins's old father Dr. T. F. O'Higgins was shot dead in his own house, and I give these simply, not as a history of the Civil War, but as instances showing the attacks that were made on the representative Parliament of the people here by persons for whom it is now proposed this Parliament should provide pensions. I indicated that the representation given by the people to the persons who made themselves responsible for these attacks on the country's institutions and on the State was thirty-six persons in a house of 128, or 28 per cent.  Early in April the Chief-of-Staff was fatally wounded in the Knockmealdown Mountains and quite a number of other prominent associates of his were captured.</P>
    <P>Eamon de Valera issued a &ldquo;Cease Fire Order&rdquo; on the 27th April, 1923. Four months after that there was another election in the Free State and at that time a House of 153 was elected <Col N="243" /> and 44 persons were elected which was analagous to 36 that were elected to the previous one, that is, they were persons who repudiated the authority of this House, and who had thrown a cloak of authority around the military attack that had up to April, 1923, been made on it, that is the Irish electorate returned to Parliament 109 persons. By a majority of 109 to 44 they returned a group to this Parliament to carry on those institutions.  That is the commentary of the electorate on the authority that started the attack on those institutions and the commentary of the electorate on the authority of those institutions, by operating the means at its disposal to bring that attack to a standstill.  Now we are asked in days when the tale of that military organisation, when the present President and the present Min ister for Defence and the present Minister for Lands and Fisheries and the present Minister for Education, threw a cloak of authority around the attack, in days when the tale of that military organisation still exists in the country, still holds arms, still organises, still trains, still declares that this institution has to be wiped out, this House is asked to provide pensions for the persons who have made that attack on this as a State institution, and who are continuing that attack.  This State has suffered many attacks, has stood up to them in a way which must make many who faced the situation in 1922 look back and realise that it has stood up most wonderfully to the attacks that have been made against it.  Similar attacks are being organised and are threatened outside.  In those circumstances we submit that you cannot tolerate for a moment the acceptance of the principle that is enshrined in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Cleary Mr. Cleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, I have only a few words to say after having listened to that speech, which is evidently the product of a diseased mind.  I do not think anybody who had not a diseased mind could in present circumstances, and with the existing goodwill that there now is throughout the country, deliver himself of such a speech as we have now <Col N="244" /> heard.  In my opinion the ex-Minister has no other idea in view than to make an effort, no matter by what means, to try and prove if he can that there are people in this country who are just as unscrupulous or just as bad as he was.  It seems to be the only effort he is anxious to make.  I submit, a Chinn Comhairle, that in justice to the House and to the country the matters mentioned by the ex-Minister are not in order at all, and can only be put into debate for one purpose, and that is to try and raise up again the bitterness and bad feeling that existed years ago, when there was a civil war in this country, the beginning of which and the fault of which we could, if we wished, go into at length, and lay the blame on certain individuals. The ex-Minister has a weakness for documents&mdash;for certain documents. They have a weakness for declaring documents and a weakness for keeping documents secret for a long period.  They divulged documents when it suited their purpose, and they kept much more important documents than the one he has now read out secret for a period of years, documents much more important to the Irish people than those he has now read out.  The ex-Minister I think is of this opinion, that the time is now ripe to make a last effort to create bitterness again amongst the people of this country.  I do not believe that the people on the benches behind the ex-Minister or the people on the Independent benches, are at all anxious to have that atmosphere again created. He talked and read documents about people that were to be shot at sight when there was a war on, people who were carrying on the war, parties on different sides.  In warfare amongst decent civilised people there is a certain recognised code, and if people are to be shot during warfare because they are fighting against you I submit it is a decenter way of treating your enemy than by poisoning him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">
      <NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the ordinary citizens?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Cleary Mr. Cleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the very thing. The ordinary citizens might have been poisoned too, and I suggest that all those things should have been thought <Col N="245" /> of by the ex-Minister when he began to read out long statements about people who were to be shot at sight. Even from his point of view it would be much better nowadays and show much better spirit, if he left those documents hidden with the other skeletons which he has in his cupboard. I think, a Chinn Comhairle, if the debate is to proceed on the lines on which it has been started by the ex-Minister it will be a very bad thing not only for the members of this House, but for the country too.  A Deputy has interrupted.  We all could throw interruptions across the House.  We could point out the nasty things that were done by parties on both sides. We could name men who were to be shot at sight.  We could name men who were shot when they were helpless prisoners by a supposed Government, as it was then.  We could name several nasty things.  We could be just as nasty as the ex-Minister, and our intentions in mentioning these things could be just as good and as well-founded and as well-meant as are his intentions, but I submit that now is not the time for that.  There are people in the country who, because of their actions in the national movement, because they took the stand that Ireland should receive her full national rights, were not considered by the late Government to be entitled to pensions under their regime&mdash;people who suffered from wounds, mothers who had lost their children in the old days of the fight, and mothers who lost their sons in the late struggle, and who were destitute because these people were their only means of support.  Can any Deputy on the opposite benches, looking at the lists and realising the persons to whom pensions were given by the late Government, say that it is wrong for a Government, no matter by what Party it is constituted, to give pensions, something to live on, to people who lost their only means of support in the struggle for Irish freedom? Whether the lads who died were wrongly led or not, surely the relatives, looking at it even from that point of view, should not be victimised because a Party spirit is in existence in this country?  I think that every <Col N="246" /> Deputy on the Independent benches will look at it in that decent light instead of trying to raise up again all the spectres and all the skeletons of that civil war as this ex-Minister has tried to do, and that they will approach the matter from the humane standpoint.  That is the proper spirit in which it should be approached.</P>
      <P>If we were to go on the argument of the ex-Minister, we have no right to be here, and the Government now in office have no right to rule.  We should all be outlaws still.  I suggest to the ex-Minister that he had ten years in which to punish the men, and, mind you, he did it right well.  There was many a morning on which he had his men out at dawn to carry out certain things, which he legalised, because he was in power, and because he had a little majority to do so.  He had ten years to do that.  Let him try to forget the days of his glory.  They will not come again for a long time.  Let him try to look at the thing from the humane standpoint.  If he does, and if he does not try to prove that there are some men as bad as himself in this State, I think his action will be much more appreciated by the Deputies of this House.</P>
      <P>I would like Deputies, if they have faults to find with this Bill, to approach it from the proper standpoint, and not from the standpoint that because somebody thought some other person a renegade ten years ago, they should start from the ugly background of a bitter or biassed point of view.  There are destitute people in the country who are entitled to some support from this State because of the attitude they took, and because of the attitude their relatives took in this struggle, and I submit that the Government is only doing its duty in introducing the Bill, and that the Opposition will only be doing their duty in supporting this measure.  If there are certain weak points in the measure, because of which it could probably be abused to some extent, let them point out how it is possible to prevent that happening, and not oppose it from the standpoint of the ex-Minister.</P>

      <P>As one who has taken neither one side nor the other in the <Col N="247" /> Civil War, I would not like to remain silent while this Bill is passing through the House.  I can approach this matter as a humanitarian.  I feel that there are some things in the Bill of which I can easily approve.  For instance, I feel that it would be a source of satisfaction to many good citizens of this State if some of the dependants of those who fell during 1916 were compensated in some way. At the same time, there are provisions made in the Bill for persons outside those, and, in that, I disagree with the Minister.  I have said that it would cause a good deal of satisfaction to many good citizens if those persons who suffered, and, particularly, those who have lost their breadwinners, and mothers who have lost their sons during that period, were compensated in some way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wanted to say that I approached this matter in the way I have mentioned, but I do feel, at the same time, that the evidence produced from the documents quoted here to-night by Deputy Mulcahy is rather convincing.  What has evolved from the reading of these documents, which, I presume, are authoritative&mdash;<Col N="248" /> the authority of the documents has not been questioned&mdash;is that an attack was to be made on the representatives of the people in this House&mdash;not an ordinary attack, but that they were to be shot at sight.  I would like to hear something from the members of the present Government, whether they be front benchers or back benchers, to show that that spirit is now relegated to the past.  It is all very fine for Deputy Cleary to talk about not reviving skeletons and old and bitter memories.  I agree with Deputy Cleary, or any other member of the House who suggests that it is not right to be harking back to the tragic occurrences of 1921 and 1922, but, at the same time, I would like some assurance as a representative of the ordinary common people of this country, that that spirit is dead and gone.  We have no evidence that it is dead and gone, but we have evidence every week in official publications that that spirit is not dead and gone.  We have even veiled threats at the present moment that many people who do not vote in the way the Government votes may some time or another be shot at sight.  I would like to have some assurance from the leaders of the present Government, or even from the back benchers, that the spirit I have mentioned is dead and gone.  We have no repudiation whatever of these threats that are being made week after week by, shall I call it, the Republican Press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have nothing at all from the Government that that is not their view.  We have protestations, of course, that they intend to go along the usual constitutional lines, but there is no contradiction of the statements to which I refer.  My own view of the matter is that I would like to see persons who have dependants, and those with 100 per cent. or 20 per cent. debility wounds compensated in some way.  But we must have regard to the finances of the country.  The Minister estimates that if this Bill passes into law it will cost something like £25,000 this year, and there is the possibility that it will run to £30,000 next year. I daresay there will be a diminution in the cost, because of the occurrence <Col N="249" /> of death, but it is a huge sum of money.  Every day we hear from the Government Benches, and from every quarter, cries for economy in the public services, and while we have &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; in the Civil Service and threats of &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; in the salaries of other public servants, we have here a further huge expenditure list.  I feel that the amount suggested by the Minister is rather high and that something should be done if this is a case where some little economy might be practised.  I daresay the Government will be able to pass this measure, and while I have an amount of sympathy with persons who lost relatives, there must be a difference made between persons who went out in cold blood and assassinated&mdash;for which I do not stand, and will never stand&mdash;and others.  There must be some difference made between assassins who went out to murder Kevin O'Higgins and the men who went out honestly believing they were fighting for their country.  I have no sympathy whatever, and never shall have, for the assassin and the murderer. I hope if anything occurs as a result of this Bill, if it passes, that we are not going to subsidise or to help in any way the assassins of Kevin O'Higgins and the other men who went before him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKilroy" hpid="Mr. Kilroy Mr. Kilroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister is replying I would like him to make it clear whether cases that some of us consider were inadequately dealt with during the regime of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government will be re-considered. Deputy Mulcahy stated that the cases of Republicans were dealt with as well as those who supported his Party when they were the Government.  I can recall the case of the eldest son of a widow who was shot while on active service in 1921, and where a final settlement of £30 was made.  I am anxious to know from the present Minister if he considers that such a case was adequately dealt with, and if it will be re-considered. In my opinion it was a scandalous thing that such a small sum of money was offered as compensation to a widow for the loss of her son.  He gave his young life in the service of his <Col N="250" /> country when men were very badly needed.  I am aware that that son had no scruple about going on active service when required.  There is another class of case to which I would like to call the Minister's attention so that, when replying, he might say what he considers might be done.  There are quite a number of young men in mental homes throughout the country and, as far as I am aware, there is no provision in the Bill for compensating their parents.  Will an amendment be accepted so that such cases could be dealt with?  It is only right that they should be dealt with.  I know of a case in Mayo where the son of a widow is in a mental home and the circumstances are the same as if he was lost on active service.  No compensation has been paid.  I am sure that every decent-minded man will admit that such a woman is entitled to compensation for the loss of her son.  The Minister should consider the question of having mental cases of the class to which I refer placed in private mental homes where they could get special care and attention.  Some of these might be restored to health if they were isolated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle of this Bill, I take it, is that pensions should be paid to persons who suffered disability owing to their action in arms in endeavouring to prevent this State and this Parliament from being set up, or owing to their endeavour in arms to destroy the State after it had been set up, and further to provide for the dependants of persons who lost their lives in either of these attempts.  In the light of our circumstances it might appear that that particular principle would be wholly unacceptable to this Parliament.  As a matter of fact that, sir, is not the case I would like to put forward.  I have had an opportunity of considering this in relation to some persons who were my own acquaintances or friends, and considering it while being relieved of what I might call day to day political difficulties. It seems to me that the principle&mdash;although it might appear at first flush, wholly unacceptable to this House&mdash; might, in certain circumstances not <Col N="251" /> only be acceptable but might be very desirable.  If we could get into the position once and for all that the civil war was a thing of the past, and that the casualties of the civil war on either side could be provided for in so far as this kind of legislation can ever provide for these casualties, that would be an excellent thing for us.  In the nature of things there are wounds and sores that this kind of legislation, and that no kind of legislation we could conceive could deal with.  But, in so far as people are suffering poverty from wounds received in a cause in which they sincerely believed, and more particularly in so far as innocent dependants are suffering from the deaths of those who were their breadwinners, I think it is quite desirable that this House should do, in certain circumstances, all that it possibly can to relieve them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me the necessary circumstances are these: That the civil war should be a thing of the past, which we would, so to speak, endeavour to liquidate, and that the threat to the State should be also a thing of the past.  I do not agree with Deputy Anthony that £25,000 or £30,000, or if it were as big as £35,000 or £40,000, is very large.  For my part I would consider the amount of money in the Bill quite small if we were in what we might call politically smooth water&mdash;if the State were accepted, and if we saw Ministers themselves accepting it&mdash;no one would begrudge money spent then towards remedying the difficulties under which certain survivors of the civil war, or certain dependants and casualties of the civil war were suffering.  But that situation has not arisen.  If that situation did arise, if there was no longer any armed menace to the State, if there was acceptance of the State, whether cordial acceptance or simply acquiescence it might be desirable, not only for a Government like the present&mdash;which contains people who actively assisted the persons who are now being dealt with in this Bill&mdash; but for any Government in this State that they should make the effort now being made in this Bill.  In the <Col N="252" /> position we find ourselves and in all our circumstances, it is difficult to argue for this Bill.  I am in the position of one who would like to argue for it, but in a condition in which the civil war is not really over, and while at the moment preparations are being made for another civil war, it seems to be an extraordinary thing that we should proceed in this Bill to give these compensations.  For my own part I feel that if the other circumstances were here, if the Minister himself and those for whom he speaks were accepting the State and if the State were removed from any threat of arms against it, and if the civil war were regarded as an unhappy incident, the victims of which on any side might be suitably relieved, it would be an excellent Bill.  We are not in that position, however, and therefore I think it is a bad Bill and ought not to be.</P>

The more he opens his mouth, the worse it is for himself and his Party. We are not going to keep him or anybody else from creeping into a hole and not having to defend their position. We will ring round the empty platforms and invite them to go up and say what they have to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy made one of his usual silly speeches.  It is a good job that he did not claim to be stating the <Col N="253" /> history of the civil war.  Otherwise one might have to recall to him at length the vital factors in the civil war he forgot to mention.  I would like to remind Deputy Hayes that the men for whom we are claiming pensions here are not the men who set out to destroy the State or to prevent it from coming into operation.  They were the men who fought, as they thought best for Ireland, to maintain the State which Deputy Hayes and his Party destroyed without any sanction from the Irish people.  They were the men also who fought from 1916 to set up here an independent State free from any form of foreign domination whatsoever.  We want also to deal with the dependants of those who were killed in that fight.</P>
    <P>I hope for the sake of good feeling in this country that the Party opposite will not vote against this Bill.  If they do oppose this Bill it will arouse very many bitter memories. It was bad enough to do some of the things which they did, but it will be much worse, now that a proposition is put up to undo the harm or to relieve some of the hardship they caused to innocent people, for them to vote for a continuance of that hardship.  I trust that for the good of the country they will refuse to do that, and that they will allow this Bill to go through without opposition.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to what Deputy Kilroy said.  He asked would certain cases that had been considered in the past be given any opportunity of being reconsidered.  All cases in which the Minister thinks there is a good <i>prima facie</i> case for a re-opening will be considered.  Volunteers who are in mental homes are treated as men suffering from a disability if their present condition arises out of service. In that way, even under the present Acts, they are entitled to an allowance and the usual way of making it to their dependants or their legal representatives will be followed through.  I trust that this Bill will get the unanimous consent of the House.  As I say, it covers cases of hardship arising out of the Black-and-Tan War, out of 1916, and also out of the Republican side in the civil war.  I should prefer, and <Col N="254" /> it would be much better for this country, that all sides that suffered wounds in the civil war, and the dependants of those who were killed, should be looked after.  It will help greatly to cover up the sores that arise out of that disastrous division.  I have always maintained that that division and the civil war which followed from it was not the wish of the people opposite, but it was because the British set themselves to start that civil war here, and unfortunately they succeeded. If we can cover up the distress that was caused by that, it will be one step further towards a real national unity here in the country and that is what we all want to see.  I trust that the good sense of all Parties in the House will discountenance any opposition and allow the Bill to go through unanimously.</P>

What is running through my mind is that the Minister has brought forward and explained certain items but there are other items in the Finance Bill about which there is a great deal of doubt.  I should like to raise the interpretation of some of the items in the Finance Bill.  Would this be the time to raise that question?</P>

      <P>There are some points which I wish to make on this Resolution.  The Minister yesterday in the end seemed to give as an explanation of this whole tariff policy, that there was no way of dealing with unemployment, which was becoming more and more marked as indicated in the unemployment figures, except by imposing tariffs.  He rather implied <Col N="259" /> that employment had been provided for 32,000 during the last four months as a result of the tariffs which he had already imposed.  I do not know if the 32,000 that have been employed during the last four months are the 32,000 that the electorate must take off the 80,000 odd, for whom the Minister promised the electorate during the election he was going to provide work in the tariffed industries, or whether the 32,000 have been employed as a result of relief work.  He made certain statements, and generally his Party has been making certain statements with regard to unemployment figures, and what the tariff policy is doing for the unemployed.  As Deputy Davin emphasised yesterday, unemployment has grown in his area.  I do not think there is a single Deputy from any constituency, in spite of the Minister's suggestion that 32,000 more have been put into employment, who could not say that, as a result of the policy the Minister has been pursuing in the last four months, unemployment is very much more acute and has increased in their areas.  I think it would be well if the Minister would give us some idea as to the areas in which these 32,000 persons are distributed, because they certainly are not to be found in the City of Dublin.  The Minister knows himself, that unemployment in the City of Dublin has considerably increased, that it is indicated in the registered figures, in spite of the cloak the Ministry endeavoured to throw over these figures, a cloak suggesting that there has been a change of policy in the recording of the figures.  The figures for the City of Dublin are but a small index, in so far as they mark an increase in unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If he examines the figures for money payments to able-bodied in receipt of outdoor relief he will find that they are 30 per cent. up since last year.  He can go to dozens of different establishments in the city and get from them information as to the number of employees that they have actually paid off.  As I mentioned before, there is one shipping company at the port that during the month of September paid about £700 less to dockers and £600 <Col N="260" /> less to ships' crews.  There was also a fall in payments in the month of August.  I just give these as samples of the different classes of business in the city that can give the Minister first-class information as to the way unemployment has been increased in the City of Dublin as a result of the policy that has been pursued. The unemployed generally are being fed on the kind of propaganda that everything is to be all right for them. The Government organ on the 24th September gave them a great statement headed &ldquo;2,000 fewer unemployed weekly.&rdquo;  I understand that the Minister yesterday quoted 87,000 as the general figures for unemployment in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that they are not all unemployed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a new sidelight.  I wonder could we have any information as to the areas in which these 2,000 fewer unemployed weekly are distributed, because we are told that exact figures with regard to unemployment are now being got and that the Ministry are basing their economic policy on that.  Up to the present we have been led to understand that the figures quoted weekly are of people registered as unemployed. Now we are told that they are not.  I suggest that is simply another kind of red herring across the statistics that we here in the House naturally expect the Ministry to put at our disposal in order that we may get in touch with the general trend of things in the country, because while we might be alarmed at the actual size and nature of unemployment in a particular part of the country, our alarm would be modified by seeing from the statistics relating to other parts of the country that unemployment was not so great there: that the results of having increased employment in other parts of the country might be expected some time or other to spread back to the <Col N="261" /> City of Dublin.  If one takes the figures that the Minister makes available weekly, one is forced to feel a considerable amount of doubt as to what the figures do mean.</P>
      <P>Up to the present I have taken them&mdash;Deputies generally have taken them&mdash;as being the number of people actually out of work.  We are told now that that is not so.  But generally, as from say the beginning of March up to date, if we take the figure the Minister gave yesterday&mdash; 87,000,&mdash; the number of people registered has increased three times. That figure is fairly constant all over the country.  In Wexford the increase was twice; Waterford 1½ times; Dublin 1½ times, and Drogheda 3 times. But if we take the last figures available on the 2nd October, the number of persons registered in Dublin has increased 18 times.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister tells us that the figures in Mayo increased from 200 to 12,000, and the same thing happened in Galway.  That is not a fact.  In Galway the figures have increased 4½ times and in Mayo 32½ times.  If we get figures from the Minister we require to have some assurance that they mean something definite and tangible.  If the Minister exaggerates employment and tells us that the number of people registered in Mayo and Galway have gone up&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is comparing two figures which cannot be compared and which have no relation one to the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister suggest that in Mayo there was a different attitude towards registration compared to Galway say pre-March last?  Does he think that the Mayo people are more inclined or less inclined to register than the Galway people, or would he tell us what interpretation we are to put on his statement that the number registered had increased in Galway in the same way as in Mayo, the increase in one case being 4½ times and in the other <Col N="262" /> 32½?  Would he tell us what on earth is wrong in that part of the country that the Minister for Lands and Fisheries comes from, because in the area around Ballina the number of persons registered has increased by 57 times?</P>
      <P>Then we are told that this is the foundation upon which the new industrial policy is being based.  I suggest that the Minister is treating his responsibility for collecting and interpreting these statistics very lightly.  The figures as they were under the old system did, in fact, give an index as to the relative position with regard to unemployment in the country.  The figures as they stand now do not.  I would ask the Minister if he can give us any indication as to the extent to which the tariffs that he now proposes to put on are going to give work to the persons that are looking for work in the Ballina area to an extent 57 times greater than they were looking for it in March last.  The Minister based his whole statement with regard to tariffs on the fact that it is only by tariffs that you can keep the position of affairs that he claims is disclosed in the figures that he provides weekly with regard to the number registered weekly as unemployed.</P>

      <P>Deputies will understand it was the intention to circulate a memorandum as requested by the Leader of the Opposition, and it was apparently intended that the general discussion on tariffs would be postponed until the memorandum was circulated. I am glad, however, to have the opportunity of dealing with the particular points raised by Deputy Mulcahy, because I am aware that some confusion has been caused as a result of statements which have appeared in the Press that were based on a misunderstanding of the figures given by me.  When I mentioned yesterday a figure of roughly 30,000 persons placed in employment, it was in relation to a statement made by Deputy McGilligan that the system of utilising the employment exchanges which was operated by the late Government was effective because, he said, 17,000 persons were placed in employment through these exchanges during the course of the year.  I was arguing at the time that for the vast majority of the people of the country seeking work under the old system the exchanges had no significance whatever. I was comparing, in support of that contention, the number of vacancies being filled through the exchanges now with the number of vacancies filled through the exchanges when the old system was operating.  Roughly speaking, the number of vacancies filled last year through the exchanges was 17,000. At the present time, the number of vacancies being filled through the exchanges averages from 1,500 to 2,000 per week.  That means that much more general use is being made of the exchanges. Consequently, there is much greater inducement to persons seeking <Col N="264" /> work to register in the exchanges, and that is precisely what we are seeking to attain.  When I say that 2,000 people are being put into employment in a week or that 30,000 people have been put into employment over a specified period, it does not mean that that number of persons have been provided with permanent employment.  It does mean that that number of vacancies has been notified to the exchanges and filled through the machinery of the exchanges.  That arises because it is necessary to understand precisely the significance of the figure given each week as to the number of registered unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Government came into office, we said that it was our intention to try to make that number a number with real significance.  We deny that under the old system it had any real significance.  The number of employment exchanges was few, and the number of unemployed who registered was very small.  For a large number, if not the majority, of the workers outside the cities, the exchanges had no significance whatsoever.  We instituted a new system of registration, by which persons could register at exchanges through post offices and Gárda stations all over the country.  As a result of the institution of that system of registration, the number of registered unemployed increased in one week by roughly 40,000.  The jump from the old figure to the new figure took place within a fortnight&mdash;all due to the fact that people were registering at the exchanges who never registered at the exchanges before.  There was another reason.  When it was decided to vote a large amount of money for relief works, we endeavoured to get some basis upon which that sum could be divided between the different counties so as to be available to meet hardship wherever hardship existed. We asked ourselves &ldquo;Upon what system are we going to divide this money as between one county and another county, and as between one part of a county and another part?&rdquo; We said: &ldquo;It is not a question of taking it by population, rateable valuation, or any of the devices used in the past.  Clearly, the best means, if possible, <Col N="265" /> of dividing this money is in relation to the actual number of unemployed.&rdquo; Consequently, it was announced that the work to be given under these relief grants would be given solely through the exchanges and, secondly, that the total amount would be allocated as between county and county in relation to the number of persons employed in these counties.</P>
    <P>When we went to the old figures to see if they would be any use in making that calculation, we found that, practically speaking, unemployment, as shown by the old figures, did not exist west of the Shannon, because west of the Shannon there is a very small number of agricultural labourers.  The people who work on the land there are, in the main, small proprietors working their own land.  These people are available for work upon roads, sewerage schemes and other relief works. In order to get that relief work, they had to register at the exchanges, even though they were not persons who were normally seeking insurable employment at all.  They were seeking relief work as such.  Consequently, we got that figure of 78,000 which, from one point of view, was of as little use as the former figure, because all these other elements entered into its computation. We are trying to get that figure analysed and divided up to show those who are seeking work in the ordinary way&mdash;industrial workers seeking industrial work as such&mdash;those who are seeking relief work and relief work only and particularly those who are seeking relief work who are holders of land or who are owners of some other means of livelihood.  When we get this analysis made&mdash;and it is going to be a matter of considerable difficulty, without powers to require people to give accurate statements of their circumstances&mdash;we will have, I hope, a figure which will have greater significance.</P>
    <P>We are told that unemployment is on the increase.  I say that it is not possible to demonstrate that by figures. It is probably not possible to demonstrate the contrary by figures.  We have got to face up to two facts.  The first is that emigration has stopped. <Col N="266" /> Normally, 25,000 or 30,000 people left the country every year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephByrne" hpid="Mr. J.J. Byrne Mr. J.J. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in the year preceding that in which you took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking an average for ten years and you get a figure of 24,000.  This year, 1,000 emigrants returned to one district in Donegal and none went out.  They are coming back into the country and, during the course of this year, the population of the country increased by 16,000.  For the first year since 1850 or thereabouts, the population of Ireland increased. Consequently, if we had succeeded in finding employment for all those unemployed at the beginning of the year, there would be still unemployment, in consequence of that stoppage of emigration, the return of the emigrants and the increase of population.  It was stated by a Deputy that unemployment had increased in consequence of the tariffs.  That is very definitely not the case.  The only instance he gave was that of a shipping company of Dublin.  It is quite true that during the month of September, in consequence of the stoppage of exports of agricultural produce, there was a diminution of employment at the ports.  That situation has been eased somewhat lately, but, under any circumstances, so long as we are setting out to develop production within the country, the amount of employment given in the unloading of imported goods is going to diminish&mdash;but not to the extent which might be assumed from the figures for last month, which were abnormal figures. Mention was made of a shipping company which, in the case of its crews, paid so much less in wages than formerly. I went into figures as to the employment given on the ships registered in Dublin, and if 50 per cent. of the crews of these ships were citizens of the Saorstát, there would not be an unemployed seaman in the Saorstát.  If the Deputy is in direct contact with the members of these shipping companies, I hope he will use his influence to induce them to employ Irish people on these ships, because in the majority of cases they are not <Col N="267" /> doing so now.  There is, of course, one company which is an honourable exception, and of the others, some have quite a good record.  I should like to mention, however, one company in particular which has a very large trade with this country, and is making a very substantial profit out of the trade of the country, and only 7 per cent of its total employees are citizens of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What I said was that if 50 per cent. of the persons employed on these ships were citizens of this State there would not be an unemployed seaman in this State. Reference was made to the figure of outdoor relief.  We have had the figure relating to outdoor relief analysed.  I want to warn Deputies against quoting that figure in relation to the unemployment problem, because it has no relation to it.  Only 14 per cent. of the persons in receipt of outdoor relief are available for employment. Fifty per cent. are children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>When I mentioned outdoor relief, I mentioned able-bodied outdoor relief as having increased 50 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of male persons in receipt of outdoor relief described as available for work and who will take work is 14 per cent. These are the people we are endeavouring to provide for.  Again, I want to provide against a misunderstanding. There are two ways by which you can give work through the Labour Exchanges.  You can say: &ldquo;Give the work available to those drawing benefit and save the Unemployment Insurance Fund.&rdquo;  Or you can say: &ldquo;Give the work available to <Col N="268" /> those who are not in benefit; let the Unemployment Insurance Fund maintain, as long as they are entitled to it, those in receipt of benefit, but give the work to those who are at present in receipt of outdoor relief or, in any case, in the greatest need of employment.&rdquo; We decided to let the Fund suffer.  The instructions which have been given to the managers of labour exchanges require them, in choosing persons for employment, apart from other considerations, to choose those who are not in receipt of benefit against those who are, and to choose those who are longest unemployed in any eventuality, apart from the order of preference which requires them to give the first offer of work to married men with dependants and the second to single men with dependants, and married men without dependants, and so on.  The effect of that instruction has been to secure in this year work for people who have been idle for years past.  It has been found that some of these people are hardly fit to work, they have been so long idle. Now they are being brought back into casual employment, it is true, but, nevertheless, they are getting a restoration of self-esteem and are becoming employable again to an extent they were not before.</P>
      <P>Another reason which I want the Deputy to keep in mind, and which explains the increase in the figures for outdoor assistance, is the grant made available by the Government for the provision of milk to children.  A number of boards of health, in order to make people entitled to that grant, are giving 1/- per week outdoor relief so as to make them recipients of relief, as without that they could not get the milk provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Having said that, I want to say that unemployment is a very serious problem here, and the measures which have been taken to deal with it up to the present, although they have been successful to a great extent, have not gone anything like reducing that problem within manageable proportions.  We have no desire <Col N="269" /> to minimise the extent of the problem. The size of it, as emphasised by the Deputy and his colleagues, is our justification for the measures we have taken; the abnormal provision of funds for relief work and the imposition of these protective duties in order to secure industrial development, because there is no other way by which unemployment can be solved except by the development of industries.  There is no alternative.</P>
      <P>Of course the measures which we have designed to induce additional tillage are going to have an effect, but their main effect will be to retain upon the land persons who would otherwise be moving to the cities seeking employment. It has been frequently mentioned here that the majority of the agricultural workers, that is including farmers and labourers, are not as fully employed as they might be and, consequently, you can increase the amount of work done upon the land considerably before you would actually attract persons back to it who are not engaged on agricultural labour.  At the same time, when we get the tillage policy developed, and we hope to do so as a result of the measures to be submitted, we will, to some extent, stop the movement of rural labour into the towns.  But there is a large number of unemployed in the towns already, and it is going to be no easy matter to find work for them.  We have made very considerable progress.  I hope to be able to publish in the near future figures which will indicate the nature of that progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has not been shown, and it cannot be shown, that any substantial amount of unemployment has been created by the protective policy of the Government. Here and there a commercial traveller, an agent for an importing firm, or a clerk in an agent's office has lost his employment.  That is correct. But, for every such person who lost employment, one hundred have gained it.  Let me say, however, that in the majority of the cases in which industrial development has proceeded immediately following the tariffs the employment given is not of the most desirable kind.  It is employment to juvenile workers or to female workers <Col N="270" /> in the main part.  The industries that employ adults, the heavier industries, are going to take longer to develop. We are making a start upon these, and I hope that in the very near future we will be able to announce the development of other projects which are going to operate in that way.  We have put into employment many hundreds of people.  We are going to put into employment many hundreds more, and that is as a result of the policy.  I hope the Dáil will be prepared to judge that policy upon its results and not upon any preconceived theories.  I am quite satisfied that if judged upon results it will be deemed to be highly satisfactory.</P>

      <P>On the figures, I should like to ask a question.  The Minister spoke of the abnormal amount of money spent on relief schemes, these figures being the basis for it.  I should like some assurance that the distribution is not entirely based on these figures, because if you take the number registered in the City of Dublin on 2nd October, it was 14,294.  For the whole county of Donegal it was half that, 7,205.</P>

There are four figures involved: Dublin, 14,294; Donegal, 7,205; Galway area, which includes practically the whole of County Galway, or most of Galway and Mayo, 9,959, representing seven areas.  Of these seven, the Ballina area has 5,900.  The figures for Dublin being 14,000, Ballina, 6,000, and the whole of Donegal, 7,000, is the distribution of unemployment relief grants going to be made on the basis of these figures?</P>

      <P>I regret having to mention, in connection with this Vote, a matter that I would rather was mentioned and dealt with elsewhere. I want to say at the outset that it is not a new question; it is a question that has been going on for some time. I refer to the discontent that exists because of the unsatisfactory conditions under which the ushers are employed in this House.  I want to refer also to certain complaints for which they have failed to secure any redress. There have been complaints for the last two or three years about the conditions under which the ushers are obliged to do their work.  I think it will be agreed on all sides of the House that the members of the existing staff do their work very satisfactorily.  I think it is apparent to all of us who have watched them doing their work that they have altogether too much work to do.  I want to put a plea to the responsible Minister for a thorough examination of the whole position with a view to seeing what additional assistance is required in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious to all of us that some additional assistance on the staff of ushers is necessary.  I think we have all felt the inconvenience on more than one occasion of having a limited <Col N="273" /> number of men to do an unlimited amount of work.  There are other aspects of the case that, perhaps, it would not be well to stress unduly here.  There are complaints that the conditions of work have been made very unsatisfactory for the ushers, particularly with regard to increments and wages.  Fines have been inflicted and there have been penalties by way of loss of increment in connection with entirely trivial matters.  I would like to say that the employees of this House who are concerned in this matter are trade unionists.  I think they have endeavoured to secure redress through their union, and I would much prefer that that object would be achieved without the matter being mentioned in the House.  It will be a very unpleasant state of affairs for us if the trade union catering for the men concerned has to take action.  This House ought to give a lead in the matter of decent employment and satisfactory conditions.</P>
    <P>I want to call attention also to the very grave dissatisfaction that exists to my own knowledge in the case of the staff employed in the restaurant. There have been complaints for a very long time in this respect.  Only recently when some of us became members of the Restaurant Committee were we brought face to face with the difficulty in that department, and the necessity for remedying complaints of the kind.  I want to mention one instance.  Before the Recess we decided, as members of the Restaurant Committee to make certain recommendations in connection with the allowance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it can be dealt with in another way.  I will say this much, that it seems to me that any attempt to remedy conditions has been deliberately flouted.  I was going to quote a particular instance connected with the restaurant in support of that view.  I hope it will not be necessary for the trade unions catering <Col N="274" /> for the persons concerned to call the men who are employed here out&mdash;to withdraw their labour&mdash;because they cannot get their grievances redressed. I understand there has been a slight improvement lately, but much more improvement is necessary.  I want the Minister to make full inquiries into these matters with the object of remedying the grievances that exist. The people concerned complain that they have a difficulty in getting a hearing for their grievances, and they are naturally desirous for some improvement in the conditions under which they work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a point, perhaps a much older point than the one raised just now.  I will refer to a matter that has been raised in this House on very many occasions.  I think it is a matter that will be subscribed to by members of all Parties. I would like the Minister to consider whether he will not again approach the railway companies with regard to the travelling facilities for members of the Oireachtas.  As members of the House are aware, the position is that each time a Deputy desires to travel he has to get a voucher.  That voucher is presented at the railway station and the Deputy is given a first-class ticket for which the State has to pay full fare. There are certain inconveniences in that procedure, and I think it would be much more satisfactory, and it might cost the State less, if there could be some system of passes the same as are given to many people in the country who have to use the railways fairly frequently. I understand that the late Government approached the railway companies on this matter, but the companies were not inclined to grant any facilities.  I think the State is entitled to certain facilities from the railway company.  A good deal of State money goes to the railways every year, and I think there ought to be some appreciation of that on the part of the companies. It is doubtful if there would be very much loss to the railways.  It would certainly be of advantage if members of the House got some such facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that I desire to raise.  Many members of the House of all Parties have spoken to <Col N="275" /> me on this matter.  It will be within the recollection of Deputies that a couple of years ago an Act relating to the travelling expenses of members was amended so that Deputies who might use their own motor cars would be entitled to some allowance.  The position to-day is that on many occasions in the performance of their duties as members of the Dáil and in carrying out the work of their constituents Deputies find it more convenient to use their own cars rather than utilise the railways.  Very often it is absolutely necessary to use a motor car and many Deputies find it more convenient to do this than to travel to Dublin by rail.  The allowance made by the Department of Finance works out at something like 1½d. a mile or less.  We know that certain State servants get as much as 6d. a mile.  I am not suggesting that 6d. a mile for State servants is too much.  When you take into account running expenses, wear and tear, and depreciation of a car, that figure is not at all too much.</P>
    <P>I suggest it is absurd to offer 1d., 1½d. or 2d. a mile to a Deputy who is obliged to use his own car in order to reach Dublin.  So far as I remember, in the Act passed by the Oireachtas it was laid down that the allowance to a member of the House who uses his own car or travels by motor bus or otherwise should not exceed the cost of a first-class railway ticket.  The Ministry of Finance interpreted that in the way that the Ministry of Finance usually interprets things by not exceeding the cost of a first-class ticket.  In fact, they do not give you the cost of a third-class ticket.  While this may appear to be a small matter I think it is unfair, and I do not think the Minister himself, or any member of the House will contend that a Deputy should travel from his constituency to Dublin to do his business at 1½d. a mile.  I know this is a matter that has been discussed between Deputies of the House.  It is a matter on which members of all Parties feel to a certain extent. Therefore, I desire to raise it and, therefore, I hope that when he is replying <Col N="276" /> the Minister will indicate first that he is prepared to interview or get in touch with the railway company again about getting passes under the present system, and that he will get his Department to interpret the present Act as the House intended it should be interpreted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Murphy, I think I should say at the outset that I am very sorry that that matter was raised in the House.  As far as I am concerned, I would have been glad to have listened to representations made to me by any responsible Deputies in regard to any members of the staff, but I am not prepared to go outside what would be my proper domain, and say here in the House whether or not there is any foundation for the grievances that are alleged to exist.  They have not been formally brought to my notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was rather unfair to raise it without approaching me at first, at any rate.  That does not help us very much.  The only thing I can say is that I wish to make it quite clear that there are responsible authorities in this House and I have no reason to believe that they would deal other than fairly and justly with the staff, as I believe the heads of all the services would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that all attempts to have satisfaction given with regard to certain matters have failed.  I was very careful when referring to the matter, and as a last resort I mentioned it in this House, the only place in which I should mention it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, because I do not think that as between the <Col N="277" /> State and the servants of the Oireachtas the House is the proper place in which to raise those matters.  I feel that very strongly.  I would like to make myself quite clear on this matter, because there should not be any ground for misunderstanding.  I understood some suggestion was made that certain civil servants might withdraw their labour.  I think that in that regard they must remember as civil servants that they enjoy certain privileges, and that one of the conditions of their service is that labour is not to be withdrawn, that there are other means of settling disputes of this sort.</P>
      <P>I would be very sorry to think that any civil servant would proceed to take action which might have serious consequences not merely for the civil servant but possibly for the State and the people.  There have been established proper means of approach to the official side of the Civil Service; proper means of approach to the Ministers, and as long as these means exist they must be tried out to the very end.  When they have failed, if there is still a sense of grievance or a sense of injustice I am prepared to receive representations such as the Deputy has made&mdash;private representations. I am perfectly certain that there is any substance in the grievances which are said to exist that there will be on the part of every responsible person in the service of the Government a desire to adjust and to remedy them should any arise.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point that has been made by Deputy Morrissey, I understand that my predecessor in office approached the railway companies on several occasions and was not able to get much satisfaction out of them.  I will look into the points the Deputy has made with regard to travelling facilities, railway or road facilities, and will try to meet any hardship that may exist.  At the same time in regard to this matter it must be remembered that we cannot do anything which would increase the cost of travelling to the State.</P>

      <P>To go a little bit further into this.  The manifesto of Fianna Fáil to the electorate stated: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil seeks a mandate to proceed with the following items: To submit to counsel for their opinion the question of the obligation to make the other annual payments to Britain, including the Pensions of the former R.I.C., and to act on the opinion obtained.&rdquo; The money has not been paid.  If the manifesto terms have been carried out, counsel have been asked for their opinion and have apparently advised that the money is not payable.  Would the Minister tell us, if counsel have been asked this, who the counsel are, and what is the opinion they have given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder whether I am bound to answer that question.  I do not think that I am bound to divulge the name of the counsel, but I will say that counsel's opinion has been obtained and that they advised that the moneys are not payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Counsel have been asked and presumably the Attorney-General has been asked.  If there is shame about giving out the names of the people who advised, if the Attor-ney-General is doing his duty he is bound to give his opinion.  Is he one of the people who have advised, or are we to take it that he has remained in an unassertive position, although he has advised that the payment should be made to Great Britain, and his advice has not been taken?  We remember that on the annuities question&mdash;on which also it agrees to get the opinion of counsel&mdash;when it first came along we were told certain counsel had given <Col N="285" /> their opinion on this.  The statement was made that some counsel had advised against it, and that was denied, but later it did emerge that one person who had been asked about them said that the whole case put to him was tripe.  Has anybody said that the R.I.C. payments are equally tripe?  We know as far as recent events can show that there is a complete abandonment of the legal action on the other question. Is it not now thought fit to disclose the names of counsel, lest they too would have to be put on the scrap heap with the people who advised on the land annuities?  We are voting money for it.  The people in the country have been taxed to subscribe a certain amount of money to the extent of £1,126,000, and the people are being taxed this year for that sum of money, although some unknown counsel have advised that those payments should not be made.  Why, when the Minister's finance estimates with regard to income tax and a few other matters are failing, and failing absurdly, and are likely to leave us in the position of having a completely unbalanced Budget at the end of the year, should they now put on the people the burden of this £1,126,000 if counsel with any reputation which could stand their names being mentioned have advised that these payments should not be made.  The Minister has told us that counsel have so advised, and I think the implication of his statement is that counsel, other than the counsel who are at the moment feed by the Government, have advised.</P>
      <P>Maybe we are to take it that one of the counsel, who was asked his opinion and gave a wrong opinion, is now going to be kicked upstairs somewhere because he gave that wrong opinion, and because his opinion is not being acted upon, because he thinks the money should be paid to Britain.</P>
      <P>In circumstances which we were told, somebody has advised that this manifesto has been carried out and that counsel have had submitted to them for their opinion the question of the obligation to make this payment and, if necessary, that it should&mdash;not that there is no contractual obligation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="286" /> Let us put it that item 3, because counsel have been asked their opinion, can be put on the basis of item 2&mdash;that there was no contractual obligation binding us to hand over these payments to Britain&mdash;that Britain is neither legally nor justly entitled to receive them.  We have not got the length of the last phrase: &ldquo;This is the signed and published opinion of several prominent lawyers.&rdquo;  We will form our impression of the lawyers and their prominence, when we hear of them. At the moment they are known only to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>This is a matter upon which the House is entitled, I think, to get an amount of information, other than what has been given.  The Minister simply stated that the money is being kept, and in the happy event of a good solution, and I suppose the Minister will say, after viewing the other solutions that have been given, in the happy and improbable event of the opinion being correct, and of the attitude taken by the Government being justified, then it may be spent somewhere else; but that hope is about equal to the hope we have of getting anything from Britain going off the gold standard.  If that hope is fulfilled, then the money we have levied this year from people who are suffering and working very hard because of the opinion of this counsel, then that money will not be needed&mdash;at least, it will not be needed for the purpose for which, at the moment, it is being gathered in.  The Minister is not going to back his fancy so far as this counsel is concerned, to any great extent he does not even take a shadow&mdash;with regard to these moneys that are in question at the moment.  He is not going to remit even portion of them.  He has not even security for getting a fraction of this amount.  He is going to lift the whole amount of the money that is due.  Take the circumstances in which it is being levied&mdash;with income tax at the rate which it is at the moment, so high that it is able to give no proper return, so high that on a very conservative estimate we are about a half a million pounds down in the year and that, mind you, although everybody is paying at a higher rate <Col N="287" /> from the business profits out of which it can be got.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And the money that is deducted all the year round from those who have fixed incomes under the control of the Minister&mdash;there is no yield, I suppose, from that&mdash;at the higher rate.  At this time when, as I say, income tax is completely failing as a tax to give the yield it is estimated to give, it is presumed now that the country can stand the burden of this £1,152,000 although some counsel, whose advice was taken by the Minister, have advised that this money should not be paid.  And the Minister is not acting on that advice, and this is on a footing with the land annuities, and if there is any belief at all in the event of the success of the movement with regard to it, it is time we got whatever hope there is cashed to some extent, because if ever the people wanted remission of taxation in the country, they want it now.  The Budget was estimated on the basis of extremely high direct taxation, and warning was given that the high direct taxation would fail in its object; that it had gone far beyond the regulation point, and proof has been given that it has failed.  On the other hand, we had also the burden of the high prices that were caused by the mixture of tariffs that were thrown on hurriedly, and we are told at any rate that by reason of the extra tax imposed on them by reason of buying goods that there would be employment in the country. We have seen that also has been falsified, <Col N="288" /> and in fact, the unemployment is worse than ever it was, and at the same time 80 per cent. of what was looked for from tariffs has been gathered in in the first six months of the year. People are paying all round, no protection, no better employment, and huge direct and indirect taxation, and on top of that comes this sum of money. What about the people who are fooled by this business of what Fianna Fáil was going to do?  Did they expect that that meant that once counsel gave an opinion these moneys could be retained, that the moneys were going to be collected&mdash;that was going to be a continuance of the imposition upon them &mdash;and have the satisfaction of knowing the Government had these moneys in a Suspense Account, no more than they expected that the land annuities would continue to be collected.  It is put in the third paragraph after the land annuities being second, and the hope was definitely inculcated in the people here that these payments would cease too.  These are portions of the payments which at the moment every bit of trade we have in the country is suffering.  We know there is a special duty with regard to certain things to collect these moneys, and these moneys are being collected from taxation to start with, and despite what counsel have advised they are not being returned to the people, and the people are not being asked not to pay them. People are paying them, and at the same time the whole trade of the country has been upset by special duties in order to collect these moneys and other sums of money, and we are within three weeks of another very definite blow being struck at the trade we have left.</P>
      <P>On the 15th November, unless there is a very definite change for the better in the relations between this country and the country from whom we are withholding these moneys, certain goods, which at the moment are not tariffed, which are getting in free to Great Britain, are going to be tariffed to bring in this £1,126,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has anybody who is interested in this money taken the trouble to look up the articles which have been tariffed?  Under the British Import <Col N="289" /> Duty Act of February of this year, from which we were exempt and continue to be exempt until the 15th of November, and after which date, the exemption will cease unless we get specific provision made by the British exempting us, is it recognised that biscuits will fall under the 10 per cent.?  Is it recognised that stout will fall under the 10 per cent?  Is it recognised that whatever woollen export trade we have&mdash;and we have a considerable export trade in high-class goods&mdash;will fall under the 10 per cent?</P>
    <P>We had one of the things last night, one of the foolish tariffs, on jute bags, of which there is a considerable export from this country.  Is it recognised that these, too, will fall under the 10 per cent., because some counsel, whose name cannot be mentioned here, has advised that some money may be retained here and the Government decide to retain that money while still collecting it?  And that is going to lead to a better situation in the country with regard to employment. Supposing the biggest export we have is taxed to the extent of 10 per cent., what is the likelihood of employment becoming better or worse in this city? Supposing biscuits are taxed to the extent of 10 per cent., and have to suffer that in competition with the English manufactured biscuit on the other side, and that one firm in this city alone suffers, what is going to be the return in the way of employment or unemployment?  Is all that you can do in the way of tariffs for the home trade going to make up what may be lost in the export trade in woollens alone?</P>
    <P>What is going to happen in Athlone with the trade which is its best export trade, and what is going to happen in County Cork with its export trade in woollens, if those people who have established a fairly good reputation for a certain class of high class goods find themselves suddenly, on the 15th of November, by reason of the fatuity of counsel, and the still greater fatuity of people who acted on that advice, up against the 10 per cent., which, at the moment, is imposed only on the foreigner and not on any member of the Dominions?  Yet we have this <Col N="290" /> Estimate mentioned here, and all the Minister can say, in the most slighting way, is that this will be retained against the happy event of the payments not having to be made to Great Britain.  A great deal has to come before that happy event, and one of the things that the House should know about before it votes this money is on what reputation this probability of that happy event depends and who is the lawyer who has advised on this.  Is it beyond the bounds of possibility that it is the same old team that has got us into the mess we are now in in relation to the annuities or is it the same team? Is it now considered that the men who were capable of advising in the way in which they did on a problem like the land annuities could be expected to go one further and advise in a similar way with regard to these payments?</P>
    <P>This is one of the critical votes the House has got to take, and the House knows that it is no theory that has been put forward with regard to the hampering of trade.  The House knows that what I have said with regard to what is likely to happen on the 15th of November, although it is not a fact at the moment, is the nearest thing possible to a fact.  Let us just take, as being on one side of the balance, the export trade we have in stout, biscuits and woollens and put against that the possibility or the probability of the happy event being successful and that we will not have to make these payments to Great Britain. Is it worth the struggle?  Supposing we are going to be successful, what is the force in asking the people to pay this money by way of taxation, to get this money collected by way of taxation, and to have it hidden here in a Suspense Account, or in some secret way here and kept here and no word of explanation given with regard to the distribution of this money or any likely use of it immediately, while the very dreaded day of the 15th November comes nearer and nearer, bringing with it, as I say, almost definitely, the extinction of two big businesses, and leading to a considerable upset in the whole woollen manufactory of this State&mdash;such an upset as will not be equalised even by the granting to this <Col N="291" /> country of the complete woollen market at home?</P>
    <P>It is time that on this, as well as on these other problems, the Government made up its mind.  It has or it has not a good case, but whether it has or has not a good case it has a good chance of winning in some way or another, and it should make up its mind also to this point, that if it is going to win these moneys there is no necessity to collect them, and if it is not going to win these moneys it is impossible to put it to the people that they should pay twice: first, through taxation indirectly on goods and direct taxation on their incomes; and secondly, by the loss of trade they are going to suffer, with all that that will mean right through the country.  Why should we run the risk of five or six thousand people extra being put out of employment in this city in order to retain a sum of money which we still collect from the people?  Of course, what we are discussing here has an analogy with every other payment called into dispute which is still being collected, and which the people of the country are paying in another way. This demands something more from the Minister for Finance, who has recently been dragged across to London if it was only to hold up his leader's hands.  I wish he had not been dragged across to London because, personally, I do not believe that his leader would be sufficiently foolish to put forward any nonsense about Britain going off the gold standard if his influence was not about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am quite wrong in that I can say this, that the folly of the theory that he put up is increased by the fact that the Minister for Finance was there.  But the Minister has been there and the Minister saw the progress of these negotiations as they went on.  The Minister has probably been considering for some period just what reliance should be put on the counsel he got on one matter, and he knows, although the House does not know, who are the counsel <Col N="292" /> who have been approached in this matter, and he is probably able to form some opinion as to the reliance that should be put on them in this particular matter.  Before the House votes this money, it ought to know who is it that gave this opinion.  At any rate, it ought to know this&mdash;is it one of the same old team or is it somebody new? Have we a fresh man working on it? Is there somebody who has considered this fresh and apart from the group who considered the other matter? Have we something to go upon even, if we are going to vote this money and tighten our belts a little bit further and say: &ldquo;Nevertheless, it is coming back to us; we have some certainty of that because we know that a sound opinion has been expressed on the matter.&rdquo;  I venture to say that there is no opinion on this.  There has been no opinion looked for other than the opinion the Minister knew he was going to get.  He must have merely looked for something to back up a plan that had already been decided on, and the statement of the name, if the Minister is plucky enough to give the name at the moment, will, I think, evidence what I have said, that there has been no new approach to this problem&mdash;no new approach whatever. This is simply part of the old business. These moneys have been thrown in as a sort of make-weight, the idea being to pile up as much as you can and maybe you will get something when the final sitting down round the council table is brought about.  Certainly no good reason has been given by the Minister for asking the people for an extra £1,126,000.  Without any reason being given we have to vote this money hoping to get it back eventually.  If we are to judge from the success of the negotiations carried on already in other matters, we are not going to get it back, and we are going to be in the position of paying the money directly once, and paying indirectly at least three times the sum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would give information on this matter.  On another Vote, the Local Loans Vote, he told us that we were doing a thing which, I think the Minister will agree, is without precedent in Parliament.  We are asked to vote money for a particular purpose by the Minister who tells us that he will not devote that money to the purpose set down in the Estimate he is moving. He says that in the happy event of our not having to pay, the money will then after legislation be devoted to another purpose.  Deputy MacDermot has asked what that purpose is.  I think the Minister might say what it is.  What hope does the Minister entertain that the money he is now collecting from the taxpayers, and which we are asked to appropriate for a particular purpose will, in fact, be available for another purpose? What is his line of approach to the problem?  Is he relying on the legal opinion he has got, and which, presumably, he will make public at some particular date?  Is he relying on legal opinion?  Is he relying on convincing the other people, who have another legal opinion, that his legal opinion is correct, or is he endeavouring to retain the money for us by a process of convincing the British Government, to whom heretofore it was paid that we ought not to pay it now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all the House is being asked to vote moneys in a specific way&mdash; £1,126,000 under sub-head M&mdash;and it is entitled to know, before it gives the Minister the money, not only that he is not going to use it for the purpose for which it is voted, but is entitled to know what the Minister is going to do about retaining it.  What line is he taking?  Is he taking the legal line?  Is he relying entirely on the legal opinion he has got?  What kind of legal opinion is it?  Is it the opinion of senior counsel?  Is it the opinion of followers of the Fianna Fáil Party who first drafted the election manifesto and then drafted the legal opinion?  In other words, <Col N="294" /> is it really legal opinion, or merely political opinion which is of no more value on the legal question than say the Minister's or my own opinion?  I should like to know that.  One gathers from the Minister that he is not going to tell us.  Could he tell us now whether he is standing entirely on the legal issue, or whether he is taking what seems to us to be the better line, the practical line, and the feasible line which might bear fruit?  Certainly he asked us to give him over £1,000,000 which he is not devoting to the purpose for which it was asked.</P>
    <P>As Deputy McGilligan pointed out, the Minister's policy&mdash;it is purely an administrative question&mdash;in refusing to make the payments has involved the country in very considerable losses, and in a very considerable diminution of trade, from which we may not recover for a long period.  Surely we ought to have some indication as to the results which the Minister hopes to achieve from the sufferings and the sacrifices which, according to his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, this particular policy involves on farmers and workers.  If this payment is not going to be made, and if, as we know now, the non-payment involves us in very serious economic losses&mdash;not only transient losses for the moment, but losses that may be permanent, and that may affect us for a very long period, making recovery a matter of very great difficulty for the Minister or his successors&mdash;can he not tell us now, when he is asking for the money, what his hopes are, and on what they are based?  He has, in fact, taxed the people for this money already, while another Government which considers the money owing is also taxing them by the process open to it, so that from the point of view of the taxpayer this and the other money is, at the moment, being paid at least twice, and possibly more than twice.</P>
    <P>Is there any possibility of indicating now where that policy is leading to, and what precise case the Minister is making if he has legal opinion?  Surely since the legal opinion on the land annuities was published one would like to see this legal opinion, too.  It would be very interesting for all the people <Col N="295" /> interested in constitutional law, all interested in the Treaty, and interested in documents since then.  It is not treating the House fairly to refuse to publish the opinion.  Perhaps it is one of the things that will be published in the White Paper that we were promised yesterday.  I am not sure if it is.  It may be.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us.  In view of the hardship his policy is undoubtedly inflicting upon ordinary citizens, we would certainly like to know what the Minister's hopes are that he will actually be able to retain the money.  He said rather gaily this evening that in the happy event of retaining it the money will be devoted to something else.  But if he retains this money and loses three times as much, it will not be a happy event.  It will become an unhappy one. We would like to know what hope the Minister has that the money will be retained.  Will our ordinary trade with our nearest neighbour be allowed to go on uninterrupted and will political relations be uninterrupted?  Perhaps the Minister could tell us.  We are interested to know what are the hopes for a happy conclusion.  Without being unduly pessimistic, one has very little grounds to go on for feeling that the Minister is going to bring this thing to a happy conclusion.</P>

      <P>Oh, no.  That would be too hard on the House.  After all, for the better part of half an hour the Deputy wandered around the subject like a man in a verbal desert who had lost himself in his own tracks.  He then became so light-headed that he could not distinguish between Parliamentary authority to spend money as required and a Parliamentary gift placing as it were money in my hands at this moment.  What does the Vote mean?  The Vote means that if it be found necessary to make the payments <Col N="296" /> we have the authority of the Dáil to make them, and the Deputy who spoke more, I think, in guile than in innocence, Deputy Hayes, is as well aware of that as I am.  If these moneys are not paid they will be surrendered to the Exchequer in the ordinary way and will fall to be disposed of again by the Dáil.  I hope, next year.</P>

      <P>Yes, and I would remind the House that before the Dáil adjourned for the summer it voted a sum of two million pounds which is roughly the equivalent of this and other additional sums which are being withheld and which are being used at the present moment to counter the measures taken against us in the economic dispute which is going on. Therefore, since we have to get the two million pounds we are taking them out of the ordinary proceeds of taxation, and these moneys are thus being used.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> Deputy Hayes, I think, asked us why we were retaining these moneys.

      <P>I say, by those who are competent to advise the Government and we have no reason to doubt their advice.  Their advice is at least as sound, in regard to the R.I.C. pensions, as the <i>post factum</i> advice which the late Government got in regard to the land annuities, and which to sustain its 48 pages of bad law and worse logic had to rely upon the actual bowdlerisation and falsification of a British White Paper, and in regard to which I may say further that I did hear a certain person in Great Britain refer to as a justification for the demand which the British Government are making upon this country at the present moment.  Some person said: &ldquo;Your last Government published a White Paper to show why the Irish people should continue to pay these annuities,&rdquo; and one of them said: &ldquo;I might be prepared to come to the same conclusion, but I certainly would not be prepared to come to the same conclusion in the same way.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Yes, quite a lot. About sub-head M, not merely have we legal advice and opinion to fortify us in the action we are taking, but we do know that on the files there is a letter, written in December, 1922, stating that the disbandment of the R.I.C. was carried out entirely by the British for their own purposes.  The statement that was made here often in <Col N="298" /> this House that this was a matter of mutual agreement, of an arrangement entered into, for their mutual convenience, by the Provisional Government and the British Government, does not appear in fact to have been true.  So far as the Provisional Government was concerned it would appear that it had nothing whatsoever to do with that arrangement, and that again it was purely a matter for the convenience of the British Government to meet their view and not to meet ours.  The Royal Irish Constabulary was their force&mdash;an Imperial force &mdash; just as much as the Royal Irish Rifles, the Munster Fusiliers, or the Black and Tans, and if there were any pensions to be paid those pensions properly fell upon the British Exchequer and not upon the Irish people.</P>

He told us of the interesting things they hear people say in Great Britain. We are not disposed to treat these statements of the Minister as accurate or correct.  We find the Minister's imagination led him away from the paths of truth before.  He has erred at times.  I wonder has he ever heard from members of his own party what certain persons in Great Britain told them as to the opinion on which they were relying with regard to the land annuities, or did he ever tell anybody what went wrong during the negotiations between Great Britain, or what they said of the Free State counsel's opinions about the land annuities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought so.  We heard of a personage in Great Britain quoting law or thinking he was quoting it, and we have people in Great Britain, even friendly to the cause of the present Government, pouring scorn upon the fatuity presented as legal opinion.  If the opinion given upon this is no better than the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo; with which the other people <Col N="300" /> started on the land annuities then we are in a sorry plight over these payments. The Minister for Finance thinks that everything I have said is conceived in ignorance, because I do not know that the purpose of this Vote is that if, eventually, the Government have to make these payments they have the Dáil's authority to raise them. Why does the Minister not come here with an Estimate or a Vote for £10,000,000&mdash;for an uncertain amount to be paid on an uncertain ground to Great Britain&mdash;and then tax the people for this £10,000,000.  He does not do that because he could not make a case for the money.  What is the case to be made in order to give the Government leave to appropriate this money and to raise it by taxation.  It is because he feels they will have to make this payment to Great Britain, that the Minister is asking for the money. He feels that he has to make the payment to Great Britain, and, just as his belief is so he is bringing forward this Vote.  I put to the Minister if it was a certainty that it was going to be wiped out he would not impose this bit of taxation upon the people.  He would be laughed out of the House if he attempted to raise £1,000,000 upon tea which he described as a luxury, and which his colleague described as food.  Supposing he wanted to raise £1,000,000 on tea and told us that he was certain this money would not have to go to the source for which it was intended he would be scouted out of the House; he comes in here looking for this money because he believes it has to be paid.  There is no mistake.  He is appropriating £1,126,000 payment to Great Britain, although that may be withheld at the moment, in respect of these things, and we have to tax the people to get that and he will not promise any remission of that taxation no more than the Minister can promise the remission of the £2,000,000 of taxation which he has already promised.  This is a big sum of money.  If we were to use the famous 66 factor this would be equivalent to a British Minister coming to the British House of Commons and asking for over 66 millions for a payment which he did not think would have to be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken it, as that ridiculous factor has been brought in.  It was used mainly by the Minister &mdash;that is this 66 to 1 business.  Imagine a British Minister facing the House of Commons and saying: &ldquo;I want 66 millions but I am not going to pay it away; that is not the intention.  I have counsel's opinion which tells me that I will not have to pay but I will not give the name of the counsel, but one thing I am certain of is I will have to levy this 66 millions upon the people.&rdquo;  What would be said in reply to that demand?  Of course we know that this was only meant as a bait before the people just as the two million was.  Look what happened.  Again taking the 66 to 1 factor, the one million here would be equivalent to 66 million.  Why not take one decision and impose taxation for 300 millions that is taking the two million of promised relief which was not given and the 4½ million extra taxation, and working them out on the equivalent of 66 to 1.  Although I have taken that factor and used that factor, of course, it is in reality, the greatest nonsense. It is only what the Government have brought upon themselves and so it can be used here.  So the Minister tells us that counsel's opinion is behind him in this matter and he tells us that the people behind him are sound people. They may be mainly sound&mdash;politically sound&mdash;and not have a great deal of law.  This may cost much to the people of the country who may happen to be deluded into believing it for a time. The Minister says this is a continuation of the old taxation and in that he is right.  But he makes this difference that we are taxing now in order to save the annuities while previously we used to be taxed in order to pay.  That is what his colleague would call a &ldquo;beautiful theory.&rdquo;  We go into actual facts against that.  Are we taxing to save these payments? Does the Minister not see the facts as they hit him in the face&mdash;that the payments are in fact being made to Great Britain in a manner, which the passage of another few months will show is working greater damage than <Col N="302" /> the levying of this money in this country? Will the Minister hold a political meeting at any fair in the country and tell the people of this country that they are being saved money by what is going on now?  Will the Minister do that?</P>

      <P>Let us leave the land annuities and keep to the R.I.C. payments.  Will the Minister go to any fair that is going to be held in the next ten days and tell the people that at the moment they are being saved moneys that used to be sent to England?  Will he argue that with them?  And does he think that he will get away with his life if he tries to argue it with them?  It was good enough beforehand to say &ldquo;We are going to save this money.  Previously the money was paid over in a weak, yielding way, but now there is strength at last in the Government and we are going to retain the money.&rdquo;  Of course you can retain the moneys, but you will lose about three times as much and you are losing three times as much at present.  This is like the theories we used to have, that of course anybody who said that Britain would resort to retaliation was firstly either suggesting a course they would never take or, secondly, he was talking mere nonsense.  That was the phrase the Minister for Industry and Commerce used, but we have the fact of retaliation now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not think that at this time, facing the facts as we know them, any Minister was going to stand up and say, as the Minister said to-night, that we were taxing in order to save the payments.  Previously there was taxing in order to pay them.  We are taxing here to pay them.  If the Minister had any certainty that they were not going to be paid we would not be asked for this Vote but he has no certainty that the money is not going to be paid and hence the taxes.  He must know himself, as well as I do that much more money is being taken from the people than is represented by these taxes.  He knows certainly that a much greater amount of injury is being done to the people.  He will soon come to realise a couple of other facts and one is this, <Col N="304" /> that whereas the mere matter of a payment of £1,152,000 may be something that is difficult to meet, something that is much harder to meet is the complete destruction of your whole economic fabric and that is what is happening.  Our whole economic security is being shattered.  If it is hard enough to bear them when things are relatively prosperous how much harder is it going to be to meet these payments when our situation has gone to the bad?  We were told of course in the summer time that these payments would not be made.</P>

      <P>There has been no practice under which a Deputy is confined to one speech on the Estimates.  If the Chair is satisfied that a Deputy is wilfully wasting time, the Chair may intervene, but so far I do not think that there has been any indication of a waste of time.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, sir, that you have not come to the conclusion <Col N="305" /> that the Minister considers any speech, except one made by himself, a waste of time.</P>

      <P>The Minister has one advantage over most of us.  Need I go on to explain what it is?</P>

      <P>I am following exactly the phrase the Minister made use of, but I could not understand what he did mean by the phrase: &ldquo;So long as we are a Treaty Party we intend that the country shall get the last ounce out of the Treaty.&rdquo;  I think he did make that statement.  He did not say the last gold ounce which is a blessing because it would have been ominous to talk in that way in relation to this Vote.  &ldquo;As long as we are a Treaty Party we are determined that the country must get the last ounce out of the Treaty.&rdquo;  Is ruining the trade of the country getting the last <Col N="306" /> ounce of the Treaty?  That phrase is interesting at any rate in as much as it gets us this statement, that the Minister is at last in a Treaty Party. He is in a Treaty Party.  He has sold his Republican soul for a mess of pottage and he is not even sure that the mess of pottage gives him a good meal.</P>

      <P>What did Deputy Corry say?  He is in a maze at the moment.  The Minister is now of a Treaty Party.  I remember when he expressed himself as an unrepentant and undying&mdash;with emphasis on the &ldquo;undying&rdquo;&mdash;Republican.  He now has come over.  If he expressed himself properly in that way in London it might have been much better than talking nonsense about Britain and the gold standard.  I move to report progress.</P>
      <P>Progress reported, Committee to sit again on Friday, 21st October.</P>
