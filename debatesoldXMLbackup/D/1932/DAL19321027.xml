      <P>asked the President if he will state if there is any record of a Decree of Dáil Eireann prohibiting the payment of Land Annuities; if so, will he state the dates of its passage through Dáil Eireann and of its promulgation to the country, and if he will cause a copy of it to be placed in the Library for the information of Deputies.</P>

      <P>Is the President aware that the counsel who advised Fianna Fáil in this matter have committed themselves to the statement that &ldquo;the prohibition by Dáil Eireann of the payment of the annuities is a factor to be considered in interpreting the Treaty&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan (for Mr. D. McMenamin)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state what progress, if any, has been made since the matter was last raised in the Dáil regarding the disputed question of the ownership of the waters of Lough Foyle.</P>
      <P>Also, if there has been any approach to the Governors of the Irish Society or their lessees or otherwise with a view to determining the rights of fishery in Lough Foyle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to reply to the two questions relating to Lough Foyle together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated in my reply to questions put down by Deputy Blaney and Deputy Dillon on the 5th July, two separate and distinct issues are involved in connection with Lough Foyle (1) the claim of the lessees of the Irish Society to a several fishery in Lough Foyle, and (2) the question of jurisdiction over the waters of the Lough.  As the Deputy is aware those questions had been discussed in London during the year 1931 between officials of the Department of External Affairs and officials of the Dominions Office in London.  As I stated in my reply to the questions put down by the Deputies referred to the discussion was resumed with the Dominions Office during the month of July, 1932.  The proposal of the Government was that with a view to preserving order on the waters of Lough Foyle an interim administrative arrangement be concluded pending settlement of the fishery dispute and without prejudice to the general question of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State over the waters of the Lough.  It was hoped that that proposal would have resulted in a temporary settlement of the matter under discussion satisfactory to both Governments.  The British Government, however, made it a condition precedent to any interim arrangement that the Government of the Irish Free State should agree to arbitration by a British Commonwealth Tribunal of the legal issues involved in regard to the boundary between the Irish Free State and the United Kingdom in the Lough Foyle area. <Col N="528" /> The Government of the Irish Free State decline to submit any Treaty issue to a British Commonwealth Tribunal.  We are prepared, however, at any time to conclude a temporary arrangement on the lines already indicated.  The incidents which have been taking place in Lough Foyle during the past few years have arisen out of the attempt of the servants of the Foyle and Bann Fishery Company to enforce against Irish Free State fishermen an alleged right of several fishery which has been in dispute and has remained unlitigated in the Courts of the Irish Free State since the Irish Free State was established.  It is that disputed claim which has caused the trouble which has made the discussions which have taken place necessary.  The natural and proper course to take in the circumstances is to conclude a temporary administrative arrangement for policing and preserving order on the Lough pending the settlement of the fishery dispute.  It is wholly unnecessary to raise the general question of jurisdiction on this particular issue. The Government cannot therefore agree to that part of the British proposal which raises that question, nor, of course, could we at any time agree to the submission of an issue raised on the Treaty of 1921 to a British Commonwealth Tribunal.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been drawn to the statement appearing in the editorial of the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; of Friday last, 21st October, to the effect that some of the increase in unemployment may be due to displacements in industries hit by the economic war though these should at least be balanced by the 32,000 people who, according to the Minister, have found work through the new tariffs and whether he will state (a) the total number of (1) men, (2) women, (3) boys and (4) girls who have found work through the new tariffs; and (b) the total number of (1) men, (2) women, (3) boys and (4) girls who have lost employment in industries hit by the economic war; and (c) what the 32,000 above referred to does represent?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative. Information as to the number of additional persons employed in industries affected by recent tariff changes is being collected but is not yet complete. There is no precise information in my Department as to the number of persons displaced from employment as a consequence of the special British duties on Irish Free State products.  I am not clear what figure the Deputy refers to in the final part of his question, but it is possible he has in mind the number of vacancies filled through the medium of the Employment Exchanges which, of course, has no relation to the number of persons employed in tariffed industries.</P>

Do we understand that the Minister has not made himself aware of the statements that I refer to, which were made in the &ldquo;Press&rdquo; of the following day, again completely misrepresenting the re-statement the Minister had made?  As the misstatements were made by the Government organ on Friday, after the Minister had on Thursday attempted to clear up the situation, and in view of the complaint the Minister has already made of the confusion that has arisen, will he take some steps to see that the Government organ does not misrepresent the unemployment figures that the Minister gives?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has received representations from the Great Southern Railway Company regarding the extra annual expenditure likely to be imposed on the Company by reason of the duty imposed by the Government on British coal in the event of the railway company not being able to free themselves from the existing contracts for such purchases or not otherwise finding it possible to use other coal; and, if so, if he can state what is the amount of the extra annual expenditure involved, and whether it is intended to permit the company to import British coal, under licence, free of duty?</P>

      <P>Informal representations have been made by the Great Southern Railway Company regarding the effect of the import duty on British coal and the matter will be further discussed with representatives of the company at an early date.  The company has estimated that the additional cost involved, if duty were paid on the whole of its requirements of coal, would be approximately £52,000 per annum.  I have, however, no reason to believe that the company cannot obtain adequate supplies of suitable coal from non-British sources.</P>

      <P>I had received, up to yesterday, in all, four such reports as are referred to in the question, the meetings affected being at Waterford City, Kilmallock, Mallow and Ennis respectively.  I was further informed, this morning, that the police had information of six other similar episodes which were not thought sufficiently serious to report specially to me.  These six other incidents occurred at Cork City, Trim, Paulstown (Co. Kilkenny), Aughamore (Co. Mayo), Carrick-on-Suir, and Clonmel respectively.  Arrangements have been made to have a sufficient force of police present at any meeting where there is reason to anticipate organised opposition.</P>

      <P>In order that I might, so to speak, meet the full sense of this question, I asked the police to send me a supplementary statement. I had received, as I stated, reports of four incidents.  After getting notice of the Deputy's question, I asked the police to send me a full and comprehensive report.  In that report the other meetings to which I have alluded are mentioned.  The guards probably had not thought it necessary specially to report to me.</P>

      <P>The general duty of the police is to preserve order and to see that a lawfully constituted and lawfully assembled meeting is not interfered <Col N="540" /> with.  It is hardly necessary for me to give any special instructions in the matter.  However, arising out of this question, I have had certain communications with the police authorities and I have learned that a special force of police is to be sent, if necessary, to public meetings.  I approve of that, but I think it would have been done in any case, without consulting me.  I approve also of any prosecutions which the police may, in their discretion, think it right to institute but I do not want the House to be under the impression that the police await instructions from me before they prosecute anybody who interferes with public meetings.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister, in his desire to secure that order will be preserved at these meetings, appreciate the very bad effect on persons likely to interfere with these meetings of articles in the Press inciting persons to the breaking up of these assemblies and has he had his attention drawn to any papers in which such statements as this statement are made: &ldquo;Free speech and freedom of the Press must be denied to traitors and treasonmongers&rdquo;?

      <P>The newspapers are rather unhelpful to me in regard to these meetings.  One of the meetings I mentioned in reply to the question put by the Deputy was the meeting at Ennis, because I did gather from the police reports that persons assembled outside the Town Hall at Ennis and that the meeting was interfered with. In the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; of to-day there is a letter from one of the persons present at the meeting which states that the meeting was not interfered with&mdash;that it went on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very short.  It is addressed to the Editor of the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo;:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In reference to a report appearing in the &lsquo;Irish Independent&rsquo; that <Col N="541" /> an Army Comrades' meeting at Ennis on the 21st instant was broken up, I wish to inform the public that we had elected our officers and only left the hall when our business was finished.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The organisers of some of the meetings want to have it both ways.  They want to allege that the meetings are broken up and also to allege that they are so powerful and influential that they are able to hold their meetings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister may rest satisfied that the general daily and weekly press will cooperate in every way to preserve order at public meetings.  The question is directed to papers like the &ldquo;Phobhlacht&rdquo; which set themselves out to deny the right of free expression to people whom they call &ldquo;traitors and treason mongers.&rdquo;  Will the Minister undertake to see that incitement of that kind will not be allowed?</P>

I can state further that the Judge was so stung by the impropriety of the Government in this case that he was forced into that remark.

      <P>This Supplementary Question is astonishing.  The earliest Statute setting up a Court of Criminal Appeal in 1907 expressly reserved the prerogative of mercy, because in exercise of the prerogative of mercy every consideration is relevant.  The Minister cannot and should not be restricted by technical rules of evidence.  The Court of Criminal Appeal has no right at all to inquire into the findings of facts as the Deputy, no doubt, will recollect if he only thinks for a moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make this quite clear that on the first day I introduced this Bill I made an appeal that the passage of this Bill should wipe out all the bitterness of the past and that the past should not be discussed further.  I sat perfectly silent while Deputy Mulcahy threw a lot of mud about the situation in 1922.  I said nothing; I let it go.  Yesterday, when the Money Resolution came in, although Deputy Mulcahy threw further mud and told further untruths, all I did was to appeal to him, for the sake of the country, not to go into these things, and I gave him an opportunity to withdraw his amendments and an opportunity to do so honourably before the country.  I asked him on a plea of generosity and not hinting that I had anything to say that was discreditable to him, and I gave him an opportunity to justify himself before the country by saying he was withdrawing in order to cover over the bitternesses of the past. I ask Deputy Dillon what more could I be expected to do?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not press the Minister.  All I can say is this: The statements that were bandied between Deputy Mulcahy and the Minister distressed anybody who has a regard for the high name of this country.  Terrible things did happen in this country during the last fifteen years and I believe that every decent Irish Nationalist wants to forget them and to work for the future and not with his eyes on the past.  Surely Deputy Mulcahy and the Minister, whom I respectfully suggest are jointly responsible, should respond to the appeal and drop all this and argue the Bill on its merits?</P>

It would be better if these things were dropped and if the past were buried and I appealed to the Deputy to look to the future and not to rake up these things or compel me to do it.  I put this to the Deputy&mdash; I do not care what they say about me personally, not a rap of my fingers, as I said yesterday&mdash;but the Deputies opposite slandered comrades who fell by my side.  Am I to allow that to go down uncontroverted in the official records here without making some effort to show that the slanders were uttered by a man whose word was utterly unreliable, and who could not be trusted even by his own Cabinet?</P>

      <P>I put to the House on the Second Reading nothing but a simple, documentary statement of the authority that was behind the actions of the time in respect of which it is proposed now to give pensions to persons who received wounds.  I submit to Deputies who will take the trouble of going back over that statement that it is nothing but a pure, documentary statement that certainly should be associated with a Bill of this importance, if this House is going to treat the work it is carrying out with anything like a responsible mind at all, bearing in mind the future which Deputy Dillon asks us to bear in mind here.  We have been asked to look to the future by the Minister, and we have been asked to deal with the Bill on its merits by the Deputy.  So far as I am concerned, I am simply dealing with the merits of the case and dealing with the merits in an impersonal and documentary way.  I, too, am asking the House to look to the future, and, if the House, instead of breaking aside into some of the discursive discussions it has broken into, would take the clauses and the amendments, and say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to these, we would know where we stood.  If we are to have all kinds of semi-sentimental appeals to us not to open our eyes to this and not to open our eyes to that, the discussions here are not going to be edifying and the work we are doing here is not going to be satisfactory work.</P>

      <P>On a point of personal explanation, if Deputy Mulcahy suggests that I am making a sentimental appeal not to dig up the deeds that were done by both sides in this country during the past fifteen years, I can assure him that I am not.  I am appealing to him to spare the fair name of this country and not to give it out to the world that the actions of irresponsible and criminal men were typical of the leaders of either side in a deplorable conflict.</P>

I do not want to question the way in which these amendments had to be dealt with yesterday as a matter of order, but I think these amendments are very simple.  Very little requires to be said about them but I do submit that the House, in coming to a decision on them, ought to put itself in a responsible frame of mind.  On Amendment No. 9, I just intervened on a matter that arose last night.  If the Minister does not wish to answer, I do not want to press my question.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), page 3, lines 2-4, to delete the words &ldquo;the expression &lsquo;pre-truce military service&rsquo; means military service during any part of the period beginning on the 1st day of April, 1916, and ending on the 11th day of July, 1921.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I move this in order to get some information in view of the inadequacy of the information the Minister gave us as to who were to be entitled to pensions under this Bill and to the suggestion that some 1916 men and some men in respect of service in 1920 and 1921 would get pensions under it. My impression is that the men of these particular periods were dealt with completely in other Acts, and in filling in blanks in the explanation of the Minister I read the following extracts from the Government Press:</P>
      <P>Many refused to avail themselves of similar Acts of the late Government on the grounds that it was not being faithful to the ideal for which the lives had been given and the wounds proudly borne.  All those can feel to-day that it is a people's tribute and not a tribute of any party or section that they are being asked to accept for the noble service with which their names will always be associated.</P>

The Labour Party approaches this Bill as an attempt to provide compensation or pensions in certain cases in respect of wounds and disabilities which arose out of a very abnormal period, out of a period which I think few people want to recall, out of a period which I think most people would be glad to rub a sponge over.  We regard this measure as an attempt to provide some compensation and pension for those people the merits of whose relative positions we need not go into now, and we hope that the passage of this Bill will do something to rub the sponge, as I said, over that unhappy period.  The Labour Party's attitude to these amendments and all the other amendments is that it hopes this Bill will be passed and that all these amendments of Deputy Mulcahy will be defeated so that some compensation can be provided for those who were wounded or disabled in that unhappy period.  They hope that having made that provision for those who were wounded or disabled in that period, that the curtain may be drawn down over an unhappy period and, that the Ireland of the future will look to the future for hope and guidance instead of resurrecting the bitter recriminations and hatreds of the past.</P>

      <P>I appreciate a lot of what Deputy Norton says, but I think it really would have been more helpful to the House if we had heard him on the specific amendments.  He refers to the hope that all the amendments standing in my name will be defeated. I think it would help the House if he would wait and deal with, say, the next amendment, or deal <Col N="555" /> with those amendments which seek to secure that persons who took part in the revolt will not be paid higher pensions than the soldiers who saved our State and institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>12.  Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every application for the grant under this part of this Act of a pension or gratuity to or an allowance or gratuity in respect of a person alleged to have been a member of an organisation to which this part of the Act applies shall be accompanied by a Declaration in the form to be prescribed by the Minister and certified in such manner as the Minister shall prescribe that the applicant is not a member of an organisation which according to the law in force in Saorstát Eireann is unlawful, and the Minister shall not refer to the Registration Board any application not accompanied by such declaration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that if we are to have regard for the future as we have been asked, that it is essential that an amendment such as that would go in.  The Deputies generally are aware that there is an organisation claiming to be the same organisation, organised in the same way and claiming to have the arms that the organisation had that we are dealing with in this particular Bill, standing outside and defying in the matter of the possession of arms and in the matter of its organisation, the Oireachtas here.  It has gone even further than that and in the issue of its organ for the 15th October in a report of a speech by Mr. George <Col N="556" /> Gilmore at Ballymahon on the previous Sunday we find the following quotation: &ldquo;But the I.R.A. was an organisation that could be used as a revolutionary Army if the people who suffer under the present system of robbery and exploitation got into it and made it so and kept it so.&rdquo; Again: &ldquo;He warned them that the I.R.A., which was not an armed expression of the revolt of the oppressed classes, would be an actual danger, because it would keep the energetic, well-intentioned people busy learning to form fours while the Capitalist exploiters were taking up their new alignments and adjusting themselves to changed political conditions.&rdquo;  That is a statement by one of the principal persons in the organisation in a paper issued on the 15th October.  It is well known that the organisation boasts that it still has arms and that it still is the type of organisation that existed previously.  It has emphasised from time to time that its object is &ldquo;the abolition of the infamous Constitution,&rdquo; using for that purpose the only weapons which Pearse is misrepresented as saying were of any use in achieving freedom, that is arms.  It has made repeated and reiterated statements to the effect that &ldquo;capitalism has failed, that they must organise and rally round the hardpressed peasantry and the unemployed and starving workers.&rdquo;  It has turned its attention to the problem of partition in this country, and says they must solve it by peaceful means if possible, but if not by military methods, and in an address sent from the Army Council to the men and women of the Orange Order in July last we had the question that: &ldquo;The I.R.A. within North-East Ulster as well as in the rest of Ireland believe that the mass of the working farmers and wage earners must organise behind revolutionary leadership if they are to rescue themselves from a system within which the few prosper and the many are impoverished.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Individuals in this organisation who have been brought before the courts for the illegal possession of arms have taken up the attitude that they are soldiers of the Republic, that arms <Col N="557" /> taken from them by the police are robbed from the Republic, and one of them brought before such a court said in July last:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I am a soldier of the Republic and I cannot recognise the right of the court to try me on a charge of having those arms.  They are the property of the Republican Army and have been stolen.</P>
    <P>All through the country everything that is possible has been done to stir up every element of disorder, to put the mantle of the Irish Republican Army of old and of Pearse around men who take arms into their hands and to invite them as the only possible way of solving the problems of the people, of solving problems dealing with the organisation of capital and of industry, to produce the rifle, the revolver and the bomb.  While that is so I submit that any person wishing to make use of the provisions of this particular Bill ought, in asking the people of the country to pension him in respect of previous happenings, to give an undertaking to the people that he is not a member of one of the illegal organisations that are operating in the way I have stated just now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all this Bill relates only to pensions for wounds or disability arising out of services up to 1923.  That answers that part of the speech of the Deputy.  Furthermore, I wish again to point out that the Deputy had an opportunity on this Bill, seeing that it was an extension of the Acts of 1923 and 1927, to put forward an amendment asking the Dáil not to give pensions to certain persons, but strangely he did not avail himself of that opportunity to extend the prohibition which he wished to put in the way of the men whom we wish to pension here, and to put the same prohibition in the way of other people whom he and his Party pensioned in the past.  Not alone was this amendment which the Deputy wished to have included in this Bill not included in former Bills, but sections were inserted in the Act which are diametrically opposed to the spirit of the amendment itself if we take it at its face value.  In the Military Service Pensions Act of 1924, Section 2, we find the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="558" /> Any person to whom this Act applies may within the prescribed period apply in the prescribed form to the Minister, and the Minister may grant to him, subject to the provisions of this Act, a certificate of military service.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say in sub-section (3):&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Minister may in his absolute discretion refuse to issue a certificate of military service to any applicant who shall have, prior to the making of the reports by the Board of Assessors, been sentenced by a Court of competent jurisdiction in Saorstát Eireann to suffer imprisonment with or without hard labour for any term exceeding three months or any term of penal servitude.</P>
    <P>That Act did not, as the House will see, propose to debar people who had suffered terms of three months' imprisonment or any term of penal servitude, altogether from the receipt of pensions.  It left it in the discretion of the Minister whether people who were convicted criminals should get pensions or not and of course there was no such thing as debarring them completely.  That refers to convicted criminals.  Much further was it from the Deputy's mind to debar people who were not convicted criminals but whom he knew to be criminals.  The next point that arises on this is, will the Deputy give the House a guarantee that he is not a member of an illegal organisation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, surely, but I wonder how much reliance can the House place on it in accepting it.  Is the House to put as much reliance on it as the ex-Minister's colleagues in the Cabinet put on it?  The late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins, in his report to the Investigation Committee, <Col N="559" /> the Army Committee of Inquiry set up by this Dáil, showed that he had not much reliance on his ex-colleague, Deputy Mulcahy, in the Cabinet.  Reporting to this Commission of Inquiry set up by the Dáil, about the existence of groups, combinations or societies in the Army he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Early in 1923 I heard reliably that officers, specially selected, were summoned from various parts of the country and sat in Portobello under the chairmanship of Seán O'M., then assistant Adjutant-General, to consider the resurrection or the reorganisation of the Irish Republican Brotherhood.  I made the assertion at the meeting of the Executive Council shortly after that, and it was denied by the Minister for Defence (Deputy Mulcahy), who also denied an assertion by me that the Headquarters staff of the Army were practically the &ldquo;inner&rdquo; or &ldquo;upper&rdquo; circle of a secret society.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, we have now the Minister reading from a Departmental file.  He refers to a statement which the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins made at a meeting of the Executive Council.  I understand that the proceedings of the Executive Council are confidential.  It would seem that the contents, therefore, of the file are confidential, and I would ask if it is in order to publish the contents of a confidential file.</P>

      <P>On the question of quotations from documents, the Chair cannot prevent the Minister from <Col N="560" /> making his case in his own way. Quotation is a commonplace in speech-making. As regards quotations from official documents, if a Minister quotes from an official document he may be asked by a Deputy to lay such document on the Table of the House, if it is not already available to Deputies. To such a request the Minister might plead that it would not be in the public interest to publish the document. If the Minister, when so requested, declines to have the papers laid on the Table of the House, he should not quote further from such document, as he might then be accused of making an ex parte statement, using partial quotation to suit his own purpose.  That is the position.</P>

As to the whole matter of using in a speech documents relating to the inner history of the Civil War period, I can only repeat what my predecessor said more than once in this House&mdash; that the worst possible Tribunal to judge the history of the period from 1922 to 1923 is this House, on all sides of which are Deputies who were active participants in that conflict.</P>

Mr. O'Higgins, as I was trying to say before, said: &ldquo;I made the assertion at a meeting of the Executive Council shortly after and it was denied by the Minister for Defence (Mulcahy), who also denied an assertion by me that Headquarters Staff of the Army were practically the inner or upper circle of a secret society.  I still believe that a series of meetings with that object were, in fact, held in Portobello in the first six months of 1923.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It will be noted there by the House that Deputy Mulcahy denies that he is a member of the I.R.B.  Are we to take it that he regards the I.R.B. as an illegal organisation?</P>

      <P>I think it was the month of June of 1923 when the Minister for Defence (Deputy Mulcahy) asked me would I be willing to meet himself, Seán O'M. and Seán MacM. to hear their views about the I.R.B. organisation, intimating that he intended asking the President and John MacNeill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This matter that we are discussing is most important, and I am prepared to show the relevance of it. I indicated the relevance already.  The Deputy did not deny that he was a member of an illegal organisation, but now he wants to prohibit people who are members of illegal organisations from getting pensions.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is good!  The late Mr. O'Higgins was invited by Deputy Mulcahy to attend a meeting consisting of Seán O'M. and Seán MacM. to hear their views about the I.R.B. organisation. It was intimated by Deputy Mulcahy, who was then Minister for Defence, that he intended asking the then President, Deputy Cosgrave, and John MacNeill.  The document proceeds:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I replied that I did not wish to leave him under any misapprehensions; that though I was a member of the I.R.B. in pre-Treaty days I had the strongest possible objection to it or to any other secret society in the altered condition of things: that I believed an organisation of that nature would be bad for the Army and for the country.  The Minister for Defence stated that <Col N="566" /> while fully appreciating my position he would nevertheless be glad if I were to attend the proposed meeting. About a week later a meeting took place in the President's room.  There were present the President, (Deputy Cosgrave), Dr. MacNeill, the Minister for Defence, Seán MacM. in mufti, Seán O'M. in mufti, and myself. Seán O'M. introduced the subject of reorganising the I.R.B. within the Army, assuring us that it would not injure discipline or efficiency, and in particular, would never be allowed to interfere with the proper allegiance of the Army to the present or any future Government.  He stated that the Constitution had been adjusted to meet the altered situation.  The Minister for Defence (Deputy Mulcahy), who had denied all knowledge a few days previously spoke in a similar strain, stating that the real idea was to keep the I.R.B. from falling into the hands of the Irregulars or other irresponsible people and to enable them the better to control the restive elements within our own ranks.</P>
    <P>His colleagues on the Executive Council did not know from day to day whether Deputy Mulcahy was or was not a member of an illegal organisation. The Deputy asked me a very pertinent question.  He asked me when was the I.R.B. made an illegal organisation.  I said I would like to know, because while he was killing people for being members of illegal organisations he was running this particular pet illegal organisation of his own.  Quoting from his own evidence before the Army Committee of Inquiry, I see where he said:</P>
    <P>The Committee will understand that the I.R.B. has been, and is a secret society, and there are, therefore, confidences that I must keep.</P>
    <P>I wonder was the Deputy keeping a confidence to-day when he denied that he is a member of the I.R.B?  He does not say.  Even if he did we would not know.  In the course of further evidence he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>What I had to say publicly with regard to the acceptance of the Treaty I said on the 22nd December, 1921, in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="567" /> I wonder what he had to say privately.  He said further:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I did not after that suggest or recommend or feel that the I.R.B. should be scrapped.  It was not scrapped.  Its existence was and is continuous.</P>
    <P>That was stated to the Army Inquiry Committee on 12th May, 1924.  The Deputy said that the I.R.B. was and is continuous.  Is it continuing now? Is the Deputy a member of it?  Does he want it cut out from all pensions? If so, why did he not in this extension of the Pensions Act include a clause prohibiting secret societies?  It is easy to see what the Deputy's idea is of the uses of the I.R.B.  &ldquo;It was essential,&rdquo; he said, on June 7th, 1923, &ldquo;that they should control its moulding and development at the present time from the point of view of giving its policy a constructive and unarmed revolutionary turn.&rdquo;  It is arranged in a most peculiar way here.  We have the letters &ldquo;un,&rdquo; then a bracket, then the word &ldquo;armed&rdquo; and then another bracket.  There seems to be a question about the armed part of the business. It is really most peculiar to have a revolutionary organisation unarmed, particularly as the Minister for Finance says, to have a revolutionary body, within an Army, unarmed.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's pet organisation was to have a policy which was constructive and of a &ldquo;revolutionary turn.&rdquo;&ldquo;It is continuous,&rdquo; he said on May 12th, 1924.  When did they discontinue it?  If he gives us the date, can we rely on his word?  Can we rely on it any more than his colleague could rely on it when the Deputy denied any knowledge of its existence and three or four days afterwards invited the same gentleman to a meeting of the I.R.B.?  Again he said at the same inquiry: &ldquo;In the interests of the State&rdquo;&mdash;Cumann na nGaedheal always had a peculiar idea of the State; they were the State; so we might put it &ldquo;in the interests of themselves&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;certain Army officers with I.R.B. associations did not refrain from taking part in or giving guidance in matters affecting the organisation.  Apprised of their <Col N="568" /> position three other Ministers did see at least some reason for the position and they did not forbid it.&rdquo;  One of the Ministers, it is interesting to note, who was apprised of the position and did not forbid it was Deputy Cosgrave.</P>
    <P>What sort of organisation was this of which they were apprised, which was continuous on 12th May, 1924, and which they did not forbid within the armed forces of the State?  The objects of the I.R.B. are fairly well known.  The first is &ldquo;To establish and maintain a free and independent republican Government in Ireland.&rdquo; The second is: &ldquo;The I.R.B. shall do its utmost to train and equip its members as a military body for the purpose of securing the independence of Ireland by force of arms.  It shall secure the co-operation of all Irish military bodies in the accomplishment of its objects.&rdquo;  Again &ldquo;The Supreme Council of the I.R.B. is hereby declared in fact as well as by right the sole Government of the Irish Republic. Its enactments shall be the laws of the Irish Republic until Ireland secures absolute national independence and a permanent Republican Government be established.&rdquo;  In May, 1924, when the Deputy swore that the I.R.B. was in existence there was no permanent Government of the Irish Republic established.  He had disestablished it by force of arms and suppressed its courts by force of arms.  He had suppressed its Dáil which was to meet on the 13th June, 1922, and never did meet and was substituted by another Dáil summoned three months later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am adverting to the illegality or legality of this organisation which the Deputy maintained within the army, members of which are now drawing pensions from the State.  The Deputy in his amendment wants to forbid members of all illegal organisations from drawing pensions &mdash;wants to forbid certain people belonging to certain illegal organisations. &ldquo;The I.R.B. Supreme Council shall have power to levy taxes, raise <Col N="569" /> loans, make war and peace, negotiate and ratify treaties with foreign powers, and all other acts necessary for the protection and government of the Irish Republic.&rdquo;  Again &ldquo;The Supreme Council shall have power to appoint a secret court for the trial of any member or members charged with the commission of treason or grave misdemeanours.  The Supreme Council alone shall have power to inflict the sentence of capital punishment and to give it effect.&rdquo;  The late Deputy O'Higgins in his evidence stated that he at one time was a member of the I.R.B.  Was he tried by a secret court? Who was the president of the court and who carried it out?  Does the Deputy want his murderers to be excluded from getting pensions?  Does the Deputy want us to think that he did not profit enough by their act to wish to see them fairly well looked after?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no real purpose behind this amendment other than to stir up bitterness.  The Deputy and his colleagues always wanted the bitterness on one side.  They wanted to do all the kicking.  They gave no quarter and they whined when cornered. There are plenty of powers within the Bill in the section which forbids the giving of a pension to any man tried and sentenced by a court of competent jurisdiction set up by the Dáil.  That is all that any fair-minded man will ask for.  It is impossible to guard against illegal organisations such as that run by Deputy Mulcahy and very early I realised it.  When Deputy Mulcahy and a few of the other exMinisters were organising the I.R.B. within the Free State Army I squashed it within the I.R.A.  An effort to reorganise the I.R.B. inside the I.R.A. was put down by me and by the Executive of the I.R.A.  But an effort to reorganise the I.R.B. was fostered by Deputy Mulcahy and his colleagues of the Executive Council. The people after all have a right to know exactly the amount of reliance that can be placed upon the word of some of the men opposite.  I was quite prepared to leave the matter to the future, provided I could deal fairly decently with some of the women who <Col N="570" /> were made widows by Deputy Mulcahy; provided I could deal fairly decently with some of the mothers who were left without a son by him; provided I could deal fairly decently with children who were left fatherless by him.  That is our intention in the Bill, and again I repeat that I hope the Dáil will pass it.</P>

      <P>I pointed out to the House the type of organisation. The attitude they took up with regard to arms, with regard to the Courts and to the institutions of the State is known.  The Minister's obvious intention is that persons, even though they belong to an organisation such as that, may have the benefit of the pensions provided for in this Bill and paid for by the taxpayers.  I submit that if it were at all possible in a matter so important as this we might have an adjournment of the Dáil to enable the Leader of the Labour Party to attend. I drew his attention to the fact when he spoke a short time ago on the general amendments, that there was this amendment.</P>

It is not proposed, although this Bill is wide enough to have enabled the Deputy to do so, to prohibit the particular group of people who are drawing pensions under the 1923 and 1927 Acts or the Military Service Pensions Act of 1924 from being members of illegal organisations.  Why?  I would like the Deputy to answer.</P>

      <P>With regard to the amendments introduced by Deputy Mulcahy, I would like to say that I agree with the statement of the Minister that they had not been introduced in good faith or in a helpful spirit.  On a previous Pension Act passed in this House, persons who committed many of the acts that Deputy Mulcahy objects to now, and did many of the things set down in the Deputy's amendment, things which should prohibit them from getting pensions, did succeed in getting pensions.  I have in mind one particular individual.</P>

      <P>I do not want to refer to them at all except that there was a particular individual who was known generally, and known to Deputy Mulcahy. He was acting on the instructions of his superior officer.  He was a very active member of the Republican Forces during 1923 and 1924, and on instructions took money from banks during that period.  On instructions, too, he destroyed part of a railway and a train engine during that period. On instructions he took clothing from shops.  That individual did all that, as a member of what Deputy Mulcahy now holds is an illegal association, and yet that individual was given a pension by Deputy Mulcahy.  Why does the Deputy come along now with his attempt to prohibit individuals who acted in a similar capacity from getting pensions?  If Deputy Mulcahy questions my facts I can give the name of the individual.</P>

      <P>There is a general principle running through some of these amendments.  Take amendment 13.  The proposal there is that instead of the rates of pensions proposed in the schedule as the rates of pensions and gratuities in the first and second schedule of the Bill, the rates and pensions in respect of soldiers in the 1927 Act would apply.  As this schedule stands, at present, the proposal is to grant to persons, to whom this Act applies, pensions greater by 50 per cent. than the pensions under the provisions of the Wounds and Disability Act allowed to soldiers who had been in the service of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept this amendment.  We have definitely stated that the pensions created and the general scale of pensions is 25 per cent. higher than that of soldiers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also 25 per cent. less than were granted to officers under previous Acts.  We went on the principle which is carried out in the United States and other countries in relation to Volunteer Armies, that is, for men who volunteered for a particular war in times of emergency. There is not the same distinction as between officers and men in the Regular Army.  Under the American pensions scheme there is a flat rate for all who served for a particular war or national emergency as volunteers irrespective of whether they served as officers or men.  We have adopted that principle, because we think it a good one.  While it gives to some of the pensioners a higher rate than they would be entitled to under other Acts, to others it gives less than they would be entitled to. Generally, I think this scheme should have been adopted under both of the other Acts.  However, it would cause hardship if we were at this time to review the whole situation and to amend the other Acts in order to bring them into conformity with the scheme proposed here.  We have simply faced the situation, and decided that a flat rate will be given to all who served.  That rate is three-quarters of the amount given to officers and dependents of officers under the two previous Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In a previous measure this House differentiated between the position of soldiers and of officers.  I think that was a very reasonable frame of mind for the House to adopt.  There is a different degree of responsibility, and there are other factors operating in the matter.  No new principle that the Minister might come across and want to set up should induce this House to grant higher <Col N="578" /> pensions to those who fought against the institution of the State in the way that has been described here, than to soldiers who preserved these institutions.</P>

      <P>The men who will get pensions under this scheme did not fight against the institutions set up by the Irish people.  They fought for them, and fought without pay.  They did not expect and did not ask for pensions.  We are not giving any ablebodied men pensions.  We are not granting pensions to all the relatives of wounded men, but to relatives who were dependent upon those who were killed.  These are the people we speak for, unlike the Deputy who got a special Act of Parliament passed in order that he might draw his full pension&mdash;not for a wound and not for disease arising out of service.  All we ask is that those who were wounded should be properly looked after; that those who contracted disease should be properly looked after; and that the people who were dependent for their daily bread on those who were killed should be properly looked after for the rest of their lives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

They did not serve for a few months with pay&mdash;like certain cases in which pensions have been granted&mdash;but served seven or eight years, and some of them ten years, without pay.</P>

In these cases the relatives of some of these men got into debt in providing hospital treatment for them.  Perhaps they had to nurse them for five or six years.

I pointed out the general circumstances in which I considered that amendment No. 12 should be accepted, and I said, then, that I had in the end given up any hope of getting the Minister to see my point of view, but I suggest that the House on an important matter like that might expect to hear from the Labour Benches, and I just refer very briefly to what I said on the previous amendment.  I pointed out that, as the members of the Labour Party know, there is an organisation in this country, having arms, claiming to be the legitimate successor of the men who are being dealt with in this Bill who revolted against the State in 1922 and 1923, and that they have taken on a very wide front of problems to solve&mdash;the problem of the Boundary, unemployment and capitalism and the destruction of the present Constitution of this country, and the putting of a new one in its place; and that, when brought before the courts in this country on a charge of illegal possession of arms the attitude is as shown in this typical example where a person, charged in the courts on 9th July last in respect of having illegally a rifle, two small arms and some ammunition, declared:</P>
    <P>I am a soldier of the Republic and I cannot recognise the right of this court to try me on a charge of having those arms.  They are the property <Col N="587" /> of the Republican Army and have been stolen.</P>
    <P>They reiterate from time to time that there is really only one means by which some of our problems may be solved&mdash; that is, arms&mdash;and they claim the guidance of Padraig Pearse in their philosophy in this matter.  A quotation from one of them, speaking at Ballymahon, on 15th October, is as follows:</P>
    <P>The I.R.A. was an organisation that could be used as a revolutionary army if the people who suffer under the present system of robbery and exploitation got into it and made it so and kept it so.</P>
    <P>And again he warns his hearers that:</P>
    <P>An I.R.A. which was not the armed expression of the revolt of the oppressed classes would be an actual danger, because it would keep the energetic, well-intentioned people busy learning to form fours while the capitalist exploiters were taking up their new alignments and adjusting themselves to changing political conditions.</P>
    <P>I urge the House, and I particularly ask the attention of the members of the Labour Party in the House, who have not addressed themselves to this question while the Bill has been before the House, that, in the circumstances in which they find themselves, with the lessons of the past that are being under-lined and marked and paid for in this Bill, it is asking too much of this House to ask it to tax the people for the provision of pensions to persons who may then join an organisation like this, and, with the very same weapons, and the very same tactics, proceed, as they intend to proceed, to the destruction of these institutions and the destruction of this State.  I submit that that is asking too much and that this amendment should pass.</P>

      <P>Only that I am very well aware that the Deputy is as dull and stupid as he can be, I would be amazed at this amendment he proposes, because only someone as dull and as stupid as he is would take responsibility for it.  I would advise the Deputy to get some friend of his to examine, <Col N="588" /> in future, amendments which the enemy, who handed these amendments into his hand, suggests to him. Of all the amazing things!  The suggested amendment reads:</P>
      <P>Before Section 21, but in Part II of the Bill to insert a new section&mdash;&mdash; excluding all members of illegal organisations from getting pensions.  Note the words, &ldquo;but in Part II of the Bill.&rdquo;  Part II alludes to certain organisations who fought for the State institutions here in the civil war. Part III of the Bill extends the benefits of the Acts of 1923 and 1927 to the section which fought against the institutions with Deputy Mulcahy and others, and the Deputy wants the House to adopt bare-facedly and unashamedly this new principle of law, that a certain section may be as illegal as they please and draw their pensions, but another section, to which the Deputy objects, may not draw their pensions if they are against the law.  He has the stupidity to ask the Labour Party to vote for an amendment like that.  As a matter of fact, anybody who is found guilty of contravening the law by a court of competent jurisdiction will automatically be suspended, because we have adopted, out of the 1927 Act, certain powers that will enable the Minister to withdraw pensions from people who are found guilty of breaches of the law.  To show that this amendment is not just a sudden brainwave of some genious of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party but that it is definite, laid-down policy, I want to quote&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to quote from the Military Service Pensions Act of 1924, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may in his absolute discretion refuse to issue a certificate of military service to any applicant who shall have, prior to the making of the report by the board of assessors, been sentenced by a court of competent jurisdiction in Saorstát Eireann to suffer imprisonment with or without hard labour for any term exceeding three months or any term of penal servitude. <Col N="589" /> There it was left to the discretion of the Minister&mdash;&ldquo;may in his absolute discretion&rdquo;&mdash;to grant or refuse a certificate of military service, for the purpose of drawing a pension, even though the applicant were found guilty.  The Deputy wants to have one law for one section.  One section of military service pensioners like himself may break the law, may be found guilty by a court, may be members of an illegal organisation but may still draw the pension. Only one as dull and stupid as the Deputy would have the temerity to table such an amendment.  He is the &ldquo;softy&rdquo; of the Cumann na nGaedheal family all right.  The Deputy wants to exclude a certain section of the country from being members of an illegal organisation.  &ldquo;If they are found guilty by a court of competent jurisdiction to be members of an illegal organisation.&rdquo;  Now, the Deputy was found guilty by a very competent court of being a member of an unlawful organisation, by a jury of twelve,&mdash;not by a jury of twelve who knew nothing about him, that would be picked from a list of jurymen who would come to a court, but by a jury of twelve men who knew him intimately for four or five years, and they found him guilty of being a member of an unlawful organisation, and refused to have anything further to do with him.  They kicked him out and still he got a pension, but it is only he and his private gunmen who can shoot and rob and loot if they please and still draw their pensions. No one else may.  That is the principle that the Deputy wants the Dáil to accept.  I will have none of it, anyway.</P>

      <P>Quite apart from the case made by the Minister as to the uneven incidence of the amendment which Deputy Mulcahy has moved, I want to deal with another aspect of the matter referred to by him.  I cannot help thinking that Deputy Mulcahy is one gentleman who lives but does not learn.  What is the purpose of this amendment?  I can only see it in the same light as many of the other amendments, as a resurrection of the bitter hatreds and passions of the Civil War period.  The House yesterday evening and again this evening has <Col N="590" /> been brought back to a very unhappy period, and this amendment which Deputy Mulcahy has submitted is not so much for the purpose of securing administrative perfection, is not for the purpose of securing legislative tidiness even, but solely for the purpose of dealing with this whole issue in the same way as many of his other amendments have done.  Yesterday and to-day Deputy Mulcahy had a glorious opportunity of showing that he for one was prepared to forgive and forget and to rub the sponge over that whole period, but Deputy Mulcahy instead has chosen to resurrect, in the bitterest possible language, the unhappy memories of a period which everyone wants to think of just as an evil memory.  He wants to know, again with the same excessive sense of tidiness, where does the Labour Party stand in relation to this amendment. I have already said this evening, and I repeat it here now, that I regard this whole Bill as an attempt&mdash;perhaps not a perfect attempt, but as some attempt at all events&mdash;to rub the sponge over that whole period, to draw down the curtain and shut away from our memories all the bitterness and the hatreds and the passions that that period produced.  Deputy Mulcahy may well leave the excessive sense of tidiness alone, and may well look at this whole Bill as something that may help to flood out the memories which every patriotic Irishman and woman will seek to forget at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Resolution has been moved without explanation.  I should like to find out from the Minister what is his best estimate of the expenditure that is likely to be incurred under this Bill.  Under the measure the Minister has power to set up a Commission.  This is to be composed of five ordinary members, defined in various ways.  Thereafter in Section 9 the Minister is given power to appoint &ldquo;such and so many persons (not being ordinary members) to act as additional members of the Commission as he thinks fit.&rdquo;  Later, under Section 11 &ldquo;any member of the Commission may, if the Minister for Finance so directs, be paid such remuneration and allowances as the said Minister shall determine.&rdquo;  Further, the Minister is given power in Section 14, in fact he is ordered, to appoint a person &ldquo;to be known and styled as the Controller of Prices.&rdquo; That Controller is to hold office &ldquo;upon such terms and be remunerated at such rates and in such manner as the Minister for Finance shall direct.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Section 15 permission is given to the Minister to appoint &ldquo;such and so many persons as he shall consider necessary to be officers of the Commission and such persons shall hold office upon such terms and be remunerated at such rates and in such manner as the Minister for Finance shall direct.&rdquo;  There may also arise expenditure under the powers of the <Col N="595" /> Commission to summon witnesses. Again the Commission is empowered to certify offences which would lead to an appearance in court. There is a further provision whereby the Commission must give notice of the making of an investigation, to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and &ldquo;in such other manner as the Commission may think suitable.&rdquo;  That would be presumably by advertisement in the daily Press.  These are the sections which relate most specifically to the expenditure which may be incurred under the Act.  There are other things also, such as complaints made by inspectors, the reference of these complaints in various ways and certain outcome of these complaints. Various proceedings may take place under certain sections.</P>
    <P>To understand properly the Money Resolution, it would be a good thing to have an indication from the Minister how many salaried members he intends to appoint, and if he has in mind any salary at which he will appoint these people, also whether it is his intention to appoint a civil servant as Controller or to appoint an outside person.  If he is to be a civil servant we should like to know if he is to get extra remuneration, because it may be contended that he will be doing something in addition to his ordinary duties as a civil servant.  Of course, if an outside person is appointed clearly that person must be remunerated.  I am assuming all the time that the Inspectors will be the civil servants, Trade Board Inspectors and such Inspectors as are under the control of the Department of Agriculture, and that they will carry out the work as part of their official duties.  It may also lead to certain expenditure in the way of outdoor allowances, because these officials will occasionally be kept away from their homes in a manner that would not be entailed by their normal duties.  Consequently that will be part of the expense. There may be some approximate estimate of the financial sacrifices the State will have to make in order to have the provisions of the Bill carried out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not easy to make anything like an approximate estimate <Col N="596" /> of the cost to the State of the operation of the Bill.  The Deputy has, I think, fairly enumerated the various headings under which cost is likely to arise. There are first the members of the Commission, their travelling and subsistence allowances, and possibly the payment of part-time remuneration.</P>
      <P>We hope that we shall be able to get people of the right calibre to come to the Commission without any remuneration, but that may not be found to be practicable.  In that case some part-time remuneration will arise to be paid. There are also the salaries of the Controller and his staff.  The intention is that these should be members of the Civil Service, and the cost that would arise under that heading might be off-set by reductions in other quarters. There are then the salaries and expenses of the Inspectors to be appointed under the Act.  It is much more difficult to estimate what cost is likely to arise there.  It will depend very largely on the extent to which complaints arise, and in which inspectorial work has to be carried out. The intention there also is that civil servants will be utilised for that work. There is also the cost of legal proceedings, of printing and advertising, etc. A rough estimate of the cost would be something about £4,000.</P>

I take that to mean that he decided at last to do what Deputy Dillon appealed to him to do some time in the month of May, to let the cat out of the bag, and announce that tariffs mean an increase in prices.  I think that that is the only interpretation his words&mdash;&ldquo;natural corollary of a tariff policy&rdquo;&mdash;can mean.  When you take away the ordinary impact of competition from outside you have no way of checking that and, accordingly, you have to introduce these tariffs.  Not only have we commodities which would be liable to duties on importation into the Saorstát, but you have them also prohibited or restricted by law.  I thought that even the Ministry, which is between protection and prohibition, founded its theories on this&mdash;that by protection you protected a commodity which is in an infant state of production, and you tried by some artificial means such as this to check it, but that as regards prohibition you would only go for it when you were certain your home producers were able to meet the demand of the home consumer. This is much more than a drafting amendment and it indicates very clearly the mentality of the Ministry&mdash; that they are going to go for prohibition even if they have such circumstances <Col N="599" /> as, for instance, obtains for the moment in regard to the shirt making industry where there is such definite over-production at home beyond the demand that there is not the rivalry of business in the ordinary way.</P>
      <P>It is something more than a tariff policy.  It is a corollary which is not natural to a prohibition policy, because if prohibition were going to operate in a sane and sensible way, it would only operate in such a way as to meet the home demand.  If not, this is opening up a new vista to us.  It opens up quite an amount of extra work under this Bill, and it opens up a very peculiar prospect for us with regard to what the Minister intends to do even though the home producer is not able to meet the entire demand at home.  I suggest to the Minister to leave this out.  Let us keep the control of prices for whatever it is worth on commodities that are subject to protection, but let us not have this check in the background upon which the Minister can lean by saying &ldquo;Well, I will introduce complete prohibition,&rdquo; even though the manufacturer is not able to meet the home demand.  It is going to be used by the Ministry in the future to make it easier for themselves to prohibit in cases where they dare not prohibit the importation if this did not exist.</P>

      <P>The ordinary definition of a protected commodity is not that of the Deputy.  One method of protection is by restricting importation, the most commonly adopted throughout Europe at the present time.  This is in fact only a drafting amendment. It merely says to add after the word &ldquo;duty&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or a commodity the importation of which into Saorstát Eireann is prohibited or restricted by law.&rdquo;  It is designed to secure that there will not be a loophole in the event of certain contingencies arising in the future.  Such a contingency arises at the moment in relation to particular commodities like flour.  A Bill has just been passed which prohibits the importation of flour except subject to certain limits allowed.  It is done by quantitative restriction.  The intention definitely is to secure the <Col N="600" /> operation of control, where necessary, in relation to a protected commodity no matter in what form that protection was applied.  I deny that tariffs mean a rise in prices.  Some tariffs mean a fall in prices.  Some tariffs mean a rise and are put on for that purpose. In a country like ours, where the number of producers is definitely limited, there is always a possibility of profiteering. That is not a necessary result of a tariff policy&mdash;it is the result of the individuals concerned&mdash;and this Bill is designed to ensure that the interests of consumers will not be prejudiced in that way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only objecting to the two words &ldquo;prohibited or&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;restricted&rdquo; is enough, because you have got to get that in if you are to close all the gaps.  I may take the example that the Minister has given&mdash;flour.  It is true that the flour measure in its form appears to be a prohibition measure, and is sometimes talked of in that way.  Everybody knows from the Minister's own statement before the House in the last session that it is not prohibition, nor will it be for many years to come, and there is no hope of it.  It is prohibition with the loophole of a licence, because for a long time to come you will need to import certain quantities of flour.  That is restriction, and that ought to be covered and will be covered if the word &ldquo;prohibition&rdquo; is left out.  I want to know the set of circumstances in which the Minister thinks he will have to have control of prices in a commodity over which he thinks he will have to have complete prohibition.  Will it ever advance to that position?  I think it is clear to him that at the moment the home manufacturer can supply and more than supply the demand at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot imagine a case in which there will be complete prohibition without the Minister being clearly and definitely assured that the capacity of the home manufacture is sufficient to meet the entire home demand.  If that is capable of meeting it, then there is going to be no necessity for control of prices except in the one case of rings, and these can be got after in <Col N="601" /> another way.  Will the Minister give us an indication, even a possibility&mdash;I do not care how vague, how approximate, the estimate may be&mdash;of some commodity that he thinks he may hereafter find it necessary to prohibit, without there being some circumstances which would by themselves keep down prices regardless of this check?  I cannot see them.  I grant that this expression has to be enlarged so as to bring in a commodity the importation of which is restricted by law.  You have a positive restriction of law, but goods may be imported under some system of licensing or quota.  I really cannot see how this is required.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon says that the alternative to this Bill is to publish the facts.  What facts?  Where are we going to get the facts?  What has this Bill been introduced for?  What is the function of the Commission to be established under this Bill but to get the facts and publish them?</P>
      <P>I replied that I would not bother to answer that point.  The Minister proceeded blandly to say that he did not know whether or not there was any profiteering at all.  The one thing he was certain of was that tariffs did not raise the cost of living.  Nevertheless, he moved a Financial Resolution here, when the people of the country are put to the pin of their collar to make ends meet, to provide money to pay a staff to inquire into an abuse the very existence of which he is not satisfied of.  I did not wish to interrupt the Minister while he was winding up the debate on an earlier stage.  Of course, if he has any grounds for believing that there is profiteering, or if he believes that some of his allies are apprehensive about profiteering, let him first establish the fact that there is evidence of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing now with the power the Minister seeks to schedule any and every commodity for the purpose of ascertaining if there is profiteering in that commodity.  I will point out that to go to great expense with that end in view is a futile procedure unless the Minister has some grounds for believing that the abuse of profiteering is in existence.  I suggest that to take these powers is futile, and I repeat what I said on an earlier stage, that it is done merely for the purpose of saving the face of the Labour Party.  If the Minister really believes there is profiteering in particular commodities, the sensible thing to do would be to hold an inquiry.  If the Minister is satisfied that there is any profiteering or any rise in the cost of living, that is the procedure he should adopt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He says he has no grounds for believing that there is profiteering, and he seems satisfied that tariffs have not resulted in any rise in the cost of <Col N="604" /> living.  Then, what on earth will all this expense bring us?  We are being asked to give the Minister certain powers; we are being asked to provide this staff which he tells us now is not going to cost anything.  He told us on an earlier occasion that tariffs would not mean any rise in the cost of living.  I fancy that before we are finished with this Commission there will be more £500 jobs and more £1,000 jobs and there will be a very large number of inspectors.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a limited scope. The section then goes on to say: &ldquo;Any other commodity which is by order of the Executive Council made under this <Col N="606" /> section declared to be a scheduled commodity for the purposes of this Act.&rdquo; I submit that to give the Executive Council powers of that character under the Bill is calculated to saddle the country with an expensive Commission, which can go roving all over the commercial life of the country and make itself a public nuisance.  I point out to the Minister that before he should dream of seeking such powers as these he should satisfy himself that there is general profiteering going on, or that there is a general rise in the cost of living.  He has repeatedly denied that there is any rise in the cost of living. He has himself disclaimed any responsibility for the suggestion that there is profiteering on a large scale or on an abnormal scale.  Yet, he arrives in here and seeks these enormously wide powers which are going to involve us in boundless cost; not the powers sought under the principle of the Bill, which are to inquire, as I suggest, into certain specified prices anticipated in the schedule, but into all prices prevailing in the Free State.  It may be that you take the view and that the Dáil takes the view that once the principle of the Bill is accepted that gave the Minister a roving commission to poke his nose into every shop, every factory and every industry in the country. If it did that the Minister, I think, stole a march upon us.  I think it is well that the Dáil should know where it is heading.  I imagine, for the purposes of the Bill, when we were discussing the principle it would have occurred to most members that the schedule should be the limit of its activities.  It now appears under Section 3 that the Commission can, by order of the Executive Council, take to itself a never-ending task, an everwidening task, and will eventually become an incubus on the back of the country that it will be very difficult to get rid of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (2) of the section under discussion says:&mdash;&ldquo;The Executive Council may, by order under this section, declare any commodity of common use to be a scheduled commodity for the purposes of this Act.&rdquo;  What are the purposes of the Act in relation to scheduled <Col N="607" /> commodities?  Section 21 says &ldquo;that where the Minister sends a request to the Commission to investigate the prices charged for any scheduled commodity then the Commission shall make an investigation.  Section 21, therefore, drives us back to see who are and what is the Commission, and we get that in Section 8, which says the Minister may set up a Commission which shall be known as and styled the Prices Commission and shall consist ordinarily of five members.  But under Section 9, &ldquo;The Minister may from time to time for the purposes of any particular investigation by the Commission appoint such and so many persons (not being ordinary members) to act as additional members of the Commission as he thinks fit.&rdquo;  I should like to join in the points raised by Deputy Dillon.  If this Bill was going to be confined by the scheduled commodities set out, then we could form an opinion as to what use there was going to be of the Commission and what necessity there would be from time to time to add on more than the ordinary members of the Commission. But, when power is taken to add members, as is proposed here, and that the Minister and Executive Council shall have power to declare any commodity of common use to be a scheduled commodity, then clearly we are going to enlarge the number of investigations and, from time to time have an enlargement of the Commission by the addition of these extra members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the case that has been made for giving this power sought to the Minister?  So far as the Bill, even with the scheduled commodities, was concerned the Minister did not express any decided opinion that there was profiteering in the country.  He certainly did not give any evidence to the House that there was clearly profiteering even in the scheduled commodities. What has he to say about the commodities other than those scheduled which may, by order, become scheduled commodities?  Where is the evidence of profiteering, of gross profit-taking, in any commodity other <Col N="608" /> than those scheduled in the Bill as presented to the House on which the House could vote these extra powers, that the Minister and the Executive Council, from time to time, declare&mdash; I call attention again to the wide nature of the sub-section&mdash;&ldquo;any commodity of common use to be a scheduled commodity&rdquo;?  It certainly requires something more than silence on the part of the Minister on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I think we should have some indication from him of the commodities other than those scheduled about which he has sufficient evidence that it establishes under the section a <i>prima facie</i> case that he should have extended powers, something more than the power to have an investigation made into food, clothing, material for clothing or fuel.  As Deputy Dillon said, so far from getting that, we have what amounts to an expression of opinion on the part of the Minister that he has hesitancy or doubt as to profiteering at all.</P>
    <P>I want to bring back to his mind one article about which he declared himself very vehemently.  He told us an interesting anecdote in April or May this year about a lady friend of his who had been grossly over-charged for a grape-fruit.  The Minister then expressed the point of view that that profiteering was such as would, in his mind, warrant the person responsible being sent to jail.  Is grape-fruit a fruit within the meaning of the schedule? It is an article that is eaten. Even the Minister's friends indulge in it.  Is it a food?  We had a slight discussion on the Second Stage as to foods, and there was an attempt to draw a distinction between foods which are a luxury and foods which are a necessity, in the course of which we got an explanation that tea is a food for the purposes of this Bill, although it is a luxury for the purposes of the Budget.  What is grape-fruit?  Is it a food, or is it even such a drink that it may be considered a food?  Is the Minister likely to order an investigation immediately about such a thing as this grape-fruit which so raised his ire last April?  Is he going to have jail for the person who was so grossly <Col N="609" /> over-charging his friend for this commodity? So far from the Minister asking for power to extend the range of commodities beyond what was scheduled, it seems to me the schedule might have been narrowed.  There are certain foods which form the subject of investigation throughout the country at regular periods for the purpose of determining what is the index number of prices&mdash;for one purpose, at any rate, of deciding upon the cost-of-living bonus.  The foods there are limited.  They are the foods in ordinary use.  Certain items of drink come in, too.</P>
    <P>Clothing comes in, and in addition there are certain items about rent. We will leave that out for the moment. What is the necessity of even having such a wide schedule as the mere statement of the word &ldquo;food&rdquo; gives without some statement from the Minister to say &ldquo;any foods examined for the purposes of the cost-of-living figure.&rdquo;  In certain foods, other than those, he has evidence of profiteering.  Then I come to the last item.  I think he should have given some evidence that, apart from food, clothing, materials for clothing or fuel, he had some evidence before him of profiteering in other articles.  Instead of that we get, as Deputy Dillon has said, a proposal to set up a Commission. We might have, as I say, our minds clear as to a limited number of investigations of a limited schedule, but where there is wide power of extension we do not know where we are going.</P>
    <P>We see also that the Commission, apart from its investigations being multiplied in numbers, may be added to by extra members, and of course it is much more likely to be added to when special commodities are under investigation than if we had a Commission picked with a view to examining the scheduled articles.  It seems to me very pertinent to say that sub-section (2) of Section 3 is likely to add very considerably to the expense of the whole measure, and likely to add to the number of people going to be put on the Commission as well as to the number who are going to be <Col N="610" /> asked to act as investigating officers to the Commission.  The position here is that all this is presented to us without a word from the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to amplify what the two previous speakers have said.  Deputy Dillon has drawn attention to the schedule which refers to food, clothing, etc.  It does not state whether it is human food only and whether this might not apply to feeding stuffs.  Deputy McGilligan has pointed out that the powers proposed to be taken under the Bill can be still further extended. The Executive Council may, by order, under the section declare any commodity of common use to be a scheduled commodity for the purpose of this Act.  Now, as if those powers were not wide enough, it appears to me that amendment 4 opens the door still wider.  The Minister may appoint the Commission to hold a public inquiry for the purposes of Section 17 of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, and if one refers to Section 17 of that Act it will be found &mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that power is given to the Minister to act in place of a local authority that is in default under certain of the Housing Acts.  It appears to me as if this Bill, which started out to deal with food and clothing&mdash;I do not know whether it is even human food and is now to include any commodity that is in common use&mdash;is to be still further extended to local authorities in default.  Then, if one of these local authorities is found to be in default, somebody else is to be set up in its place.  Is the position to be that the Prices Tribunal is to come in and take the place of the local authority in the case, say, of a building scheme?  I would like to have information on those points.</P>

      <P>The last matter referred to by Deputy Dockrell can be discussed when we get to that part of the Bill.  The Dáil has decided that machinery should be set up for the investigation and controlling of the prices of commodities.  This section prescribes the range of commodities in <Col N="611" /> respect of which that investigation and control may take place.

      <P>The wording was deliberately decided on to make it as wide as possible so that there could be included within its scope every commodity which may be classed as food, fuel, clothing or material for clothing.  I think it is quite clear that the price of a grapefruit could be investigated by the Commission under this Bill.  It will probably be of greater interest to Deputy McGilligan to know that it can even investigate the price of lemons.  The Commission can investigate the quality and price of a range of articles.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Dillon confined most of their remarks to paragraph (b), which declares that the Commission may also investigate the price of any other article which is by order of the Executive Council declared to be a scheduled commodity for the purposes of this Act.  Sub-section (2) gives the Executive Council power to declare any commodity of common use to be a scheduled commodity.  Deputy Dillon talked about the Commission as an incubus on industry, roving around the country and poking its nose into all sorts of places, and with unlimited powers.  Deputy Dillon has become quite a master in the art of exaggeration, and achieves his effects by ignoring those things that conflict with his own ideas.  He ignored, for instance, the effect of sub-section (3), which provides that when an order is made by the Executive Council declaring any commodity to be a scheduled commodity, that order must be laid before the two Houses of the Oireachtas. Each House can, within twenty-one days, if it so pleases, pass a resolution <Col N="612" /> annulling the order.  That is the usual form, and I think it is rather an effective check upon the possibility of the Executive Council adopting the attitude which Deputy McGilligan seemed to envisage.  Is it not desirable that the Executive Council should have power given to it under sub-section (2) of the section?</P>

      <P>Armed with particular powers and authority.  We are asking that Commission to investigate, in certain circumstances, the prices of certain scheduled commodities.  If we should find at a later date that a large number of complaints were forthcoming because a particular commodity was not scheduled and in respect of which excessive prices were being charged throughout the country, should we not have some means by which we could get the Commission to investigate complaints without being obliged to bring in a new Bill to the Dáil, getting it passed through all its stages here and later of getting through its various stages in the Seanad so that it might become law? Is it not desirable, assuming, as we must, that the Dáil desires to have investigation of prices, that there should be some easy means by which the range of commodities investigated can be enlarged if the necessity arises, subject to the power of the Dáil to express its opinion?  It is quite easy to visualise that situation arising in connection with commodities in common use not down in the schedule. Soap, for example.  I do not know whether Deputies opposite regard soap as an article of common use, but it is so regarded by certain parts of the community.  If it should happen that there was a combination amongst soap manufacturers, elevating the price and making undue profits, is it <Col N="613" /> not necessary that we should get power to investigate?</P>

      <P>I explained when the Bill was before the House, on Second Reading, that there had been a number of complaints from various quarters of excessive prices of different commodities, but I was not able to say definitely that profiteering was taking place.  I was told that there was a sufficient volume of complaints to investigate, and, at any rate, it is the duty of the State to have the means of investigating these complaints, but the State has been bereft of this power up to the present.  It is going to take that power now, and, in future, if any great number of individuals have reason to complain that undue profits are secured upon the sale, retail or wholesale, of a number of commodities, investigation can take place, and if the complaint is found to be justified, action to reduce prices can follow. That is the purport of the Bill.  This section merely relates to the range of articles upon which investigation can take place.  I cannot see any logical reason why any single article of food, clothing and material for clothing should not come within the Executive power by order subject to the sub-section if the necessity should arise.</P>

      <P>Is not this the old gag of every oligarchy ever set up?  &ldquo;What do you want all this nonsense of an Oireachtas for?  Give us the powers, and we will do the job.  We will tell you about those things you ought to know&mdash;fuel and clothing and a few other things&mdash;but when we take action we must have power to do the rest.&rdquo;&ldquo;We will not come to you to ask permission of you, but we will tell you afterwards, and we will ask you to approve of what we have.&rdquo;  That is the old argument of the old oligarchy over again, which comes to the conclusion that it is fit to do the job. That, however, is not the feeling prevailing in this country.  The Oireachtas makes laws, not the Ministers, and it is our job to try to keep Ministers in their places.  It is not an easy job with their 78 supporters, but that is <Col N="614" /> what we are trying to do.  They are trying to get permission from the Oireachtas to do what they want to do and not to do what we want them to do.  They want to do what they like first, and then come for retrospective permission from Dáil Eireann afterwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This further emerges from the Minister's reply besides what Deputy Dillon has said&mdash; profiteering is now thrown overboard. The Minister is again questioned about the offence of profiteering.  He is not satisfied that there is any.  What is the Bill founded upon?  Complaint. There is a sufficient volume of complaint. This calls for the appellation which was so well applied to it by Deputy Dillon previously that it is the merest eyewash.  A whole lot of people complain.  The Minister and his friends get a whole flood of complaints, and that is what is to be investigated.  It was a little more than complaint before. The Minister was so convinced that there was gross profiteering in a particular case that he was prepared to send the seller to jail.  He hoped that when the Commission was set up it would be allowed to impose a sentence of imprisonment upon such person. We now have the schedule furthere extended and widened by the interjection of Deputy Moore.  It is not only food for men, women and children that is to be dealt with.  It may be food for animals.  It is not even clothing for human beings.  I do not know why he inserted fuel.  It may have even a wider extension than anybody may be able to read into some of the limiting words in the schedule.  In addition we are asked to give the Executive power to declare any commodities in common use to be scheduled commodities.  There was another example given by the Minister. He says if there is some article in common use such as soap, and a complaint of profiteering is made, whether the Minister considers the complaint is a sound one or not, he can send out to have it investigated. I thought, somewhere between the complaint being made, and the operation of Section 21, that we were going to have some discretion used by the <Col N="615" /> Minister, that he is going to make up his mind whether the complaint is well founded or not, but this is merely running with the storm.  The Minister invites everyone to send in complaints and he will send out to have investigation made.  He is going to enlarge the extent, and to enlarge the activities of the members of the Commission. He is going to enlarge the number of officials and inspectors who will be running round the country poking their noses into people's businesses because someone makes an ill-informed complaint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some ill-informed person may make a complaint to the Commission.  What is to be the Commission's attitude if they find the Minister asking for investigation because ill-informed complaints are made to him?  He will say the Commission is avoiding its duty in operating with any discretion upon these things.  If the Commission is going to pay attention to sub-section (2) of Section 21 it shows that they should only be of the opinion that an investigation in the public interest should be made.  If they read the Minister's words and see that he has based the whole Bill, not upon profiteering, but upon complaints of profiteering, they are going to take their cue from that, and will see that those general complaints are investigated.  If they are as keen as the Minister they are going to investigate everything sent on to them.  They can have the schedule enlarged by the Minister's extension showing how he intends the work to be carried on, and further enlarged by the addition of any commodities in common use, by an Order being laid upon the Table for 21 sitting days, by which time the Commission may have investigated the whole of the business.  There has been no great case made for the Bill, but it has passed its Second Reading, through the desire expressed by a majority to have profiteering investigated.  The whole thing is whether an undue price has been charged.  I doubt very much <Col N="616" /> if the House had that clearly before it when passing that principle.  The allegation of profiteering was not going to be sustained by evidence based on complaints.  Whether or not the House passed that, the House is now asked in detail to agree to an extension of the articles in the schedule by giving to the Executive Council the power to add any article in common use to-day.  Whatever the House may have passed on the Second Reading they have not got any evidence now on which to pass this, and I am going to divide against it.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any evidence which points to the fact that we had any power to investigate complaints.  There was no machinery at the command of the State, no power in any Minister to carry out investigations of a complaint.  Is that desirable? If complaints are made in reference to any commodity for which excessive prices are charged is it desirable that the only thing we can do with the complaints is to put them into the waste paper basket?  That is all we can do until this Bill is passed.  Let me say that the Bill would be introduced if there was no complaint.  It is machinery which should be in existence. The powers conferred on the State by this Bill should be possessed by it, and, in particular, the powers conferred in Part 5 should be in existence once a protective policy is brought into operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <P>I must reply to that. The Minister stated that there was no power without this Bill to do anything except to put complaints into the waste paper basket.  That is not so. The Minister will find in the records of the Department that investigations were made.  The Minister will also find records of an Act which could be brought into operation by simply passing a resolution in the House, naming the particular article, whereas this includes power to take evidence on <Col N="617" /> oath and to commit a person.  Apart from that, it required coming before the House and making a case for the institution of a special tribunal, and specifying the article.  The Minister will find on the records many investigations <Col N="618" /> that were made on complaints, and will also find that some of them were attended with results&mdash;the lowering of prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to Sections 5 and 6 together, as they are closely allied.  These sections furnish further evidence of a practice which is growing.  The Minister seeks, under these two sections, power to make regulations.  That sounds harmless enough, but what is the nature of these regulations to be?  The Minister reassures us.  He tells us that he is going to lay these regulations on the Table of the House and that we will be given an opportunity of convincing the other members of the Oireachtas that the regulations are either good or bad.  Just as he was giving us that assurance, there were three members of the Fianna Fáil Party sitting on the Government Benches.  Nevertheless, when the division bell rang, they came galloping in to form a judgment on the proposal of the Minister without getting the benefit of our argument. When the Minister comes down with his regulations, twenty-one days old, and lays them on the Table, the three faithful followers of Fianna Fáil will be arrayed behind him.  When the division bell rings, the 73 faithful followers will come struggling up the stairs and through the lobby.  Then they will all walk out again.  That is the danger.  So long as the Minister takes powers of this character, it simply means that, while the Bill operates, the Minister will make the law and will come down and go through the form of depositing papers on the Table.  That will be the end of it. There will be no opportunity and no way of compelling the Minister to defend his proposal before he puts it into operation.  The Minister will, of course, say that he has to defend it at the end of twenty-one days.  But he has twenty-one days to do what he pleases.  Presumably, he will be able to ascertain if there is profiteering on <Col N="620" /> the price of butter, though he will have to consult the Minister for Agriculture before he starts to inquire into that, and for twenty-one days he will be operating, and he will have his inspectors careering around the country before he can be called upon to defend his action.  The Minister may get up and say that these regulations do not amount to anything, that they are a mere form which appears in every Bill of this character. But so long as that kind of power is given to the Minister, these regulations will grow in importance and very soon it will not be the Oireachtas that will be legislating in respect of price control but the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>I would not like to envisage bright specimens of antediluvians. The Minister certainly is not bright about this.  Economies were promised extending to £2,000,000 and we get £4,000,000 additional slapped on.  I am sure that we should read what the Minister for Industry and Commerce said to-night with the speeches he was making when in Opposition.  He spoke about trying to stop the trend of legislation.  It is just the same kind of cant.  It was not meant.  We have the section here. There is a further advance of legislation by order.  I do not object to legislation by order on principle.  The thing is quite good, but there should <Col N="622" /> be some discrimination.  That is what Deputy Dillon has been getting at. That is the gist of his arguments.  No evidence is given of profiteering.  Even when the Minister was introducing this Bill he made no statement that there is any evidence of profiteering.  What he said was that there had been an enormous number of complaints.  Instead of pitching those complaints into the ordinary type of wastepaper basket he is seeking to pitch them into a new type of wastepaper basket in the form of this Commission.  The Minister seeks an extension of his powers by way of order.  I say with Deputy Dillon that this is a sufficiently serious matter, too serious a matter to be done by order; but if it is to be done by order it should be done in the way of order.  It should not become law until it is passed.  The attention of the faithful followers of both Parties should be given to it, and they should be able to form their judgment upon it.</P>
      <P>There is something to be said for that type of order which may be laid on the Table of the House for 21 days and may never be raised.  Even if raised, everything that is desired may have been achieved before the 21 days' period is passed.  Of course, even if a motion of that kind is put down the Government can always refuse facilities for discussion until the very end of the period.  Does the Minister think that this is a suitable type of thing? I am not going to discuss this on the basis that legislation by order is bad, but does the Minister consider that legislation by order in reference to the enlargement of powers by way of extending the articles in the Schedule is a good thing?</P>

      <P>I did hear the Minister say that he did not know to what Section 8 really referred.  I expect the Minister himself is one of those who did not read the Bill.  However, speaking in the abstract, it may be necessary to have legislation by order.  Let us hear the Minister defend the various types of things that he sees ahead of him as requiring orders that will have to be brought before the House, and which will become law unless they are negatived by a resolution of the House.  Let us hear him on those matters.  Let him make the defence to the House that is accustomed to legislation by order, a defence that it is a proper thing to have a variety of things prescribed in this way.  The analogy with the order that is to be made under Section 3, which has just been passed, is very close to the orders that will be made under Sections 5 and 6.  They are phrased in practically the same form. <Col N="624" /> It is not one that will require notice in this House to be called to it, not that type of thing.  If the Minister wants us to give him these orders let us hear from him.  If this is to be done in an agreed form, we should get some statement as to why it was put in this form rather than the form in which the House would know of it before it becomes law.</P>

      <P>This form was adopted because the matters to be prescribed are minor matters; they relate to matters of the form in which the complaints are to be made.  I may tell the Deputy that though his speech is not intended to be serious, it is quite obvious that he intended to obstruct this in the interests of the Profiteers' Association.  We have the Army Comrades Association already, and no doubt we will now have the Profiteers' Association.  The Deputy's opposition to this Bill is designed in the interests of the profiteers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been able to find only one profiteer. That is the person who sold a grape fruit to the Minister's lady friend.  If the Minister had given us any evidence of profiteering we should agree.  If there had been profiteering and we wanted to cut that out quickly, I would be in favour of giving the Minister those powers.  I would say, &ldquo;Come back to the House and we will see about passing a law which will prevent profiteering.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has two defences.  He says &ldquo;cut out the profiteer&rdquo; in spite of the fact that he had refused to give evidence of profiteering and in spite of the fact that he said there was no evidence before him.  The Minister said there was no evidence of profiteering before him to convince him that there was profiteering, but he said that there were complaints.  If the Minister is to give heed to complaints he will have a terrible time ahead, because they are growing in number, but that is another matter.  Obstruction&mdash; it is a peculiar use of the word.  Anything which attempts to get sense into the Minister's head is obstruction.  I should have thought that it was an attempt to clear away an obstruction. The Minister does not see that.  What are we obstructing the Minister doing by talking about these orders?  Getting after non-existent profiteers?  That is, I think, his own case.  Then again the other phrase is used: &ldquo;Talk as much as you like, this is going to become law.&rdquo;  Might I point out to the Minister a measure about which that very phrase was used, and which did not become law in the way in which he threatened it was going to become law?  In the end, the Minister bowed and gave us the amendments we required on the Control of Manufactures Bill, and there is considerable good in arousing the public conscience on certain matters like this, because it has its repercussions afterwards.  We have seen how often on other matters, in which the Minister forced his way through on Finance measures, he had to come back to this House and bring in resolutions himself to meet points that, when previously raised, were phrased to be just as much obstruction <Col N="626" /> as he speaks of now.  We have given the Minister some little education by reason of speaking here.  It is a difficult task, but we are going to persevere at it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to that.  Despite the fact that he has been campaigning in this field himself, that aspect of it has not turned up to him.  The Dáil Recess may take place to-day.  To-morrow, the Minister can make an Order and operate under that Order for four or five months and then, as soon as may be, in the next Session, submit it to the faithful and the true, and we have twenty-one days to examine it.  I would suggest to the Minister that whereas he objects to people poking their noses into business in this country, he ought to be very reluctant to ask for powers to arrogate to himself the right to poke his own nose into his neighbour's affairs. This may be the practice, and, if it has been, it is a rotten bad practice, but, of all cases, where you are going to undertake to run a man's business in the country a little better than he is able to run it himself, the Minister ought to be reluctant to ask powers to arrogate to himself the right to undertake the conduct of his neighbour's affairs.  There should be express sanction from the Dáil before he takes that burden on his broad and capable shoulders.</P>

    <P>(1)  As soon as conveniently may be after the passing of this Act, there <Col N="627" /> shall be established a Commission (in this Act referred to as the Commission), which shall be known as and styled the Prices Commission, to fulfil the functions assigned to the Commission by this Act.</P>
    <P>(2)  Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Commission shall consist of five members (in this Act called ordinary members) of whom at least two shall be women and of whom one who may be a woman shall be a person representative of agricultural interests.</P>
    <P>(3)  The ordinary member who is required to be a person representative of agricultural interests shall be nominated by the Minister after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and the other ordinary members shall be nominated by the Minister.</P>
    <P>(4)  Every ordinary member shall hold office during the pleasure of the Minister.</P>
    <P>(5)  Whenever it appears to the Minister that on account of illness or for other sufficient reason an ordinary member of the Commission is temporarily unable to discharge his duties as such member, the Minister may appoint a person to act as an ordinary member for such period (not exceeding the duration of such inability) as he shall think proper, and every person so appointed to act as an ordinary member of the Commission shall during the period for which he is so appointed be an ordinary member of the Commission in the place of such first-mentioned ordinary member.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just going to ask the Minister the same question.  Under this Bill, the Commission that is to be set up, as I understand it, will consist of five members, two of whom are to be women, and the only person who is mentioned as having any special knowledge is the representative of agriculture on this Commission.  As this Commission will be inquiring into matters which deeply concern the commercial <Col N="628" /> community, matters which are of considerable importance to the State, it is highly desirable that one of those members, at least, should have business knowledge, should be a representative of the commercial community. I think the Minister will agree that that is highly desirable, and I would like him to incorporate a proviso in this section setting out that, in addition to having one representative of agriculture, which I agree is our basic industry, and ought to have a special representative, it is essential that a representative of commerce should be on that tribunal in order to guide it, seeing that commerce is going to be closely inquired into by this tribunal. I would ask the Minister to embody in this particular section a clause to the effect that a representative of the commercial community shall be one of the members of the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully with what Deputy Good has said, that it is highly desirable that, at least one, if not more, of the members of the proposed Commission should have commercial experience and knowledge of the conditions existing in trade and industry in this country, but I would like the Deputy to try his own hand at drafting the amendment on these lines.  The Deputy may assume that the Minister, in the exercise of his powers under this section, in relation to the appointment of the Commission, will have to have regard to that fact, and also to other facts, such as the desirability of having somebody on the Commission who will have a knowledge of the laws of evidence and the desirability of having people who have had experience of price investigations in the past or something of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special qualification which will be required by anybody carrying out investigations on this Commission will have to be taken into account, and it is intended to take them into account. That is undoubtedly the intention, but it would be practically impossible to set down this qualification in the Bill. We did set down the condition that one of the persons should be a representative of agricultural interests, and that is elaborated in the following sub <Col N="629" /> section which says that that person shall be selected after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, who is responsible for representing the views of the agricultural community in this regard, and ensures that the names of suitable representatives will be available to the Minister when making the selection, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce is the person to select the individual with the special knowledge of industrial and commercial conditions that would make that person a useful person on this Commission, and that is undoubtedly the intention.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there is any other point necessary by way of explanation of the section.  It appears to be quite clear.  The Commission shall be appointed, and it shall consist of five persons, two of whom shall be women and one of whom shall be a representative of agricultural interests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is considered desirable&mdash;and I am open to conviction on the matter&mdash;that two of the members of the Commission should be women because, in respect of most articles of common consumption of the type specified in the Schedule, women are, in the main, the purchasers.  It is the women who do the actual shopping and buying of these goods, and, consequently, special provision should be made to ensure representation for women on the Commission.</P>

      <P>Is it prudent that an ordinary member of this Commission, who has practically judicial functions allotted to him, and who might make a finding that would not please the Minister a bit, should be in the position to be informed by the Minister that his services are no longer required?  Could he not have some defined period of tenure on this preposterous Committee where, at least, he would have an opportunity of speaking the truth in public?  He could speak the truth in public if he could do no other useful work.  As it is, if a man says anything to vex the Minister, the Minister can put him off the Commission.  I do not think there is any precedent for investing a person with judicial functions and, at the same time, giving to the Minister who appoints him the right to dismiss him at his discretion without cause <Col N="631" /> stated or anything else.  Is that desirable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>I think it is desirable.

It should be for a cause stated and reason shown in Dáil Eireann.  Otherwise the Commission would be an even greater and more laughable farce than it already promises to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 8 we have got to examine this a little bit more closely.  Section 8 puts upon the Minister the duty of establishing a Prices Commission to fulfil the functions <Col N="632" /> assigned to the Commission by the Act.  The only limitation that is imposed upon the Minister is confined to five people&mdash;five ordinary members, and then there is a further limitation, two members shall be women, and one, who may be one of the women, shall be a person representative of agricultural interests.  On that first point the Minister has been asked why he would not define that one of them would be a person experienced in commercial affairs, and he thought&mdash;whatever would be a suitable thing to have in the back of one's mind&mdash;it was an unsuitable thing to be set down.  He has set it down that two must be women, and that one, who may be a woman, shall be representative of agricultural interests in the country.  If it is undesirable to set it down with regard to a person representing commercial interests, surely it is equally undesirable to set down this discrimination by way of sex.  The Minister said that there was no special reason why it should be done, but he is doing it.  Sub-section (3) goes on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The ordinary member who is required to be a person representative of agricultural interests shall be nominated by the Minister after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And then we get the amazing sub-section to which Deputy Dillon has referred that the other ordinary members shall be nominated by the Minister. This Commission is to be set up to fulfil the functions assigned to the Commission by the Act.  Let us look at some of them.  Section 17 sets out some of the powers.  Those are to be the powers given to a Commission, all the members of which are removable at the will of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Commission shall have all such powers, rights, and privileges for enforcing the attendance of witnesses and examining them on oath (which any member of the Commission is hereby authorised to administer) or otherwise, and for compelling the production of documents as are vested in the High Court, or a judge thereof in respect of the trial of an action, and a summons signed by any one or more <Col N="633" /> members of the Commission shall be equivalent to and have the like effect as a formal process issued by the High Court for enforcing the attendance of witness and compelling the production of documents.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then there are penalties.  If any person on being duly summoned, and the summons being duly signed by any one of those people makes default in attending or</P>
    <P>being in attendance as a witness refuses to take an oath legally required by the Commission to be taken, or to produce any document in his power and control legally required by the Commission to be produced by him, or to answer any question to which the Commission may legally require an answer, or</P>
    <P>does any other thing which would, if the Commission were a Court of Justice, having power to commit for contempt of court, be contempt of such court,</P>
    <P>the Commission may certify the offence of that person under their hands to the High Court and that court may, after such inquiry as it thinks proper to make, punish or take steps for the punishment of that person in like manner as if he had been guilty of contempt of the said court.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable equation of the composition of this Committee, and, say a court of intermediate jurisdiction in this country, and yet I have here the Minister amongst others foaming here at the suggestion of appointing a temporary District Justice on the ground that because they were temporary&mdash;not mind you that they were removable at the will of the Minister, but because they were appointed for a limited period&mdash;they were not the proper type of impartial person one should associate with the Courts of Justice, and that was urged with regard to the lowest person we have under the scheme of courts in the country, temporary District Justices. Yet we are going to set up a Commission with considerable powers, for compelling the attendance of witnesses, asking questions, and commiting for contempt of court, because such <Col N="634" /> questions are not answered, and so on, and every member of it shall hold office during the pleasure of the Minister.  Surely it establishes immediately that the purpose of this is that the Minister will bring pressure upon those people to report on any investigation submitted to them as he wants, and, if they do not, they are going to be fired.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a section in it which talks about the finance of this Commission.  It is obvious from later sections&mdash;it is absolutely certain&mdash;that the power of granting salaries for serving on such a Commission is there.  I think it is pretty obvious from what we have seen of the reports of another board that the salaries are going to be paid.  The Minister is going to appoint people to harass the folk of the country with regard to an evil which he himself says is not existent, and he is going to give some justification hereafter for this Bill, and for the amount of inconvenience and pinpricking that is going to be caused to the traders of the country.  What better way could he get than by packing this Commission&mdash;packing it with people whom he expects to be subservient to his wishes and afterwards holding over them the threat.  &ldquo;If you do not do what I desire you are going to lose the bit of salary we give you for serving on the Commission.&rdquo;  Does not the Minister at any rate exclude the worst criticism of that type if he says &ldquo;were appointed for a yearly term&rdquo; and let the reappointment be in the Minister's hands, but appoint for some fixed term?  The man who goes on goes on with the knowledge that he is still subject to being dropped at the end of the year, but he also goes on with this knowledge, that if he serves for a year and he is not reappointed it will be open to people to question why he is not reappointed, and if his public performance has been good the Minister will be subjected to quite an amount of criticism for not reappointing him. The man will have the security of knowing that if he shows himself to be expert in that matter there is a considerable amount of experience piled up by him at the end of the year which should lead to his reappointment, <Col N="635" /> but in this the whole thing is at the pleasure of the Minister, and these are considerable powers that are being given and it is certainly not right that they should be given to people who hold office from day to day, from investigation to investigation, or rather from the result of each investigation to another, at the pleasure of the Minister, whose view of them is apt to be clouded by the general circumstances to which Deputy Dillon has referred.</P>
      <P>If they are finding things the Minister has been definitely adverse to in this House, if they are finding things that really go to counter many of the Minister's arguments, they are not going to have very much of a chance of being carried forward.  I think the Minister should, at any rate, tell us whether he is going to bind himself to any limitation of these members&mdash;of the type he has already set out in sub-section 2 and tell us what he has in his mind with regard to these Commissions; what type of people he intends to put on them, if he can get them. What the Minister may intend to do is very often blocked by circumstances. It is not always possible to get the proper people&mdash;the proper people may be there and not willing to serve, and the people the Minister may think would be best to get for this Commission are going to be impeded from serving on it by the very fact that they can be thrown off at any minute if the Minister takes a wrong view of them. We should know what type of person he has in his mind.  I gather from what has been said that somebody with something approaching judicial capacity is going to be put on&mdash;somebody at any rate who has some capacity for ruling, as to what is evidence and what is not evidence; what is a suitable question to put to a witness, and whether refusal to reply is a matter of privilege or whether it is simply perverse and such as should be reported to the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I look at the later section here, what is to be done? Take Section 22&mdash;First of all, they have to decide whether the prices charged for certain things are unduly high.  Then they are to ask the people concerned, <Col N="636" /> whoever is responsible for those unduly high prices, to lower them.  If they are not lowered, notice is to be sent to the Minister setting out the reason for the prices being too high and</P>
    <P>the Commission shall give notice (in this section referred to as a price reduction notice) to the persons by whom such prices are being charged stating the opinion of the Commission and the price to which such prices should in the opinion of the Commission be reduced, and requiring such reduction to be made within a time specified in such notice;</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>(iii)  their opinion as to the price to which the prices the subject of such investigation should be reduced.</P>
    <P>That is not a decision that can be come to by two women whose touch with prices is simply that they purchase articles in shops.  A very big variety of considerations would come before this Commission when they have got to determine what is the real price to which all the prices in this particular set of commodities are to be related.  I think the Minister is very foolish in tying himself to women.  I think he is rather foolish in trying himself even that in all matters there should be a person representative of agriculture.  I think it would be much better if he left himself completely free or else let him show himself completely under their influence and put on five, but will he give us a statement subject always to the chance of circumstances that he may not get the people he has in mind.  Will he tell us what this Commission will be for the group of commodities that are scheduled&mdash;for food, clothing, material for clothing and fuel.</P>
    <P>What is the type of Commission he will establish?  What is more or less the specification of persons that he will put on if he has them at his disposal. When he gives us that description I think we can go on to consider whether these people are of such a type that they will hold office at the pleasure of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir James Craig Sir James Craig">
      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words on this matter.  I want to support some of the contentions that have been made by Deputy Dillon and the last speaker.  I think it was in the year 1923, owing to the knowledge that I had acquired when sitting on the Board of a Hospital for many years, I had shown at all events a certain knowledge as to prices of foods, and I was asked to sit on the Food Commission which sat in 1923, and on which I gave a great deal of information.  I cannot make, and I do not intend to make, a Second Reading speech on this occasion.  Allow me, however, to say that so far as conditions then and conditions now are concerned, that although there was very strong evidence of profiteering in those days, I do not think anything like the same conditions apply at the present time.  Now, sir, I want to urge upon the Minister that he should not restrict his choice in any way.  There were two ladies sat upon the Food Commission on which I sat, and one lady subsequently sat upon the Liquor Commission of which I was a member.  Now I want to say, so far as these ladies were concerned, they showed considerable interest in the work.  They did not cross-examine to any great extent, and one of the ladies who gave evidence before us assured us there would be no question of any profiteering if the lady purchaser only went to the right place.  She said it was all their own fault&mdash;if they go in and give a big price&mdash;it is their own fault. You could get the thing cheap enough if you know where to go.  However, I am merely stating that I think it is a great mistake, at all events, for the Minister to restrict himself in any way in the Bill.  Let him put two ladies if he likes on, but I think he should not restrict himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point is of far greater importance.  As I say, I sat on these two Commissions.  I sat on them because I was supposed to have a certain amount of knowledge with regard to the price of food as applied to the supplies to hospitals for many years.  On the liquor question I did <Col N="638" /> show a certain amount of knowledge and interest also, and I was pressed as a matter of fact to sit upon that Commission. I did not want to sit on either of them, and I want to say now quite definitely that I would not have accepted the position if there had been any restriction placed upon me, nor would I have sat upon them if there was the slightest hint that I could be removed at the will of any Minister.  I want to say that very definitely.  I do not think the Minister is going to get independent people who will give independent judgment if he is going to say:&mdash;&ldquo;I am going to hunt you off the Commission whenever I like, or if you do not carry out instructions that come from my office.&rdquo;  I would not quite definitely have sat upon a Commission where I received any instructions from a Minister, or any advice as to what I should do, or what principles I should follow.  Now, sir, I admit, and I think it is very advisable that there should be on the Commission a person with legal training, a person who would know the form of evidence that should be given.  That is of very great importance&mdash;and as Deputy Good has stated, I think it is very advisable that people who are in business should be represented on the Commission.  I was not in business, and I think I showed on the Commission that I had as great a knowledge of the prices that should be paid for things, as anybody else upon it, so that, as I say, I would like the Minister to keep himself absolutely free.  He is not going to choose me, I am sure of that, he is not going to choose me for another reason &mdash;that I sat upon this Commission without getting any pay.  He is going to pay people who are coming on Commissions now.  Those who sat on Commissions in the past got no remuneration whatever, which was a very hard thing.  We gave our time, and it was very hard on me personally to give the amount of time I had to give, but I gave it freely and willingly and there was no remuneration in these days.  As I say, I want the Minister to leave himself without any restriction and to remove the provision regarding these two women.  Let him appoint two women if he likes or <Col N="639" /> appoint a legal gentleman if he likes, but let there be no restriction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to emphasise one question that apparently has arisen.  There are to be five members on the Commission.  Two of these are to be women and one a representative of agriculture.  That leaves two vacancies.  At the same time it has been mentioned that one of the other members should have a legal training. That would bring the membership up to four and leave the Minister with one vacancy to fill.  One question that has been mentioned, and I think it is the most important that the Commission will have to decide is, what is cost? We all remember the discussions that take place in regard to that question and I can only say that I feel puzzled when I hear of two women, a representative of agriculture and a legal gentleman discussing what is cost, without the assistance of an accountant or without the assistance of a business man. I think that these two sections will have to be provided for, so that I do not see very well how the Minister is going to fit all these members on the Commission and give a proper representation to the business community. Certainly, in my humble opinion, in so far as so many of the questions to be decided will turn on the matter of cost, there will also have to be an accountant on the Commission.</P>

      <P>There is one point I should like to raise.  In a recent notice in the Press of the appointment of a Labour member on the Housing Board, I think there was a salary mentioned of £500 per annum.  I think the Minister in appointing a representative of Labour in this case would give more satisfaction to the House if he appointed some person who was in receipt of trade union wages.  That person would be better able to appraise price values and so on than somebody from the aristocracy of Labour.</P>

      <P>As regards the point made by Deputy Sir James Craig and others, there is a condition that two members of the Commission shall be women.  That is a condition upon which I have more or less an open mind.  I think it is desirable that we should tie ourselves down to this condition, but if any Deputy moves to delete it, I am prepared to argue it as an open question without any matter of a Party vote or anything of that kind.  It is, in my opinion, not a very substantial point, because presumably the Minister, in selecting the members of the Commission, will be anxious to get a balanced team representative of as many interests as possible so grouped as to ensure that it will be capable of carrying out its function under the Bill.  One comes to expect absurd nonsensical arguments from Deputy McGilligan, but nevertheless it is not very easy to suffer them gladly.  There is no possible comparison between the Commission to be appointed under this Bill and a District Justice.  The Commission does nothing more than report and it is on the report of the Commission that the Minister may act.  He may act if he thinks fit, but there is nothing in this Bill to require him to act on the report.  The purpose of the Commission is to investigate and report. Certainly it is not a judicial body at all, but in order to ensure that it will be able to get evidence on which to base its report certain powers are conferred on it as set out in Section 17.</P>

The Minister is an officer of the Dáil, responsible to the Dáil if he removes any member of the Commission.  Under sub-section (4), Section 5, he is liable to be questioned here in regard to his action in that matter.  It is obviously desirable in view of the powers which Deputy McGilligan read out as being conferred on members of the Commission, that the Minister if he wants to make the Commission effective and to ensure that it is going to get the co-operation of the general public, should be able to remove any member of the Commission if he thinks there is a case for his removal.</P>

Will the Minister answer more amiably if in the future he is asked why did he dismiss so-and-so from the board? Will he give the answer that immediately jumps to his mind, that it might be damaging to the reputation of the person?  There is quite a number of counters to questions of that kind that are put up in such cases, which will close down discussion.  If a member goes on this board with sub-section (4) of Section 8 replaced by <Col N="644" /> some such provision as this: That every ordinary member shall hold office for a period to be specified by the Minister when appointing him, which period shall not be less than a year, and during that period may not be removed except for cause stated to the Dáil by the Minister and approved by a resolution of the Dáil&mdash; if a member accepted appointment under these conditions, he would then know that the conditions under which he might be removed would have to be explained to, and accepted by, the Dáil.  He would take office knowing what would be the consequences.  He would be forewarned and would act accordingly, but he also would have it before him that the Minister had got to come down here and make a statement giving the reasons why he had been dropped from the board.  It would not be a question of merely dropping him and then have a fobbing off of questions with the usual type of answer&mdash;that it was undesirable to have certain things discussed.  We have two things clearly before our minds with regard to this Commission. A colleague of the Minister was spoken to in the Seanad with regard to Commissions in general.  He was then objecting to a Commission being set up &mdash;that the Minister should have all the power.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;There are many objections to a Commission that we need not go into now, whether that Commission be one composed of civil servants or of independent people called together as an advisory body.  We have had some experience of Commissions. I must confess that even the experience which I thought I had did not fully cover what I have seen since I went into this Department. Commissions are very often slow.  Civil Service Commissions are inevitably slow, because they must run within the red tapes afforded by the Department.  Other <Col N="645" /> Commissions, independent or socalled independent Commissions, have in fact operated in the State within the last few years, and I must confess that I have been more disappointed even than I thought I was by realising what some of those Commissions did.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he went on to say that the Minister in charge of a particular Department, working in close conjunction, as he must, with his Executive Council and subject to the Oireachtas&mdash;apart from his Executive Council with his work shown to the public and with everything being known&mdash;is better than any Commission.  Later on, in column 1833, we get this ponderous statement:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not want to refer again to the experience of Commissions&mdash;and I speak with a considerable amount of knowledge of rather disturbing things&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>the Minister for Finance need not be worried.  It does not refer to him&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;but I do not want to see any Commission, and I do not want to see outside or advisory Commissions of so-called independent people.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>And that will not be mud, I suppose.  We have this example. There were many Labour men who could have been appointed on a Board like that, or that may be appointed on the proposed Board, but look at the choice that was made in the former case.  Will the same motives that operated there operate with regard to this?  It has been described by a number of people as simply an opportunity to provide jobs. There is no evidence that this Commission is required.  There is no profiteering.  There are only complaints, and we are going to have people appointed, at salaries presumably, to investigate complaints.  The Minister has given us no information as to the types who will form the members of the Board.  He has not stated whether there will be an accountant or an agriculturist or an experienced person of any kind, and we have all the time to bear in mind that among these representatives there must be two women on the Commission.  We have not got that statement from him and any attempt to get it from him is described either as obstruction or throwing mud.  He could stop any criticism of this type by stating if he has in his mind types and not persons and if he has not individuals before his mind as the suitable people to appoint. Has he a category of people from whom he is going to draw the members?  Let us eliminate, at any rate, certain undesirable categories.  If the Minister likes to sit in a sort of sulky silence certain conclusions will be drawn from that.  The Minister is going to accept, or he will consider, an amendment, provided it is not put down by people who are obviously opposed to this Bill. This rules out this Party.</P>

      <P>When the Minister is here himself he cannot speak of profiteers because he cannot produce evidence with regard to them.  There was a lot of bawling down in the country about profiteering and prices, and about people battening on the poor, and so this had to come along. There is no evidence of it and there is no evidence that the Minister is serious about this Commission.  He has not given us any indication that he has thought about the people he wants to appoint or the categories from which they are to be drawn.  This is flung out with the statement that he did not believe there would be very much work for this Commission.  The Minister reiterated to-day that he has not had evidence produced to him of a prima facie type establishing profiteering. Is the Minister prepared to consider on Report an amendment substituting sub-section (4) by what I have said?  Is he prepared to consider on Report an amendment of this type:&mdash;&ldquo;That every ordinary member will hold office for a specified term not less <Col N="648" /> than one year, and during that specified term he may not be removed except for cause stated to the Dáil and approved by Resolution of the Dail?&rdquo;</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 9.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 9 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that objecting to sections of this Bill really brings home to one more and more how fundamentally rotten the Bill is and how dangerous it is.  We used to regard as one of the bogeys in our youth a person who was known as &ldquo;Peter the Packer.&rdquo;  It was regarded as a great instrument of oppression on the part of the British Government in this country to pack a jury.  You did not pay the jury.  They simply got into the jury box and their only inducement to hang you was that it would get them out quicker than if they disagreed. But the Minister, under Section 9, when he proposes an investigation into the price of any particular commodity, can promptly appoint extra persons to the already established Commission to hear that particular case.  The danger in that is obvious.  If the Minister has already five people on it, in 99 cases out of 100 he would simply appoint one or two more who would be specially qualified to deal with some particular commodity.  But it does not give him the power to do this.  If, for some unscrupulous reason, he desires to discredit some particular merchant or manufacturer, he could arrange that an inquiry would be launched by this Commission and persons could be appointed with a certain knowledge with the deliberate intention of overbearing the Commission and with the purpose present to his mind.  Ordinarily, when he appoints his five Commissioners, they are persons whom he will appoint for general qualities, such as one being a good accountant, another a lady with a wide experience of shopping, a lawyer and so forth.  Having, according to himself, provided a Commission giving scope for a reasonable representation of relevant interests, he takes further powers to put on special members in special cases.  Normally, that power will not be wrongly used, but it can be, in the hands of the Minister, a weapon of great oppression and of great danger.  The tragedy of this is that a price-fixing Bill looks a mild thing, a thing that can really hurt nobody except the wicked profiteer.  As a matter of fact, it can become an instrument of very grave oppression. In this particular case, if the section were being used by an unscrupulous Minister, it could be used to the very grave detriment of the citizens of the State, who would have very little power to defend themselves against him.</P>

      <P>Therefore, the power is given to the Minister to appoint the members of the Commission, and Section 9 is inserted to ensure that, whenever there is an investigation of a kind that will require specialist knowledge, a person with that knowledge can be added to the Commission.  It seems to me eminently reasonable that power to appoint these temporary members with specialised knowledge in certain special circumstances should exist. Section put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he has made up his mind that it is really essential to the success of the Commission that the members should be permanent.  I do not know that we have any evidence before us which would lead us to the conclusion that a permanent Commission is absolutely essential.  The Minister might, as he is aware, set up a Commission for a period of three or five years.  If, at the end of that period, the Minister thought that the circumstances justified the continuance of the Commission, he would have power to continue it.  I think it is hardly wise for the Minister at this stage to express the opinion that a permanent Commission is necessary.  I do not think that the Minister has such evidence before him as would justify him in coming to the conclusion that a permanent Commission is essential. At least, if he has, he has not expressed it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Good's point hardly arises on this section.  Under <Col N="652" /> Part 5 of the Bill it is intended that the Commission should carry out a more or less continuous investigation of the prices charged by manufacturers for protected commodities.  I think it is eminently desirable that there should be a permanent body in existence to watch the course of prices in respect of protected commodities, a body that will report to the Minister when anything unusual occurs or where, in their opinion, an unnecessary increase in price takes place so that, if necessary, action can be taken.  The position is quite different in respect to the functions of the Committee under Part 3 of the Bill.  It would suffice there, perhaps, to have a body that could be brought into existence whenever there was a case for investigation. But under Part 5 of the Bill I think a permanent body is necessary at present. When we have had experience of its working we may reconsider the position as to whether the Bill is necessary or whether it can be modified in any way.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave's point does not arise on this section, but on the following one.  We hope to secure&mdash;this is a point that Deputies who have spoken earlier might note&mdash;that the members of the Commission will act without any remuneration.  I do not think we will have much difficulty in that.  But, of course, it is easy to conceive that it may be desirable to have a person with legal training or an accountant of high standing in his profession a member of the Commission.  In such a case it would be unreasonable to expect that they would give the time necessary without some remuneration.  Consequently, power is taken to pay that remuneration where necessary, but we hope to be able to get members to act without any remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I think it would be well if the Minister were to fix a limited period during which the members of the Commission would act.  If the Minister were to adopt that suggestion it would, I think, make his task easier in getting members to act.  I am sure, as the Minister says, it may be possible to get citizens to discharge these duties in an honorary <Col N="653" /> capacity.  It would be much easier, I think, to get citizens capable of discharging these duties to act if they were not expected to continue as permanent members.  If the period of membership were to be, say, for three to five years I think it would be much better.  It may not be an easy matter at all to get citizens suitable for the position to act on a permanent body. I think that at the outset at all events the Minister ought not to make it a permanent body.</P>

The class of person that would be useful for the one might be quite unsuitable for the other.  I suggest that there are very few women who have had sufficient experience of prices, costings, etc., of a manufacturing business.  They might be suitable for the other type of inquiry on the prices side.  I think it is a ridiculous proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This section sets out that the Commission may make regulations for the governance of its own proceedings. There is no mention in any part of the section that the regulations are to be subject to the approval of the Minister, and as far as I can gather from the Bill they are not to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Commission can make regulations for the conduct of its business, but there is no obligation on it to submit these regulations for the approval of the Minister or of the House.  That seems to be the position as far as I can gather from the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="656" /> Subsequently the Commission is given power to enforce the attendance of witnesses, to examine them on oath similar to the powers vested in the High Court, and subsequently again, the Commission may certify an offence to the High Court for punishment.  It seems a rather strange thing that the Commission shall have power to make regulations, and may make regulations that may be unreasonable, yet a contravention of these regulations would be punishable by the High Court.  It does not seem reasonable that these regulations should not be first submitted to the Minister, and secondly to the House by being published in the House.  For example, the Commission may decide, at any given moment, to hold a meeting in public.  It may summon Patrick Murphy to appear before it according to the regulations which it made.  Patrick Murphy may think in his own interest that to give certain evidence in public he would be reported to the High Court.  To my mind it is not clear, but perhaps the Minister has had legal advice as to how far the High Court is expected to make enquiry.  &ldquo;The High Court,&rdquo; it says in sub-section (2), Section 17, line 14, &ldquo;may, after such inquiries as it thinks proper to make, punish or take steps for the punishment of that person.&rdquo; Would the High Court have power to inquire into and examine into the regulations that the person had contravened. My point is that the Commission itself makes regulations and that for the contravention of these regulations a man may be punished.  In other words, the Commission is doing something that the House should only do; it is defining what should be punishable by law.</P>

      <P>As far as 17 is concerned the offences are if any person summoned as a witness defaults in attending, or refuses to take an oath legally required by the Commission, or to produce any document in his power and control legally required by the Commission, or to answer any question to which the Commission may legally require an answer, or does any other thing which would, if the Commission were a Court of Justice, be contempt of such court.  These are the only offences upon which a certificate can be issued.  The other matters upon which the Commission may make regulations such as the holding of its sittings, the time of its sittings, do not arise.  The Deputy has put his finger on a particular difficulty.  That is the difficulty which arises when a person is summoned as a witness and, at a public sitting, is asked to give information concerning his own business which he does not wish to give in public.  We will have that discussed again on an amendment tabled in the names of Deputy Good and Deputy Dockrell.  We have tried to safeguard that position by putting in a rather elaborate provision prohibiting disclosure of things available only by virtue of the powers of obtaining information conferred upon the Commission. That is a matter that we will discuss later.  But the particular point of having the regulations of the Commission subject either to the approval of the Minister or the Dáil is something that I shall look into.  At the moment I am not clear as to the necessity or whether the particular point made by the Deputy is one inherent in the Bill or whether it does not necessarily arise out of the regulations, but out of the whole scheme.</P>

If my recollection is correct I heard of a case in which some witness appeared before one of those statutory bodies and, refusing to answer a certain question, was committed.

      <P>I do not know how far I am preaching to the converted in proposing this amendment.  Does the Minister realise that in these days when practically every trade has some sort of organisation, if he could get a trade to appear officially before him and to make representations, that if there is anything to investigate and anything to alter, an arrangement made officially with the trade could be more easily carried out, and would be less likely to lead to any misunderstanding or any feeling that the individual representative of the trade had allowed something to go by default, and that if he had realised the question that he was actually asked he might have made a proper submission of all the facts?  I suggest to the Minister that in a case where he could get the representatives of the whole trade in front of him, and with the evidence submitted officially, the Commission will more easily and quickly arrive at a proper finding of all the facts.</P>

    <P>(2)  It shall not be lawful for any person (other than a member or officer of the Commission) who attends a sitting of the Commission to disclose to any person any information acquired through being present at such sitting and which is available only by virtue of the powers of obtaining information conferred upon the Commission or an inspector by this Act.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of sub-section (2), line 42, to add the words:&mdash;Provided always that where a sitting of the Commission is held which is open to the public a report of the proceedings of such sitting may be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owing to sub-section 2 there appears to be some ambiguity in the minds of many people as to how far the proceedings of the Commission may be made public.  <i>(Sub-section read.)</i>  As it stands that sub-section leaves it very indefinite as to what can be published, and I would like to get from the Minister some information as to whether <Col N="661" /> this Commission will follow the procedure that was followed by the Tariff Commission, which was somewhat analagous.  As the Minister will remember, the Tariff Commission held private sittings at which private matters were discussed in detail which it was not desirable to make public.  The Commission at other times held public sittings.  What this amendment aims at is, that the Press shall be at liberty to publish the proceedings of public meetings of the Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the analogy of the Tariff Commission holds in this case.  Obviously the inquiries that are going to be made by this Commission will be of a more intimate nature than those which the Tariff Commission had to conduct.  There is a clear difficulty here which gave considerable trouble in the drafting of the Bill.  If we were to accept the Deputy's amendment, and put in the proviso he suggests, the Commission, I think, would be compelled to hold private sessions every time they were examining a witness who was summoned to attend, and perhaps every time they were examining witnesses in relation to matters likely to be investigated by the Commission.  The questions asked and the information given might be of a very confidential nature relating to the trade of the person concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, we put in this section, sub-section (2) of which makes it unlawful for any person present at a meeting of the Commission to make public &ldquo;any information acquired through being present at such sitting and which is available only by virtue of the powers of obtaining information conferred upon the Commission or an inspector by this Act.&rdquo; It seems to me that that would preclude the reporting of any evidence given on oath, unless the Prices Commission and the witness agreed to its publication.  In effect, by the section we are leaving the nut to the Commission itself to crack, and to make any regulations, in order to ensure a witness appearing before it against damage for publication of evidence. We are making it illegal for the public to give private information which the <Col N="662" /> Commission obtained in exercise of its powers under this Bill.  On the other hand I think it would be unwise to accept the amendment, because it would practically force the Commission always to sit in private.  What we desire is that the Commission, in so far as possible, will do its work in public, while at the same time protecting the witness against damage for publication of the evidence.  The Commission will have to reconcile these two things within the limits prescribed by the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear the Minister say that publicity is desirable, because I think one of the great advantages of a Commission of this kind is wide publicity of the proceedings. We will all be in favour, at all events, of making the task of the Press as easy as we can, so as to get wide publicity.  I am afraid under this sub-section as it stands the task of the Press will be exceedingly difficult.  Is it the intention of the Minister that a report of the proceedings shall be supplied to the Press and that they shall not be at liberty to take their own report, which, as the Minister knows, is customary at such Commissions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It would work out, in my opinion, by the Press reporting speeches made by counsel, and general statements of that kind, and also the evidence of witnesses, except the members of the Commission intimated in advance, or the witness requested the Commission to intimate in advance, that the evidence would not be published, in which case it would be illegal under the section for newspapers to report such evidence.  It is obviously a matter in respect of which it is difficult to make a general rule, because one trader in a particular commodity might say that he had no objection whatever, while another trader in the same commodity might say that there were special reasons which made it desirable that the evidence would be heard in camera.  The Commission has to try to adjust its proceedings, and to go into the difficulties of the situation, while, at the same time, we make it definitely illegal&mdash;except with the general consent of the people concerned&mdash;to give any information that <Col N="663" /> the Commission obtained as a result of the exercise of its powers in Section 17.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see how the Minister is going to solve the matter. I know some persons who would like to give evidence, and who would desire that that evidence would have the widest possible publicity.  In fact, they would be disappointed if it did not get the fullest publicity.  Other members of the Commission might consider that it might be undesirable to publish that evidence and there might be a difference between the witnesses and the Commission.  In the circumstances, what is the Press to do?  I think we should settle the matter.  The procedure at previous Commissions has been settled and it should be settled in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It was interesting to hear the explanation given by the Minister.  I think this shows how different people get different impressions. Deputy Good stated that he was glad to see that the Minister desired publicity.  I listened carefully to the Minister, and it struck me that the Minister was aiming precisely at the opposite.  I am not entering into this in a political sense but, on reading the section, I understood that there is prohibition of publication.  Just as a door must be open or shut, the meetings must be private or public.  I do not understand how you are going to get over the situation.  Take a country town where the Commission meets, and the Press is present, apparently members of the public may be present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Commission so decides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the whole difficulty. Can the Commission decide to hold a public session?  If it does what will happen under sub-section 2 of this section?  Anything that the Commission decides cannot override sub-section 2 of Section 19 when it is <Col N="664" /> passed.  This section prohibits the publication of the evidence.  Practical commonsense tells us that if, in a country town, a meeting of the Commission is held at which persons other than officers of the Commission and witnesses are present, something almost as good as publication in a newspaper, in so far as that country town is concerned, will take place.  That is absolutely certain.  We all know what a country town is.  If a local person is present at a meeting of the Commission in a country town, information as to what takes place at the Commission will go all over the place and in a much worse manner than if it were published in the newspapers.  If it were published, publication would take place according to the ordinary practice of the Press, with certain exceptions, as, for example, when the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; is reporting disturbances at political meetings.  In the ordinary way, however, one gets some sort of accuracy in a Press report. What would appear to happen here would be: You would have Pressmen present but you would not get a Press report; you would get local rumours as to what happened at the Commission and the result, from the point of view of the trader or any interested party attending before the Commission, would be very much worse than if there was a newspaper report of the proceedings published.  I think that, in the ordinary case, the result of the operation of this section would be more damaging to a trader than a fair newspaper report, such as would be given by any reporter and published by a local or Dublin newspaper.  I realise the Minister's difficulty but I think that he is endeavouring to reconcile things that are really irreconcilable. Either the Commission should be given instructions to hold its meetings in private or it should be allowed to make regulations for holding its meetings in public.  It should be provided in the Act that, in the case of a public meeting, a newspaper report may be published. Let these two kinds of meetings have their normal meaning and take their course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the speeches of advocates, I do not know what sort of regulations <Col N="665" /> this Commission will make. They may allow counsel to appear before them.  They may not allow anybody but counsel and witnesses to appear, or they may allow representatives of organised bodies&mdash;organised bodies of consumers, trade associations or trade unions&mdash;to appear before them.  In that case, a speech made by such a representative would surely be privileged.  That is to say, he would be allowed to make the same kind of speech as counsel would make in a court.  If published, that might do considerable damage, because it might contain several accusations.  If portion of it were published and the other portion withheld, you might get a very unfair result.  I cannot understand how this section would work.  I submit to the Minister that the Commission could not, by any kind of human ingenuity, make regulations which would enable them to hold meetings which would be neither public nor private.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Hayes that a sitting must be either private or public.  After all, the Press ought to get a fair hunt.  If they arrive at a Commission, find the doors shut in their faces and ascertain that it is a private sitting, if they publish anything about it, it is their funeral. Equally, if they arrive at a meeting of the Commission which is open to the public, they should be entitled to publish the proceedings.  But it seems to me that the Minister envisages some sort of situation like this&mdash;that at a meeting where opening statements have been heard, and the evidence of A, B and C taken, it may be suggested that the evidence of D be treated as private. Is that the Minister's idea?  If it is, I suggest that it is not quite fair. I do not know whether the Controller is to make that announcement or whether reference to the evidence of that party will appear later.  I suggest that the Minister will have to make up his mind that the meetings of the Commission will be either public or private.  He cannot have a mixture of the two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir James Craig Sir James Craig">
      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>There comes to my mind a situation that arose in regard <Col N="666" /> to the Liquor Commission.  A consumer appeared and gave evidence in which he assailed a company in a provincial town.  He made very serious charges again them.  The newspapers reported a very small part of the evidence in this case.  The company which was assailed had to be communicated with.  When their witness came to give rebutting evidence, the only way it could be done was by those of us on the Commission who had taken notes of the statements made asking him whether these statements were true or not.  That opens up a question with which the Minister should try to deal.  A notice had to be sent to this gentleman to say that his company had been assailed.  When he came to rebut the accusation, he did not know what he had to rebut, because a full report had not been published. I think it is very difficult to decide whether the Commission should sit at certain times in private and at other times in public.  I cannot make up my mind at the moment what would be the best procedure to adopt but I should like to secure that no charges could be made against a person or company without their getting a proper chance of stating their side of the case.</P>

      <P>This is really the vital part: Suppose there is a session being held at which the confidential evidence the Minister is thinking of is to be given.  The witness, when he comes to give that evidence, if the meeting is not called a private meeting, will say: &ldquo;While I am giving this evidence, somebody in the neighbourhood who is really interested in what I am going to say may walk in.&rdquo;  While the evidence may not be disclosed by the Press, it may be disclosed to a person to whom it will be of real importance and who may walk in at any moment.  That will, undoubtedly, affect the evidence such a person will give. I do not think that there is any alternative to allowing confidential evidence of that kind to be given in private, if the person giving the evidence so claims.  I ask the Minister to consider that point.</P>

If serious charges are made against a number of persons in a district or town, or loose charges of profiteering, look at the position. A person comes in and makes these charges.  Will there be an obligation on the Commission to see that these charges in detail are inquired into&mdash;not certainly the name of the person that made them, that is another matter, but at all events that they will be brought there knowing that these charges are made and that these traders will have an opportunity of rebutting them?

      <P>I move amendment 4:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before Section 21 and in Part II of <Col N="670" /> the Bill to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The Minister may appoint the Commission to hold a public inquiry for the purposes of Section 17 of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932 (No. 19 of 1932), and whenever the Minister so appoints the Commission to hold any such inquiry, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the Commission shall hold such inquiry;</P>
    <P>(b)  the provisions of this Part of this Act relating to the following matters, that is to say, regulations for proceedings of the Commission, powers of the Commission, notices of investigation by the Commission and submissions by interested persons, prohibition on disclosure of information and annual reports by the Commission, shall not apply in respect of such inquiry.</P>
    <P>Under Section 17 of the Housing Act of 1932 the Minister for Industry and Commerce has power to hold an inquiry into the prices charged for building materials.  The purpose of this amendment is merely to provide that the Minister may appoint the Commission established by this Bill to hold that investigation.  That Act gives him power to appoint a Commission to hold a public inquiry and have a report.  This is intended for the purpose of enabling the Minister to appoint a Commission to hold a public investigation subject to this, that the regulations for the proceedings of the Commission, powers of the Commission, notices of investigation by the Commission, and submissions by interested persons, prohibition on disclosure of information and annual reports by the Commission shall not apply in respect of such inquiry.  The only provisions that can apply in respect of such inquiry are those contained in the Housing Act.  It is clear that the Minister could appoint five individuals constituting the Commission to hold the inquiry under the Housing Act, but he could not appoint the Commission itself without this <Col N="671" /> amendment.  The Minister will have the staff of the Commission as well.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="677" /> PART V.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Display of Retail Price Lists in Shops.</P>
    <P>(1)  The Commission may make a report (in this Part of this Act referred to as price list report) to the Minister stating that in their opinion it is desirable, in the public interest, that the Minister should make an order under this Part of this Act requiring every person who carries on the business of selling retail either (as may be specified in such report) at any place in Saorstát Eireann or at particular places in Saorstát Eireann any scheduled commodity or commodities to display at the premises where such person carries on such business a list stating the retail price of such commodity or commodities.</P>
    <P>(2)  Every report under this section shall specify:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the reasons why the Commission consider it desirable that the order the subject of the report should be made;</P>
    <P>(b)  a specification of every commodity to which the proposed order should relate;</P>
    <P>(c)  the date on which the Commission recommend the proposed order should come into force, and the duration of such order;</P>
    <P>(d)  the area to which the Commission recommend the proposed order should apply;</P>
    <P>(e)  the manner in which the Commission recommend that the proposed order should require the price list of every such commodity to be displayed.</P>
    <P>During the discussions on the Second Reading, I announced that we had been giving consideration to the possibility of providing that, in certain circumstances, traders would be required to publish a notice indicating the price they were charging at the time for certain commodities.  I also indicated the various difficulties we foresaw would arise if we had a general provision in relation to the publication of prices&mdash;the variety of commodities, the difficulty of distinguishing <Col N="678" /> one quality from another and the fact that a regulation which would apply in one area, and which could be enforced in one area, might not be applicable to the circumstances of another area at all.  We have endeavoured to get over these difficulties in the way set out in the amendment, in which we enabled the Commission to make a report on the question as to whether it is, in their opinion, desirable that an order should be made by the Minister requiring the publication in a specified manner of prices relating to specified commodities in specified districts.  In other words, we provide that no order, requiring publication of these prices, will take place until an investigation into the matter has been made by the Commission and a report furnished.  The report will indicate the reasons why it is considered desirable that an order should be made.  It will specify the commodity or commodities to be covered by the order, the date on which it should come into operation, and the area in which it should operate, and, of course, and this is a matter of considerable importance, the manner in which the price list in respect of the commodities concerned is to be displayed.  There is a feeling in a number of quarters that the publication of these price lists would conduce to better shopping on the part of sections of the community.  Deputy Sir James Craig quoted a statement, made by a member of the Commission on which he served, that if people would only use the necessary diligence while shopping there would be no profiteering and they could procure supplies at the lowest prices.  It may help to develop that attitude, because shoppers, by requiring in respect of certain commodities, where it is feasible to do so, the shopkeeper to publish in some particular manner, outside or inside his shop, a notice indicating the price at which that commodity is on sale on the day on which the notice is displayed.  It will then be feasible for people without undue difficulty, or without placing themselves in circumstances of undue embarrassment, to ascertain, in respect of that commodity in a number of <Col N="679" /> shops, the price at which it is available and that might tend undoubtedly to induce the necessary element of competition and reduced prices.  We are, however, putting the onus on the Commission of finding a way out of the various administrative difficulties which it is easy to foresee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very easy for the Minister to read it off and to say that it is easy to foresee administrative difficulties.  There are certainly going to be administrative difficulties from the point of view of his Department. but the more I listen to the Minister talking about this Bill, the more it is driven in upon me that the Minister has allowed himself to be manoeuvred into the position of regarding the mercantile community in this country as a gang of desperadoes.  Every kind of harassment is to be allowed under his æs, and the latest performance is this list of prices.  Now, I have the most profound respect for the experiences of Deputy Sir James Craig in most matters to which he refers in this House, but he is not a merchant, and I do not think he can be familiar with the variety.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He would not listen to me, and very properly, but, similarly, when he proceeds to tell me that his detachment helps him to form a true judgment of the difficulties of the mercantile community, he must pardon me if I do not listen to him.  The existing Schedule provides that the Commission will take into consideration articles used as food, clothing, material for clothing or fuel.  It is manifestly absurd that a schedule of prices should be put up about clothing. &ldquo;This shop sells trousers at 3/6&rdquo;&mdash; that is manifestly ridiculous.  &ldquo;This shop sells navy blue serge for 7/11&rdquo;&mdash;<Col N="680" /> that is manifestly absurd and, obviously, this proviso cannot apply there.  It is meant to apply in respect of foodstuffs.  I know that the Minister is acquainted with certain branches of what may be described as the dry goods trade, but I do not know that he is acquainted very extensively with the food and provision trade.  If he were acquainted with it, he would know that, in the principal items of the food and provision business prices vary from day to day and week to week, and an order is to be made requiring.</P>
      <P>every person who carries on the business of selling retail, either at any place in Saorstát Eireann or at particular places in Saorstát Eireann, any scheduled commodity or commodities, to display at the premises where such person carries on such business a list stating the retail price of such commodity or commodities.</P>
      <P>Is the suggestion here that the retailer &mdash;I assume it only applies to retailers &mdash;should expose a list of prices at which he is retailing on any given day?  Suppose the Commission fixes a price, say, for Indian meal.  That is the fixed price in that area.  They can fix a price for a given area&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A maximum price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They can fix a maximum price in that given area.  Presumably, it will be against the law for anybody to sell Indian meal for anything over or above that price in that area, even though the price varies to such an extent that it becomes necessary to sell at an increased price.  Without further reference to the Commission, the sale of Indian meal must stop in that area until a further order is made revising the price.  I see now, on closer study of the section, that it simply puts an obligation on a man to schedule his prices for certain commodities.  I confess that when I first read the section I thought it meant that the Minister might fix a certain price which a person would have to display, but it simply requires the publication, in a form to be prescribed, of the prices he is actually charging?</P>

      <P>Well, no.  It might be considered necessary to investigate the price charged for one particular class of article, which would be in a general range subject to the term &ldquo;protected commodity.&rdquo;  For example, it might be decided to investigate the price of agricultural labourers' boots without at the same time carrying out an investigation into the entire range of boot and shoe prices.  That is why the qualifying words are put in there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked on previous occasions when this Vote was under consideration as to whether something could not be done to reduce the expenditure. I might remind the Parliamentary Secretary when I asked on previous occasions the volume of the quit rents that were collected I was informed, I am not quite sure whether by him or his predecessor, that it was something in the region of £8,000?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  It is even less than on the last occasion.  Now it is costing us something like £4,000 to collect £7,000.  That does not seem a very practical proposal to a business man, and I would like to know if this particular office has been the subject of an investigation, to see whether it is desirable in view of the circumstances <Col N="687" /> I have mentioned, to continue it as a separate department, because it is hardly a practical proposition to pay £4,000 to collect £7,000.  Of course I know the Parliamentary Secretary will inform me there are other duties discharged by this particular office, but it does appear to one from inquiry made into the matter that these duties in connection with the investigation of Quit Rents in cases dealt with by the Land Commission might also be dealt with by the legal staff attached to the Land Commission, and that this&mdash;I will not say very expensive office&mdash; unremunerative expenditure of £4,000 to collect £7,000, is one that might be considered and dealt with in a more businesslike way than it is at the moment.</P>

It is even regarded as a dying service, and certainly the question whether it could be merged into some other service will be one of the matters which will be considered, and is in fact actually having consideration.

    <P>Maidir le Bun-Oideachas, níl aon athrú mór le tabhairt faoi deara ná le tuairisc do thabhairt air ó cuireadh na Meastacháin deiridh fá bhrághaid na Dála.  Is beagnach mar a chéile an meán-tinnreamh ar na Bun-Scoileanna i mbliadhna agus anuraidh .i. beagán thar 84% don tír ar fad.  Ins na Baile-Cheanntair mhóra, bhí an méid <Col N="690" /> fá'n gcéad níos aoirde; cuir i gcás, 87.5% i gCathair Phort Láirge, ós cionn 86% i gCathair Choreaigh, i gCathair Luimnigh agus i gCathair Bhaile Átha Cliath.  Agus ní raibh an meán-tinnreamh faoi 80% in aon cheanntar.  Cé go bhfuil an tinnreamh féin seasmhach féadaim a rádh, tá an líon scoláirí fá'n gcéad atá ag freastal ar na hárd-ranganna ag dul i méid do réir a chéile, agus dar liom gurb é sin an toradh is tábhachtaighe a tháinig as an Acht.  Ach is iontuigthe dár ndóighe nach mbíonn an lán-toradh iomlán ar fagháil ná le feicsint go cionn chúpla bliadhain fós.</P>
    <P>Bíodh gur sásamhail liom an tinnreamh, á ghlacadh tríd agus tríd i dtir tuatha mar an tír seo againne, ní féidir liom a rádh go bhfuilim sásta leis na scoileanna féin, maidir leis an slighe atá ionnta do na daltaí.  Do réir tuairiscí na gCigirí tá sé soiléir go gcaithfear feabhas mór do chur ar an gceist seo ar fud na tíre ar fad, agus is baoghal liom go nglacfadh sé timcheall milliún púnt an scéal a léigheas gan trácht ar an tsuim bhliantamhail is gádh do chaitheamh de ghnáth ar thógaint agus ar dheisiú na scol in aghaidh na bliadhna.  Tá Roinn an Oideachais agus Oifig na n-Oibreacha Puiblidhe i gcomhairle le chéile ag féachaint cionnas is fearr an scéal do réidhteach agus tá súil againn go mbéimíd ábalta ar a lán do dhéanamh go cionn roinnt bliadhna chun cóiríocht fhóghanta scol (adequate school accommodation) do sholáthar don tír.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an obair atá déanta ins na scoileanna, ní raibh sé d'uain agam fós fiosrúchán iomlán do dhéanamh fá'n dhul-chun-cinn atá á dhéanamh ins na Bun-Scoileanna.  Do réir an eólais atá le fagháil ó Thuarsgabhála na gCigirí tá sár-obair á déanamh ag trian de na hoidí agus tá obair mhaith á déanamh ag furmhór na codach eile.  Ach ní mór dúinn chuimhneamh go bhfuil beagnach trian de na hoidí atá ann fá láthair gan aon cháilíocht sa Ghaedhilg; agus is mór i geeart an laige agus an cheataighe é sin toisc an dianghádh atá leis an nGaedhilg do réir an chláir nua.  Tá neithe eile fós ag coinneáil cúl ar an obair mar tá an fhaillighe agus an neamart a dheineann <Col N="691" /> a lán múinteóirí gan leanamhaint dá gcuid staidéir agus de léightheóracht i gcoitchinne &mdash; staidéar a bhainfeadh le n-a gcuid oibre mar mhúinteóirí nó staidéar ar ábharaibh eile.  Maidir le héifeachtúlacht na hoibre ins na hábhair léighinn is léar dom nach bhfuil na Cigirí i gcoitchinne sásta leis an dul-chun-cinn atá déanta chun Cainnteoirí Gaedhilge a dhéanamh de na macaibh léighinn.  Obair throm is eadh í, agus níl amhras ar bith ná go mbaintear ó éifeacht na bhFoireann atá ann fá láthair, de bhrigh go bhfuil múinteóir nó dhó i ngach scoil, atá lag ins an nGaedhilg ina lán áiteanna&mdash;fiú in áiteannaibh ina múintear go maith í&mdash;ach amháin mar ghnáth-ábhar scoile.  Ní bhaintear feidhm as stair na hEireann nuair a bítear ag teagasg na Gaedhilge ná ní mhúscaltar meanman agus sprid na leanbhaí, agus is é a thoradh san go léir, nach gcuireann na leanbhaí fíorshuim ins an dteangain go deó.</P>
    <P>Ní buan é éifeacht na hoibre sin chun Eire do Ghaedhealú, agus ní dhéanfaidh teagasc na Gaedhilge don aos óg a n-aigne do spreagadh, mara gcuirtear isteach ina n-aigne i bhfochair na Gaedhilge, teas-ghrádh dá dtír tré theagasc staire na hEireann, agus gan leigint don stair sin a bheith tur tuirseamhail ach a déanamh beó suimeamhail spéiseamhail.  Is tuigthe mhór as an ní sin chun grádh a mhús-múinteoirí ag déanamh sár-oibre ar an dóigh sin, agus go bhfuil a gcuid scoláirí ag glacadh taithnimh do thír agus do dhúithche; ach is baoghalach gur beag an éifeacht atá sa stair a múintear i bhfurmhór na scoileanna chun an gríosadh is cuibhe agus is ceart do thabhairt do chroidhe agus d'aigne an pháiste.  Is féidir an rud céadna a rádh i dtaobh na léightheoir-eachta a déantear sa Bhéarla.  Tá a lán oidí ann a bhaineann feidhm an-mhór as an ní sin chun grádh a mhús-cail do thír na hEireann i dteannta grádh do dheaghlitridheacht; ach, do réir chuma, bíonn a bhfurmhór sásta le obair thur a bheir eolas cuibheasach maith ar an Bhéarla do na mic léighinn ach eolas san am chéadna nach mbíonn mórán usáide ann chun suim agus <Col N="692" /> spéis dáiríríbh a mhusgailt ina gcroidhe sa tsaoghal a bhíonn ina dtimcheall.</P>
    <P>Tuigtear dom go bhfuil feabhas tar éis teacht diaidh ar ndiaidh ar an módh teagaise a bhíodh i réim chun Tíreolaidheacht agus Uimhridheacht do theagase tá tamall bliadhanta ó shoin; agus fós go bhfuil na múin-teóirí ag déanamh cleachtaidh i ndiaidh a chéile ar nósa níos oilte agus níos intleachtúla chun na hábhair sin a theagasc.  Maidir leis na hábhair is deacra ná iad san, mar atá, an Mhatamaitice, Tuath-eólas, et rl, ní shamhluigheann an caighdeán (stan-dard) a bheith árd.  Ins na ranga is aoirde amháin iseadh a múintear na hábhair sin ó thús agus is ins na ranga céadna san is laige a shamhluigheann obair na scoileanna a bheith i gcoitchinne.  Ó thárla anois gur éigean do leanbhaí idir a 12 agus a 14 leanúint de thinnreamh i Scoileanna Náisiúnta caithfear iniúchadh níos iomláine a dhéanamh ar na ceisteanna a bhaineas le hoideachas na n-óg i mBun-Scoileanna san tréimhse athrúcháin seo.  Tá deacrachtaí móra ag gabháil le hoideachas éifeachtúil do thabhairt do mhic-léighinn den chineál san i ngach tír, ach is deacra go mór ceist dá leithéid sin a réidhteach i ndúthaigh tuaithe mar atá againn-ne, agus gan i bhfurmhór na scoileanna againn ach dhá oide do na ranganna uile.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an méid Múinteoirí Bunscoile atá ar fáil is áthas liom a rádh go bhfuil feabhas tagtha ar an scéal ar gach bealach.  I gcás na mban táthar lán-tsásta leis an méid iarra-thóirí atá ar fáil do na Coláistí Oiliúna agus i gcás na bhfear tá an líon ag méadú.  Tá an caighdeán dóibh seo atá ag dul isteach sna Coláistí sin ag ardú i ngeall ar go bhfuil socrú déanta le go líonfar na folúntaisí go léir beagnach feasta le mic léighinn a bhfuil oideachas meán-scoile ortha agus a fuair Ard-Teistiméireacht na Meán-Scoile. Cé's muite de líon beag congantóirí nea-oilte atá sa tSeirbhís cheana tá cúrsa Meán-Scoile nó cúrsa Ollscoile déanta ag bunáite gach mac léighinn a leigtear isteach in sna Colaistí Oiliúna anois.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="693" /> Gan aimhreas, sé rud a thiocfas as an socrú nuadh seo go n-árdóchar go maith caighdeán an oideachais do mhúinteóirí i Scoileanna Náisiúnta agus ba cheart go gcuirfeadh seo feabhas mór ar obair na scol.</P>
    <P>I dteannta an caighdeán generálta d'árdú do na múinteóirí tá dóchas, ó thárla gur tríd an nGaedhilg a gheibh-eann an chuid is mó de na daoine atá ag dul le múinteoireacht in sna Coláistí Oiliúna a gcuid oideachais go léir, go dtiocfaidh feabhas tapaidh ar eolas na Múinteoirí ar an nGaedhilg mar theangain teagaisc faoi cheann cúpla blian.</P>
    <P>Tugadh cuntas ins na Tuarasgbhála Bliantúla cheana ar na modhanna le n-ar chuir Roinn an Oideachais an feabhas úd ar chaighdeán oideachais na n-adhbhar múinteoirí.  Ní gádh dom-sa trácht a dhéanamh air sin annso arís. Ba mhian liom a rádh, amh, go bhfuil feabhas mór tagtha ar stáid na Gaedhilge ins na Coláistí Oiliúna ó tháinig scoláirí isteach ionnta ó na Coláistí Ullmhucháin i mbliana (1931) agus anuraidh (1930).  Sí an Ghaedhilg gnáth-theanga na gColáistí Catoiliceach faoi láthair agus is tríd an nGaedhilg a deantar an chuid is mó den teagasc ionnta.  Maidir leis na páipéirí scrúdú-cháin a freagartar i nGaedhilg táid ag dul i líonmhaireacht in aghaidh na bliana agus is dóigh liom go mbeidh breis a's 80 faoi'n gcéad de mhic léighinn na gColáistí Catoiliceach ag déanamh a scrúdúchán tríd an nGaedhilg an bhliain seo chugainn (míle naoi gcéad triocha a's a dó).  Tá feabhas mór i gcúrsaí na teangan tagtha ar Choláiste Oiliúna Eaglais na hEireann freisin ce nach bhfuil sé ar aon dul leis na Coláistí eile nídh nach iongna.</P>
    <P>Tá an Roinn ag iarraidh an scéal seo d'fheabhsú a thuille.  Is mó líon tighe bocht sa nGaeltacht nach mbeadh sé de ghustal aca páistí a chur go Coláiste Ullmhúcháin agus ní hé amháin go dtugann Roinn an Oideachtais saor-áiteanna ins na Coláistí Ullmhúcháin do ghársúin is do chailíní cliste ón bhfíor-Ghaeltacht ach tugtar costas éadaigh a's taistil dóibh freisin agus spreagtar na múinteoirí le h-iad d'ullamhú i gcóir na scrúduithe.  Mar sin tá i bhfad Eireann níos mó páistí ó Chonamara <Col N="694" /> agus ó Thír Chonaill ag déanamh na scrúduithe anois.</P>
    <P>Ní fada go mbeidh na scoláirí sin ag múineadh ar fuaid na tíre agus ba cheart go mba mhór an chabhair iad leis na scoileanna a Ghaedhealú.  Ina éagmais sin is mór an rud oideachas agus obair a thabhairt do mhuintir na fíor-Ghaeltachta nach raibh fiú Cothrom na Féinne á fháil aca le fada. Tuigtear dóibh anois gurab í an Ghaedhilg a thugann na buntáistí speisialta san dóibh.</P>
    <P>Tríd is tríd feictear dom go raghaidh Bun Oideachas na Tíre 'n cinn go maith ó thaobh na Gaedhilge agus ó thaobh an Oideachais féin mar beidh Gaedhilgeoirí óga agus oideachas maith ortha ag teagasc ins na scoileanna feasta.</P>

      <P>Before I proceed to deal with the two questions I asked to-day and the reason that I found the replies unsatisfactory, I should like to know if the Minister for Justice requires any long time to reply to any observations I may have to offer or is he going to confine himself to the abbreviated answer he gave to-day? It may be necessary to divide the time somewhat between us.  Does the Minister say that he will require a long time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I offered to divide the time with him but he does not want to.  I raised two questions which were replied to together by the Minister for Justice.  I asked if he would state:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="695" />&ldquo;(a) the offence with which Charles Dullea was charged at the Cork Circuit Court Criminal Sittings last March; (b) the result of this trial and the sentence imposed; (c) the term actually served by Charles Dullea; (d) whether the trial judge recommended for or against the remission of sentence; (e) whether the Minister for Justice recommended the remission and (f) the general grounds on which sentence was remitted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I asked very much the same question and the same particulars in regard to Doctor Levison except that in the second question I put in &ldquo;if any appeal on the matter came before the Court of Criminal Appeal and, if so, what was the result.&rdquo;  The replies were given together and I want to say that I am entirely satisfied with what was given to me in regard to the particulars asked for under (a), (b) and (c) in the first case and (a), (b), (c) and (d) in the second case.  These satisfactory points were as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Charles Dullea was convicted on two charges of rape (against the same person on two separate occasions) at Cork Circuit Court on 21st March, 1932 and was sentenced to three years' penal servitude on each charge, the sentence to run concurrently.</P>
    <P>He was committed to prison on that date, 21st March, 1932, and was released on 17th June following.</P>
    <P>This gentleman was convicted of two charges of rape, committed to prison on 21st March, and released on 17th June.  So the Minister states.</P>
    <P>Human Levison was convicted at Dublin Circuit Court on 16th December, 1931, of being a principal in the second degree to using an instrument to procure miscarriage and of conspiracy to use an instrument for that purpose.  He was sentenced to three years' penal servitude for the first offence and to 12 months' imprisonment for the second offence, the sentences to run concurrently.  He was committed to prison on that date, 16th December, 1931.  An application <Col N="696" /> to the Court of Criminal Appeal for leave to appeal was refused.  He was released on 7th July, 1932.</P>
    <P>So this gentleman who was convicted in the second degree of using an instrument to procure miscarriage&mdash;a slightly different offence from the other, but equally disgusting&mdash;and of conspiracy to use an instrument for that purpose, and who got a sentence of three years' penal servitude and was committed to prison on 16th December last year, was released on 7th July of this year.</P>
    <P>As far as the remaining items were concerned, I got what I consider a most unsatisfactory reply.  I asked did the trial judge recommend for or against the remission of sentence.  I was told:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It is not the practice to disclose the reasons for the exercise of the prerogative in such cases, or the nature of the recommendation made by the trial judge.</P>
    <P>I did not ask for the nature of the recommendation.  I asked a simple question&mdash;did he recommend for or against the remission of sentence?  I was fobbed off with the answer that &ldquo;it is not the practice to disclose the reasons for the exercise of the prerogative or the nature of the recommendation.&rdquo; I was told in each case &ldquo;The release was on my recommendation.&rdquo; Therefore, the Minister has recommended, in the case of a gentleman convicted of two charges of rape against the same person on two separate occasions, sentenced to three years' penal servitude, and committed to prison on 21st March, that he should be released on 17th June following. The Minister has also accepted the responsibility to this House for having recommended&mdash;and for getting the Executive Council to accept the recommendation&mdash;the release of a man convicted of procuring miscarriage and of conspiracy to use an instrument for that purpose, who was sentenced to three years' penal servitude last December and was released on 7th July of this year.  The Minister simply states that his recommendation for release was issued in the exercise of the prerogative, and then he hides himself <Col N="697" /> behind the statement that it is not the practice to disclose the reasons for the exercise of the prerogative.</P>
    <P>It must be very apparent to anybody who knows the atmosphere of this country with regard to sexual crimes, and to anybody who knows the Catholic mind that runs through this country generally and the peculiar view&mdash;the strict, rigid view&mdash; which is taken with regard to all such offences, that the public mind is apt to be gravely disquieted by the fact that a man convicted of rape against the same person on two separate occasions and sentenced to three years' penal servitude for the offence, was released after three months, and that a man convicted of being a principal in the second degree to using an instrument to procure miscarriage and of conspiracy to use an instrument for that purpose, and sentenced to three years' penal servitude, was also released after a few months. One would have thought that a person appreciative of that point of view would have taken the opportunity of explaining, at least to this House, that the Trial Judge had recommended the releases.  If that answer had been given, the public mind, which has been gravely disquieted over the cases of these two people, convicted of two outrageous offences, would have been to some extent, satisfied.  The Minister, however, says that it is not the practice to disclose the nature of the recommendation made.</P>
    <P>I am not going to go into the sordid details of either of these cases, but I do want to say with regard to the case of Charles Dullea, convicted by a jury and sentenced to three years' penal servitude and released after a few months, that, after his release, he was sued civilly in Cork for an alleged indecent assault committed on the 16th November last&mdash;the same occasion and the same act which got him the three years on the criminal charge previously.  When the case came into court, it was then made known to the Judge that this gentleman had been released.  His lordship then stated that if he was released it was against his lordship's <Col N="698" /> advice.  In the Judge's own words: &ldquo;I stated that there was no ground on which he should be released.&rdquo; The Minister says that that is a very improper observation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGeoghehan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Geoghegan) James Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Geoghegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>A very improper observation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not more improper than the Minister's conduct in releasing the man and failing to give a reason for his release, and if it be put to the test of the public conscience it will be found, I think, that the Judge will stand higher than the Minister.</P>
      <P>However, the case went on.  The girl was produced and gave evidence; so did the doctor and the girl's father. Was there a plea entered by the prisoner&mdash;remember that this was after the Minister had been moved in some way to release this man, and presumably, on this man's behalf, some plea was made which moved the Minister to get him released, and now he appears in Court charged civilly with the same offence&mdash;does he put forward any plea on his own behalf?  No. A solicitor examines him on the point only of means as to what damages he can pay.  The defendant in his evidence stated that: &ldquo;the greater portion of his farm of about 60 acres was mountainy land.  He had a wife and six young children, and was obliged to pay his father and mother £6 per year, in addition to meeting all the obligations on the farm.  It was urged on his behalf that he was poor and could not bear heavy damages.  His lordship said he had to give the girl damages which he thought her entitled to; it would be a big sum, but having regard to the position of the defendant he would fix the amount at £250.  He allowed costs, and ordered £50 to be paid within fourteen days and the balance within six months.&rdquo;  The foregoing is from the newspaper report of the trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us get that in perspective.  A man is tried criminally on two charges of rape, as the Minister has put it himself, against the same person on two separate occasions; is convicted and sentenced to three years' penal servitude on each charge to run concurrently. <Col N="699" /> He is put into prison on 21st March and is released on the following 17th June.  He is released for some reason unknown to this House, and certainly for some reason, as it appears, unknown to the Judge.  He comes before a civil court for the same offence, only this time he is being sued civilly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGeoghehan" hpid="Mr. Geogheban Mr. Geogheban">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geogheban</NameTxt>
      <P>The same Judge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And the same Judge. It was a jury which found him guilty the first time and if the Minister thinks that the judge was wrong in making that remark&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGeoghehan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>His name was improperly introduced by you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from the newspaper, and his name would not have been introduced at all if the Judge had recommended the release, but the Minister thought to hide himself behind a principle which he raised for the occasion.  This man this time was sued civilly before the Judge who gave him sentence after a jury had found him guilty and the man did not put in any evidence on his own behalf. He merely pleaded inability to pay heavy damages.  The Minister shelters behind the prerogative; it is not desirable to have the prerogative discussed. I agree there are limits within which the prerogative should be discussed or might be discussed in this House, but when the public conscience is excited by a person convicted of rape and sentenced to three years being let out after three months, is the public conscience not to be allayed by having it stated that the Judge at the trial did recommend against the remission or that he recommended for it?  The Minister will not state that.  What is undesirable in having it stated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the mere statement that the Judge recommended that the sentence should be remitted had been made, as it could have been made, to the House to-day, it would probably have satisfied most people.  The thing to be noted is that there was no appeal made by Charles Dullea against the sentence on a criminal charge and an appeal was open on a variety of grounds.  No appeal was <Col N="700" /> taken.  The appeal was to the Minister who had not seen the trial, who had not seen the witnesses and who had no capacity to judge from the demeanour of the people where right lay and where wrong was.  Then, as to the aftermath, when that same individual was sued civilly on the same charge he did not enter any defence for himself.</P>
    <P>I now come to the case of Dr. Levison. According to the Minister, he was convicted, on the count of being principal in the second degree, of using an instrument with a view to procuring miscarriage and of conspiracy to use an instrument for that purpose.  He also got three years and he served from mid December until July of this year. Then he too was released, but his case went through a different procedure.  He was tried here in Dublin.  There was a certain point in the trial.  Counsel defending him asked for a direction, submitting that there was no legal evidence of conspiracy against him.  The Judge refused the application and the trial proceeded.  The newspaper report of the winding-up of that case states that the Judge charged the jury at length and said that the offence of performing an illegal operation, with a view to miscarriage was a very serious one&mdash; second only to the capital offence.  The Minister who released this man probably knows that himself.  The jury retired and, returning after a certain time, they found Levison guilty on the count of being principal in the second degree.  Applications for certificates for leave to appeal were made and the Judge said he would decide the matter in the morning.</P>
    <P>Eventually the case came before the Court of Criminal Appeal.  It was there argued for a couple of days.  According to the newspaper reports, in the application of Levison there were fourteen grounds in which it was submitted that the verdicts were unreasonable, perverse, unsupported by evidence, and against the evidence; that the evidence of the girl was inadmissible on the count of conspiracy; that the trial was unsatisfactory and that there had been a miscarriage of justice.  The judgment of the Court was read by one of the Judges who said that the Court saw no reason for holding that the trial was <Col N="701" /> unsatisfactory and were of opinion that there was no reasonable ground to interfere with the verdict of the jury.</P>
    <P>Again, let us get this into proper perspective.  A man stands his trial before a jury and the jury convict him. He is sentenced to three years.  He takes an appeal and the appeal introduces all these things I have referred to.  At the end the Court of Criminal Appeal say that they saw no reason for holding that the trial was unsatisfactory and were of opinion that there was no reasonable ground to interfere with the verdict of the jury.  A further application was thereupon made for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court on the ground that the decision involved a point of law of exceptional public importance.  The answer of the Court was that the Court considered that no point of law of exceptional public importance was involved in their decision and they refused the application.</P>
    <P>The Minister recommends the release and the Executive Council accept that. When I seek to get some information on this point&mdash;and I want the phraseology I used in the question attended to&mdash;I am really refused an answer.  I asked in each case whether the trial judge recommended for or against the remission of sentence, whether the Minister for Justice recommended the remission and the general grounds on which sentence was remitted.  Why may we not be told in a case of this type that the trial judge recommended the remission of sentence or that he did not?  May I suggest that the present Government, which has not shown itself very anxious to keep confidential information confidential, would not have failed to say that the trial judge had recommended a remission if, in fact, the trial judge had recommended it? Why this peculiar delicacy about stating matters of this kind?</P>

      <P>I say that if we had been told the trial judge had recommended a remission, if, in fact, the trial judge had done so, we would have been satisfied.  I can see nothing undesirable in that simple statement being made.  I could see quite a lot of undesirable remarks flowing from the reasons that were given, if they were to be gone into in detail. I can see no reason whatever for refusing to state that the trial judge did or did not recommend remission. I have asked for the general grounds upon which the sentences were remitted. If I had asked the Minister to go into a long, detailed explanation, he could have refused.  On the other hand, he could have stated that fresh evidence had been brought before him; he could have stated various things.</P>

      <P>The Minister could have said various things, but he did not state any of those things.  He hides himself behind this idea, that it is undesirable to have the reasons disclosed&mdash;that it is not the practice to disclose the reasons for the exercise of the prerogative in such cases or the nature of the recommendation made by the trial judge.  Does the Minister not consider, in such bad cases as these, involving very bad sexual offences, one of which must undoubtedly excite the public conscience &mdash;that is, the growth of such offences as the procuring of miscarriage&mdash;that it would have been far more desirable even to give the detailed grounds&mdash;no matter what they might have led to&mdash; upon which the Executive Council accepted his recommendation to release these two people?  The Minister has not decided to do so and he can stand before the public hereafter as the man who released, after three months, a person who had been convicted of rape and sentenced to three years.</P>

      <P>If the Minister wants me to take it to myself he should let me know what it is.  In the case of a man who was given three years for using an instrument for a certain purpose, the Minister thought fit to release him after seven months.  He hides in each case behind the prerogative and he will not say whether the trial judge recommended it or did not recommend and what are the general grounds on which the Executive Council acted.</P>

      <P>It has been suggested that this man, Charles Dullea, and, I suppose, this man Levison, had such a grip over the Party to which I <Col N="704" /> belong that, without rhyme or reason, or without any pretence of right, they have been released from terms of penal servitude.  Charles Dullea was so anxious to enlist the services of the Fianna Fáil Party to influence me to do something corrupt that, instead of presenting his petition, as hundreds of prisoners present petitions (practically all of them unsuccessfully), by sending it to me directly or by sending it to me through some intermediary, he is such a pal of the Fianna Fáil Party that he adopts the course of sending his petition direct to the Governor-General, and the Governor-General on 12th May graciously sends it to my secretary.  A very subtle way of reaching the heart of the Fianna Fáil Party; a very unusual way, I may say, of presenting a petition.  The Deputy put certain questions to me to-day and I answered that I felt that it is in the highest degree undesirable that the grounds on which the prerogative of mercy is exercised should be stated; that it is undesirable to drag the name of the judge into this matter by saying that he made a recommendation for or against, that he made a recommendation at all, or that he was consulted. The responsibility is upon me. The responsibility on me is a much wider responsibility than that thrown on either judge or jury.  They are restricted by well-known, well-defined, inflexible rules of evidence.  It is part of my duty to try to ascertain the truth, to ascertain it even by hearsay, provided it is reliable hearsay, to take every circumstance into account.  If I had a little longer time to do it, I would put that to the House in language more eloquent than I have at my command.  I refer to the report of the Committee that inquired nearly thirty years ago into the Adolph Beck case.  Let me quote a little of it.  That Committee said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Committee complain that the failure to release Beck was due to the failure of the Home Office officials in the Petition Section to grasp the legal points in the petition which, if grasped, must have resulted in his release.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Further they say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Home Office has already <Col N="705" /> power to redress miscarriages arising out of findings of fact.  Even where partial guilt only is clear, the wide jurisdiction under the prerogative of mercy admits of a large discretion in re-adjusting sentences. The Secretary of State is not invariably guided by the Judge's opinion; in some cases he has acted contrary to the Judge's opinion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is a long time since that report was issued and we are supposed to have progressed a good deal since in point of time.  Some people think that we have progressed, if I might say so, in a geographical sense too; that possibly we might take an even more liberal view in this country than was taken in England, at all events the England away back in the early part of this century.  As is pointed out in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in the Levison case, the Court of Criminal Appeal or the Judge of First Instance has no power to interfere in a question of fact.  That was pointed out in the Court.  The Deputy might have taken the precaution of reading that judgment before he launched this attack.  If the Deputy had taken the trouble to read the charge of the learned Circuit Court Judge of Dublin to the jury in the Levison case, not merely would the Deputy have refrained from introducing the matter in the House, but he would have marvelled how any jury, in the teeth of that charge, could have convicted Levison.  At all events, the Minister for Justice, as the repository, in effect, of the prerogative of mercy, is the only person who can redress such a wrong, if it is done.  There is no other machinery in the country.  I would be wanting in my duty if I did not do it.</P>

      <P>I have only now a few seconds to conclude and there are a few more observations I should like to have made.  Let me say this, however. If any Deputy is genuinely interested in the principles upon which the prerogative of mercy is exercised, these principles could have been discussed here without the introduction of the name of any person. Some Deputies would have thought it was not a courageous thing to drag in the name of Levison and Charles Dullea, men who are not here to answer back; men for whom it is not part of my duty to answer.</P>

      <P>My function is an entirely different one.  My function is to see that any man against whom guilt has not been proved is not kept in jail.  It is not enough for me to be told that the Catholic mind is excited or that Charles Dullea may have committed a sin.  What I must see to is, whether there has been guilt duly proven against him and, if there has not, I have a duty, and it is a duty I will not shirk and I will not be intimidated even by questions like this.  If a case arises to-morrow or the next day, in which I am satisfied, as fully as I was satisfied in this, I will again exercise the prerogative of mercy without the slightest fear of an illjudged and unfair question being placed on the Order Paper.</P>
