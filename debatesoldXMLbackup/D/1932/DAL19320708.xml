      <P>In moving the Second Reading of this Housing Bill I believe it is unnecessary to dwell at any great length on the urgent necessity of such a measure. There is no matter of the many important matters calling for immediate attention that is to-day more pressing than the provision of proper housing accommodation for the many thousands of our people who are improperly housed.  Housing conditions in our cities and towns have been for many years a subject of reproach to our administrations, central and local. Personally I have regarded it as a stain on our national honour that the housing conditions of our poorer <Col N="512" /> classes have been permitted to increase in wretchedness instead of improving during the last ten years.</P>
      <P>The aim of this Bill now moved by this Government is to end the housing problem.  We hope to provide inside a period of ten years adequate and sanitary houses for all our people at present improperly housed.  It is known to everyone in the country that housing conditions of the poorer classes of our population have been and continue to be unsatisfactory.  It is, I believe, reasonable to expect that the housing problem, unless tackled in a resolute way at once, will become more acute than ever in the near future as a result of the cessation of emigration.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance in his Budget speech of this year announced that a sum of not less than £5,000,000 would be provided immediately as a beginning to assist local authorities in eradicating the housing evil.  The Bill now before us gives effect to the promises then made and sets out in detail how the Government proposes to provide assistance to local authorities and private persons for the building of suitable dwellings.  The Budget of this year imposed heavy financial burdens on our people, but even those upon whom those burdens pressed most heavily will, I think, find considerable consolation for their sacrifices if they feel assured that one result of the additional burdens they are being asked to bear will be the disappearance of the slum evil in our cities and towns and the insanitary dwellings in our rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unnecessary to remind citizens of Dublin of what the housing conditions of our poorer classes here are. It must be known to them that more than one-fourth of the total population of our capital is housed in one-roomed tenements.  Attention has often been called in this House and in the press to the abominable housing conditions in Dublin, but I think it will scarcely be denied that, proportionately speaking, housing conditions in Cork, Limerick and other cities and large towns in the country are equally bad.  So deeply impressed is the Government with the urgency of <Col N="513" /> this problem, and the necessity for tackling it in a resolute way, it has decided that, whatever the cost, the poor must be properly housed in town and country.</P>
    <P>It has been reported to me that the financial terms offered to local authorities and private persons in this Bill have been criticised as over-generous. To those offering such criticism I would say that in my opinion it will pay the nation well to pay the price, whatever it may be, necessary to abolish the slums and the insanitary dwellings and to do this in as short a time as possible. The effect on the Nation's health, moral and physical, of providing adequate healthy dwellings for all our people is incalculable.  Much of the money we are now obliged to spend on public health services, on the eradication of tuberculosis, on public hospitals, on mental homes and sanatoria, will, I feel assured, be available for other useful purposes as soon as we have ended, once and for all, the abominable housing conditions which have been our shame for too long.</P>
    <P>In speaking of the insanitary housing conditions as being a cause of shame to us may I say that it is not my wish to have it understood that the late Free State Government is to be blamed for these conditions?  I have said it in this House and elsewhere and I would like to repeat that the housing conditions in Dublin and in the country were disgraceful when the late administration took office.  These abominable housing conditions existed during the period of the British administration. They arose because of British administration and from hereditary and economic causes arising out of foreign domination.  The British administration not alone did not make an adequate attempt to provide sanitary dwellings for our people but in my own experience they hampered the earnest efforts that were made, at least by the Dublin Corporation in my time, to meet the housing needs of the citizens of Dublin. The charge I would levy against the late administration on the subject of housing is, that while they passed several Housing Bills, good enough <Col N="514" /> each and every one of them in their way, none of these Bills made a real attempt to tackle the slum evil.</P>
    <P>In the Free State there are about 600,000 inhabited dwellings.  During the past ten years, under several schemes, over 26,000 houses have been provided by local authorities, public utility societies and private persons.  In respect of these houses grants amounting to about £2,500,000 have been made. These houses were provided as follows by the various agencies of house supply:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Of these 13,700 are situate in urban areas and 12,300 in rural areas.  Notwithstanding the provision of this considerable number of houses it is estimated that more than 60,000 houses more are required to meet immediate needs (including the replacement of existing insanitary dwellings).</P>
    <P>I do not wish to undervalue the housing achievements of the last administration.  It is undeniable that high building costs militated to a great extent against housing progress during a great part of the last decade and this and other economic factors acted as a deterrent to those faced with the housing problem.  I would like to point out, however, that the rate of house-building of the last ten years would never be sufficient to solve our housing problem.  House production at the average rate of 2,600 houses per annum&mdash;that is the rate of the last ten years&mdash;provides only for replacements of our existing 600,000 houses at a rate of less than one half of one per cent. per annum. It is questionable whether this rate of progress would meet normal depreciation, but it is certain that it would never make any inroads on the enormous existing housing needs.  It is evident that, notwithstanding the provision of 26,000 houses in the past ten years, the slums problem has become more acute than ever during that period and that a much greater rate of production must be reached before we can begin to overtake the housing arrears with which we are at present faced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> It is true that it is only comparatively recently that building costs have come down to a figure at which houses could be built for the very uneconomic classes without saddling State and local funds with enormous losses.  Even now building costs are high, but it is the considered view of the Government that, notwithstanding this, further delay in dealing with the slums cannot be permitted.  Every year the problem becomes more acute and, unless it is to be permitted to engulf our whole national life, it must be attacked at once in a spirited and determined way.  A beginning must be made with the most needy cases for persons living in slums and for every new house provided at least one insanitary house must be removed.</P>
    <P>The Housing Act passed last year aimed mainly at slum clearance.  The provisions of that Act in regard to procedure for slum clearance schemes of urban local authorities, and for dealing generally with unhealthy houses, provide most useful machinery, which it is intended to bring into use in the contemplated housing programme. The financial provisions of that Act, however, were not such as would enable local authorities to deal in any effective way with the slums problem. Local authorities, operating under that Act, could not let the houses at rents low enough to enable them to accommodate the really needy classes, and if substantial schemes were undertaken the charge on the local rates would be prohibitive in most cases.  With such financial provisions it is clear that the desired result, the eradication of the slums, could not be achieved.</P>
    <P>Emerging out of the mass of factors bearing on the housing and slums problems is the salient fact that these problems are mainly financial.  No amount of legislation, no quantities of plans and specifications can in themselves achieve anything if the money is not available to buy the bricks and mortar, and pay the labour.  The financial side of the problem is nevertheless briefly stated.  We have on the one hand the prospective tenant whose ability to pay is limited, and on the other hand the agencies of house <Col N="516" /> supply unable to bring down costs to such a figure as will enable the economic rent to come within the limited paying ability of the prospective tenant.  It is clear that the difference between the paying ability of the tenant and the economic rent must be bridged by public moneys, and that the loss entailed in this must be borne between the Central and local funds.  Of course every human effort must be made to reduce the disparity between the paying ability of the tenant and the economic rent, but house production at the highest rate possible must proceed in the meantime.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Housing Bill to which I am asking this House to give a Second Reading offers the key to the solution of the entire problem in the shortest time possible.  It aims at bringing into play all agencies of house supply to the greatest possible degree of effectiveness and the financial provisions of the Bill are framed to enable the most needy classes in the community to be dealt with at once.</P>
    <P>Securing the greatest rate of progress that is physically possible, it is believed that it will take almost ten years to wipe out the existing arrears in housing and restore a position in which normal activity to provide for replacements will prevent a recurrence of the problem.  The Government has no intention of spending as much as one penny unnecessarily in carrying out this programme and from the outset, concurrently with the building of houses to meet the needs of the most urgent cases, work will be carried out in checking existing surveys of needs, investigating the financial circumstances of those requiring houses, pursuing efforts to effect economies in construction and reduction of building costs generally and examining the various other aspects of the problem.</P>
    <P>It is expected that under the present Bill over one-fourth of the total estimated need will be provided within the next three years and in the light of the experience gained during that period proposals to deal with the balance of the problem will be framed.  It is the intention of the Government that building work will be continuous until <Col N="517" /> the total housing demands are fully satisfied and every insanitary house in the State has been removed.</P>
    <P>In urban areas the main source of supply will be the local authority operating under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts.  Provision is included in Section 22 of the Bill for shortening procedure in connection with slum clearance schemes and the compulsory acquisition of land, but otherwise the existing machinery of the Housing of the Working Classes Acts as amended last year will remain unaltered.  The financial provisions of the Bill are framed so as to enable these local bodies to undertake at once comprehensive schemes to clear out all slums and provide their total housing needs without putting an undue charge on, the rates.  That is explained in Section 6 (1).  For slum clearance schemes the State will pay up to two-thirds of the annual charges on loans. That is a heavy charge, but we think it is necessary.  This will enable a house, costing £300, of which the economic weekly rent (inclusive of rates) would be about ten shillings, to be let at a weekly rent of say three shillings, inclusive of rates, without a greater loss to the local authority than £5 per annum.  In the larger areas where costs will be higher a house costing £400 of which the economic inclusive weekly rent would be about fourteen shillings could be let at an inclusive weekly rent of, say, five shillings with an annual loss to the local authority of in or about £6.</P>
    <P>The Government are prepared to make the maximum contribution permissible under the Bill so long as they are satisfied that the houses are let to the most needy applicants and that the rents charged are not unnecessarily low in any case.  Matters of that kind will require strict supervision, but we propose to make all the provision necessary for such strict examination in every case.  Local authorities must, therefore, exercise the greatest care in the fixing of rents and the selection of tenants and the tenants must be selected with strict regard to income of family, size of family and nature of existing accommodation.  The payment of subsidy will be conditional on these <Col N="518" /> matters being carefully attended to by each local authority and if any case be found in which the spirit of the Bill is not honoured I will not hesitate to stop the subsidy in that case.</P>
    <P>It may not be out of place if I throw out a hint about building costs at this point.  It is proposed to take power in the Bill (Section 6 (4)) to fix maximum costs over which subsidy will not be paid, and any attempt to increase costs will not be tolerated.  There are other provisions included in the Bill (Sections 15 and 16) to cope with any emergency of this kind and these I will deal with later.</P>
    <P>To return to the financial provisions of the Bill, so far as urban local authorities are concerned, it will be observed that by Section 5 (1), provision is made for the payment of grants, up to 60 per cent. of the cost, for the acquisition and renovation of existing houses.  This is a point that should interest Dublin in particular. This provision will be applicable particularly to the larger areas, where building costs of new houses are high and there is a class that will be unable to pay even the low inclusive rent at which new houses in these areas can be let.  The existing houses when renovated are to be managed by philanthropic societies or similar bodies of persons, and the financial assistance now to be made available will enable the provision of good sanitary dwelling accommodation for this class at inclusive rents averaging between 2s 6d. and 3s. weekly.  Provision on these lines was included in the 1931 Act, but the amount of the grant provided in that Act would not enable the rents to be fixed low enough, and local authorities were not permitted to borrow for the purpose.</P>
    <P>I would very specially like to call the attention of philanthropic societies and charitable organisations in Dublin to that section of the Bill, and to call their attention to the generous grants that are now provided, so that an effort may be made, even outside local authorities, to provide proper accommodation for the very poor and very uneconomic classes it is intended to deal with.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="519" /> For the provision of new houses under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts for the accommodation of persons, not displaced from insanitary houses, but at present living in over-crowded or otherwise unsuitable houses, the State will pay up to one-third of the loan charges.  This will be found in Section 6 (1) (ii).  This subsidy will enable in the smaller areas a house costing £350 of which the economic inclusive weekly rent would be about 11s. 6d. to be let at an inclusive rent, of say, 7s. 6d. with a loss of about £3 per annum to the local authority, and in the larger areas a house costing £450, of which the economic inclusive weekly rent would be about 16s. to be let at an inclusive weekly rent of 10s. with a loss of about £5 10s. per annum to the local authority.  Here again I may say local authorities will be required to make the most careful selection of tenants to ensure that the houses are let only to those tenants who most need them, and who cannot pay a higher rent.</P>
    <P>In order to bring into play the activities of public utility societies to assist urban local authorities in the provision of houses for the latter classes it is proposed in Sections 5 (1) and 8 of the Bill to empower local authorities to join with the State in making a combined grant of one-third of the cost of houses subject to a maximum combined grant of £150 per house to be borne, £100 by the State and £50 by the local authority, on the condition that houses so provided will be let on monthly or lesser tenancies.  This provision is especially included to enable public utility societies to act as a subsidiary of the local authority.  In order to ensure that these societies operate for the housing of persons who normally would have to be housed by the local authority a maximum floor area of 750 sq. feet is prescribed in the Bill for houses to be built by them. This approximates to the ordinary working-class houses.  In addition to the combined grant State loans will be made to these societies.  It is hoped that in areas where housing needs are great the local authorities will endeavour to bring societies into existence <Col N="520" /> to co-operate with them under this special provision, in the building of houses.  This will leave local authorities more free to concentrate on slum clearance and, as well, will enable local authorities to cut their losses in the provision of their housing needs since every house provided by these societies will relieve the local authority concerned of the annual loss which the rates would have to bear if the house had been provided by the local authority.</P>
    <P>It is also intended to provide for the urban classes who could pay a good rent, but are at present unable to get houses to rent.  The provisions Included in Section 5 (1) (b) of the Bill will enable these classes with the aid of grants under the Bill and loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts to provide houses for themselves. In this connection the Bill provides under Section 22 (3) for the payment of larger instalments of loans under the Small Dwellings Acts during the progress of building works.  This provision will enable a person with little capital but in a position to pay the loan charges and other outgoings to provide a house for himself.  These items in respect of a house costing £500 on a leased site should not exceed more than one pound per week at the highest point.  The grants will also be available under Section 5 to speculative builders and public utility societies for the provision of houses which, when provided, can be rented by or, if desired, purchased by intending residents with the aid of loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts. The grants at the outset will be £70 per house for houses completed before the 1st April next, and I am going to ask the House to extend that to the 1st June; £60 for houses completed in the following year and £50 for houses completed in the succeeding year.  It is hoped that by so grading the grants the commencement of building work will be considerably expedited.</P>
    <P>In rural areas to enable local authorities to provide labourers cottages it is proposed in Section 6 (1) (b) of the Bill that the State will pay 60% of the annual charges on loans borrowed by rural local authorities <Col N="521" /> for the purpose.  This provision will enable the letting of labourers cottages at inclusive rents averaging 2/- weekly without imposing undue charges on the local rates and so that the loss to the rates may be more evenly divided it is proposed in Section 21 of the Bill to make the county health district the area of charge instead of, as at present, the rural district.  Provision is also made by Section 19 of the Bill for shortening considerably the present procedure for rural local authorities operating under the Labourers Acts. An endeavour is being made to bring the law in regard to the Labourers Acts in that particular matter into conformity with the Housing of the Working Classes Acts.  As most Deputies are aware the existing procedure under the Labourers Acts is slow and cumbersome and it is now proposed to put the rural local authority in a position to go ahead with schemes with the same expedition as is now possible in urban areas under the improved machinery provided last year.</P>
    <P>The grant system hitherto in force for private persons in rural areas has enabled the provision of over 10,000 houses but it is the opinion of the Government that the grants available were not large enough to enable small farmers and agricultural labourers to provide themselves with suitable housing accommodation.  It is proposed, therefore, in Section 5 (1) (e) to continue the grants at the rate of £45 per house and to make available special grants for small farmers and agricultural labourers.  For small farmers not exceeding £15 valuation and for agricultural labourers grants of £70 per house are to be provided, and for small farmers exceeding £15 but not exceeding £25 valuation, grants of £60 per house are to be provided. These grants relate to new houses but it is intended in rural areas to make available for small farmers not exceeding £25 valuation and for agricultural labourers grants not exceeding £40 per house for the reconstruction of houses at present in the occupation of these persons.</P>
    <P>With a view to encouraging the <Col N="522" /> formation of public utility societies in rural areas for the special purpose of advising and assisting small farmers and agricultural labourers in the building of houses, it is proposed in Section 5 (1) (f) and (g) to increase the grants of £70 and £60 for small farmers and agricultural labourers to £80 and £70 respectively for houses built through the medium of such societies for these persons.  Under this provision it is hoped that many public spirited persons in rural areas will form public utility societies and encourage the really needy small farmers and agricultural labourers to avail of the grants.</P>
    <P>That is a section to which one or two members of the House have called my attention and which they have criticised.  I was encouraged to put this provision into the Bill because of the fact that I knew of one county where a Deputy of this House had interested himself in forming a public utility society and had succeeded in a couple of years through the agency of that society in building 83 houses.  I thought that was excellent work but it was said to me that that would be dragging politics into the matter because this man naturally had to be associated with some Party.  He happened to be a politician, a member of one of the Parties in this House.  I will say that it was good political work, if you like, but it was excellent work and I said to the Deputies who criticised that proposition to me, &ldquo;I do not care if every man in the House of every political Party takes up the work of forming public utility societies. They could not do better work whatever their political views may be.&rdquo;  I would encourage every man in the House no matter what Party he may belong to to do the same as that Deputy to whom I referred.  They would be doing good political work, if you like, but they would be doing excellent social work at the same time.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that the grant system for private persons and public utility societies is to continue up to the 1st April, 1935.  With the grants offered there is no excuse for anyone who should fail to take advantage of them in that period.  When I state that <Col N="523" /> about ten years will be required to supply all housing demands I do not anticipate that it will take anything like this for private persons, in a position to do so, to satisfy their needs and there will probably be no need to continue the grant system beyond the period prescribed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed in Section 5 (1) (a) of the Bill to provide for the payment of grants of £45 per house in respect of houses begun under the Housing Acts, 1929-1930, as amended by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931, but not completed in time to qualify for grants under those Acts.</P>
    <P>In respect of the latter houses rates remission similar to that provided under the Housing Acts, 1929-1930 will be granted&mdash;(Section 9).  So those who have not yet completed their houses under the older Act will be placed in no more disadvantageous position than those who had completed them earlier. In addition the new Bill provides for two-thirds remission for seven years in respect of all houses provided under the new Bill excepting houses provided by local authorities or by public utility societies in urban areas for letting under the special terms already referred to.  In the case of houses reconstructed by small farmers and agricultural labourers in rural areas it is provided in the Bill that the valuation for rating purposes will not be increased for the first seven years after reconstruction. The general question of rates remission is one that has been most carefully considered by the Government. It is realised that there are objections to the principle of remission but, in all the circumstances, it has been decided to continue it on the reduced basis of two-thirds remission for seven years in respect of houses for which grants are made to persons and public utility societies under the Bill. It will be noted that this is the only assistance which local authorities are to be called upon to afford to these persons and societies except in the case of houses built for letting in urban areas by public utility societies, and local authorities are not asked to grant rates remission in respect of the latter houses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="524" /> Loans for local authorities schemes will be advanced from the Local Loans Fund for 35 years, repayable on the annuity system at rates of interest to be fixed from time to time by the Minister for Finance.  It is hoped, however, that local authorities in a position to do so will raise loans in the open market so as to relieve the strain on the State.</P>
    <P>With the foregoing very generous financial provisions the Government expect the full co-operation of all bodies and persons concerned with the housing problem, and of all persons engaged in or connected with building industries.  As previously stated it is anticipated that tendencies towards increased prices will have to be coped with, and the Government is making provision for dealing with such emergencies. The Miscellaneous Provisions of the Bill include (Sections 15 and 16) power to the Minister to purchase, manufacture or promote the manufacture of building materials and appliances, and power to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, after public inquiry, to limit prices of building materials and appliances.  These powers will be used to the fullest extent necessary to cope with any situation which may arise.</P>
    <P>Section 20 of the Bill also provides for rural local authorities to acquire land for the purpose of leasing or selling building sites for the erection by private persons or public utility societies of cottages suitable for occupation by agricultural labourers.  It is expected that this provision will enable sites to be provided for many agricultural labourers not in a position at present to secure suitable sites.  By facilitating persons of this class to build their own houses with the aid of grants considerable saving will be secured by local authorities who, otherwise, would be called upon to provide cottages and plots for them under the Labourers Acts.</P>
    <P>The Government feel confident that the local authorities, conscious of the urgent housing needs of their areas, will proceed to carry out substantial slum clearance and housing schemes with the greatest possible expedition. In any case where dilatoriness is displayed <Col N="525" /> by a local authority in availing of the financial terms to be made available, the Minister is to be empowered by Section 17 of the Bill to act in place of the local authority.</P>
    <P>It is the intention of the Government to set up a Housing Board to advise and assist the Minister in the exercise of his powers in relation to housing, and particularly in connection with the carrying out of the housing programme contemplated in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>In the building of the houses it is expected that materials and appliances of Saorstát manufacture will be used as far as possible.  From time to time lists of suitable materials and appliances will be published, and after the publication of such lists, bodies and persons building houses with the aid of State subsidies will be required to use the materials and appliances specified.</P>
    <P>It is the aim of the Government to take full advantage of the housing drive to develop native industries in building materials and appliances. Substantial sums of the ratepayers' money will be sunk in the houses to be provided and a large proportion of these sums will not be recoverable in rents.  If, however, native materials and appliances are used to the fullest extent possible in the building of the houses, most of the money will be put back in circulation immediately and the financial strain on the community generally will be greatly eased, while employment will, at the same time we hope, be greatly stimulated.</P>
    <P>I much regret that it has not been found possible to introduce before now the long-promised Town Planning Bill.  It is my earnest desire to have this Bill introduced as soon as possible.  I have great hope that the Town Planning Bill may be ready for introduction without delay after the Recess.  In the meantime, I would appeal to all local authorities about to plan housing schemes to give earnest consideration to the question of town planning and above all to provide for as many open spaces as possible and particularly space for playgrounds for our children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="526" /> In recommending this measure to the favourable consideration of the House may I take advantage of this opportunity to appeal to all classes of the community to give of their very best to assist the State to end the great and pressing evil of the slums?  May I make a very special appeal to building operatives to make a very special effort to assist by all means at their disposal, the State and the local authorities to provide at the cheapest possible rate decent dwellings at reasonable rents for the working classes and especially for the very poor who are unable to pay what is called an economic rate?  They should be in a special way interested in this problem.  The lives of so many of their own class and even of their own children are at stake.  By assisting to their fullest capacity in this truly Christian work they will be doing the best they can for themselves and for the nation.</P>

    <P>This is designed to give effect to, and must be taken in conjunction with, amendment 65, which is to insert a new section before Section 26 as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The excise duties chargeable under Section 13 of the Finance Act, 1920, on the mechanically propelled vehicles mentioned in the Fourth Schedule to this Act shall, as on and from the 1st day of July, 1932, be charged, levied, and paid at the rates specified in the said Fourth Schedule in lieu of the rates specified in the Fifth Schedule to the Finance Act, 1929 (No. 32 of 1929).</P>
    <P>The purpose of this section is briefly to give effect to the statement in the Budget speech that we proposed in view of the very special difficulties in which small bus owners, in particular, found themselves, to reduce the existing seating tax of £5 per head per seat in buses and chars-a-banc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>A good deal of the transport costs of this country for the last two years have been uneconomic and an inquiry here in Dublin with one of the most important transport companies in the country illustrated that fact a few years ago.  It is common knowledge that the railroad companies have been in difficult circumstances, particularly for the last two or three years.  Obviously for some particular reason other agencies came in, in competition with the railways, and the resultant effect is that neither the railways nor their competitors are now pursuing what, in commercial parlance, would be called an economic business proposition.  The railways are <Col N="529" /> suffering in loss of revenue, largely attributable to the competition that they have from other sources.  The ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce pointed out in this House that transport was being provided at uneconomic prices.  That is common knowledge.  In order to equate the cost, in respect of the upkeep of the railways, some two or three years ago, the tax on seating accommodation in the buses was raised to about £5.  It is now proposed to reduce it.  Is that to be a solution of the transport problem, which is an extreme one?  The railways companies are in exceedingly great difficulty.  The £100 ordinary stock of the railway companies is at present selling for £7 or £8 and it was as low as £5 and that is to some extent due to this competition. Now it was not the railways that started the competition.  The competition was started by other bodies, and taking the major investment, if we are looking after the investment of our people, this proposition does not appear, on the face of it, to be a solution of either the minor or the major problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount saved, to what is called the small bus companies, is negligible and the competition goes in favour of the extent of whatever saving there is to the bus companies in this case. If there was any indication as to the consideration of any new policy in respect of transport along with this proposal there would be some reason for it.  While it is mentioned that it is intended to help the small bus companies the fact is that it helps all bus companies; they all participate and get the advantage of this particular concession.  If, as I say, there was any indication that we were to consider transport policy as such, if there was any indication that in the income tax proposal of the Minister relief would be offered to the unfortunate people who hold ordinary stock in the Great Southern Railway, then, I say some attempt would be made to equate the railways as a transport agency.  No one is going to vote against this, but it is a bad method of solving the problem, if there is a problem to be solved.  It is pure and <Col N="530" /> simple political bribery and the Minister knows it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with some of the viewpoints put forward by Deputy Cosgrave, that in many respects, the mentality indicated in this amendment is a mentality that, I think, may have dangerous repercussions so far as the railway industry is concerned. The proposal in this section is to give a certain kind of relief to small buses, ostensibly, but in effect all buses secure the remission of the seating tax as set out in the section. Probably the amount of relief is not very considerable.  At the same time this proposal seems to me to savour of a desire to bolster up an uneconomic transport system.  The proposal in the section is to help the small bus companies which, of course, as everybody with any experience of the small companies must know, means helping bus companies that pay scandalously low rates of wages, and compel their employees to work scandalously long hours.  I suppose an attempt will be made to excuse that state of affairs.  But if the Minister makes independent enquiries, on his own, he will find that many of these small bus companies are paying rates of wages, and enforcing conditions of labour, that would be a reflection upon any decent Christian society.  Is this the kind of bus company that is to be assisted under this section?  and that the State are so much concerned about?  Is this an indication that the State is going to assist them in face of the fact that the railway companies, whatever be their disability, are paying rates of wages negotiated between themselves and the railwaymen's Union?  As I said, the amount of relief is not considerable but the mentality behind it is much more serious.  The railway industry is a vital industry so far as this country is concerned.  You may blame the railway directors and the shortsightedness of their policy.  But one fact remains that £25,000,000 of our money is invested in the railway industry; that 17,000 men have devoted <Col N="531" /> lives to the railway service and I earnestly hope that the proposal in this Bill is not an indication on the part of the State of buttressing up an uneconomic transport system but rather that the Minister will give some assurance in his reply to the effect that he will do something to regulate the tangle into which the transport system has been allowed to degenerate and that we will have some definite indication from the Minister that this is not the first step along the road to accelerate further economic disintegration of the railway industry. I hope the Minister will give that assurance and the further assurance that this is not a pro-bus proposal or an anti-railway proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDavis" hpid="Mr. Davis Mr. Davis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davis</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a question that, in my opinion, deserves the serious consideration of every Deputy in this House.  There are two aspects of the situation to be taken into account&mdash; the position of the railway company on one hand and the position of the bus companies on the other.  It must be known to everybody who takes a serious interest in these two situations that there is a very great difference as to what the responsibility of each is.  We must keep in mind that the railway companies are the payers of very substantial rates; they contribute in a very substantial way.  The bus companies, on the other hand, come in to use the road, but at what time do they come in to use the road?  They come in at a time when £2,000,000 had been borrowed and expended on the construction of roads in this country. Then, and only then, did they appear on the scene.  If you compare that with the condition of a railway company what do you find?  If a railway company wants to construct a railroad they have, first of all, to seek legislation, then to acquire the necessary land to construct the railroad, and when they have that done they have, out of their own expenditure, to construct the railroad.  When that road is constructed they have to provide rolling stock, and they have to maintain the road and the rolling stock at their own expense.  They are at the <Col N="532" /> same time contributing substantially to the rates.  I am afraid the Minister for Finance has overlooked the fact that he is now proposing that bus companies can utilise roads constructed at the expense of the public, and, at the same time, overlooks the fact that the railway companies are paying rates for the maintenance of these roads.  Is that an equitable way of holding the scales between the two systems?</P>
      <P>As Deputy Norton very pertinently pointed out, there are many people seriously involved because their capital is invested in the railway companies. How much capital is invested in the bus companies?  Notwithstanding these facts the Minister for Finance, without hesitation and without a blush, proposes to reduce the tax on buses that are a very grave danger to the travelling public.  The accommodation they provide is very poor. People who travel on buses do so at their own risk.  While people who travel on the railways do so at their own risk, the risk is infinitely less than travelling by buses having regard to the manner in which they go along the roads.  In my opinion these are serious questions that have not been sufficiently considered by the Minister. Doubtless buses afford a certain amount of accommodation to the public, but, if they do, is that sufficient to justify the Minister for Finance in throwing on the shoulders of the ratepayers the responsibility of taking over the railway companies?  As a public man with some experience in matters of this kind I think it must inevitably come to that.  If the railway companies cease to be able to operate I wonder on whom the responsibility for doing so will fall.  Will it be the responsibility of the State or the responsibility of the ratepayers if we are to safeguard the railways?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not as well acquainted with the wages paid by omnibus companies as Deputy Norton, and I am not in a position to criticise what considerations they deserve from this House.  I am quite satisfied that Deputy Norton has not committed himself to the statement he made without full investigation, and satisfying himself that there is no comparison between the position <Col N="533" /> of bus companies and railway companies. That is another reason why an important matter like this should receive consideration by the Minister for Finance in the responsible position he occupies.  I am not going to allege because I have not the knowledge to justify me doing so but rumour has it &mdash;be it well-founded or ill-founded&mdash; that there are some political considerations underlying this matter.  If such is the case, I say it is disgraceful that in a matter demanding that public administration be fairly, fearlessly, honestly and conscientiously discharged for the benefit and for the credit of the general public that point of view should be overlooked.  I certainly say that if such considerations were permitted to enter into the administration of affairs by the Minister for Finance it is something that would bring discredit to that office for all time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I find that the figure per seat that I mentioned for the biggest transport company outside the rail roads, and which was the subject of an inquiry some time ago, is £6 11s 11d. according to the charges to be met on rates paid on land&mdash;that is the tramway lines &mdash; wayleaves, maintenance, renewal of roads, and licence duty on the vehicles.  That figure was before the mind of the last administration when fixing £5 per seat. It is obvious there was something to go on in connection with that figure. The company I mentioned started work some fifty years ago.  A great deal of criticism was passed some years ago by members of the Party opposite, in which I think the Parliamentary Secretary to the President was rather loud, about the renewal of the lease by a local authority.  The price fixed was £5 per seat.  The liability undertaken by this transport company was undertaken fifty years ago and, in the inquiry which took place, they urged that they were prejudiced by reason of the enormous cost placed upon them.  It is now proposed to reduce the seating tax to £3 6s. 8d. The big transport organisation that I mentioned did not produce the competition which resulted in both of them <Col N="534" /> being in difficulties a couple of years ago.  The question is, how this tax is. going to operate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the philosophic doubt given expression to by Deputy Norton.  I have no doubt whatever in relation to the position as disclosed by the balance sheets of the railway systems in this country.  We are all aware of the very precarious position in which, unfortunately, the Irish railways arc to-day, and I was one of those who cherished the hope that this Government might produce something in the way of a Bill to co-ordinate the transport systems.  If the amendment is passed I feel that anything we may do will simply buttress up a very rotten system of transport, and give further encouragement to cut-throat competition between the two branches of transport.  We are all aware of the fact that the Great Southern Railways have economised very drastically.  The employees have suffered very considerable reductions in wages and conditions, and no further economies can be practised unless the employees are to work for nothing.  I propose to divide the House on the very point stressed by Deputy Norton as a protest against the low wages and the bad conditions suggested by the Deputy.  I have no doubt whatsoever about this matter, and I propose to divide the House on it. We are aware that the railway system maintains a very expensive permanent way.  We are also aware that certain. moneys accrue to the Road Fund because of transport on the roads, but there can be no comparison whatever between the two systems either in the way of comfort in travelling or so far as the element of danger is concerned. The element of danger is very low on the railway system, whereas it is very high in connection with road transport. I feel, therefore, that it is rather dangerous to encourage the further development of road transport, because between the number of privately-owned cars, commercial vehicles and bus companies, the life of the ordinary pedestrian will become a regular nightmare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was expecting that, during this <Col N="535" /> session, the Government might produce a Bill to co-ordinate our services and to reduce, instead of to increase, traffic on the roads.  For that reason I am opposing this amendment, and I propose to divide the House on it so as to ascertain where we stand.  I have given certain undertakings to my constituents and I have never gone behind them.  I have attended meetings of railway shareholders, although not a shareholder myself&mdash;perhaps I may be considered lucky in that respect&mdash;and I have listened to what was said at these meetings.  I heard the pitiful wail of the shareholders, but I was still more responsive to the petitions of the railway workers.  The railway workers impressed upon me the absolute necessity of preventing, so far as I could do so by my vote, the further development of road traffic.  I am not going to discuss any connection that may exist between the railway company and some of the bus companies or whether there is such a connection or not.  I intend to oppose this amendment because I believe it will simply bring about further chaos and confusion in the transport system of the country.  Instead of tackling this matter at its roots and producing a plan that would give us a co-ordinated transport service, the Government is tinkering with the problem and that does not appeal to me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the protest made by Deputy Anthony. It would be useless to discuss the general question of transport on this amendment.  I support Deputy Anthony's protest on the grounds he himself has placed before the House. I support this protest on the ground of the wages paid the employees of these small bus companies and, secondly, on the ground of the competition offered by these small bus companies to organised systems of transport, which issue time tables, and have to keep to those time tables. Notwithstanding that the larger companies work to time tables, this amendment is designed to give relief to the smaller bus companies as, against their competitors.  Deputy Norton registers <Col N="536" /> a philosophic protest against the wages paid by the smaller companies.  I am going to register a practical protest by voting against the relief proposal.  It is common knowledge that cases figure in the police courts regarding these small bus companies and their employees. For example, there was a case recently in the courts in which two boys employed by one of these small bus companies had been summarily dismissed because they would not accept some small reduction in wages.  The boys had not been paid wages in lieu of notice.  In other words, they did not receive the treatment which the most menial servant would be entitled to&mdash;notice of a week or a month or wages in lieu of notice. As a protest against the manner in which they were treated, these boys went off and stole the bus.  I need not say I have no sympathy with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us consider the position of these small bus companies as against organised services which issue a time table.  The company which issues a time table has to run its buses at specified hours.  These small bus companies which are getting relief under this proposal do not run their buses regularly.  They lie by or, perhaps I should say, lie in wait, until the busy hours, when they slip out and compete against the other buses.  In that way they save wear and tear during the periods when business is slack. Nevertheless, they are getting special relief as against their competitors who ply at all times.  Again, the driver-conductor on these small buses gets a wage of about £2 per week.  The driver serving the larger companies which issue time tables receives about £3 8s. 0d. per week and the conductor about £2 12s. 0d.  Thus, the bigger buses pay in wages about £6 per week as against £2 paid by the smaller buses which are getting the relief under this proposal.  What justification is there for that?  If relief is to be given to anybody, should not the Minister see that it is given to those companies which are providing good <Col N="537" /> service and paying good wages?  I support the protest made by Deputy Anthony, and if lie pushes the matter to a division, I will vote with him.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Anthony's protest.  The relative positions of the railway company, the tramway company, the large bus companies and the small bus companies will have to be discussed at some other time at considerable length, and, therefore, I do not wish to enter into a discussion of that question now.  However, there is one point peculiarly relevant to this problem which has not been mentioned here to-day.  That is the seating accommodation in these smaller buses.  I do not know whether the Minister is prepared to give a definition of a seat.  I do not regard myself as a superman in the way of size. There are many Deputies here who are much bigger than I am.  I must say, however, that in some of these smaller buses it is a positive torture for two people who are not small to sit together. I suggest that that is one of the questions that ought to be settled by the Ministers.  One company ought not to be allowed to get away with two-thirds of a seat while another company has to provide a full seat.  It would be a definite offence for anybody in trade to sell three-quarters of a 1b. of any commodity and label it 1 1b.  I suggest that it is really the same offence to supply three-quarters or two-thirds of a seat and label it a seat, because that is what it comes to.  In the interests of the travelling public who have to use these smaller buses, I suggest that that is a matter the Minister should look into and I should like to get an assurance from him that he will look into it.  It is a very vital question, when giving an extra remission of taxation, that that extra remission should go to people who supply portion of a seat while their competitors are compelled to supply a whole seat.</P>

      <P>They would come naturally at that time.  This is now our <i>damnosa hereditas</i> from the Government preceding this.  The last Government created a situation here where one of the worst things that could be done was done, namely, the efforts of the citizens of this country were used to develop a cut-throat policy between the railway companies and the bus companies during a period of seven years. The deliberate intention in the minds of the then Government was that they were going to allow a few interests, very small interests, to grow up. When a whole lot of decent Irishmen were trying to build up something for themselves, instead of trying to prevent waste the Government allowed the cut-throat policy to-develop and we are now coming in for the remnants of that policy.  This has been done in order to prevent from being ruined economically men of enterprise who had to work under great difficulties, but perhaps against whom a great deal could be said in the way of criticism as to wages and conditions of work and so on, men who were fighting with their backs against the wall.  This policy was allowed by the late Government to develop during seven years.  For the time being and until we have produced other schemes of transport it is necessary in order that more economic waste might be prevented to assist these men to keep in existence by reducing their overhead charges.  That is what this amounts to.  It is a temporary palliative and no one would suggest that it represents the serious intentions of the Government or the Government's attitude on wages, or on the transport question, or on the railway problem.  We have had very <Col N="539" /> severe criticism made of the late Government's policy as regards the railways.  The only thing I can admire about the late Government, the present Opposition, is their extraordinary neck in getting up here and saying what they are saying now when one considers that during their whole period in office they never did anything to help the possible re-organisation of the railway companies and they never did anything that would put the railways on their feet.  We on these benches appreciate the railway position because we know it is the great transport service of the country, and we have to stand up for the railways. This is a purely temporary measure.  It is absurd to say that it is a political measure.</P>

      <P>It is a political measure in the sense that we are trying to do everything we can for the country.  It is in that sense that we are trying to do the best we can for everybody.  It is an attempt to prevent economic waste and to protect those people who had sufficient courage and initiative to start this enterprise of private buses in order to help the public.  There has been continual conflict between the various services, but I have no doubt that in a very short time the Government will be able to deal with this problem, though it is absurd to think that the Government can deal with everything at once.  People cannot say that we are not making an effort to carry out our programme.  The Opposition are making a great mistake if they think that the people of the country have not as much sense as they have.  The people of the country are beginning to see through the Opposition.  I met a man the other day who was a supporter of the late Government, and speaking to me he said, &ldquo;Why doesn't the Opposition allow the Government to blow its nose?&rdquo;  He said the attitude of the Opposition is absolutely unreasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiersey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the House very long, but in opening my few remarks I have to condemn the actions of the late Government in one respect, and that is that they were too lenient when they imposed the tax on buses.  They were too lenient in not putting on more than £5 on each bus seat.  I know what buses cost the ratepayers.  I know what the buses on the roads are, and I know what it costs each county council in Ireland to keep the roads in repair for buses. I think the Minister for Finance knows that too.  He has all the figures in his office.  We know that through the activities of the buses, and especially if they are helped a little <Col N="541" /> more as they are being helped now, it is going to be the finishing stroke on the railways.</P>
      <P>Deputy Little spoke about the small bus owner who bought his bus and who was working with his back to the wall.  Are the backs of 17,000 railway workers to the wall?  Does the Deputy consider their position at all?  Do we not see these railway employees losing employment day after day and week after week?  Not a week passes but one reads of some small branch line that has become so uneconomic that it has to be closed down.  One can travel on any railway except probably the railway from Dublin to Kildare or the railway from Dublin on the direct line to Cork, and you will find so few travelling by train that a bus could take them.  Now the railway company must have on that train, in order to comply with the restrictions of the Board of Trade, at least half a dozen men.  All these restrictions are against the railway companies. The buses can go out any time day or night just as they like, and if they do not turn up at all the public has no means of redress against them. We see a line of railway and a bus running along the side of it.  We see in the courts every day, especially here in Dublin, cases where the bus drivers had to be brought up for practically racing each other in order to get traffic.  I certainly do say that that is not a benefit to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I advise the Minister for Finance to look in other directions.  He should put a higher rate per seat on buses and give some chance to the railways which employ such a large number of hands. He should make every effort to prevent men being thrown on the unemployed list.  Comparatively few would be unemployed by reason of the small number of buses that would go off the roads.  I hope some of them will go off.  The railways have been severely hit.  Anybody travelling round to-day can observe many painters and others who formerly earned a decent livelihood when engaged on the railways walking around idle.  Going through the country to-day one can observe the almost derelict stations.  The <Col N="542" /> painting cannot be renewed because the companies cannot afford to buy paint.  In the same way the rolling stock has of necessity to be neglected. Everything is going from bad to worse and unless the Government give some assistance there is a very poor prospect facing the railways.  The Government can lend a helping hand by putting the railways in a position to meet their competitors.  The most effective protest I can make is to vote against this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise as an almost fanatical supporter of the railways and, consequently, an opponent of the buses.  I was delighted to gather from the remarks of Deputy Dockrell that some of those who have the bad taste to support the buses in preference to railways have suffered torture by so doing and I hope they will go on suffering torture so long as they indulge in that preference.  As regards Deputy Little's remarks, he represents this as not being the final treatment of the transport problem.  We all thoroughly realise that, but it does to some extent prejudice the final treatment of the transport problem. It seems to be considered that if you call people ordinary, decent, Irish citizens you make out a complete case for showering favours on them.  We must all try to be ordinary, decent, Irish citizens. The question is whether the activities of any particular set of ordinary, decent, Irish citizens deserve special encouragement from the State or not.  I submit that we ought to stick fast to the principle of saving our tottering railways.</P>

      <P>It might shorten the debate if I remind the House what it is we are supposed to be talking about. The proposal in the new section is an entirely temporary provision.  It is not intended to produce any solution of the transport difficulty.  It is designed, pending the coming into force of the Transport Act of 1932, to keep in employment 1,000 people who would have been driven out of employment, not in consequence of the policy of the present Government, but by reason of the extraordinary taxation imposed last year mainly upon buses operating in <Col N="543" /> urban areas.  When this £5 seating tax was originally imposed there was no tax on petrol.  Within twelve months two successive imposts of 4d. a gallon on petrol were put on.  No undertaking owned by a private individual carrying on, often with limited capital, but all the time providing employment, all the time providing services which the community hitherto had not enjoyed, particularly in the cities, could possibly have carried on for long after that additional burden had been imposed.  So serious was the position that on 1st April last a number of these concerns were unable to pay the seating tax.  I would like to emphasise they were concerns mainly operating in the City of Dublin and they were not in competition with the Railways Company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither the Railways Company nor the Tramways Company have made any such protest. All those who have been vocal about the pitiful plight of the Railways Company, if they vote against this, will be voting to deprive the Railways Company of a temporary concession.  I am not so certain that, taking all the facts into consideration, the Railways Company are entitled to the concession. I am not going to put 1,000 men on the streets merely because somebody is going to get possibly a little more than he would have been entitled to.  That is the position with which we are faced and the purpose of this new section is to enable existing undertakings to continue in operation until the Transport Act of 1932, which was passed through the Dáil by the <Col N="544" /> late Government, will come into operation. Until it does come into operation, an opportunity to survive should be given to every one of the existing undertakings which have carried on against heavy competition, which have opened up new routes, which have built up a new industry in this City of Dublin and given employment to people who would otherwise be walking the streets, which have provided for the workers of Dublin amenities in regard to lunch hours and their meals generally, in regard to their transport to and from business, which those workers would never have enjoyed but for the small man who had the initiative, the enterprise and the energy to go into the highways and the by-ways and run transport services through the slums of Dublin when the wealthy corporation to which Deputy Cosgrave referred never ventured to do anything and never would venture to do anything.</P>

      <P>The point I am making is that these small men who did render a public service, who did risk their all in the ventures which they undertook, should be given an opportunity to survive until the Transport Act comes into operation.  They will not be able to operate unless they are granted a licence under that Act, unless they are in a position to prove to the Minister that they will maintain a continuously satisfactory service, unless they are in a position to prove to the Minister that the accommodation which they offer to the passengers will be adequate; that a seat, if I might try to answer Deputy Dockrell's definition of what a seat in a bus is, will no longer continue to be a seat where one bends one's knees to relieve one from torture; that they will provide ample accommodation for <Col N="545" /> passengers and a continued service; that that practice which some concerns have pursued of placing buses on the roads at the most profitable hour&mdash;and remember in that regard that the Tramways Company and every other transport undertaking during the rush hour does put extra vehicles on the road or on the lines&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is a lawyer, and if the Deputy was familiar with the laws of the State he would know that one of the provisions of the Transport Act is to ensure that they will work to a time-table and maintain it.  All we are doing is to allow existing undertakings to remain in operation until the Transport Act comes into force, when everything will be co-ordinated within the limits of that Act, as a preliminary to the wider transport measure which the Minister for Industry and Commerce will bring before the Dáil in due course.  We are asking the House to do that, not because we are prejudiced in favour of bus transport as against railway transport but because we are mainly concerned with the fact that 1,000 men in employment, whether at adequate or inadequate wages, are in present circumstances better for the State and better for the community than 1,000 men unemployed and on home relief.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of the rate of wages paid by some concerns, I am not justifying or defending them in any way.  I condemn them as strongly as anybody else, and I want to make it clear that this temporary concession here is given on one condition, that if it ever becomes necessary to renew it, it will only be renewed in respect of those who, in regard to wages and conditions of employment, put their house in order, and they are getting that done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that my sympathy in this matter is with the Opposition, because I do not really see why this concession is being made.  I can quite understand the Minister's case that it is necessary to preserve a large number of people from unemployment. I am not, however, altogether satisfied that the Minister's case is sound.  I understand the point of view from which he has approached the question. I am rather surprised that the Opposition has concentrated its eyes so emphatically upon Dublin.  If I might say so, there is more than one curse on this House&mdash;Deputy Little referred to one&mdash;and that is that all Parties here, except the Independents, seem to begin and end in Dublin.  There are, astonishingly enough, 25 counties which do not comprise the Free State. I should like to draw attention to the fact that the rural population of this country have very little affection for the buses.  They have placed, so far as I know, and I think Deputy Davis will agree, a very great additional burden upon the ratepayers of the country who are maintaining the permanent way of the bus companies.  It is only fair to remember in this connection that we are the ratepayers <Col N="548" /> maintaining the permanent way of the buses, while the railway company is maintaining its own permanent way and paying rates for permission to maintain it.  That the Government should intervene at this juncture and make a concession to this kind of people, who come to them and make a poor mouth, out of the public revenue is I think a hardship.  The railway company, as I say, is actually paying for the privilege of maintaining a permanent way.  These gentlemen have no permanent way to maintain and yet they come to the Government and make a poor mouth and ask for a concession which will cost the State £25,000.  When we asked the Government yesterday to make a concession in respect of athletics, which affected every section of the community, the Minister got up and touched my heart with the vehemence with which he said that passionately as he desired to do it he could not spare the money, that it would cost £25,000.  That is out-door athletics.  To-day he blandly announces that he is going to dish out £25,000 to a number of entrepreneurs whose activities, to say the least, he is not prepared to endorse without qualification.  The way they conduct their business is not above suspicion. The rate of wages they pay is not satisfactory.  The hours of work which they have instituted are not only unjust to the employees, but, I submit, are a menace to the public.  A man who is driving a bus or railway engine for more than what has been agreed by experts to be a safe period is a menace to himself, a menace to his passengers, and a menace to every one who crosses his path.  As we know, the longer these men work the faster they seem to go, and we all know to our cost, those of us who have any connection with Dublin hospitals, that people are being carried in there in really terrifying numbers as a result of bus accidents.  That is the second phase of the indictment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other aspects of the bus case which might be violently attacked, but I am not concerned with attacking these small people, particularly in view of what the Minister says as to his intention to review the <Col N="549" /> whole question and to deal with it under the powers given by the new Transport Act, which is to come into operation in a short time, but I would ask the Minister why is he going to give £25,000 in this direction when the Promised Land is in sight for these small people?  They have only to hang on for another couple of months and the whole matter will be finally disposed of and, whatever rights they have, protected.  Why does he hand out £25,000 to them, when the same sum of money would have protected athletics for the next twelve months and avoided the imposition of a tax which he and his whole Party admit is a most undesirable tax and one, the imposition of which they have to contemplate.  If these people have any case at all they ought to have been able to hang on for another couple of months when the Minister would deal with the problem fully and adequately when the new powers under the Transport Act became available.  I cannot divorce from my mind the possibility that these men brought very heavy political pressure to bear and said &ldquo;We will raise such a wind, if we do not get the concessions, that will make it very hard for the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I could not vote for this remission in the light of the Minister's Budget. He has asked everybody in the State to make substantial sacrifices and sacrifices that I was prepared to endorse, in the very pressing and urgent circumstances in which he found himself, but, having called for this sacrifice from every section of the community, and having refused a concession in respect of athletics which would cost no more than £25,000, I do not think the Minister should ask us to support him in giving £25,000 to these bus proprietors.</P>

I would like to know, if the Minister seriously believes that, how he arrived at that figure?

      <P>In case there might be any misapprehension in the mind of the House as to what will happen <Col N="552" /> to these bus owners, and what action the Government will take in regard to the maintenance of routes and the enforcement of a reasonable wage and proper working conditions, I would like to draw the attention of Deputies to Section 12 of the Road Transport Act which will come into operation very shortly.  I think any impartially minded Deputies, if there are any in the Opposition, when they have heard the powers which the Minister will have in relation to the granting of licences, will agree with me that many of the objections which have been urged here against giving these men a chance to continue to give employment under proper conditions will be overcome.  The first condition which the Minister for Industry and Commerce may attach will be (a) the terminal points and the route of the passenger road service to which the licence relates; (b) the frequency of such service, including variations of such frequency on different days or at different periods of each day; (c) the daily duration of such service, so that they will not, as one Deputy said, be able to come out at all hours of the night, unless the needs of the public so require it; and even the railways run at night; (d) the minimum number of vehicles to be kept available for the operation of such service; (e) the type of vehicle to be used on such service; so that, to meet Deputy Dockrell's point, the public will get what they are paying for, a comfortable seat; (f) the maintenance of a particular standard of fitness, cleanliness and appearance of the vehicles used on such service; so that Deputy Minch's point will be met; (g) appointing or restricting the distinctive marks and numbers on or the colours of the vehicles used; (h) the publication of the time-tables of and charges on such service and the display of such time-tables and charges in the vehicles used on such service; so that Deputy McMenamin's objection, on the ground that these bus undertakings do not run to any fixed schedule, will be met.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;The rates of wages <Col N="553" /> and hours of duty of employees and agreements or arrangements in reference thereto in the working of the passenger road service to which a licence relates.&rdquo;  Under the Transport Act every existing abuse&mdash;and I am not denying that there have been abuses&mdash;will be remedied before a licence is granted and the only thing we are asking&mdash;again I repeat it&mdash; is that a thousand men be kept in employment and be not thrown out on the roads and that undertakings be not destroyed.  Remember there are bus undertakings which do pay higher wages than are paid elsewhere, not possibly as high wages as the railway companies are paying, but there are bus companies operating in urban areas which pay wages higher than the general standard in other employments to possibly the same class of men.  The point we are making is that although there are undoubtedly a few unsatisfactory undertakings the whole industry should not be wiped out before the Minister for Industry and Commerce has a chance to put the industry on a proper basis in regard to services, in regard to schedules and in regard to wages and conditions of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Executive Council were very ill-advised to surrender to all this clamour from the bus companies.  After all, if it was only a short period before the provisions of the Transport Act came into operation, I cannot yet reconcile myself to believe that 1,000 people were likely to lose their employment in the meantime.  I think that is the kind of statement that might be made to support any kind of clamour, and I think the Executive Council were very ill-advised to yield to the clamour, which is a clamour to subsidise, to some extent, the bus company that pays a scandalously low rate of wages.  We made clear to the Minister the views of the Labour Party on this matter. On the Budget statement it was made perfectly clear to him by Deputy Davin that our viewpoint on the matter is this: that this concession will not of itself give any very considerable subsidy perhaps to private bus companies. The Tramways Company will <Col N="554" /> participate, the Railway Company will participate, and many other bus companies will participate for a relatively limited period under the scope of the Bill.  As I said in my previous speech, the serious part of the whole business is the mentality behind it.  We have reason to fear that this may be the prelude to an attempt to bolster up a scandalously ill-equipped and bad-conditioned bus industry.  I am not applying that description to all the bus services, but I am most certainly applying it to many of the bus services which operate from this city and which the Minister, if he makes inquiries, will know perfectly well are carried on only by sweating the employees engaged in the operation of that industry. The serious part of the whole business is not so much the amount of money involved as the mentality behind the policy.  The Minister said that it is only a temporary measure designed to keep the industry in being until another Act begins to operate to regulate that industry.  I would have much preferred if the Minister had allowed these companies to carry on as they were until such time as the Act came into operation.  I do not believe that these other consequences of 1,000 men being disemployed would have materialised at all.  There is a provision in the Transport Act to ensure that rates of wages and conditions of labour must be one of the factors referred to in the examination of the application of a bus company to continue a road service.  Is the Minister prepared to assure the House that so far as that section of the Act is concerned he will not allow bus companies which pay a very low rate of wages to continue to work road services?</P>

      <P>So far as the clamour from the bus owners is concerned, there has been a clamour for the past five years from the shareholders of the railway companies in connection with the very bad position in which the railways find themselves.  I am perfectly aware of the fact that this concession in regard to the buses will be applied to buses owned by the railway companies and to that extent it is a little concession to the railways as well, but on the broad question of railways versus bus traffic it is a well-known fact that this country in its present economic condition cannot maintain two transport systems and that inevitably one must go down.  In that case it would be only natural to assume that the transport system most beneficial to the country's needs should be preserved. I think it is generally agreed that the railway system is the system best suited to the needs of this country. There is another factor in connection with this business and that is that the managers of all the railway companies in the Free State have declared in no uncertain voice that it is only a matter of time if the present condition of affairs continues until the railways are absolutely closed.  If that is the case it will mean that from 17,000 to 20,000 men will find themselves unemployed. It will also mean that various centres throughout the State in which the weekly wages bill of the railways is very large&mdash;notably the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford and north of the Boyne, Dundalk in my own constituency&mdash;will find themselves in a very serious economic position should the railways close down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in my own way studied the whole question for the past three or four years.  I know there are factors other than bus competition which are materially affecting the railways.  That is a matter that can be discussed when the forthcoming Traffic Bill is introduced. I do say however that no time should be lost by the Minister and his Government in introducing legislation that will settle once and for all this very important matter of transport.  It has already been stated by various speakers that this country is not in a position to maintain two transport <Col N="556" /> systems.  Anybody reading the papers can see that the fairs that have been held lately all over the country have been very bad and that the prices prevailing are very much below those that prevailed twelve months ago.  In general the position of the country, economically, industrially and in every other way is becoming worse.  I do not mean to suggest for a moment that that state of affairs can be attributed to the present Government but cognisance should be taken of that fact in dealing with this problem.  I do suggest to the Minister that it was not fair to make this concession to the buses in view of the fact that the railways have suffered so much during the past twelve months.  If he was going to do anything it should have been in the interests of the railways.  I hope and trust that it is the intention of the Government now to do something that will safeguard the railways and safeguard the interests of those people who, when money was needed for the purpose, invested money in the extension of the railway system of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister gave this concession to these small bus owners to improve their position in any shape or form, the condition of the buses has got steadily worse, instead of any attempt being made to enhance their appearance even externally, much less internally.  I agree that they serve a very useful purpose, but, at the same time, the amount of steeplechasing that is going on around this city and the dangerous way in which these buses are being driven is in striking comparison with the larger buses controlled by the Tramways or even the trams themselves&mdash;there is simply no comparison at all.  As a matter of fact, I think that some of the saints in heaven must be wondering what has come over their position on this earth judging by the names that some of these buses have been given and the way they chase around.  I sincerely hope that when this new Bill does come in there will be some consideration given to the appearance and size of these buses and not have them as at present an eyesore around the city.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out, with regard to something that Deputy Minch said about the steeplechasing around the city or country, that I do not think the bus owners ought to be held entirely responsible for that.  After all, there are other people besides the owners to enforce the traffic laws.  Possibly there may be difficulties there due to the fact that the last administration brought in a Traffic Bill and were not able to pass it through the Dáil.  They were not able to make the proper and necessary regulations for traffic.  Naturally, bus drivers are like ordinary motor car drivers&mdash;or perhaps I should say careless motor car drivers&mdash;if they see a chance of getting ahead of another <Col N="558" /> fellow they will take the chance and as the law stands at present there is nobody to stop them.  We had certain proposals in view with regard to this at that time and I understand that as soon as the Minister for Local Government and Public Health comes back from Ottawa a measure will be introduced embodying a few of the amendments which we felt on the last occasion might have been introduced when we were in a position to introduce them.  I am sure it will get an easy passage and we need not be subject to steeplechasing.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 212:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete &ldquo;No. 35 of 1926&rdquo; where it first occurs and all references in columns 2, 3 and 4 thereto.</P>
      <P>The main object of this amendment is to exempt coursing from the entertainment tax.  I urge it rather from the business end than the sports end, though, of course the sporting end should not be overlooked.  Coursing is an open air sport, and there is as much reason for exempting persons looking on at a coursing match as those at a football match.  The business end of greyhound rearing in this country has become of considerable importance since the advent of greyhound racing.  It is the small coursing clubs in the country that feed the racing tracks, and the racing tracks give very considerable employment apart altogether from the value that has accrued in the breeding of greyhounds.</P>
      <P>The only &ldquo;livestock&rdquo; for which there is sale is the greyhound.  I have resolutions from various clubs in my county urging the removal of this tax, and I, therefore, move this amendment.  I do so from very full conviction, because I know there are big interests in Kerry involved in the breeding and sale of greyhounds.  I have not the figures, but I presume the Minister can get them as to the value of our export in greyhounds per annum.  It must be quite a considerable amount.  I have known dogs from Tralee sold for 200 guineas.</P>

      <P>Not many, but I have known dozens sold at figures of 20, 30, 40 and 50 guineas.  It is quite a big business, especially in the belt of the northern county from Tralee on towards Listowel.  I might mention that there is also the question of manufacturing these tracks, for which a person in the Free State has the patent.  He has installed them in Tralee, Galway, Bundoran and other places.  I do not know that there is very much labour involved in the making of the tracks, but I urge the amendment from the point of view of the breeding of greyhounds. Greyhound coursing clubs encourage the breeding of these dogs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister seriously to consider the remission of this tax.  The majority of coursing meetings are not paying propositions, and have to be helped by private subscriptions, by whist drives and dances. <Col N="561" /> Whatever may be said in favour of the tax on mechanical greyhound coursing does not apply to coursing meetings, upon which there will be a very big burden if the tax is put on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Kennedy, I am not speaking on behalf of track racing, for which I have no brief, and about which I know nothing.  I have only seen track racing once or twice.  I am speaking in the interests of coursing clubs.  I would like to know from the Minister what amount he proposes to get from a tax on coursing meetings, and for what period the calculation was made. There was a vast difference between the number of people who attended coursing meetings last season and three years ago.  One-third of the number that attended three years ago did not attend last winter.  I am speaking with considerable experience of three or four counties, and especially on behalf of a county that has considerably supported coursing meetings. I think it will be acknowledged that Kilkenny contributes the largest crowds to coursing meetings.  Book-makers who attend these meetings&mdash; and they are the best authority in that regard&mdash;will agree with that statement.  In that county last year, and in Tipperary one-third of the coursing clubs lost money on the coursing season, and some of them will probably go out of existence.  At any rate, almost a third of them would have disappeared.  This tax practically means the abolition of coursing.  If the Minister looked at the prices realised at the dog sales in Dublin this week he would know that the trade in greyhounds is almost as great as the trade in bloodstock and almost as remunerative, dogs bringing up to £200&mdash;not an uncommon price.  Even £400 was paid for a greyhound the other day.  That means a great deal to small farmers because it is the small farmers and people of that class who benefit from the breeding of greyhounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A concession was made to horse racing and to the Gaelic Athletic Association.  I suppose we will be met on this amendment with the argument <Col N="562" /> that the Minister put up previously, that if he remitted the tax the Forestry Vote or some other Vote would have to suffer.  Is the money to be raised at the expense of people who support coursing while no expense is to be placed on people who support horse racing?  Can the Minister tell me what he expects to derive from the tax, and on what year the calculation was based?  That information will enable the discussion to be carried on with the facts available. I can tell the Minister that at the end of the year coursing clubs will be reduced by fifty per cent.  Deputies who live in the south and the midlands, especially those representing Tipperary, Kilkenny and Limerick, could corroborate every word I am saying if they would only tell what they know of the local situation.  Deputy Gibbons will be able to speak about the clubs in Freshford and Tullaroan.  The same applies to clubs in Kerry and Cork.  The Minister ought to do what is fair in this matter, having regard to the amount involved, and putting aside the fact that the amendment comes from this side of the House.  The object is to preserve a national industry which is worth a considerable amount of money to the country, and from which poor people who need the money will benefit most. If a case can be made for the exemption of horse racing unquestionably a case can be made for coursing. The only consideration should not be political expediency.  It should not be a question if Deputy Norton is to be elected for Kildare or not.  It should be a question of fair play, and appreciation of what is decent and honest, as against discrimination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.  I speak not only from the point of view of coursing meetings, but also from the point of view of racing people because I think the two things are linked up. We should not forget that coursing meetings are very largely the poor man's sport.  Most of those who attend coursing meetings cannot afford to attend race meetings, and they have no desire to do so.  It would be very unfair to give a concession to horse-racing <Col N="563" /> on race courses at the expense of coursing meetings, or those who attend coursing meetings.  I can speak on this question with a certain amount of knowledge.  The headquarters of the coursing association is in my constituency and gives good employment to a fairly large number of hands.  The racing track in Clonmel has been of great benefit to that town, a town that has been hit harder during the past ten years than any other town in Ireland. Since the race track was installed, it has brought a good deal of business to that town.  It has been a great benefit and has given a considerable amount of employment.  I should like to hear the Minister's case for this imposition and I should like to hear the figures for which Deputy Lynch asked him.  I am satisfied from the position in my own county that there is a fairly substantial and valuable export trade in greyhounds. The price of £200 or £300 for a greyhound is not altogether as uncommon as the Minister seems to think it is.  But I am not thinking of the prices from £200 to £500.  I am thinking of the small farmers and labourers who are able to get prices of £10, £20 or £50 for fairly good greyhounds. You cannot divorce greyhound coursing from the racing tracks.  The racing tracks are the inducement for the more general breeding of good greyhounds. They make for the production of a better dog.  They bring out the points of the dog and render him valuable.  I should like if the Minister would take these few words into consideration and, if possible, give us some idea of the value of the export trade in greyhounds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Cleary Mr. Cleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very interested in the attitude of the Minister in this regard. I have been approached by a number of coursing clubs in my county in connection with this tax and I should like the Minister to reconsider it or, at all events, assure us that at some later stage he will give the matter reconsideration.  I take a different view of this matter from some of the Deputies who have spoken.  My impression is that coursing is of very little use to people who sell greyhounds <Col N="564" /> and gain by the selling of them. Coursing, as I know it, is only a sport &mdash;a very expensive sport to those who engage in it.  In my county, it is usually a sport for people who can afford to expend money on it.  It is the track racing that makes whatever market there is for greyhounds.  Since greyhound track racing&mdash;Deputy Gorey will appreciate this&mdash;came into prominence, the value of our export trade in greyhounds has increased.  Were it not for that, greyhound breeding as a profitable proposition would not be worth while.</P>
      <P>I think it would be of greater value to breeders of greyhounds if the tax on track racing were removed.  If you had to differentiate between one and the other, relief of the tax on track racing would be of greater benefit to breeders of greyhounds than would relief of the tax in respect of coursing meetings.  I admit that they both go hand in hand.  I should like the Minister to reconsider his attitude.  I do not think there should be differentiation made.  I would not like to see the tax taken off coursing meetings and left on track racing.  I think that would effect more injury in one way than the benefit which would be gained in another way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coursing meetings have never been run as profitable propositions.  Whether this tax is imposed or not, I am afraid they will not be run as profitable propositions. They have collections and subscriptions and other means of raising money for coursing meetings, and you must have a very high entrance fee for people who run their dogs at these meetings.  No matter which way the tax goes, I think coursing meetings will continue to be non-paying propositions so far as the organisers are concerned.  However, the most valuable thing for breeders of greyhounds would be the removal of the tax on track racing.  That is really what brings out the value of the dog, and it is because of that our export trade in greyhounds has increased to the extent it has.  I see the danger that if we urge the Minister sufficiently strongly to withdraw this tax, the Opposition and ourselves will be responsible <Col N="565" /> for bringing Mr. Thomas to realise that this is another export of the Irish farmer which he can bring under his new Bill.  If Mr. Thomas realises that the greyhound export trade is of greater value to Kerry than the cattle export trade, he will probably remove the cattle export trade from his measure and tax greyhounds instead.</P>
    <P>I should not be so anxious to press this matter if horse racing were not exempted.  Greyhound racing affects the poor man more intimately.  I am not at all convinced that the tax on horse racing was removed, as Deputy Gorey suggested, so that we may have Deputy Norton in Kildare next time. To my mind, Deputy Gorey is more affected.  My idea is that whether this tax is imposed or not, Deputy Gorey will not be elected next time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to the unanimous chorus of appeal to the Minister to exempt this sport from tax.  The number of letters I have received from coursing clubs of my constituency of East Cork indicates how important this tax is regarded by people interested in coursing.  I have been assured that the tax will practically kill coursing.  I am very much impressed by the fact that there have been a number of appeals from the Minister's own Party.  That shows how unanimous the House is in making this request to the Minister.  I should like to appeal particularly on behalf of the poorer men who get comparatively small prices for their greyhounds. To the poor man, a price of £20, £30 or £40 is a very big one. This industry, which is a very important one to the country, will be seriously injured if the Minister insists on imposing this tax.  A very small amount will probably be got in revenue and it will materially injure <Col N="566" /> one of the sports which also serves as an amusement in the country districts. Coursing takes place in my district and I can assure Deputies that very great interest is taken in a remote country district like that in what I may describe as a national sport.  If the Minister persists in adopting a hidebound attitude in respect of the imposition of this tax, he will not receive the number of compliments which were shied at him last night. In fact, I think the compliments wilt take a different form.  I respectfully ask him not to impose this tax upon a sport which is, undoubtedly, deserving of our assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1927" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I also ask the Minister to reconsider this matter.  Certain representations have been made to me-by coursing clubs.  I agree with what Deputy Cleary has said that, in considering this matter, it is very difficult to divorce the position of the coursing club from the position of the racing track.  There is at present a considerable export trade in greyhounds. Irish greyhounds have, apparently, won a place of merit on the track and on the coursing fields in England, so that there is anxiety on the part of interested persons in England to acquire Irish greyhounds.  I do not know if the Minister is aware that coursing and track racing fit in completely in this country, quite contrary to the position in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general controlling body of both track racing and coursing here is the Standing Committee of the Irish Coursing Club.  From the 1st October until the end of February you have the ordinary coursing meetings, whether park or open coursing, in the country, and at the end of that time, say by the beginning of March, you have your track season starting, and it continues until September.  If this tax on open coursing or park coursing meetings is continued it would make such a call on the voluntary subscriptions through the various clubs that these clubs will have to close down.  There is such heavy expense attached to the preservation of land and, where land is not preserved, to the buying of hares that these clubs have to depend to some <Col N="567" /> extent on the gate money, and only a very small charge for admission must be made if people are to be induced to come to these meetings.  The people who attend these meetings are people who are unable to pay very high charges, so that if this tax be imposed it will simply mean that the clubs will have to bear the tax because they will not be able to get it from the public. It is absolutely necessary, I think, for the purpose of knowing how their greyhounds stand with regard to track coursing that the owners of greyhounds should have an opportunity of coursing their dogs during the winter so as to try them out against other dogs.  I do ask the Minister to consider this question and to give it his most sympathetic consideration.  This tax will most seriously interfere with both coursing and track racing and the amount of the tax which will be produced from it will not be very large. A concession has been made in the matter of the entertainments tax on horse-racing and that is an advantage to horse-breeding, because these races give the owners an opportunity of having their horses show their merits. In the same way coursing meetings will be helping the owners of track dogs.  If the track racing ceases I am afraid that in future the pairing in this House will be a great deal more difficult.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Contrary to the views of other Deputies who have spoken I am in favour of the imposition of this tax.  I have been actively associated with coursing for several years and I think it is only fair to support this tax for at least one year. In that view I am supported by resolutions sent to me by two of the leading coursing clubs in the South of Ireland.  These are the Cork City Club and Ballindangan Coursing Club. These clubs are admitted by the Irish Coursing Club to be the most active coursing clubs at present in Ireland. Their view is that they do not consider that the clubs are really capable of bearing the imposition, but they believe that it is only right that coursing clubs should make some sacrifice <Col N="568" /> in the national interest at the present time.  Therefore, on this ground, they ask me to support the imposition of this tax by all the means in my power.</P>

      <P>I feel that I cannot exactly agree with Deputy Murphy on that point and I would request the Minister to give consideration to the tax upon coursing because as far as I know these coursing meetings are not organised for the purpose of making a profit for anybody.  As a general rule they make a loss and I do not believe they could stand up against this tax at all.  I am not so satisfied on the other question of greyhound track racing.  These are generally run by companies and run definitely for profit.  I would appeal to the Minister to give all the consideration possible to open coursing.  I have no case to make for track racing and I do not know much about it.  I am not one of those referred to by Deputy Finlay.  I take an interest in open coursing and I have had numerous letters and resolutions urging that this tax be not imposed. Consequently I would ask the Minister to reconsider it.</P>

      <P>With reference to the amendment introduced by the Minister, I have a case in mind and I think it concerns a branch of the Minister's Department.  It is a case where the actual contractor for work, under the terms of his contract, sub-contracts for the erection of steel work on the site; that is, with the concurrence of the building employer. In that case it is perfectly obvious from the amendment introduced here by the Minister that the sub-contractor could charge the contractor an increased price based on the amount of duties which he, the sub-contractor, had to pay when bringing the steel work into the country for the purpose of erection. When the Minister applies Section 10 of the Finance Act of 1901 in this way it would appear to me that the contractor could not pass on the increased duty which he would have to pay the sub-contractor; he could not pass it on to the building employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to point out the difficulty as I see it.  Section 10 of the Finance Act, 1901, deals with one transaction; that is, the sale of certain goods and the delivery of certain goods.  I will just put the case again as I see it.  You have, first of all, the building employer.  Then you have the contractor under contract with that person.  Under the terms of the contract the contractor is entitled to let out to a sub-contractor the doing of certain work for the due completion of the building.  The sub-contractor has to supply steel, to erect certain steel work on the site of the building. Under Section 10 of the Finance Act. 1901, as applied here, the sub-contractor is the vendor or seller of goods to the contractor.  The sub-contractor can undoubtedly, over the contract price which the contractor has agreed to <Col N="578" /> give him, charge by way of addition the duty which he, the sub-contractor, had to pay when importing these goods.  The position as a result of the application of Section 10 of the Finance Act, 1901 is this: The sub-contractor can undoubtedly recover from the contractor the duty which he has paid on these goods, but there the transaction is finished and the contractor cannot pass it on to the building employer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Because he has not paid the duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1927" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>A case was brought to my notice and I will mention it.  It deals with the erection of a substantial building in Galway under contract from the Board of Works.  In the particular instance I speak of a firm within the country is the general contractor, but the sub-contractors are outside the country.  Undoubtedly the sub-contractors can pass on to the contractor the amount of duty which they have had to pay.  But under the conditions of Section 10 the contractor could not pass on to the building employer, in this case the Board of Works, the amount of extra duty he would be obliged to pay to the sub-contractors. Will the Minister consider between this and the Report Stage&mdash;I think it would be capable of a very easy amendment&mdash;dealing with a case such as I have set out?  The information at my disposal would go to show that this method of sub-contracting is quite common in a number of big building transactions.  Sub-contracting is permitted under the actual contract for a building.  The amendment that I ask the Minister to include would not be dealing with this individual case, but with building contractors in general.</P>

      <P>Under Section 10 of the Finance Act of 1901 and the Finance Act of 1902 the duty was actually paid by the person who passed it on.  In the case of a vendor, when he purchased the article he paid the duty.  When he sold the article he passed on to the purchaser the duty he had paid.  Deputy Finlay's point is that the sub-contractor, having paid the duty, is entitled to recoup himself from the contractor who had not paid the duty directly in the first instance.</P>

      <P>The House may not be aware that when protective duties were imposed by the late Government the same sort of complaint as to delay on the part of the staff of the Customs and Excise in clearing goods was made. It was a very widespread complaint and it was given a good deal of publicity in the Press.  As a result of that a Committee to inquire into these delays was set up by the late Government.  In only one case, and that a very slight case, was there any evidence to show that the delays which took place were due to any laxity on the part of the Revenue Commissioners.  I am satisfied that the same thing applies at the present moment.  If there are delays they are due possibly to the fact that numbers of people who are clearing goods are not familiar with the requirements and the ordinary procedure adopted in clearing dutiable goods. Possibly it is their first experience of clearing such goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position under the Customs law is this: that the unshipping, landing, and bringing to a proper place of examination dutiable goods, putting them into scales where necessary, opening, unpacking, repacking, and other operations, must be performed either by the importer or his agent.  It is no part of the duty of the officers of Customs and Excise to do any of these things.  The necessary Customs entry must be prepared and presented to the Revenue officer by the importer or his agent and the relative goods must then be produced to the officer for examination. A great deal of delay has arisen owing to the fact that these formalities have not been complied with.  Shipping companies, in many instances, owing to the fact, I believe, that their <Col N="581" /> staffs have been insufficient, have failed to do these things, and when they have failed to do these things they have said that they could not get the goods through the Customs, leading the person aggrieved to believe that the responsibility lay on the Customs officers, not on the clearing agent and shipping companies and not possibly, in many instances, on the owners of the goods themselves.</P>
    <P>A good many cases were brought to my notice in which it was alleged that the Customs authorities had been responsible for holding up goods at the Customs.  I have had very careful inquiries made into them.  I shall give a case in point.  A consignment of baskets for fruit imported on 3rd June was presented for free entry on Monday, 6th June.  The officer examined the goods and found them to be dutiable and informed the shipping company that clearance could have been obtained by that date, or any time afterwards, by the passing of a duty entry and the payment of duty.  The duty, I understand, was actually paid by the consignee to the shipping company about the middle of the week, so that within seven days after 3rd June there was absolutely no excuse for any further delay in clearing the goods.  It was not, however, until three or four days afterwards, until the following Saturday, that a clerk was sent to the Customs House to pass the duty entry. In the meantime, it had been decided to exempt baskets of this description and the Commissioners' instructions notifying this exemption were received by the staff on that Saturday morning. The clerk of the shipping company was, therefore, informed that the goods could be delivered on the original free entry.  Notwithstanding that, the goods were not delivered on that date and were not cleared until the following Tuesday&mdash;part of them were cleared on the following Tuesday and the remainder the following Wednesday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 41, there are various repeals in the Schedule in connection with this.  There is one outstanding case, No. 35 of 1926, where it is proposed to alter the whole complexion of the concession which was <Col N="586" /> first made in England, and, subsequently here, in connection with excess profits duty.  In 1925 or 1926 an arrangement was made between the British Government and the commercial community in regard to liability for and easement in respect of excess profits duty.  The commercial community waived their right to get back tax, and the Government at that time introduced an amendment providing for easements except in cases of fraud or wilful neglect.  That was done under the Act of 1926 and I do not propose to weary the House now with the statement the Minister made outside the House and reported in February, 1932.  He said that this going back into the collection of income tax was un-Christian, indefensible and inequitable. The case in respect of excess profits duty rested since 1926 under this Act, on circumstances in which there would be fraud or wilful neglect.  Now they have been amended.  The Minister has taken that out and has given to the Revenue Commissioners the right to go into every and any case, in respect of which a charge would lie, over these periods, and they can go back on these cases of 1914 which were closed, and the position will be, as soon as this Act passes, with these amendments, that, while the commercial community is open to investigation, in respect of charges for excess profits duty, there is no opportunity of getting back money which has been paid and which the State has entered into possession of and which a person was over-charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in his opening speech on the Budget, mentioned that he proposed to give certain facilities to people who would own up&mdash;I think those were his words, in short&mdash;and they were to get a concession of three-quarters of the amount.  There is no mention of three-quarters of the amount in this Bill, from one end to another, and the position is that there is no business in this State, which was liable for excess profits duty since 1914, but may be investigated now, and, while some of them made provision for excess profits duties, in various balance sheets over a few <Col N="587" /> years, that has now passed out.  A wise company would probably put in, for instance, perhaps, a sum of money now, and if they do, they practically invite the attention of the Revenue Commissioners. I would like to say, in connection with the Revenue Commissioners, that while people may take to themselves the right to criticise them, if the law, as it stands, empowers them to make this investigation, they are almost bound to do it.  That is exactly the position here, with regard to this, so I oppose the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1927" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that one of the principal reasons in putting a closing down period on excess profits duty was that the law with regard to excess profits duty is this: Suppose A.B., being the owner of a business premises was liable for excess profits duty and he did not pay it, and, subsequently, sold that business to a bona-fide purchaser, under the law regarding excess profits duty, that bonafide purchaser can be made liable for the excess profits duty which was payable, but which was not paid by his immediate predecessor in business.  If the Minister opens again the door to assessments for excess profits duty, a general door, without any limitations as to fraud or wilful neglect, as has been pointed out by Deputy Cosgrave, the law is such that the Revenue Commissioners in this country can turn to anyone who has purchased a business since 1920 up to, in fact, the year 1932, which business may have been liable <Col N="588" /> for excess profits duty which was not paid, and can raise an assessment for excess profits duty on that purchaser &mdash;I do not care whether he is a purchaser by descent or a purchaser for value&mdash;and make him pay what his predecessor in the business should have paid fourteen or fifteen years ago.</P>

      <P>When does the Minister intend to circulate the amendment with regard to the tobacco duty which he promised?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the hands of the draftsman, as a matter of fact, and will probably be in the hands of Deputies on Monday morning</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That will not give time for amendments to be put in. Amendments will then have to be accepted in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the Bill has to go to the Seanad on Friday night.</P>

      <P>What is the reason for not taking the Bill on Tuesday?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Simply because a number of other amendments have to <Col N="591" /> go in on Report Stage and they would not be ready.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we not take portion of the Bill and the amendments which would be ready and dispose of that part of the Bill?  It is quite possible that we will have time to spare on Tuesday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We are standing by the agreement as to Wednesday, but I am now informed that it will be possible to circulate the tobacco duty amendment to-night, and we can take amendments in the House to that amendment, if necessary.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 2.10 p.m. until Tuesday, 12th July, at 3 p.m.</P>
