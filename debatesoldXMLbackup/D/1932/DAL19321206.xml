      <P>I am taking the two questions together.  I am having the statistical information requested by the Deputy in Questions 2 and 3 inserted in the Official Report, so far as the particulars required are available in my Department.  The items in the questions relating to grants in the charge of the Department of Education and the Department of Agriculture may be obtained by addressing the Ministers concerned.  I may add that the bulk of the statistical information desired is given in respect of the financial years 1930-31 and 1931-32, as figures for the calendar years 1931 and 1932 are in most cases not readily available.</P>

Last week, owing to abnormal pressure of work, five industrial inspectors were transferred to another section of my Department; this is an emergency measure only, and it is my intention to restore the inspectorate to its full strength as soon as circumstances permit.</P>
      <P>As regards the last part of the question, one senior industrial inspector and five inspectors are now engaged wholetime in the work of inspection of factories and workshops.</P>

Under the latter procedure the importers are at liberty to import from any country they please, up to the limit of their licences.  The ruling prices here, and the fact that a bounty on export is payable, induced Belgian private interests to purchase cattle here in November and the present month.  In these circumstances it was not considered necessary for further purchases to be made by the Department, even if this had been feasible; but in any event, the Department have no control as to the channel through which Belgian holders of licences make their purchases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil approves of the Trade Agreement between the Irish Free State and the Dominion of Canada, signed at Ottawa on the 20th day of August, 1932, a copy of which was laid on the Table of the Dáil on the 13th day of October, 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies who will have read the terms of the agreement will have noticed that it contains three provisions.  By Article I, goods, the produce or manufacture of Canada, imported into the Irish Free State cannot be made subject to other or higher duties than those paid on similar goods the produce or manufacture of any other country.  By Article II, goods, the <Col N="784" /> produce or the manufacture of the Irish Free State, imported into Canada cannot be subjected to other or higher duties than those paid on similar goods the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  Article III provides that the agreement shall be subject to the approval of the Parliaments of the Dominion of Canada and of the Irish Free State.  Upon approval being given, it shall be brought into force on a date to be agreed upon by the Governments of the Dominion of Canada and of the Irish Free State and it shall remain in force for a period of five years from the date of its coming into force, and thereafter until the expiration of six months from the date on which either Government shall have given to the other notice of its intention to terminate the agreement.</P>
    <P>Article I does not require any change in the customs law of this State.  It has been the practice to confer upon goods, the produce or manufacture of Canada, the benefit of the most favoured nation treatment in the matter of customs duties.  That means that the preferential rate of duty, provided in the case of the majority of our tariffed items, applied to the goods of these countries as to the goods the produce or the manufacture of other States of the British Commonwealth.  In future, that general application of tariffed preferences to States, members of the Commonwealth, will not, of course, operate. In consequence of the engagements entered into at Ottawa and other engagements that may be entered into in future, instead of general preferences, certain specific preferences will be given, except where the contrary is provided.  In considering Article II of this agreement, Deputies must refer to the agreement entered into at the same time between the Dominion of Canada and the Government of the United Kingdom which was set out in the report circulated to Deputies. Schedule E of that agreement contains a list of the various items on which altered rates of duty will apply as from the coming into operation of this agreement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="785" /> In respect of a great many items contained in that long list, we have no interest but where the produce or manufactures of this country are concerned, it is important for us to ensure that our industrialists can compete in the Canadian market and will not be placed in any worse position than their competitors from Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The Canadian Treaty with Great Britain provided for a reduction of customs duties upon ale, beer, porter and stout, upon spirits and strong waters of any kind, and upon various classes of linen and woollen goods, hosiery and the like.  The benefit of that reduction is secured for industrialists here who are, or who may at some time in the future be, interested in the Canadian market.  Heretofore, the exports of the produce of the Irish Free State to Canada were not very great in volume.  The value of these exports during the year 1930 was £133,389.  During the same year, Canadian goods imported to the Irish Free State were valued at £772,345. The Irish Free State goods exported to Canada were as follows, in the order of importance:&mdash;Tractors, woollen tissues, biscuits, live horses, raw wool, and drink of various kinds. Trade which Irish woollen manufacturers had in Canada for woollen tissues was, since the year to which these figures related, seriously impaired. It was, in fact, almost entirely stopped by the substantial rise in the Canadian duty.  That position has now been rectified, and it is hoped that manufacturers will regain the trade they formerly had in this country and they are taking steps in that direction.  The same applies to various other articles.  Various conferences have taken place between myself, and officials of my Department, on the one hand, and Irish industrialists, likely to be interested in the Canadian market, on the other hand, and steps are being taken to investigate the possibilities there.  I do not think it is necessary that I should say more than this at this stage.  The particular agreement has to be ratified by the Dáil, and when ratified, and brought into operation, it will apply <Col N="786" /> for a period of five years and will continue in operation unless six months' notice is given by either side for the termination of this agreement.  I accordingly move the motion.</P>

I said before, about this, that those who were going to sell their souls for a mess of pottage might, at any rate, have seen to it that the mess was going to give some sort of a substantial meal.  The speech we have just listened to shows what is thought by the Government of this agreement. I have a sort of feeling that the Minister has never been more uncomfortable in his life&mdash;and he has had many uncomfortable moments in this House&mdash;than in moving this motion. The only thing I regret is that in order to add to his embarrassment the gentleman who signed this agreement on behalf of the Free State, was not present to listen to him and to add, if that were possible, to the Minister's wonderful and powerful persuasion in asking us to pass this agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We started for that Conference, in so far as we were to have dealings with people other than the United Kingdom delegation, with the greatest of hopes, at least so we were told. There was, however, no preparation made for the Conference.  I asked a question, in the early part of the Summer to find out what precautions had been taken, what consideration had been given to the Agenda and what discussions there had been with any of our producers, likely to be interested. And the most we could get was the sapience of the President that at the Conference only general lines of agreement would be laid down and nothing in the way of detailed trade arrangements was in prospect.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce to-day referred to the trade agreement between the United Kingdom and Canada, and I think that in Schedule E there is detail enough to show how completely astray was the point of <Col N="787" /> view held and announced here before our delegates went to Cánada.  But the fact that such a viewpoint was held prevented any discussion being had with our producers, with the object of discovering what we might get from members of the British Commonwealth outside the United Kingdom.  And yet we were told by some of the delegation, before they started, that unless agreements could be secured with the United Kingdom there would not be much use in going to Canada.  We were told in a later message from them, after their passage across the ocean, that they were still in the same frame of mind and that what they did would not count unless they could come to an arrangement with the United Kingdom.  In the end this is the only concrete thing that we have got from this International Conference.  But these were high hopes held out to the people of this country with regard to our prospects at the Conference, and these hopes did not found upon trading prospects with the United Kingdom. The <i>Irish Press</i> wrote a series of editorials bearing on these matters. In one dated the 3rd June we were told this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;From the preliminary Press statements that reach us from the Dominions, it is clear that at Ottawa there will be the deepest divergence of opinion and little prospect of any substantial agreement between people whose economic interests differ so greatly.  In that atmosphere we can fancy what Mr. Thomas's &lsquo;tact&rsquo; will produce.  The Irish Delegation will go earnestly anxious to do its best both for the Free State and to make the Conference as a whole a success.  That Mr. Thomas's preliminary action is to announce Britain's adoption of a policy of bad manners is Britain's concern and nobody else's.  The Free State imports over fifty million pounds worth of goods each year.  The Dominions can supply many of these goods as well as Britain.  If business, therefore, is to be done at Ottawa&mdash;should the Conference ever be allowed by Mr. <Col N="788" /> Thomas to get that far&mdash;the Irish Free State is in a perfectly happy position.  It has a tariff weapon which it can use in favour of whatever Dominion has the good sense, as well as the good manners, not to go to Ottawa full of anti-Irish spleen.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If, bearing in mind our &ldquo;perfectly happy position&rdquo; as described, we have to comfort ourselves with whatever little hope is to be gleaned from this agreement we would have&mdash;possibly, too hastily&mdash;to conclude that all the Dominions went to that Conference without having the good sense or manners to be empty of Irish spleen. Something similar was repeated on the 22nd July in the same paper. In an editorial which devoted itself to the prospects of an entire breakdown of the Ottawa Conference and incidentally went on to speak of the speech of the leader of the Irish Free State Delegation, that is, the Vice-President of the present Government, we find this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Most of the speeches at the opening of the Ottawa Conference yesterday show what small hope there is of much resulting from the deliberations thus begun.  The spokesmen of all countries were full of geniality.  They overflowed in optimism, they saluted each other in graceful phrases but they avoided detail.  Not one of them produced a plan by which entry of specific goods to one market would be permitted in return for such-and-such a preference in another.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And later down it stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That it will be a hardly fought battle goes without saying.  Britain wants markets for manufactures but is not willing or is actually unable to give in return markets for the primary industries of the Commonwealth&mdash;wool, dead meat, grain, fruit, dairy produce.  The Dominions want larger British consumption of their products but as they are building up native industries themselves, they are reluctant to permit the dumping of British manufactured goods.  To resolve that mammoth clash of interests is not Ottawa's only task.  Each individual <Col N="789" /> Dominion has a conflict among her farmers and her factory-owners. The farmers are willing to lower the Dominions tariff wall to British manufacturers in the hope thereby of getting a bigger share of the British purchasers of their products. The factory-owners on the other hand naturally want the tariff walls as high as they can get them.  If out of this conflict of opposites Ottawa can produce an economic paradise, the various Delegations will be the joy and the envy of the world.  Far more likely is it that each of the Delegations will win a little for itself and that in five weeks' time that little will be magnified to conceal the lot in which no agreement could be reached.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should here remark on my own that that last happy phrase is a perfect description of the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce this afternoon.  But&mdash;to continue the Editor's criticism&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Seán T. O'Kelly's speech was one of the best delivered.  He set out the claim the Irish people have on Canada, Australia, New Zealand and other English-speaking countries, the claim of a nation which helped to make these lands great.  He stressed the fact that the delegates he led were there, as the others were, &lsquo;to seek first of all the interests of our own people.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then this special point, so much in our favour, was harped upon again.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He pointed out that the Free State was in a position to take particular advantage of any opportunities the Conference gave.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is the quotation which is given from that speech of the Minister:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Special difficulties have arisen affecting about 85 per cent. of our trade, difficulties which may involve substantial changes in the form and direction of that trade.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The editorial then continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No doubt Britain no less than the Dominions understood the reference. If we can get from other nations manufactured goods hitherto supplied from Britain, we shall get them there.  A trade of some <Col N="790" /> £30,000,000 is thus available for competition by States other than Great Britain.  In so far as the Ottawa Conference will provide the Free State with opportunities to exploit that situation to the Irish people's benefit, thus far will it be of real advantage to this country. For the rest, the Free State Delegation will use its best effort to make the Conference, despite the unhappy star under which it meets, as successful as the opposing interests within it permit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So we must regretfully accept this Treaty as the result of the exploitation by our Delegation of the exceedingly advantageous position in which they found themselves there, and as the best we could do even after the Vice-President's ominous warning that difficulties had arisen affecting about 85 per cent. of our trade, &ldquo;difficulties which may involve substantial changes in the form and direction of that trade.&rdquo;  We had purchases of £30,000,000 worth of manufactured goods to play with.  The United Kingdom Delegation had been worried that through their blunders, or, as the Minister for Finance had with tactful delicacy phrased it, because certain statesmen were going to &ldquo;act like John Bull in the Canadian china shop,&rdquo; £30,000,000 trade was likely to be endangered, and although this warning had been conveyed in one of the best speeches of the Conference and although we were in a perfectly happy position with a tariff weapon at hand to use as we pleased, this pitiful thing is the result.</P>
    <P>What does it come to?  Relate Article 1 to Article 2 and it simply means this: that for a period of five years certain, and for as long a period after that as the Treaty is not denounced, we give to Canadian goods coming into this country preferences equal to those which we give to the most favoured country in the world, whether that be a Commonwealth country or a country outside the Commonwealth of Nations, and in return we secure that our goods will be charged at whatever rate British goods are charged going into Canada. <Col N="791" /> was it delicacy that made our people refrain from putting into the first paragraph that we would give to Canadians the preference we would accord to Britain?  If so, why did not the same delicacy operate in the next clause?  I can only explain the reference to Great Britain and Northern Ireland in the second Article on this basis, that there be a definite recognition by our delegates that the goods we were most likely to encounter in competition for the Canadian market were British goods and that the preferences we would have to fight would be the preferences accorded to British goods, notwithstanding the minatory nonsense about substantial changes in the form and direction of 85 per cent. of our trade.  In the second Article it is clearly stated that whatever preferences Britain gets on goods going into Canada, we also must get them.  But in Article I, although, I think, it is clear that the country most likely to get the best preference from us under normal conditions is Britain, we do not say that Canadian goods will get whatever preferences have been from time to time accorded to British goods.  We avoid the hurtful British reference by setting as the standard the lowest preference, whether it is that of a Commonwealth country or of one outside the Commonwealth.  This childishness is in keeping with the minatory tone of the Vice-President's statement when he said that 85 per cent. of our trade was affected by the difficulties which had arisen and &ldquo;which may involve substantial changes in the form and direction of that trade.&rdquo;  That was only put up there for the moment, the bluff, so easily called, that we might give a preference to some outside country lower than what we are by force of circumstances almost bound to give to Great Britain.</P>
    <P>At any rate, this is what we are signing for five years: that we guarantee that Canadian goods on entry into the Saorstát shall not be subject to any other or higher preference than goods coming here from any other country, that is, we <Col N="792" /> grant the completest most-favoured-nation terms, or most-favoured-Commonwealth State terms, and in return we get a guarantee that our goods shall be admitted to Canada at British rates.  First of all, what is the amount of trade we do?  The Minister says that the figures were about £133,000 one way, as against three quarters of a million pounds the other way.  We exported the former and smaller amount and imported the second amount.  The most that the Minister could tell us about the future, as the result of this gilt-edged agreement, is that there have been meetings already with producers in this country and that steps have been taken to investigate the possibilities of trade with Canada under the new conditions.  What about the other side of it?  What about this trump card which we had in our hands&mdash;the £30,000,000 worth of trade which we had with Great Britain? What is the prospect of our doing that trade with Canada rather than Great Britain?  Because, if we are going to do a big trade in sending our goods to Canada, it is pretty certain that after a bit Canada is going to demand from us a better percentage of our trade.  Has the Minister any indication from Canadian manufacturers that they are likely in the near future to replace in this country the goods that are now being manufactured in Great Britain, and if so, to what percentage of that British trade and over what range of goods?</P>
    <P>The second point to be considered is this.  It is apparently considered really beneficial that goods going from here into Canada are to be put on terms of fair competition&mdash;equal competitive terms&mdash;with goods going from Great Britain.  Do our manufacturers say that they are likely to export much under these conditions? If they do, what manufacturers are they who say that they are going to carry on trade under these conditions? It would be interesting to know.  Are they amongst those manufacturers who call for a tariff against British goods when those goods come in here on equal terms.  If this really is a benefit, <Col N="793" /> it means that our people have some hope of standing up in an equal fight with British manufacturers, when both are exporting to Canada.  If that is so, why cannot our people manufacture for the home market, where they have the advantage of production at home and the protection of the amount of the freight paid on goods coming in here.  Why cannot they manufacture for sale here on equal terms and without help against the British industrialist?</P>
    <P>This agreement, however, cannot be taken by itself.  For the moment, it is the only thing we have got to consider, but the terms of this agreement and indeed the terms of all these agreements, were so arranged at Ottawa that they were supposed to interlock into one decent whole.  Even though the more important pieces of that interlocking whole are missing for the time being, we have got to see that this agreement will not prevent any decent trade agreement being made later on with other countries. The Minister has referred us to the agreement made as between the United Kingdom and Canada.  Sooner or later, this country has got to make a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, and I think that we will then have to take this agreement between the United Kingdom and Canada as the model.  We must at least take it as laying down the lines upon which other trade agreements will have to proceed if they are to be made with the United Kingdom. There are, therefore, two or three items of importance that arise immediately upon this three clause Treaty of ours. If we are going to have our goods subject to no higher duty than is leviable upon United Kingdom goods we have to look elsewhere in this Report to find out what is the present position as between Canada and the United Kingdom, and what system is there in the agreement now made between the United Kingdom and Canada for varying the duties now established.</P>
    <P>In the Treaty between the United Kingdom and Canada the first eight Articles give the British side of the <Col N="794" /> bargain.  The first Article provides that the free entry of goods allowed under the Import Duties Act, 1932, is to continue, but subject to a certain reservation made in Schedule A.  In Article 2 the Government of the United Kingdom bound itself to invite its Parliament to pass legislation to achieve what is set out in Schedule B. In the third, they bound themselves that the general ad valorem duty of 10 per cent. imposed by Section 1 of the Import Duties Act, 1932, would not be reduced except with the consent of the Canadian Government.  The fourth is a relaxation Article.  The fifth is full of danger to our derided cattle trade.  The sixth is a most important Article from the point of view of producers here, because it comes to this, that as soon as the United Kingdom Government had received from the Commission which was then sitting a report upon the re-organisation of the pig industry in the United Kingdom then that Government bound itself to introduce to its Parliament measures regulating the supply of bacon and hams, from all sources into the United Kingdom.  It also makes provision for this&mdash;and a most important item it is&mdash;that there would be free entry of Canadian bacon and hams of good quality up to a maximum of 2,500,000 cwt. per annum.</P>
    <P>The Commission that was dealing with the bacon industry in the United Kingdom has since reported and has recommended a rationalisation scheme. Already negotiations have been entered into with quite a number of countries which were sending bacon and hams into the United Kingdom in fierce competition with the goods that used to go from this country into the United Kingdom, and about a month ago agreements were made, regularising this trade, and enforcing a reduction of imports.  Article 7 has regard to tobacco and has no reaction, good or bad, upon this country. Article 8 is an extension clause with regard to the Colonies.</P>
    <P>The other side of this agreement is very important from our angle, because if and when we have a trade agreement with the United Kingdom <Col N="795" /> it is to be presumed that this type of conditions will have to be regarded. The first of this new series of Articles is number 9, referring to the very lengthy Schedule E appended to this agreement.  Under that Article the Canadian Government bound itself to invite its Parliament to pass the legislation necessary to substitute for whatever duties were then leviable the duties set out opposite the different items in Schedule E.  That will represent, in so far as the items set down in detail in Schedule E are articles manufactured here for export or with an exportable surplus, the advantages we get under this agreement in return for binding ourselves for five years to admit into this country Canadian goods at whatever is the lowest rate that we impose upon any goods coming into this country from anywhere.  In addition, there are six Articles that must be read together.  Articles 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 deal with the arrangements that were made at Ottawa with regard to tariffs against British goods.  I do not intend to go through them in detail, but the general effect of them is this: the Canadian Government bound itself that no duties hereafter would be imposed upon United Kingdom goods going into Canada except after examination by a non-party tariff board; it also bound itself that existing duties would be sent for revision to that same judicial Tariff Commission; it bound itself to bring into its Parliament any reports received from that Commission, and to invite that Parliament to pass the necessary legislation in accordance with the Commission's recommendation. Even the terms of reference, in a general way, are given to this Tariff Commission.</P>
    <P>Article 10 says that the Canadian Government undertake that protection by tariff will be afforded against United Kingdom products only to those industries which are reasonably assured of sound opportunities for success.  That is the first limitation. The second is in Article 11: &ldquo;During the currency of this agreement the tariff shall be based on the principle <Col N="796" /> that protective duties shall not exceed such level as will give the United Kingdom producers full opportunities of reasonable competition,&rdquo; and that reasonable competition is defined, &ldquo;on the basis of the relative cost of economic and efficient production, provided that in the application of such principles special consideration shall be given to the case of industries not fully established.&rdquo;  Article 12 provides for the constitution forthwith of the Tariff Board.  No. 13 is an Article which provides for the review of existing duties.  Article 14 provides that &ldquo;No existing duty shall be increased on United Kingdom goods except after an enquiry and the receipt of a report from the Tariff Board.&rdquo;  Article 15 guarantees the United Kingdom producers full rights of audience before that Tariff Board when it has under consideration any matter arising under Article 13 or 14.</P>
    <P>Let us analyse these clauses in reference to the new position.  Our goods are going to enjoy the tariff rates which, under this clause, are given or likely to be given to British goods.  Look what that means&mdash;that hereafter, either with regard to existing duties or any new duty that may be proposed, a judicial, non-party&mdash; and, I think, even non-political&mdash; tariff board has got to investigate. The United Kingdom producers have full rights of audience before that Board, and the Government, in so far as it has any sway over Parliament, binds itself to introduce legislation in accordance with the reports submitted from time to time.  The basis of the report is to be that protective duties shall not exceed such level as will give the United Kingdom producers full opportunity of reasonable competition, so that the standards our goods have to pass, reading these clauses side by side with our own trade agreement, is the tariff which Canada is allowed to put on, scaling that tariff to the height required to give British manufacturers reasonable protection on the basis of the relative cost of economic and efficient production.  Economic and efficient production will hereafter rule the tariff rate on goods going into Canada, and that rate, which is to be <Col N="797" /> set according to the standard of British economic production and British efficiency, is going to rule our goods going into Canada also.  Most of the tariffs we have put on in this country recently have been imposed on this basis, that the ordinary competition we suffer from Great Britain is not reasonable competition, and yet we now adopt for this trade agreement with Canada the standard which a Tariff Board in Canada will give on the basis of British efficient and economic production, and will give only to industries in Canada which are reasonably assured of sound opportunities for success.  It is abundantly clear that this trade treaty of ours with Canada is not worth anything as a trade agreement in itself, and the only thing we have really to consider is how far it may hamper us eventually in making the really valuable agreement, that which we ought to have been engaged in making with Great Britain.  I stress here again and feel we should bear it in mind all the time that we have got eventually to make an agreement with Great Britain and it will presumably follow the lines laid down here in the agreement made with Canada, and that further agreement which is in this book and made with Australia.  The trade treaty put before us is the only little fragment which has come to us from all the mutual advantages that were sought and, to a certain extent, got from that Ottawa Conference.  We talk here of having a new scheme of economy&mdash; readjusting the whole economics of the country.  We are to some extent achieving that in a Bill which is now in its last Stage in this House, and that Cereals Bill pivots on the price to be paid on certain articles and on the tests adopted to determine whether that article is up to standard. We have been told by the people responsible for the Bill that they do not know whether they can ever define what the standard of millable wheat in this country is.</P>
    <P>That is the haphazard way the present Government are changing the economic system of this country, while strangely, at the same time they are <Col N="798" /> subsidising all the dairy products and live-stock exports that used to be so condemned.  For the whole trend of these subsidies is to keep going the particular form of economy that prevails in the country and which has always been so severely condemned, and so recently condemned by the people who moved this Wheat Bill. But in contrast with that muddled procedure Ottawa did represent a real rationalisation scheme&mdash;Ottawa is represented by these other agreements in which we have no part.  Only in a slight way, by this agreement with Canada, do we fit into probably the biggest rationalisation scheme ever attempted.  I have already referred to a clause about bacon.  I use the bacon arrangement to illustrate what I mean.  An arrangement was made with Canada, that even after a named Commission had reported, no matter what was done on foot of the report, Canada was to have free entry for bacon and hams up to a maximum of 2,500,000 cwts. per annum.  Those who have followed events in recent months will have observed that there has been further progress in that particular rationalisation process in bacon and ham, progress made mainly with the Commonwealth countries but also with certain other foreign countries with whom Britain is engaged at the moment in making trade agreements.  So, too, with butter, meat and other items of importance, and all done in connection with a very big and well considered scheme of economic re-adjustment in Great Britain.  That is what is happening at the moment on the other side of the water, and instead of playing a foremost part in that scheme we are in exactly the same position as we were in at Ottawa&mdash;we are in the corner for the time being, we are in the corner at this most important period when all the re-fashioning is going on on the other side.  It is, of course, argued that this is not the true picture, and the newest method of explaining our difficulties is to say that it is not the tariffs put on against us which are causing the harm, but that it is the lowering of prices which has taken place in England generally and which is due to the decline in purchasing <Col N="799" /> power of the English community.</P>
    <P>Now, it is common case with everybody that if we were normally operating with the United Kingdom we must have made our best agreement with the United Kingdom, and that these other ones with Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, and all the other countries would be of minor importance in comparison with the United Kingdom one.  We had this trump card of the purchase of £30,000,000 of manufactured goods which we did not intend to purchase from the Dominions, and in return for that we should have been able to get a better footing in the British market for the goods we were producing here&mdash; producing at a profit to our own producers&mdash;and we should have guaranteed to continue in that production instead of making this fatuous change over to a particular type of product like wheat, with which the world is saturated at the moment, and which we cannot produce at anything like the price at which it can be produced and imported into this country.  Remember also that these agreements made at Ottawa carried with them, not merely the question of the quantitative regulation of imports into Great Britain, but also carried with them this promise that on meat products of different types there is to be consultation during this year and next year, with a view to stabilising the prices of certain primary products so as to give to the Dominion producers a price to which they could look forward with certainly year by year.  And there was a further promise given that prices were not going to be stabilised at the level to which competition had reduced them just now&mdash; there was, at any rate, going to be an increase in the wholesale prices.  That was the time when we should have been able to play a part which would be of advantage to the producers of this country, because we certainly had the advantage that we purchased so much in the way of manufactured goods from the United Kingdom&mdash;more than any other Dominion could claim.  With regard to the point that the lack of <Col N="800" /> purchasing power of the British consumer had caused the drop in prices of these meat exports to the United Kingdom from the different Dominions, that point was questioned in the English Parliament, and this emerged. A single item was taken for purposes of comparison&mdash;the amount of frozen mutton and lamb imported into the United Kingdom.  The information sought by Parliamentary question was what was the amount imported from Australia and from New Zealand respectively during the twelve months ending 30th June of this year, and the average annual imports from each of those countries during the five years ending 30th June, 1931.  The figures given were these.  The annual average for the five years ending 30th June, 1931, from Australia, 690,000 cwts.; in the year from that to the end of June 1932 this figure had risen to 1,190,000 cwts.  From New Zealand the annual average during the five years was 2,935,000 cwts., which had risen in the twelve months to 3,908,000 cwts.  Since that question was answered and because of it, or at any rate because of the discussions going on to which that question was relevant, there have been many negotiations in Great Britain with a view to having the quantity of imports from these countries reduced, and great reductions have taken place.</P>
    <P>When these reductions were taking place we should have been prominent in securing place for our goods and in ousting the goods that were coming from other countries.  If it does happen that the chance comes to us of getting an agreement with Great Britain before the new system is consolidated, and before the new five-year arrangements have been made primarily with the Dominions, but extended outside the Commonwealth so as to replace the products that are no longer going from this side to Britain, then eventually what we will have to consider is the same type of agreement as has been made between the United Kingdom and Canada.  But, at the moment, we have not even an indication from the Minister of what might satisfy the revengeful feelings of certain people here who want only revenge and do not care what happens to the country's <Col N="801" /> economy.  We have no indication from him as to what portion of the £30,000,000 purchases heretofore made from Great Britain is going to be made in the future from Canada, and, as a complement to that, he has not told us what fraction of the exports that we used to send to Great Britain is, from this time, going to enter, under the new arrangement and because of the new arrangement, Canada.</P>
    <P>Unless we get an answer to these two questions I cannot see that there is any positive good likely to result from this new trade agreement.  In itself, it is not to be objected to.  I do not say that it does any harm, but I can see very little good proceeding from it.  Could the Minister tell us what steps are being taken to investigate the possibilities of further trade with Canada and, if they have progressed, to what point?  Would he say what hope there is of any industrialist here getting an increased trade with Canada because of this agreement and to what extent?</P>
    <P>The only virtue that the agreement has is that it does not seem likely hereafter to impede a good arrangement being made with the only one of the Commonwealth countries with which a good arrangement, one worth anything, is possible.  But, accepting it even in this unenthusiastic way, a few points require care.  I do not know just what emphasis can be put on the line or two which ends Article 11 of the United Kingdom agreement with Canada: &ldquo;Provided that in the application of such principle special consideration shall be given to the case of industries not fully established.&rdquo;  I presume that that, at any rate, has got to be read with Article 10, where that Article ordains that protection hereafter is only going to be given &ldquo;to those industries which are reasonably assured of sound opportunities for success.&rdquo;  It seems to me that if there is ahead&mdash;as the hope of it certainly is in most people's minds&mdash;a good trade footing with Great Britain, and if those two Articles hereafter govern our trade relations with the United Kingdom. then some number of these unascertained 300 factories that the Minister boasts of having started in <Col N="802" /> this country will probably not last long.  At any rate, the principle, if it is to be called a principle at all, on which the Minister operates in accumulating tariffs on in this country will have to be changed, because I presume all the time, taking the analogy of the agreement that is here with Canada and the agreement with Australia, that much the same type of procedure will be proposed to us eventually so as to ensure fair play as between the manufacturers of the different countries of the Commonwealth. The way that fair play is to be secured is, first of all, by the appointment of tariff boards to assess tariff applications and, further, by their appointment on the basis that they are to be non-party and, in the main, they are to be judicial.</P>
    <P>With some reservations that plan can be accepted here.  But there would have to be some reservations made. At any rate we shall require hereafter to have explained the fulness of the phrase &ldquo;special consideration shall be given to the case of industries not fully established.&rdquo;  Taking that as the principle with some reservations, even that principle can be accepted.  For that reason I personally would have no objection to the agreement that we have before us in these three articles being entered into between the Irish Free State and the Dominion of Canada, but I can see no real good coming out of it.  There was a golden opportunity afforded for securing material benefit to the people of this country, if the Delegation had really gone there, as the Vice-President said, &ldquo;to seek first of all the interests of our own people.&rdquo;  But if this is all that he can bring us back to show how well he observed the pledge that he put on himself of seeking &ldquo;first of all the interests of our own people,&rdquo; then we must say that the evidence is not convincing.  The interests of our own people are not going to be helped to any great extent by this.</P>
    <P>The point about signing for five years need not, I think, worry us to any great extent.  If this is a good agreement it is worth making for five years, particularly when we get the clauses exposed to us as they are here so that <Col N="803" /> we can read them for what they are worth, and make up our minds as to what will result to the country from them.  If it is a bad agreement, I do not think there will be any difficulty in getting a variation of it, if it can be shown that a variation is required in the interests both of the Canadian people and of the people of this country.  There is nothing outstandingly unfair as regards the balance of these two articles, because in the end they come to the same thing: that we each guarantee to the other the entry of goods on a United Kingdom preference basis.  Because of an anti-British pretence there is a delicacy about accepting in Article 1&mdash; it is clear throughout the article&mdash; a recognition that the United Kingdom is going to be the test as between ourselves and Canada.  It is the rate at which United Kingdom goods will go into Canada or come in here that is going to matter to each country.  We might as well have said that in Article 1, but for all that it matters it can remain as it is.</P>
    <P>This, however, has to be stated in relation to it&mdash;it is on this basis it has been discussed by the other Parliaments concerned&mdash;that this five years' agreement is accepted subject to the constitutional reservation which must have been present to the minds of all the representatives who agreed to this five years' agreement at Canada, that no Government can bind its successor.  It can only, when it ceases to be a Government, plead with its successor to continue an agreement such as this.  If circumstances change with the advent of a new Government, then agreements of this type might have to be scrapped.  That is, no doubt, understood.  The only warning that might have to be given beyond that general warning is this, that if hereafter it is found that this does not interlock properly with a Saorstát-United Kingdom agreement then it is this agreement which must fall by the way, because the United Kingdom agreement which will eventually have to be made will be the really important one for the people of this country.</P>
    <P>If the present Government do not <Col N="804" /> set themselves out to get the other parts built all round this, and if some other Government has to take the matter in hands later, this will not be regarded as a foundation, but as something which is merely to be inserted into the general agreement.</P>
    <P>While this agreement was being hammered out in Canada, there were a few speeches made there by our representatives.  Because no reference to it appears in this treaty, I would like to have some information about one matter.  A statement was made by the Irish Free State Delegation to the Financial and Monetary Committee. Incidentally, as regards that part of the report, I might remark that those who produced this book so definitely on the model of the two books brought out previously by the United Kingdom Government need not have followed it so closely as to copy out the obvious miscalculations in relation to money that appear in the other booklets.  In the second part of the report, as presented there, this occurs:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Irish Free State pound, resting on a sterling exchange standard, has at all times up to the present been maintained at parity with the pound sterling.  The position of the Irish Free State as a creditor country has facilitated this.  There is, accordingly, no problem of exchange instability between the Irish Free State and the United Kingdom with which this Conference need be concerned.  Notwithstanding this, the Irish Free State is materially interested in the general problem of exchange instability as exemplified in recent times both in the world generally and more especially in the case of some of the inter-Commonwealth exchanges.  The delegates of the Irish Free State consider that the stabilisation of exchanges between members of the Commonwealth could profitably be investigated at this Conference, and that any progress made would be a valuable contribution towards the solution of the wider problems that may hereafter engage the attention of the proposed World Monetary Conference.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="805" /> Did that investigation take place at the Ottawa Conference?  The next paragraph states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Should other members of the Commonwealth find it feasible to maintain stability in terms of sterling, the methods to be adopted for this purpose would appear to be likely to involve problems which would be common in several respects to those members and the Irish Free State, and on which the interchange of views at this Conference should serve a useful purpose.  The experience of the Irish Free State in operating a sterling exchange standard suggests that there are points of policy in the administration of such a standard on which communication and co-operation between the various authorities operating such a standard would be beneficial to all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, I would like to know if there was such communication and co-operation at Ottawa when this matter about the operation of a sterling exchange standard took place.  The next paragraph states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is recognised that wide issues affecting exchange standards in general involve considerations which could not well be explored fully by a body having the limited membership of this Conference.  Nevertheless, if the method of a sterling exchange standard, or something approximating to it, is to be adopted generally, even as an interim measure pending further advance, it would seem to be very desirable that the members of the Commonwealth who resort to this method should have the advantage of some enlightenment from the authorities of the United Kingdom as to the policy to be pursued in regard to sterling itself, and especially the expectations entertained as to its future exchange relations with free gold currencies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On that there is a continuation of the previous question.  Did the Irish Free State delegation have the advantage of some enlightenment from the authorities of the United Kingdom on this question?  It is recognised in that part of the report which I have read, the Irish Free State Report, that any <Col N="806" /> question of maintaining stability in terms of sterling or operating the sterling exchange standard or not doing so is regarded as a matter for consultation and communication between the different members of the Commonwealth both when this memorandum was put forward and now. Seeing that nothing appears about it in the agreement, we would like to know whether there was any conference, anything even approaching an agreement, any arrangement whereby the conferences held out there were to be continued, and if there has been since then any continuation of conferences of that type.</P>
    <P>I notice in the report from which I have read a statement which, if it was not added to by some sort of oral evidence on the part of the delegates, cannot be taken to be an accurate statement of the position here:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Despite the fall in production at home and the reduced external trade, it has been found necessary to increase the burden of taxation which was already intensified by the steep fall in prices previously mentioned. Owing to the growth of unemployment and increased distress generally throughout the country, the Budget provision for normal expenditure which usually runs to £26¼ millions, has had to be supplemented to no less an extent than £2½ millions in the current financial year 1932-33.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why 2½ million pounds was stated at Ottawa when the Minister for Finance was boasting in this House that the Government had added 4¼ millions by way of increased taxation, I fail to understand.  I say that unless this report was accompanied by some sort of a commentary, some oral evidence, it cannot be regarded as accurate, because the phrase &ldquo;for normal expenditure&rdquo; would have had to be explained to the delegates at that Conference.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the phrase put before the Conference in connection with unemployment in this country and I would like the Minister to explain it.  On page 132 under the heading of Unemployment and Emigration the report says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" />&ldquo;Even before the present depression began, the Irish Free State had to contend with a severe unemployment problem.  At the Census of 1926, the number of persons who stated that they were out of work was 78,000...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, of course, the Minister must know is a misstatement.  There were never 78,000 people who described themselves as out of work.  The question they were asked to answer was not that and the distinction has got to be made.  Out of work has a certain significance.  It applies to people who must work in order to gain a livelihood and who are unable to get work.</P>

This agreement is all we get from the Conference. Just as in the case of a Second Reading of a Bill, when it is possible to complain of what is not in the Bill just as well as what is in it, I submit that in this instance I am entitled to contrast the statements made here by certain people with the statements that were made at the Conference.  I submit I am entitled to speak upon our position as it is specially defined in relation to Canada and that I am entitled to find out why certain things are not included in the trade agreement, as well as to comment upon the two articles that are in it.  It has been the usual practice to have a discussion on trade generally between two countries when a trade agreement between two countries is brought forward.</P>

      <P>As showing from another angle the importance that was attached to the whole Conference, just as I have previously shown the attitude taken up with regard to it here in the quotation I made from the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; of July 27th and June 3rd, I want briefly to recall some of the things which happened at the opening of this Conference.  On page 18 of this report, we are told that &ldquo;the Conference was opened by his Excellency the Governor General of Canada, who first delivered a gracious message from his Majesty the King which was in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;My thoughts and prayers are with the delegates of my Governments who are gathered in Conference to-day to explore the means by which they may promote the prosperity of the peoples of this Great Empire.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have before us one of the means which were arrived at at that Conference for promoting the prosperity of two of &ldquo;the peoples of this Great <Col N="809" /> Empire.&rdquo;  The King's Message continued:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At this Conference you are opening a new page of history on which within a few weeks will be written the record of a determined effort to solve the difficulties weighing so heavily not only on us, but upon the whole world.  It is my earnest hope that when this Conference rises there will be a record of results worthily reflecting the frankness, the sincerity and the spirit of helpfulness with which I feel confident your deliberations will be conducted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is one of the results included in the &ldquo;record of results&rdquo; which the King hoped would worthily reflect the frankness, the sincerity and the spirit of helpfulness with which the deliberations were to be conducted.  The third and last paragraph of this message is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The British Empire is based on the principle of co-operation and it is now your common purpose to give the fullest possible effect to that principle in the economic sphere. By so doing, you will set in motion beneficial forces within the British Empire which may well extend their impulse also to the world at large. I pray that you may be given clear insight and strength of purpose for these ends.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is signed by the King.  This is one of the beneficial forces that have been set in motion through the British Commonwealth.  Whether or not we will be allowed to discuss the possibility of the impulse of that being extended to the world at large, I do not venture to say.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We make take it that this agreement is the reflection of the &ldquo;clear insight and strength of purpose&rdquo; which the King's prayer has brought to the leaders of the Free State Delegation in their relations with the people of Canada.  There was one other comment upon that Conference which, I think, is relevant to this trade agreement.  While the <Col N="810" /> Conference was sitting, this speech was made:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is one bright omen, enough to encourage some faint hope&mdash; the Irish Free State delegates at Ottawa appear to have shown admirable feeling and dignity in a difficult position.  They have given no countenance to the idea that they do not recognise their allegiance to the Crown nor have they shown any disposition wantonly to disturb the harmony of the Conference.  The fact is, they are in touch with Empire.  An ounce of experience is worth all the theories of Mr. de Valera about a republic.  If the delegates can come home and impart the spirit of Ottawa to their colleagues, we shall soon see a restoration of peaceful and profitable relations between their country and ours.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That speech was made by the Attorney-General of the United Kingdom.</P>

      <P>I think it is the London &ldquo;Times.&rdquo;  But I do not know what paper it is.  Does it matter to the Deputy?  Our delegates have been in touch with Empire, or, as they prefer to say, with that part of the Empire called Canada.  This agreement is the result.  Have they come home to impart &ldquo;the spirit of Ottawa&rdquo; to their colleagues?  That is a question to which it would be worth while to have an answer.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce did not show to-day that he thinks much of this agreement.  He did not waste very much time in discussing it.  He did not attempt to put forward any of the virtues or any of the benefits that were to flow from it to the people of this country or to the producers of this country.  Did he get anything <Col N="811" /> from Ottawa?  Did he get that spirit referred to in the Attorney-General's speech and has he imparted it to his colleagues?</P>
      <P>The Vice-President is given here as signing this agreement &ldquo;on behalf of His Majesty's Government in the Irish Free State.&rdquo;  Did he do that with the approval of his President?  Did his President know what he was getting in return for allowing his Vice-President to sign on behalf of &ldquo;His Majesty's Government in the Irish Free State&rdquo;? Now that the Vice-President has come into the House, perhaps he would tell us what benefit he has got from being &ldquo;in touch with Empire&rdquo; and whether the &ldquo;spirit of Ottawa&rdquo; has permeated his colleagues of the Executive Council, because, if it has, this agreement may be worth something.  If it has not, it is no good.  If it has, we can get other agreements of this type, only they will have relation to people with whom we are dealing to a very big extent.  We may get the beneficial position in the Commonwealth that we should have got if there had been a proper spirit observable at Ottawa as between our delegates and the delegates of the United Kingdom.  But if that spirit is not there, this agreement is no good to anybody.  It does no great harm to anybody, subject to the reservations I have suggested.  It does no harm to anybody and, because it does no harm to anybody, the House can accept it.  It can accept it on that five year basis, with the other reservation that I urged, that no Government can bind its successors. It must be remembered that this agreement is only of very minor importance viewed from any angle and that if, hereafter, there is to be a real agreement made with the only people who matter in relation to this country and its trade, then this agreement may have to fall if it obstructs in the slightest way the making of the real agreement we ought to arrive at at some time with the people of Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that he took the opinion of some of the manufacturers in this country. Presumably a trade agreement such as <Col N="812" /> this ought to clear up all the outstanding questions that are hampering trade between the two countries.  Over a period of years there are bound to be changes in trade and commerce and difficulties in doing business that have crept in.  Those difficulties ought to be removed in an agreement such as this. We have no doubt all read the reports in the English papers of the trade delegations that advised the Government on various parts of the agreement that they wished made or conditions that they wanted altered.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stated that he consulted some of the manufacturers before he went to Canada.  I do not know if he consulted any of the importers who are importing Canadian goods into this country.  He certainly did not consult anybody in the timber trade.  I can scarcely believe that when the Ministers were in Canada the Canadians did not specifically mention one of their products which forms such a large part of their exports, or used to form such a large portion of their exports, namely, timber.  There are difficulties in the way of Canadian exports of timber to this country, and the exports have declined very much. At the same time, there is no reason why the Minister should not have dealt with some special difficulties which there are and tried to remove them. It is open to question if the Canadian timber people might not be misled, by reading an agreement such as this, into thinking that there were no special difficulties in connection with the sale of Canadian timber in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that this is an important question not only for the timber people, but for other people who are exporting goods to this country.  Is the practice to be followed of not consulting the trade in this country?  What is the position of people who feel that there are legitimate questions that ought to be raised at a conference such as this, and difficulties that ought to be fairly and squarely placed before the Canadian exporters and that they ought to be told that these conditions should be improved or that no trade is possible?  I am sure that the Minister would not advocate that any direct <Col N="813" /> approach should be made to the Canadian people.  It seems to me that the Government ought to have been doubly careful to consult everybody in this country who had anything to suggest, either in the way of sending goods out or bringing goods in.  There is no doubt but that the Canadians are very anxious to sell all their goods. I take it that we are not anxious to bring in Canadian cattle or other things that this country produces.  It seems to me, however, that we at least had a bargaining counter and the difficulties and the advantages ought to have been explored.  I have been very much disappointed that the Minister did not make any reference to the fact that certain importing interests in this country were not consulted or as to what steps are to be taken in future to remove these difficulties.  Does the Minister suggest that because the departure was so hurried there was not time for these consultations?  What is the procedure to be in the future?  He surely does not suggest that the special Irish position should be put up through somebody in England?  I am sure he does not contend that.  When the Minister is replying, I should like him to deal with the question of whether the importers here are to be consulted in future; whether their point of view will be given any consideration, or what will happen in the future.</P>

      <P>This recommendation that we have got here as a result of the Ministers' pilgrimage to Canada is practically continuing for five years what has been in force here since the setting up of this State, namely, Imperial preference.  It is accorded to Canada now and Canada accords it to us, and that is the sum and substance of the whole agreement.  There has been a marked reticence on the part of the Ministry with regard to the report from Canada and a marked indifference on the part of their followers, judging by the numbers present in the House, and also on the part of their allies, the Labour Party, who have been represented in the House for some time past by only a single member.  I notice that some of the Ministers and quite a number of their followers have contented <Col N="814" /> themselves since they came into office with finding out that there has been depression all over the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>They have found out since they came into office that there has been such a thing.  They were not aware of it before.  It is a remarkable discovery.  They learned a good deal more when they went to Ottawa.  There is no information given to the House as to whether even the members of the delegation have read the report.  There certainly is no information given as to whether any of the other members have read the report.  There are just a few matters in it which are of some interest even to Ministers of State.  In the first place, there is that peculiar terminology which appears in the report&mdash; what is described as cattle population. There appears to be a very large number in various countries.  It is remarkable how we have been told by a good many speakers on the Government side that the purchasing power of the British public is falling.  That is the way they account for the reduction in the price of agricultural produce and so on.  It transpires in the course of the report, so far as Australia is concerned, that butter imports into Great Britain have increased very considerably in the short space of three years&mdash;a statement made, strangely enough, by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.  It shows the imports from Australia into Great Britain of butter in 1929 to be 768,000 cwts. and the price was 165/- per cwt.  In the following year the imports increased to 950,000 cwts. and the price fell to 126/- per cwt.  Was the production of butter reduced as a result?  On the contrary, in the following year the imports increased from under a million to 1,500,000 cwts. and the price per cwt. fell to 107/- per cwt.  So that apparently we get to that point now when there is a very large increase in the quantity of butter from Australia and New Zealand imported into the British markets.  It would be rather interesting to know whether the delegation that was at Ottawa, having got full information about <Col N="815" /> this, failed to acquaint the members of the Executive Council who were at home of the importance of that fact.  The mere signing of an agreement such as this continuing what has been in operation for five years really accentuates the neglect either of the delegation or the Ministry in connection with this matter.  The same story is told in the very same speech in respect of the imports of frozen mutton and lamb.  There were 593,000 cwts. in 1929 and the price was 68/- per cwt.  In the following year the amount rose to 810,000 cwts. and the price fell to 61/-.  This increased in the year 1931 to 1,532,000 cwts. and the price then dropped to 47/- per cwt.</P>
      <P>These are matters which ought to have engaged the attention of the delegation.  They were very much more important than an agreement such as this with Canada, barely continuing the agreement that had been in existence since this State was founded.  Much the same sort of information can be gleaned from the report in respect of number of cattle all over the world, mainly in respect of countries that are competing with us here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an agreement with Great Britain that should have been brought back, and not that kind of an agreement with Canada and South Africa. The sum total of the business that these two countries do with this State does not represent very much more than £2,000,000, whereas the British market is worth £40,000,000 in the year.  The Vice-President who signed this report contributed his quota towards the speeches that were made in the beginning of the Conference.  Deputy McGilligan has read a portion of one of those speeches.  It is fair to say that the Vice-President said that they &ldquo;sought to put an end to the anomaly of one-sided development as the aim or goal of organised States.&rdquo; But his concluding paragraph is rather remarkable: &ldquo;We most earnestly hope the Conference will be a success, whether or not the people of the Irish Free State can share in the ultimate benefits to the same full extent as the <Col N="816" /> people of other nations whose representatives are gathered here.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that looking at the report and the recommendations made and the bargains made, the maximum advantages were got for the other Dominions and the minimum advantages for ours. There is no doubt that that agreement, with great respect to the delegation, was not worth signing.  The same terms would have been granted in any case.  It has been the practice here for ten years, and its continuance for five years more is no great achievement. The delegation learned something in Ottawa.  Did they impress upon the Executive Council here when they came home what they learned.  What was the result of the lesson that they endeavoured to teach, if they did endeavour to teach the Executive Council on that matter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave apparently thinks that the most useful thing that happened in Ottawa was that the members of the Executive Council learned of the existence of world depression.  Change of Government has come for both of us.  If what Deputy Cosgrave says is correct, if it took the responsibility of office to teach us that there was world depression, it took the responsibility of being out of office to teach the Deputy's side that there was depression here at home.  We may have learned of the existence of poverty and unemployment outside the Free State since we came into office, but Deputy Cosgrave and his Party, since they went out of office, have learned that there was depression here in the Free State.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately the facts and figures are against the Deputy. The main statistics are available from the earliest publications of the late Government.  There is no doubt about it but the Deputy left things in this State far worse than he found them, and the task of the present Government is to clear up that mess caused because the people of this country were foolish enough to leave him in a position of responsibility for a long number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to undertake to answer all the points made by Deputy McGilligan.  While he was speaking for the 90 minutes he occupied, my mind was mainly filled with the consoling thought that somewhere various rivers flow safely to the sea, and I knew that he would have to stop somewhere and that no matter how often he repeated himself, when he sat down he would, in fact, have said very little. It is difficult to follow precisely what is in the minds of the Deputies opposite.  I do not want to say that the discussion here has been entirely useless.  On the contrary, it has been the most valuable demonstration we have had of the disparity that exists between the mind and thoughts of Deputy McGilligan and his Party.  That disparity has been most illuminating. I suppose we will have the Whips of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party arraigning him before the tribunal of that Party in the near future and, following that, his expulsion for the most flagrant heresy any member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party could have been guilty of.  He actually told us that agreements made by one Government are not binding on their successors.  If Deputies opposite took that point of view a little before this they might have saved this country a lot of trouble.  I recollect that very violent speeches were made by many members of the Opposition since last March in support of the contention that agreements made by them, so far as they made agreements, were binding <Col N="818" /> on their successors and could not be altered or terminated without agreement by the other Party.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that Deputy McGilligan agrees to that.  He was definite and precise.  Those who were listening will remember that he said, not once but three times, that no agreement made by one Government could be held to be binding on its successor.  He emphasised the fact that this was an agreement entered into that would not be binding upon the successors of this Government; that they would be free to terminate at any time they liked, if circumstances arose which would appear to justify their action.  That is quite an interesting development.  No doubt, if Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies attend more frequently, and listen with attention, their instruction will proceed apace, and they will soon have a rational outlook on national affairs.  I am glad to notice that Deputy McGilligan, who is, perhaps, a little quicker than most of his colleagues, is beginning to show signs of improvement from the instruction we are giving.</P>
    <P>Not very much has been said about the agreement itself.  Deputy Cosgrave emphasised the fact that it merely continues in operation what has been the practice for the past five years.  To an extent that is true, but Deputy Cosgrave probably does not know that the Ottawa Conference rejected the idea of a general extension of preferential tariff treatment as between members of the Commonwealth.  The matter was discussed there and a definite decision made against the extension to all members of the Commonwealth of preferential tariff treatment given as between any two members. When that decision was made it was necessary that the Irish Free State, in so far as it desired to have any trade with other States members of the Commonwealth upon any definite basis, should enter into a specific agreement defining the basis under which it came.  That is all we did in the case of Canada; that is all we did in the case of South Africa, and that is what will, no doubt, be done when the arrangements made at Ottawa are <Col N="819" /> brought to fruition in the case of the other States there represented.</P>
    <P>Before I proceed to deal with the more general remarks of Deputy McGilligan I would like to deal with the remarks of Deputy Dockrell.  In my speech when moving the motion I did not refer to any consultations I had with representatives of manufacturers here before I went to Ottawa.  I referred to consultation with certain manufacturers after my return. Consultations with various groups of manufacturers did take place before the delegation left the Free State, but we certainly did not go round asking every trader if he knew of any little matter that he wanted to have rectified while the delegation was in Ottawa.  The timber merchants of the Free State had many consultations with my Department, and their Association and officials of my Department have been in regular touch, particularly within the last month, but I am not aware that at any time any member of that Association made any reference to any matter especially bearing on trade with Canada or to any grievance that he wanted to have redressed.  If Deputy Dockrell or any other timber importer, or the Association, will bring any such matter to the attention of my Department it will of course have attention.  Obviously the Department cannot know until some one directly concerned brings the matter to its notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not the large imports of timber from Canada to this State bring that particular fact to the Minister's attention?  I refer to the item that was stressed by Deputy Dockrell.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear what particular item Deputy Dockrell means.  He referred to a special difficulty about the importation of Canadian timber.  I should like to have that difficulty examined.  It is a matter for those directly interested to raise the specific point in which they are interested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to <Col N="820" /> make is that, when the Minister was looking into the imports of timber into the Free State, before he went to Canada, would not the importance of these large imports be before his mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly that is the case.  The position is that we were concerned in collecting on our own initiative all the information that in our opinion was required in relation to goods or produce of manufacturers of the Free State for which an opening could be found in the Canadian market.  Certain persons engaged in the importation of Canadian produce here approached the Department to draw the attention of the delegation to specific matters and grievances that they wanted to have attended to.  The timber merchants did not.  However, there is still time, and in some of the many consultations that will, no doubt, take place in the immediate future this matter can be raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">

      <P>Deputy McGilligan quoted a speech made by the Vice-President in which he stated that we went to Canada to seek the interests of our own people first.  The Deputy went on to refer to the smallness, in his opinion, of the results of the visit of the delegation to Canada.  He did not link the two facts in the way they should be linked.  Undoubtedly the delegation went to Canada to seek the interests of our own people, and we discovered, in the circumstances that existed, that our people had very little interest there.  The trade of the Irish Free State with the nations represented &mdash; other than Great Britain &mdash; has never been very considerable, and is not likely to be. But, for the possibility of developing better trade relations with Great Britain, really our interest in Imperial economic conferences or other Imperial <Col N="821" /> conferences is very slight indeed. Deputies will do well to bear that fact in mind when criticising the report of the Conference, or any of the matters that may arise out of that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think that is going to continue for ever?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter I am going to refer to.  Apparently Deputy McGilligan thought we should have acted on the assumption that the position between ourselves and Great Britain should continue for ever.  He went on to ask why we did not make an agreement with Canada to secure better treatment for our exports in return for giving Canadian producers preferential treatment over British manufacturers for certain imports.  If we were to conclude agreements with Canada in that way we would undoubtedly have to give very grave consideration to the possibility of a treaty of that kind.  I would ask Deputies to bear in mind the circumstances which existed in August when the treaty was being negotiated.  At that time we had no good reason to contemplate that the position which had arisen between Great Britain and ourselves would be of long duration. The circumstances are different now. The British Government decided to use the tariff weapon against us, and endeavoured to force us to abandon the position we occupied by inflicting economic hardships on our people. The special tariffs imposed on our exports caused, as they were bound to cause, dislocation of trade and substantial commercial inconvenience in this country.  That condition, I am glad to say, was, however, only temporary. I think the worst is past. I think the efforts of the British Government to force us to accept their views in the dispute by economic pressure has already defeated itself. From this on we can contemplate continuing improvement in the position, and the necessity, if I may use that term, for an agreement with Great Britain at all is, day by day and week by week, growing less urgent.  We have already passed the worst of the position and that fact will enable us, <Col N="822" /> under present circumstances, to contemplate entering into agreements with other countries, involving the concession of special privileges in our market for the goods of these countries formerly supplied from Great Britain, such agreement to have much longer duration than it would have been possible to contemplate last August. That matter and matters relating to the advisability of making such agreements, where such agreements would be of advantage to us, are at present receiving the close attention of the Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan is apparently astonished by the fact that we contemplate manufacturers in this country being able to compete on level terms with manufacturers in Great Britain. He always comes to the consideration of any economic question from the viewpoint that industry here cannot possibly be economic or efficient.  The idea that a hosiery manufacturer or a woollen manufacturer or a linen manufacturer or a producer of alcoholic drink of any kind in the Free State could possibly compete on level terms in the Canadian market with British producers of the same goods seems absolutely incomprehensible to the Deputy.  But it is a fact that they have done it and it is a fact that they can do it.  We have never proposed to give to the manufacturers in the State who have been established for any considerable time, and who can consequently be held to have got over the initial difficulties always associated with new industries, anything more than reasonable conditions of competition, but we found those manufacturers up against a wholesaling system, a commercial organisation, a system of credit which made it impossible for them to compete with their British rivals on level terms without the assistance of protective tariffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not now referring to the new industries established during the past six months or those industries which will be established during the next six months.  These industries must for some time be less efficient than industries in other countries which have been established for fifty or a hundred years but they will become efficient in <Col N="823" /> time.  Many English distributors and many Continental firms which have become interested in trade in this country, for the first time during the past half year, have expressed to me their astonishment at the efficiency of some of our industries, and, as a result of the contacts established, we can envisage the possibility of an export trade in manufactured goods of various classes other than those in respect of which we had an export trade at all times.  There is, in Canada, the prospect of increasing the sales of various manufactured goods, the products of this country, and the producers of these goods are, as I have said, looking into that position and taking whatever steps they consider necessary in order to benefit by it.</P>
    <P>We have a right to expect that we will get an increased sale of our produce in the Canadian market.  I do not think we should go out looking for a mathematical balance of trade with every individual country, but we have to face up to the fact that the Canadians have a very substantial balance in their favour in the trade between the two countries at the present time, and they have had that balance in their favour so long as trade between the two countries existed.  We can expect some effort on their part to help us to redress that position, knowing that our ability to buy their goods must depend in a large measure on the extent to which they buy our goods.  We do not ask them to take the produce of this country where they can supply their needs from their own resources, but there are goods produced here which they import from other countries, and we see no reason why they should not import them from us, particularly as we are able to supply them, very frequently, much better and much cheaper than other countries can.  I do not know if Deputy McGilligan really expected me to reply to all the questions he asked arising out of the general report of the Conference.  On the section of the report dealing with financial and currency matters he asked three questions.  I think the answer to all three questions must be <Col N="824" /> in the negative.  I mean, by that, that there was no prolonged investigation of the possibility of stabilising exchange rates within the Commonwealth. There was no prolonged examination of the advisability of establishing sterling exchange standards between Commonwealth countries.  Any information which we obtained as to the future of sterling from the British authorities is contained in the statement made by Mr. Neville Chamberlain and published in the report.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to follow the Deputy to the point where he was ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle.  The figures which were contained in the statement submitted by the Free State Delegation and published in the report are, in the main, accurate.  No doubt, circumstances have changed, and, in any event, it is always possible to get two points of view in relation to any statistical information.  I think you could prove anything by statistics. It is not necessary to produce a large array of them, in order to establish the fact that the conditions existing here were such that we could not be regarded as a country any more prosperous or any less affected by the general conditions than any other country in the world, and that, in fact, because of misgovernment, and because of the general neglect of our potentialities for a decade, conditions here might be regarded as substantially worse than those prevailing elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Of course, that position is rapidly changing, and it will not be possible to say that again, but, nevertheless, there is a long way to go.  It is just as well that Deputies should realise that fact &mdash;no matter how optimistic they may be and no matter how pleased they may be at the progress already achieved, under circumstances of great difficulty, that there is still a long part of the road to be travelled.  But we are going along that road at some considerable speed, and we can reasonably hope that, given conditions somewhat more favourable throughout the world as a whole, given the co-operation of all sections at home, we can definitely secure our people against hardships, <Col N="825" /> and definitely ensure that poverty will pass from the island, and that we will be able to build an economic system here which will be sound at base and, consequently, cannot easily be shaken by temporary fluctuations of trade in other countries.</P>
    <P>That is what we are trying to do. This agreement with Canada which we are now discussing does not in any way cut across that programme.  We are undertaking to give Canadian produce imported into this country most favoured nation treatment.  We are not in any way depriving ourselves of the right to protect our industries.  We are not in any way undertaking to limit the possibility of developing our own resources.  We are undertaking to give for five years to Canadian goods treatment as favourable as that given to the goods of any other country.  That may prove to be a somewhat slight handicap if we proceed to negotiate with other countries specific trade treaties upon a quantitative basis, but nevertheless I think the agreement with the commitments entered into is one that should be approved of by the Dáil.  In that connection I should like to refer to certain remarks of Deputy McGilligan.  He quoted a number of sections of the Canadian Treaty and said he assumed that in the event of a trade treaty being entered into between the Irish Government and the Government of Great Britain this trade treaty would be a model.  That is a very big assumption and one that I certainly should not like to take.  Whatever the circumstances that affected the drafting of this treaty as between Canada and the United Kingdom, the only circumstances that will be taken into account if, and whenever, a treaty is being made between the Free State and Great Britain will be those actually existing at the time bearing upon our respective positions.</P>
    <P>I think that any Government, even a Cumann na nGaedheal Government, would be very slow to enter into a treaty with Great Britain involving all the considerations which are contained in the various clauses of the Canadian Treaty.  Our circumstances are entirely different from those of Canada and, consequently, it would be necessary for <Col N="826" /> the nature of any agreement to be made between us and Great Britain to be in many respects different, and very substantially different, from that of any agreement entered into between Canada and Great Britain.  It is necessary that there should be no misunderstanding on that score.  However, that is a matter that will arise only when the British Government recovers its senses.</P>

      <P>This is an ordinary drafting amendment. The two lines in the Bill which it is proposed to delete provide merely a definition, that the expression &ldquo;licensed miller&rdquo; means a person who is the holder of a milling licence.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is also really a drafting amendment. Section 19 provides for the carrying on of a milling business in certain circumstances after the death of the person who is the holder of the milling licence.  A doubt has been raised as to the adequacy of the section, consequently it is sought to insert another sub-section such as the amendment proposes.  It declares that when a person is carrying on a milling business as the personal representative <Col N="828" /> of the administrator of a licensed miller who has died such person shall be deemed to be the holder of the milling licence.</P>

    <P>(2) The Minister may attach to any licence granted under this section such conditions as he thinks fit and may revoke such licence at any time.</P>
    <P>There was a considerable amount of discussion, on the previous Stage of the Bill, on the matters raised on these amendments.  The first amendment has reference to the disposal of maize by a registered maize miller where it is used for human consumption and dealt with in a retail way.  The way it is to be dealt with, packed and labelled and weighed, are prescribed. If the weight is not prescribed then it is not to be more than one stone. Under paragraph (b) it would be permissible for all maize millers to sell one cwt. or even one ton of maize to a miller in a poor district and he might repack.  This provision with regard to allowing a wholesaler to sell to a retailer, and for a retailer to repack would not be availed of in the near future.  Perhaps when the Bill is working for six or eight months, and going smoothly, we might be able to frame regulations that would enable a retailer in the poor districts, where maize is sold for human food, to sell as a retailer.  But there is no hope of that within a few months, or until the Act is working.  The same would apply to one stone weight.  These amendments are put in in the hope that when things are going smoothly in four or six months' time, we might be able to meet the points raised by Deputy Professor O'Sullivan, by Deputy Dillon and Deputy McMenamin, <Col N="831" /> in regard to areas where meal is used for human consumption.

      <P>It is not so much the difficulty of prescribing as the difficulty in having them carried out and enforced.

It would take four or six months to get it running smoothly, without difficulties of this kind arising.</P>

      <P>The Minister will understand that whatever desire there is on his part in connection with the working of this measure there is this strong case to be faced: that persons in these poor districts do consume this meal.  Surely they are entitled to as much consideration as others.  It is practically a matter of life and death with them.  There is a 25 per cent. increase in commodities in constant use.  Surely it should be easy to frame regulations from the beginning excluding them.  He is prepared to exclude them.  He does not think human food mixes with barley and rye and those commodities.  He is not gambling upon that particular case.  Why make it more expensive for those people?  It ought to be possible to frame regulations and proposals to prevent them <Col N="832" /> being faced with this particular expense.  It is quite within the knowledge of everybody that prices for agricultural produce in those districts in respect of those matters are up, while the income of those people has gone down.  In the Imperial Conference Report, which we were discussing this evening, it was apparent that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is aware of the fact that the remittances from America are down.  These people, therefore, are not in a position to meet any increase in the cost of living at the present moment.  If this is a practical proposition in a few months surely the not very static position in which they are placed now will not interfere with the working of this Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest to the Minister that in the meantime, pending the regulations, the maize millers might be left free in these particular districts.  What hardship will that be?  None whatever.  Because, with these people whatever maize meal comes into their homes must be used for home consumption.  I earnestly appeal to the Minister in the present condition, particularly in those areas, to give out the regulations.  These areas are well defined.  Anyone who takes up a Gaeltacht map will find these areas well defined.  It is easy to single out a licensing area where the millers will not sell larger quantities than those prescribed under the Bill generally.  I think that red tape should not be permitted to enter this.  The Minister should take his courage in both hands and make some concession to those people, particularly at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I look upon this section as really quite as objectionable a section as one could find in the whole Bill.  I do not think that the Minister's suggestions here in any way improve the section.  I am not going to discuss the section as a whole but really to point out that this maize meal is a food of the very poorest portion of the community.  It is, therefore, of the utmost importance to them that they should get maize meal of a good <Col N="833" /> quality at the cheapest price possible. The provision in the Bill, as it stands, is that it should be in a sealed package. Of course, I think myself that limiting it to a stone at a time is absolute humbug, and that if you put it in any sort of package, whether sealed or secured in the prescribed manner, there will be the trouble of transferring it from the sack into these packages and the grocer and others concerned are going to charge so heavily for that labour as to make it more than it is worth.  If you buy a package now that pays more than the twopence packet duty, such, for instance, as the toothpaste which I buy, which costs 2/-, with the twopenny tax it is 2/2, and now it is 2/3&mdash; the extra penny being for a certain amount of money lying with the Customs.  Very considerable charges crop up here also for the trouble the grocer will go to in putting up this meal in these packages.</P>
      <P>Another objection is that it does not seem to be of any real advantage to have it in packages at all because, unless it increases the price of the stuff enormously, a person can come in and buy 100 or 200 packages.  There is nothing to prevent him buying as many packages from the same shop on the same day as he likes.  The only thing is that he will have to buy it at an enhanced price, because the grocer will have gone to a very considerable amount of trouble getting this stuff into the packages.  I do not see, for the life of me, especially as the Minister is dealing here with food which is the food of the very poorest section of the community and is only used as human food in the most remote and&mdash; I will say now in this year&mdash;most poverty-stricken areas in the country &mdash;if they want a one-cwt. or two-cwt. bag of meal, that they should not be able to get it, especially as in many cases they live a long way from the shops.  I cannot see why it must be sealed in the fashion prescribed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much appreciate the spirit in which the Minister has met the objections raised on an earlier stage of the Bill.  I can assure him that my appreciation of that makes me desire to avoid putting any further <Col N="834" /> difficulties in his way in administering the Bill, but I am primarily concerned at present in favour of the Gaeltacht area, where this meal is principally sold as an article of food for human consumption.  It might seem at first that to make special regulations for one area was an impractical suggestion, but I would remind the Minister that the Department of Justice has taken that course in administering the treacle restrictions.  There are certain areas in the country where it is possible, if necessary, to get a permit to sell or distribute treacle, so that no difficulty arises to prevent the provision of emergency regulations for a particular area.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should ascertain the exact area of the Gacltacht, as scheduled, for instance, in the Gaeltacht Report, or in the Gaeltacht Housing Act, or in any of the departmental regulations they have had to define the Gaeltacht, and that he should provide that, within that area, pending the perfection of a scheme for the whole country, retailers should be allowed to purchase Indian meal and distribute it in stone packages to the people when they want it.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Minister has said that the extent to which he has met our objections cannot come into force for about six months until he has devised a plan for distributing the meal in accordance with these new provisions. I suggest, however, that the situation in the Gaeltacht will not permit of that six months' interval, and I urge him most strongly that for that area, in the intervening six months, he will waive his regulations and take a bit of a risk.  There is no danger whatever of that risk in the Gaeltacht, nor is there any danger of its jeopardising the general structure of the Bill.  It is a gesture towards that area and towards the special circumstances prevailing in that area, and I can assure the Minister that it is a gesture that will be very much appreciated by the people living there and, for myself, by the people who represent them.</P>

      <P>On the First Schedule, I mentioned on the previous Stage that I would like some information <Col N="837" /> from the Minister, if he had time to look into the Bill in the meantime, as to what the policy of his Government is in connection with the Workmen's Compensation Act.  The Minister will remember that a Committee was set up some years ago by his predecessors in office to deal with this measure and the recommendations of that Committee have not been acted upon.</P>
      <P>What we in commerce object to in this measure is that the rates allowed to persons who meet with an accident under this particular Act were based on wages which were paid in 1923.  It will be within the knowledge of all the members of the House that wages at that particular time were very much higher than they are at present, and the rates payable to insured persons were based on those rates.  The rates at the moment payable in this country to insured persons are 5/- a week in excess of the rates paid to similarly insured persons either in Northern Ireland or in Great Britain, so that those who are engaged in industry here have to carry this increased burden.  The reaction of that particular rate on industry is this: the Minister will understand that agricultural labourers come into the building industry, which is an insured industry, and at other times they are working as agricultural labourers.  If they happen to meet with an accident while in the building industry they are getting a rate of wages while they are out of employment far in excess of what they would earn in the ordinary way as agricultural labourers.  The result is that the accidents are more numerous and the malingering is much longer.  Those facts were enquired into, and they are further borne out by tables prepared by the Department of Industry and Commerce, to which the Minister can have access.  In those circumstances this Act is at present a considerable burden to industry in this country, and I would be glad to know if the Minister could give us some information as to what the policy of his Government is in connection with this particular Act.  I take it that I can deal with Schedule 2 when that schedule is under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is rather peculiar to hear Deputy Good's particular attack on the labourers of this country as evidenced by his statement here.  First of all he complains that an employer has to pay 5/-more in this country than he has to pay in England or Northern Ireland if his employee gets injured, and he follows that up with an attack on agricultural labourers who come into the city to work.</P>

      <P>Coming into the building industry, we all know what that means. Well, so far as my knowledge goes practically every farmer at the present day insures his agricultural labourers against accidents, and I would not for a moment believe that the general body of labourers&mdash;even those who go into the building trade&mdash;are of the type that Deputy Good suggests, the type who would deliberately get injured in order to draw insurance money from the poor unfortunate bankrupt builders of this country.  I think it is very unfair of Deputy Good to make in this House that attack on agricultural labourers who come into the building trade to work.  I, for one, would not for a moment, from my knowledge of agricultural labourers, believe it, but it is, of course, what one should expect from the type of Deputy Good.</P>

I think I am right in saying that in England wilful misconduct or gross negligence has ceased to be a defence where the relatives of <Col N="839" /> a man who was killed in the course of his employment sue his employer for compensation by the amending Act of 1923.  I do not think that that amending Act applies in Ireland&mdash;to be quite frank, I do not know.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies I would like to say that on the matter of workmen's compensation I did not wish to make any attack whatever. I just want to make clear that it is retarding the progress of industry. A man who was employed in the ordinary way as an agricultural labourer, when he goes into the building industry, as everybody knows, gets a higher rate of wages.  Then if he gets <Col N="840" /> injured in that industry it is only human to expect that the period he will be out, as he gets a higher rate of wages than he will when he is working, will be made as long as possible.  That is only human.  What I object to in this measure, as it stands at the moment, is that it has not been adopted to existing requirements.  That was the point I wanted to stress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies in this House who have taken an interest in this matter in particular may remember a Committee was set up some years ago &mdash;I am not sure whether it was in 1928 or 1929&mdash;to examine into the question of workmen's compensation and to report thereon.  That Committee did report, and arising out of the recommendations made, a Bill was drafted. I do not know exactly when this Bill was drafted, but I think it was drafted during the period the late Government were in office.  On inquiry I have discovered that, while the terms of the Bill have been examined by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, he is not satisfied that he has yet had time to examine the matter as thoroughly as the importance of the subject would call for.  He has been, as you know, fairly well occupied since he came here with various matters, and while he realises that this question of workmen's compensation is one which needs early attention, he has not been able, up to the present, to give it that serious examination he would wish to, but he hopes to do so at an early date.</P>
      <P>I believe that the subject mentioned by Deputy Dillon is one of the matters which is receiving the attention of the Department.  It is admitted that the law as it stands is not up to date, and it is the determination of the Government to bring in legislation on the matter as soon as they can conveniently do so.  I think when the Bill is brought in it will be found that the conditions that will exist then between the Irish Free State and the other part of the country will not be very material.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point Deputy Good made the other day, perhaps I had better not refer to it as he might have something further to say on the matter.</P>

      <P>On the question of the Rent Restrictions Act, I also gave notice to the Minister that I would raise this point at a later stage.  I was anxious to know what was the policy of the Government with regard to this particular Act.  It was mentioned by the Government's predecessors in office some three years ago that they intended to discontinue the Act in the near future, but since then the Act has been continued for a period of three years, and I was wondering whether it was the intention of the Government to continue it from year to year.  The Minister is aware, of course, that under this Bill a considerable depression arises in the building industry.  Housing, or the building of houses in the past, was a form of investment availed of by a great many citizens of this State, and as a result of it being a form of investment there was a considerable demand for houses for the purposes of investment.  Naturally, that gave a considerable amount of employment in the industry, but when the Rent Restrictions Act was brought in it shook confidence in housing as an investment, and consequently it ceased to be a popular form of investment. This matter has been mentioned from time to time in this House that there might be further legislation along the same lines.  Some members of the Dáil are optimistic enough to think that the future will see further legislation somewhat of the same character.  I want to point out to the Minister that this uncertainty with regard to future legislation and also the effects of the Rent Restrictions Act have stopped investment being put into house property, and that, of course, has its reaction on the industry.  I was anxious to know from the Minister if he could give us any indication of policy which would tend to restore the confidence which has been shaken and so enable us to get in this country more money put into this particular form of investment.  I need not point <Col N="842" /> out to the Minister that there are not many investments in this State in which people can safely invest their savings, but housing was always in the past looked upon as a very safe form of investment.  I am anxious it should be restored into that particular category, and if the Minister could help us at all in that direction with a statement of policy, I am sure it would be much appreciated by the industry.</P>

      <P>On the Second Schedule and on the point raised by Deputy Good and by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, I am afraid, much as I would like to be able to state definitely if a decision had been come to, that in this as in the last matter all we can do for the present is to carry on with the legislation that is in existence with regard to this.  We cannot amend the Rent Restriction Act by the Expiring Laws Bill.  The only alternative we have then is to carry on with the legislation that we have for another year until we get an opportunity of examining the question more fully or of dropping the Act.  As the Departments concerned have not had an opportunity of going into the matter fully enough to warrant them dropping the Act at this stage, we have decided to carry on for one year more with the legislation at present in existence.  I quite agree that it is possible that the dropping of the Rent Restrictions Act might give a fillip to the housing industry, but I doubt if it would be a very great fillip. I am aware that Deputy Good knows a considerable amount about this subject, perhaps a considerable amount more than I know, especially as to the effect of the Rent Restriction Act on building. But, would he not agree with me that any injurious effects that may be acting on speculative house building in general may be altogether nullified as a result of the bounties and the grants that at present are being made by the Government to house builders of all classes.  I will not say to all classes, but to special classes.</P>

      <P>The bounties are limited to houses of a certain size, but as the Minister must know there is a demand for houses of a larger size.  These latter would not be covered by the Rent Restriction Act.  If the Minister <Col N="843" /> has any statement of policy that would restore the confidence that is necessary in order to get people to put money into that particular class of house it would be very advisable to have it.</P>

      <P>The grants that are given by the Government at present to house builders cover that class of house, houses with a valuation of £30 down, so that I cannot see that the dropping of the Rent Restriction Act would give any great fillip or have any great effect.  It may be so, but it is a debatable point.  At the moment I do not think it is a very urgent matter. All that I can say now is that the Government have not had an opportunity of examining the matter as fully as would warrant them to take the decision to drop the Act at present. Therefore, we are asking the House to continue it for another year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  The object of this Bill is to provide for the grant and distribution amongst county councils and certain urban districts of a sum of £250,000 to be applied by them in relieving to a certain extent the rates leviable during the current financial year in respect of agricultural land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes that the sum of £250,000 should be allocated in the proportions set forth in the Schedule <Col N="845" /> to the Bill.  It is intended that the benefit of the grant should be given primarily to small farmers who, for this purpose, are taken to be persons in possession of agricultural land, the rateable value of which does not exceed £10.  Larger farmers in possession of land of greater value are not excluded from benefit but will rank as if they were small farmers in possession of land not exceeding £10 in value.  Other persons in occupation of agricultural land will participate in the benefit of the grant to the same extent as if they were small farmers.</P>
    <P>The benefit to be given was fixed at approximately three-fourths of the current rates leviable on such valuations.  Accordingly, the proportions on which the grant is allocated is based on the aggregate of the number of valuation units of £10 or less in each county and urban district and the current rates leviable thereon. For this purpose, with certain exceptions, a person in occupation of agricultural land, the total valuation of which exceeds £10, is treated as in occupation of land of a valuation of £10.  These exceptions are specified in Section 2 of the Bill and comprise land in respect of which owners, not being occupiers, are rated under the Local Government (Rates on Small Dwellings) Act, 1928, or land acquired by local authorities under the Labourers Acts, or held by the Land Commission.  Each tenement held by these persons and bodies is, for the purpose of the Bill, regarded as having a separate valuation unit, and accordingly they get the benefit of the grant in respect of each holding.</P>
    <P>The sum of £250,000 has, therefore, been apportioned between each of the counties and urban districts in proportion to the total of the valuation units calculated as described in each such county and urban district and the rates leviable thereon.  Thus, if each of the sums set forth in the Schedule is divided by the sum of the valuation units in each county and urban district, it will produce a rate in the £ equivalent to approximately three-fourths of the current rates leviable thereon in respect of agricultural land.  The remission <Col N="846" /> of rates which each person will obtain is therefore measured by the product of his unit of valuation and such rates as so ascertained.  The remission on this basis would roughly be equivalent to three-fourths of the current rates on land on the basis of a valuation unit of £10 or less.</P>
    <P>At the time the Government announced their intention of making this grant, most of the rates in the counties and urban districts had either been made or were in process of being made and it was not considered practicable to have the rates revised on the basis of the grants to be made to each county and urban district.  It is, accordingly, proposed that the allowances to be made to ratepayers will be made by the issue of credit notes to the amount of the remission due to each ratepayer. On presentation of any such credit note in part payment of rates, credit will be given to the ratepayer concerned to the extent of the amount specified in the note.  Such credit note may be presented in part payment of any rate due by the ratepayer.  Provision is made for the refund either in whole or as a part to a ratepayer, who has paid all his rates for the current year, of the amount of a credit note issued to him.</P>
    <P>With a view to expediting the payment of rates it is provided that the benefit of credit notes must be claimed on or before the 31st day of March, 1933, the last day of the current financial year.  Any portion of the grant which is not disposed of by the end of that year will be applied in the subsequent year in like manner as the ordinary agricultural grant would be applicable, and thus any balance outstanding will go in relief of the general body of persons rated in respect of agricultural land. It was necessary to give certain directions and instructions to county and urban district councils in anticipation of the provisions of this Bill, and accordingly by Section 10 of the Bill provision is made for their validation, and the validation of the acts done by those councils under such directions or instructions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as this temporary measure goes, it will do something, but it will do very little to relieve the present state of agricultural depression in this country.  I think it is greatly to be regretted that at this period, when farmers of all classes, but more especially the small farmers, are suffering considerably and are being hit so much by a multiplicity of Government measures which are making for their impoverishment, the Government has not gone further and that there has not been a complete remission of rates for this year.  So far as this sum of £250,000 goes it will, of course, be of some advantage to the agricultural community and, in consequence, this is a Bill which we do not intend to oppose and it is a Bill which, if necessary, we will support.  We cannot, however, support it without making it clear that we do not consider its provisions are adequate or approach even to adequacy.</P>
      <P>There are some things in this Bill which I do not like.  It seems to me that when relief is not given to rates all round no Government Department should receive any portion of this grant back.  Under this Bill, special provisions are being made by which the Land Commission will receive certain relief.  In some counties there are considerable areas of land in the possession of the Land Commission.  I will take County Mayo, County Galway and other congested counties as an example.  A very considerable amount of land&mdash;small, scattered areas as well as large farms&mdash;is in the possession of the Land Commission.  I cannot see why one Government Department should give out money in relief of rates and that money should be transferred to another Department, as it will be under this Bill.  It is my intention on the Committee Stage, unless the Minister shows some justification for this proposal, to move amendments which will make the Irish Land Commission pay full rates upon all land which it has in its occupation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were to make the speech which I would like to make, I am afraid the Chair would rule me out of order. What I am anxious to do is to comment upon what is not in this Bill rather <Col N="848" /> than what is in it.  I am perfectly aware of what this Bill ought to contain and what class of legislation ought to be brought in that would be in some way adequate.  There ought to be something big done by the Government to help along the agricultural community and, above all, to help the smallholders who are suffering so much at the present time.  I am perfectly aware of what measures they ought to bring in.  I do know that they should not confine themselves so completely and entirely to a Bill which makes such inadequate provision as this.  That is the subject with which I should like to deal, but I am aware that I cannot deal with it at any further length now without rendering myself liable to be held up by the Chair.  I am willing to vote for this Bill, but I must make it perfectly clear that I consider this absolutely and entirely a very inadequate measure of relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to ask the Minister a question. Under this Bill do the credit notes to persons who have already paid their rates issue automatically, or must those persons apply to the local authority? I take it that they issue automatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the principle of the Bill and it is to that we should address ourselves now.  I think it admits a very important principle and that is that derating for agricultural land is a necessity.  It admits that in times of stress, such as we are passing through, the largest possible measure of derating for these farmers who are nearest the border line of poverty is essential.  The Government recognise that it is absolutely vital and, though the revenue is already heavily taxed, they have appropriated this money to make it possible to relieve holders, whose valuation does not exceed £10, of three-quarters of their rates.  I am sorry that the promises the farmers heard from Fianna Fáil platforms during the recent General Election have somewhat wilted since Fianna Fáil took office.  I seem to remember that it was part of the policy of Fianna Fáil that there should be complete derating of agricultural land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="849" /> My recollection is that they cordially endorsed such a proposal during the election campaign.  I have not heard anything about complete derating since they came into office.  Now that the Minister is introducing a Bill to remit, for this year, 75 per cent. of the rates of a great deal of the agricultural land of the country, I think this would be an appropriate occasion for the Minister in charge of these matters to declare that his Government intend, at the earliest possible moment, to introduce legislation to derate agricultural land as it is derated elsewhere. I recognise that I might be trespassing on your indulgence, a Chinn Comhairle, if I ventured to discuss at too great length on this Bill the merits of a proposal for derating agricultural land, but I think the Minister should be quite prepared to indicate the intention of the Government as regards that matter on this occasion.  I cannot conceive of any more appropriate occasion than this for such a declaration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney raised a point&mdash;I think a very important point &mdash;about the Irish Land Commission receiving benefits under this Bill.  The Vice-President will be aware that if the Irish Land Commission receives credit notes under this Bill any money they recover will return to the coffers of the Commission and, thence, if there is a surplus at the end of the year, into the coffers of the Minister for Finance. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance was eloquent on that subject a few nights ago in connection with relief grants.  He pointed out that if relief grants were handed to the Land Commission to administer and if pressure of work made it impossible for the Land Commission to dispose of the money within the financial year, the balance would find its way into the Treasury and would never be spent at all.  I suggest to the Minister for Local Government that if he allows any part of this quarter of a million pounds to be appropriated to credit notes by the Irish Land Commission, it will follow the course taken by the grants which the Land Commission administered in the past and a material portion of the sum will find its way back into the <Col N="850" /> Treasury.  I do not suggest that that is the purpose of the Minister, but I think it might be worth his while to examine the matter which Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has raised, bearing that point in mind.  I welcome the principle of the Bill and I shall support it.  I can assure the Minister that I shall support it with much greater cordiality and enthusiasm if the Minister takes advantage of the occasion to declare that it is the intention of the Government of which he is Vice-President to introduce at the earliest possible moment proposals for the complete derating of agricultural land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, which was foreshadowed in the Budget proposals of this year.  I am glad that the small holders are going to get fair play or, perhaps, preference under the Bill.  Under previous derating proposals, we had large ranchers here and there throughout the country getting ten, fifteen, twenty or thirty times as much relief as small farmers who were working their holding.  Under this Bill, these gentlemen are at last being put in their proper place.  I am very glad that they are.  This Bill, as I said, was foreshadowed in the Budget.  It was meant at that period as a carrying out of a definite proposal brought in last year by our Party when in Opposition. It was defeated then by the last Government.  We had brought in a proposal for £1,000,000 relief of agricultural land.  I am glad that our Government took the first opportunity of carrying out that pledge to the Irish people&mdash;of carrying it out in the manner in which they have carried it out here.  I was rather amused by the speech of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney who, last year, opposed any idea of the farmers requiring anything like £1,000,000 relief of rating.  I was rather amused to hear the Deputy complain that this Bill did not go far enough. Being a close student of statistics, I am rather surprised that when the Deputy saw last year that the price the farmers got for their commodities had dropped by £6,000,000 as compared with 1930 that&mdash;with the knowledge of figures which a member of the Executive Council would have&mdash;he did not <Col N="851" /> give way to our proposal and provide £1,000,000 for the unfortunate farmers. Apparently, his position has driven him into a more generous frame of mind in respect of the farming community than he possessed when we heard him oppose here, with all the vigour at his disposal, any relief whatsoever being provided for the agricultural community, whether it was by way of remission of interest, of which they had been robbed under various Land Acts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The farmers can rest assured that they have a Government which appreciates their interests and is prepared to look after their interests and not a Government which considers the landlord first and everybody else afterwards.

      <P>I notice in the Schedule to the Bill dealing with ratepayers in urban areas that some rather important towns are omitted.  I fail to see why large towns in certain areas should be left out.  The urban agricultural ratepayers in these districts are just as badly off as the urban agricultural ratepayers in other areas, and I fail to see why they should be discriminated against.  They have been as badly hit by the agricultural depression as the farmers in the purely rural areas, and it is only fair that an effort should be made to relieve them to some extent.  For instance, I see that the urban district of Dungarvan is not included in the Schedule.  I mention Dungarvan because it is typical of a considerable number of other towns of a similar kind.  I suggest to the Minister that on the Committee Stage a wider discrimination should be made and that towns such as this should be included.  These people have been pressing us for relief for the past few years and it is about time that we should do something for them.  It is certainly curious that a discrimination should be made between one town and another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to note that the Bill has been welcomed on all sides of the House, even with certain conditions, as suggested by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.  Although it only deals with a sum of a quarter million, I do not think that in these times even a quarter of a million given to the agricultural community in general is likely to be looked upon as anything but a further generous measure of <Col N="853" /> relief, in addition to what they have got even from this Government during its short period of office.  Already the agricultural community have got by way of agricultural grants assistance in relief of rates to the extent of one and three-quarter millions and this quarter of a million additional will reduce very considerably the amount of rates on agricultural land.  Speaking as one who represents a borough constituency, I know that we in the boroughs often feel that the agricultural community are certainly much more favoured by this House than people living in cities and towns.  That may be justly so.  I know that it has often been brought to my attention by my constituents that those of us who represent the boroughs are not as influential in Government circles as those who represent agriculture; at least, that we do not seem to be able to get as much in proportion to the resources of the State out of the Exchequer for our constituents as the agricultural community are able to get for theirs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the opinion, whether well-founded or not, of a great many people living in cities and towns. I personally, speaking as a Minister and for the Executive Council, say that as agriculture plays such a very important part in our national economy the agriculturists are bound to get first consideration from any Government of this State.  I hope that when agriculture is restored to its proper position, probably by the aid of the present Government with, as I hope, an improvement in world conditions in general which will assist, those in the cities and towns will come in for a <Col N="854" /> little share of the benefit that the agricultural community have been getting from Governments here and from the present Government since it came into office.</P>
      <P>Deputy Goulding raised the question of agricultural holdings in urban areas. I have had many representations made to me when I was an ordinary Deputy and since I came to hold office as a Minister by representatives of these people, and I do believe that they have a certain claim.  I do not think, however, that it would be of much value to them, and I do not think we would be justified in bringing in any new regulation of the kind with regard to the quarter of a million we are now giving as an additional grant for the relief of rates.  It would not be of any material help to these people.  I think they must await the reconsideration and reorganisation of the whole question of this agricultural grant. These grants have been given by Governments in the past in a haphazard kind of way.  There has not been the thought behind the giving of these grants that, I think, the importance of the subject would justify.  They have been given when times were hard.  Governments have realised that conditions were bad in the agricultural industry, that times were hard, that they must come to the relief of that element in the community, and grants were made accordingly.  Grants have been made in different areas under different conditions and on different principles. Before very long I think we will have to have a re-examination of these grants and a reorganisation of that matter.  Roughly, the grants amount to about two millions now, but probably in a year or two they may amount to more.  Whether it be done this year or next year, there will have to be a re-examination of these grants and of the method of their distribution. When that is being done I think it will be the proper time to give consideration to the people holding agricultural land in urban areas.  I think they will be entitled to consideration when this reorganisation does take place, as I feel it must take place before very long.</P>

    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney objected <Col N="855" /> to the Land Commission getting any benefit from this grant.  Why did he not object when his own Government gave back the money in the same way? They gave three or four times what this Government propose to give, and we never heard a word from him when his own Ministry gave back very considerable sums to the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>In this particular instance this has got to be remembered with regard to the amounts going back to the Land Commission.  There are at this moment hundreds of holdings being transferred and a considerable number of those&mdash;I cannot say how many at the moment&mdash; will be transferred before the 31st of March next.  The benefit of the grant that is being made now to the Land Commission will go to these holders, and if you take the money off the Land Commission now the new holders will lose the benefit that would accrue to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We need not be told that.  The Land Commission has been in possession of some of these holdings for 30 or 40 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there are such lands.  I think there are holdings that have been in their possession since the Land Commission was founded.</P>

      <P>Some of these lands have been held by the Land Commission <Col N="856" /> for very long periods, but all that is outside our business at the moment. It would be unwise to take the money from the Land Commission. Undoubtedly some of it will go back to the Exchequer.  If you take this money from the Land Commission now you might be depriving the new holders of the advantages that might come to them if they come into possession of their holdings before the 31st of March next.  You would be doing that if you attempt to take away from the Land Commission the allotments of the money they get out of this agricultural grant.</P>
      <P>With regard to de-rating the Government took the earliest opportunity of carrying out its promises.  Deputy Corry said these promises were made last year when we discussed the question of the agricultural grant.  We then asked that a grant of £1,000,000 be given.  That was defeated by this House when it was opposed by the late Government.  Three-quarters of a million was voted by the House on the suggestion of the late Government and in asking the House to grant this additional quarter of a million we are keeping the promise that was made at that time.  There is no suggestion that is the full extent of the grant that will be made by the Fianna Fáil Government to the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We came into office at a time when the rates had been struck practically everywhere by the local authorities.  I know this matter is being considered and is being thoroughly examined.  I know that in connection with our policy of the holding of the Land Annuities the whole question as to the position of agriculture and the present position in particular of the agricultural community with regard to the payment of Land Annuities as well as the rates on agricultural land is being examined. When the next Budget is being introduced the question is bound to receive and will receive the consideration which the present position of agriculture demands.  The Land Commission are landholders like everybody else and they get the same treatment as every other holder of land, large or small.  We have got the same principle with regard to them.  It would be <Col N="857" /> improper and invidious in view of the fact that this land is being steadily transferred if we were to differentiate between them and the other landholders in the country.  I think these are the only points that were raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that according to the usual practice I shall be allowed to ask two questions.  The Minister gave it as one of the dominant features that the Land Commission should get this benefit so that certain persons who would be vested before the 31st of March would benefit by it.  If we could devise between now and the Committee Stage an amendment that would preserve this benefit for any tenants vested before the 31st of March and at the same time see that the Land Commission will not get the benefit of this for the land in their possession, will the Minister consider it?  The second point I want to put to the Minister is this: the Minister spoke circumspectly on the subject of de-rating. I think the Minister might be pressed to state if Fianna Fáil has a policy on the question of de-rating. Any policy they have must be subject to finance&mdash;to being able to find the money.  The money has to be found from revenue or from the other source to which the Minister referred. Is it the policy of Fianna Fáil to devote that money to the de-rating of agricultural land in the Saorstát?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first question which Deputy Dillon put to me I would like to reserve the answer until I see the amendment. With regard to the second question, I must say that I do not remember any declaration being made by Fianna Fáil binding itself to complete de-rating. I do remember a declaration being made pledging Fianna Fáil to use the money of the land annuities for the benefit of the agricultural community.</P>
