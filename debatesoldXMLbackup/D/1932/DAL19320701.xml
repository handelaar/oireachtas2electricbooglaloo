      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (9), line 26, to delete the word &ldquo;greatest&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;least.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is the section which deals with the imposition of duties in the First Schedule, that is to say the huge list of tariffed articles.  I notice the Ministry have made up their mind that they are not sure themselves from time to time whether articles may come under one heading or another and in order to see that at any rate the public get the worst of it in every case, they have decided to put this in sub-section (9):</P>
      <P>Where an article could be regarded as chargeable with two or more of the duties imposed by this section, such article shall be deemed to be liable only to that one of those duties in respect of which the greatest amount of duty would be payable and such article shall accordingly be chargeable only with such duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the feeling about these tariffs that if proper consideration had been given to them, there need not have been any confusion in the minds of the Ministry, the mind of the public or the minds of the Revenue Commissioners as to what duty was really chargeable on a particular article when it was coming in, but failing that consideration I should like to see that the balance would weigh on the side of the consumer in each case. Consequently if there is any case or if there are any cases in which double duty would appear to be chargeable <Col N="2026" /> that only one duty shall be charged and that that duty shall be the least that would be payable under any of the impositions.  I think that when taxation is going to be imposed on the public, and in a sense tariff duties are taxation, where the tax is indefinite, in the sense that it is indeterminate as between a high rate or a low rate, the public should get the advantage of the doubt and the least of the duties in question should be chargeable.  The importance of this amendment I cannot myself evaluate because I do not know how many of these confusions are likely to occur. I do not know if the Ministers concerned could give us an indication of the likely clash as between the greatest and the least amount of duty in the list to which this amendment refers, that is to say the First Schedule.  If we could get some indication of that there is a possibility that there would be no necessity to press the amendment because the number of cases might be small.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that this amendment can be seriously intended. If an amendment of this kind were tabled by a Deputy, new to the House, everybody would understand, but the Deputy who moved this amendment has ten years' experience in administration, and he must know that a provision of this kind would not work. The practice which it is proposed to adopt in the sub-section has always been the practice.  When we are imposing a duty upon furniture, at a particular rate, and on manufactured wood-work at a lower rate, it is obviously intended that articles of furniture should not be charged at a lower rate than articles of woodwork, and therefore it is necessary to have precautions of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the kind of argument we often hear here.  Everything is protection of the duty even though it may be a higher duty than the items in the Schedule.  As to having experience in this House, no experience appears to be any good except to lump on tariffs without any consideration, or the Minister being able to answer questions about them when <Col N="2027" /> put to him.  The Minister gave one example, namely, the duty on furniture and manufactured woodwork.  Is it impossible to get a definition of furniture that would bring within the scope of the furniture tariff whatever should be brought within the scope of that tariff?  Would it not be possible to get a definition that would take in every article definitely brought within the furniture tax?  If that is impossible we will get nearer to some definite thought on the matter, and an appreciation of what the position is if we say to the Government, and through them to the Revenue Commissioners that unless there is a proper definition the consumer has to get his chance of getting articles in free.  It only means the difference between a possible fifty and thirty-three and one-third per cent.  It is by no means having articles admitted free.  The only articles upon which there is freedom are certain types of manure coming in from within the British Commonwealth, and linen goods, so there is no great contrast as between the free list and the tariff list. It is only between the different heads of tariffs the contrast is.  Again I press for an indication of the number of things likely to be found under those heads.  Are they likely to be numerous?  Can we have specific instances other than furniture and woodwork and so on, as to what these amount to?</P>

      <P>It is not possible to give special lists of every class of article subject to duty.  One example is given, another is that of trade catalogues, thirty-three and one-third per cent., and printing matter 10 per cent. If the Deputy's amendment were carried trade catalogues would be subject only to the lower duty on printing matter and the object of the Bill would be defeated.</P>

    <P>(1)  There shall be charged, levied, and paid on every of the articles mentioned in the second column of the Second Schedule to this Act imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 12th day of May, 1932, a customs duty at the rate stated in the third column of the said Schedule opposite the mention of the article in the said second column.</P>
    <P>(2)  Wherever it is stated in the fifth column of the Second Schedule to this Act that the provisions of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, apply in respect of any duty mentioned in that Schedule, the provisions of the said Section 8 shall apply to that duty with the substitution of the expression &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; for the expression &ldquo;Great Britain and Ireland&rdquo; and as though the articles liable to that duty were included in the Second Schedule to the said Finance Act, 1919, in the list of goods to which two-thirds of the full rate is made applicable as a preferential rate.</P>
    <P>(3)  Subject to the provisions of the foregoing sub-section of this section, the provisions (if any) set forth in the fifth column of the Second Schedule to this Act opposite the mention in the second column of the said Schedule of any article shall apply and have effect in relation to the duty imposed by this section on such article.</P>
    <P>(4)  Whenever it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that the duty imposed by this section on any article has been duly paid in respect of such article and that such article has not been used in Saorstát Eireann otherwise than for a purpose of manufacture, a drawback equal to the amount of the duty so paid shall be allowed on such article or on any goods in the manufacture or preparation of which such article is shown to have been used if such article or such goods (as the case may be) is or are exported as merchandise, or shipped for use as stores, or deposited in a bonded warehouse for shipment as stores.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2029" /> (5)  Section 6 of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1879, shall not apply to any article chargeable with a duty imposed by this section.</P>
    <P>(6)  Any article chargeable with a duty imposed by this section which is re-imported into Saorstát Eireann after exportation therefrom shall be exempt from such duty if it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that such article had not been imported prior to its exportation or</P>
    <P>(b)  that such article had been imported prior to the 12th day of May, 1932, or</P>
    <P>(c)  that such article had been first imported on or after the 12th day of May, 1932, and that all duties of customs to which it was then liable had been duly paid and either no drawback of duty had been allowed on exportation or all drawback so allowed had been repaid to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>(7)  Articles which have been imported and exported by way of transit shall not be deemed to have been imported or exported for the purposes of the next preceding sub-section of this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 38.</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), page 10, to delete all from the word &ldquo;articles&rdquo; in line 40 to the end of the sub-section and substitute the words &ldquo;Second Schedule to the said Finance Act, 1919, contained a list of goods to which the rate of such duty mentioned in the fourth column of the said Second Schedule to this Act is made applicable as a preferential rate and the articles chargeable with the said duty were included in that list.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will refer to the Second Schedule he will see.  On item number 3, the preferential duty is three-farthings while the full rate is one penny.  It was necessary <Col N="2030" /> to introduce this amendment to cover that particular instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather curious about this substitution in sub-section (2) of Section 11.  The purpose apparently is that the two-third rate is taken as the preferential rate and it is determined now that the rate shall be what is declared in column 2 of the Second Schedule. The same occurs in Section 10 but the preferential rate is not always mathematically two-thirds.  Why is it necessary to substitute this in Section 11, and not in Section 10?  Sub-section (2) (a) of Section 10 is very nearly the same as sub-section (2) of Section 11.</P>

I assume the two Schedules are in the same position. There are duties in both.  Why have two-thirds in Section 11, if it is not considered desirable to have it in Section 10?  Why not reverse the procedure?</P>

      <P>I think we should propose to ask the House to divide on this particular section.  I think it is unnecessary for the Minister to impose this duty without discussing the <Col N="2032" /> large economies that could be effected. It is obvious that the Budget proposals contemplate very modest savings indeed&mdash;that they could, if the Minister went about it, be increased sufficiently to enable him to dispense with this duty.  Even apart from that, I believe the whole scheme of taxation is framed upon a very liberal scale and that the customs duties will yield a good deal more than the Minister estimates.  There will not be the sudden development of manufactures and the reduction of imports that the Government is optimistic enough to anticipate.  I think it will find at the end of this financial year if the Budget goes through without modification that there will be a very substantial surplus in the Exchequer.  I think there is no reason why the poorer classes of the community should be unnecessarily taxed for some electoral or political purpose that will develop later and I feel that the Minister ought not to insist on the imposition of this duty.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 29: In sub-section (1), line 37, to delete the words &ldquo;five hundred&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;one thousand.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister amended the original provision to some extent and exempted the 500 lbs. of tea in the possession of any person who had 1,000 lbs or over. I do not know why he did not go the whole distance and remove a certain grievance which the original tax created.  The position now is that whereas a person with 999 lbs. of tea pays tax on 499 lbs. a person with 1,000 lbs. pays on the whole.  The amount of money involved, from the Exchequer point of view, cannot be very great but this is leaving certain traders with a grievance. It puts certain traders at a disadvantage with rivals who may be operating in the same town or in the same street.  I think the Minister ought to agree to alter the section, letting the first 1,000 lbs. of tea in stock free of duty, charging duty only on the amount above the first 1,000 lbs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. I take it that it is an accepted principle that retrospective legislation is undesirable.  In this case, the Minister made up his mind&mdash;very unfortunately, I think&mdash;that the situation demanded the imposition of retrospective taxation on tea stocks.  He went further and made the differentiation to which Deputy Blythe has referred. The Minister has defended that on the ground that the person who had virtually <Col N="2037" /> no tea in stock is entitled to consideration as well as the person who had over 1,000 lbs. in stock but I think that defence, on the whole, does not hold water.  The general feeling of inequity will prevail if a person with 999 lbs. of tea is exempt from this retrospective legislation and a person who has 1,001 lbs. is placed at a disadvantage of 499 lbs.  The cost of the concession which Deputy Blythe proposed would amount to less than a ten-pound note in respect of every person who would become eligible for the concession, so that the cost would be insignificant.  I submit to the Minister that the further he can go to meet those who feel that this retrospective procedure is undesirable the better it will be from every point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether it would be relevant on this amendment to refer briefly to the general principle of this tax but I am sorry the Minister did not deem it necessary to answer the observations of Deputy Blythe on the last section on the general principle of this tea tax.  I think it is a pity that the opposition to this tax was allowed, at this juncture, to pass without comment.  It is very desirable that the public should be continually reminded that the tax imposed upon tea in this Budget is merely the transfer of a duty from a commodity of great food value to a commodity of no food value.  I think it is very desirable that the public should be made constantly aware that it is the intention of the Government to place a tax on what must be deemed to be a luxury commodity.  It cannot be denied that the average poor person, who has to share the burden of this tax, can, without depriving anybody of a luxury to which great importance is attached, avoid the incidence of extra taxation.  Any persons who feel that the 4d. tax will place a strain on their resources can, without depriving themselves of a luxury, arrange that their children will not have tea and thus reduce the weekly expenditure on tea and avoid the payment of the 4d. impost.  At the same time, sugar is made available without any impost, to the great advantage <Col N="2038" /> of the junior members of the household, so that the net result of this tax&mdash;it is very important that the public should realise it&mdash;is that the weekly expenditure of the average working class family, following the impost upon sugar introduced by the last Government, can be materially reduced by the transfer of this duty from sugar to tea.  But here the element of differentiation is brought in as between tea merchants and it will only produce a sum of about £9 per person liable for revenue.  That seems to me to be undesirable, and I believe the Minister would make a useful concession if he could see his way to forego the £9, with a view to securing, in so far as he can, that every person will be dealt with equitably and equally by this Budget.</P>

      <P>After what Deputy Dillon has said I do not think it is necessary for me to add anything further to what has been already said in the Budget statement and elsewhere in defence of this particular duty, as contrasted with the maintenance of the pre-existing duty on sugar.  I am still not convinced that the proposal which the Government has made to meet the case of merchants who had stocks in excess of 1,000 lbs., is not the fairest and the most equitable which, in all circumstances, could have been put forward.  Admittedly, from the revenue point of view, the ideal thing would have been to have endeavoured to collect the excess duty on every pound of tea in the possession of merchants. Practical reasons make that impossible.  We had to fix some limit for exemption and we fixed 1,000 lbs. In deference to requests made in the House we reduced the exemption to merchants carrying a heavier stock than 1,000 lbs. to 500 lbs.  We thought that was a fair way out.  However, I am not anxious obstinately to maintain the attitude we have taken up on the matter.  If I find the cost of meeting the Opposition and the Independent members who have spoken is not too great I will ask that this amendment be not pressed at this stage but be withdrawn and, if I am not able to meet the Deputies on the Report Stage, they can bring it up again.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister to consider whether he could not exempt gramophone records.  Gramophone records were previously chargeable and appeals were made some years ago from all sections of the House to exempt them.  I think the Minister should recognise that some special consideration is due in respect to them, as compared with the other types of records which it is proposed to tax.  People who purchase records for a pianola are much better off than a great many of those who will be buying gramophone records.  Many people have no type of musical instrument except these records and they are found in the poorest households.  I think the amount of duty involved cannot be very large and that the Minister might exempt them.</P>

This is the one means of entertainment that these families have.  I think that the really strong case should appeal to the Minister.</P>

We are getting, as this Budget develops, I do not say, new principles of taxation, but we are getting new categories, and we have the astounding suggestion made here to-day by an Independent Deputy, and, of course, accepted, as naturally it would be, by the Minister, that tea is a luxury.  The Minister will see that paraded over many parts of this country before he goes to election next&mdash;&mdash;Tea is a luxury.  This, as a matter of fact, is a children's tax in the main&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody ever said that sugar was a luxury.  That is the relevancy of that remark.  The Minister has dragged in tobacco and I would like the Minister to stand in front of a working class constituency and talk of tobacco as a luxury.  He is living in a peculiar stratum of society if he has these two ideas that tea and tobacco are luxury articles. Gramophone records cannot be put on the same footing at all as tea or tobacco, but still a good case can be made.  A tax is being imposed on musical instruments, and if the section stands as it is, and Deputy Mulcahy's amendment, when moved <Col N="2042" /> later, is not carried, gramophones will be taxed as such.  That only adds to the injustice of the thing.  The first cost is considerable on some gramophones, but taking even the smaller type which are cheap and relatively efficient, these can be brought in here and the first cost is considerable on them, but still it can be borne, but if one is to get any sort of pleasure from a gramophone it must be by reason of a fairly good stream of new records and it is these additional sums coming in that will inflict hardship.  There has recently sprung up quite a considerable trade amongst big record manufacturers in records for children and records that are even above the stage that would be described as the children's stage but for young people nevertheless, and records which those who are interested in educational science are coming more and more to consider of value from the purely educational standpoint. There can be a division made into what is entirely and completely a pleasure record and those which are designed to be as much an aid to education as the reading of historical novels would be an aid to education, on the literary or historical side. These aids to education are going to be somewhat hindered by this.  I wonder has the Minister any idea of what the remission would cost, of what he would not get if the gramophone record was excepted from this tax, because that is an item that must enter into our calculations at this point.  It is rather a rough and ready way of dealing with a serious amendment which has very definite backing from the two angles I spoke of, simply to say that it is a luxury article, and to say further, which seems to me to be fantastic as an argument, that because the gramophone itself is taxed, the record has to be taxed also.  I think that much more serious consideration than that shown by the type of answer the Minister gives might be afforded to an amendment of this type.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan has raised the question of luxuries, as usual, with great adroitness, with reference to tea, on the subject of <Col N="2043" /> gramophone records.  He has managed to get it in and I think it only reasonable and fair to reply that tea is neither a luxury nor anything else but a deleterious article of food for young children.  The case made here was that it was not intended or suggested that tea was not only a luxury but almost a necessity for adults amongst the poor population in this country, but that it was neither one nor the other, but an article of food calculated to do grave injury to the children of the poor and that the transfer of the tax from sugar to tea was calculated to leave the tax as it was, available to the adult population, with a saving on their weekly sugar purchases which would more than counter-balance what was to be paid in respect of the tea, if they pursued the sensible course adopted by every well informed parent, of withholding tea from their children and giving them another beverage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the Minister's reply I would respectfully suggest that when Deputies Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll and Sir James Craig intervene in this matter and make a representation to him, supported as it was by Deputy McGilligan, it would deserve the Minister's consideration as to whether some concession might not be made.  I suggest to him, though I fully understand the reluctance of the Minister to make a remission on a luxury article of this character, which is a luxury no matter what its educational value is, that the case might be met on Report Stage by limiting the duty in respect of the cheaper record, say, the record not intended to retail for more than 2/-.  Some modus vivendi might be arrived at which might meet the case of the people for whom Deputies Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll and Sir James Craig spoke.  With regard to the more expensive records I quite agree that they are of a highly educational value but, any person who can afford to pay 6/6 for a record, or 35/- for a book of records, can very well afford, in times like this, to contribute to the revenue, in order that he may enjoy the educational benefit of such music, but, in the case of the poor and the children who enjoy <Col N="2044" /> this harmless amusement, I think the Minister would be showing a benevolence that would do him credit, if, with paternal solicitude, he ensured that the records of the young were delivered from the hands of the tax-gatherer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon has, for the second time, got in his spar as to whether tea was a luxury or not.  I am not going to go into it.  The populace is the best judge of that and they will some day clearly indicate whether they consider it a luxury or not.  As to the tax on gramophones, the Minister said that since 1924, records and gramophones have become cheaper. They have become cheaper, and I think that the Minister and every Deputy ought to be glad that they have.  Up to recent days, children, and, I may say, adults on the mountain sides and waysides of this State, had very little opportunity of hearing any relatively good music.  Any music they did hear was derived possibly from a mouth organ, a penny whistle, or a jew's-harp.  They occasionally heard the music of the wayside fiddler when he paid an occasional visit to their humble homes, but, on the whole, their knowledge of music was very limited and their opportunities of hearing any music very limited until the advent of the gramophone, which, for the first time, placed within the reach of these poor people, opportunities of hearing fairly good music and of hearing reproduced some of the best bands in the world.  It was an educational value to children, and I think it ought to be the desire of the House that such opportunities should increase and not decrease.  It ought to be the wish of all of us that opportunities for children and others in very remote places to hear good music should not be limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will ask the Minister, in view of the desires of Deputies both here and on the Independent Benches, to reconsider this matter.  It cannot amount to a great sum of money.  This places in the hands of the very poor people opportunities of hearing good music. A tax like this will put good music possibly out of the reach of the poor. Numerous charitable organisations <Col N="2045" /> and very many private individuals distribute, at their own expense, gramophones amongst the poor people and this provides them with a very desirable form of entertainment.  The people have to provide their own records and if this tax is imposed it will cause considerable hardship.</P>

I agree with that and I wish to add my voice to theirs in that connection.  A further case can be made for records of an educational type.  I do not know if the Minister is aware that languages are now being extensively taught through the medium of the gramophone record.  French, German and Spanish records can now be procured and those languages can be learned through that medium.  I do not know whether the Minister can tell me of his own knowledge whether there are gramophone records for the teaching of Irish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to emphasise that there is no more effective channel for teaching a person pronunciation than through the medium of gramophone records.  Of course people may acquire a book knowledge of a language, but they will carry the imprint of their own attempts at pronunciation for the rest of their lives. People who are taught pronunciation by means of gramophone records will acquire a correct pronunciation that cannot be acquired in any other way except, of course, through personal contact with speakers of that language. I do not know whether the Minister will make the case that there are nowadays broadcasts from various countries in different languages and that people with very powerful and selective sets can listen to excellent lessons in foreign tongues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to point out that for the ordinary private individual in this State the method of learning a language by means of gramophone records <Col N="2046" /> is the simplest, and a language can be very easily acquired in that way.  If the price of records is increased there will not be so many bought.  Wealthier people, when they use gramophone records for some time, pass them on and in that manner many gramophone records find their way into the humblest homes. Very often records are presented to the poor.  The revenue to be derived in this case will be very small and I think the only effect of the tariff will be to prevent people, particularly the poor, getting a little amusement in their own homes.</P>

I think the Deputy's knowledge in that respect would not carry us very far.  In connection with the discussion on this section there is one thing that might help us to have a clearer point of view.  What I have in mind is the necessity for a clearer definition of the word luxury.  What is or what is not a luxury?  So far as I can judge from the Minister's interpretation, a luxury means something we can do without. Therefore, everything in the form of clothing, food or entertainment could be done without; they are luxuries and should be taxed out of existence.</P>

      <P>A proper definition of what is meant by luxury ought to be given.  Apparently we are discussing it from different points of view.  I take up a different attitude to the Minister in regard to what is a luxury. With regard to gramophone records, it is disgraceful to put a tax on them. You can, at any rate, remedy matters by eliminating the tax on the lower-priced records which are available for the homes of the poor.  It is ridiculous to class gramophone records as luxuries. The gramophone is the only sort of musical entertainment the poor can have.  They buy reasonably good gramophones and records cheaply. That is the only way they have of getting into touch with some of the master minds in the musical world; that is how they acquire the more popular airs and songs.  Any form of culture as applied to the lives of the poor ought not to be taxed.  Their lives are drab enough and these gramophones are the means of bringing them some brightness.  If you go through the smaller towns and cities you will find gramophones installed in the houses of the poor.  They cannot afford <Col N="2048" /> expensive wireless sets, pianos or violins.  Gramophones in their cases are essential and I do not think the Minister should define them as luxuries.</P>

      <P>From what I have heard in this debate it would seem there were only two classes in the State who would buy gramophone records, the very young and the very poor.  The whole case against the tax is based on the assumption that children in certain circumstances might have to pay more for their records.  We are led to believe that the purchasers of the greater number of records would be children.  If the case against a tax is based on the belief that gramophone records will be slightly dearer for children we ought at least to have some reliable figures to show us what proportion the children constitute of those who purchase records.  I believe it is a very small proportion, almost infinitesimal, so insignificant that it should not be mentioned in the debate at all.  The State should not be at the loss of revenue amounting to thousands of pounds simply because possibly two or three hundred children&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There has not been a single argument submitted to show me that there is a thousand.  The State should not lose revenue simply because two or three hundred children purchasing sixpenny records might have to pay twopence more for them. That is the case made by Deputy McGilligan and some other Deputies. We cannot look at the matter merely from that point of view.  It has also been said that this tax is going to deprive the poor of good music.  It has been said that the cheaper records go mainly into the poorer classes of homes.  I deny that absolutely.  I think the people who buy shilling records in the greatest numbers are people in fairly comfortable circumstances. They buy may be two or three a week.  As soon as one jazz tune becomes popular they buy the record with that tune and make the lives of their neighbours a misery, <Col N="2049" /> playing it daily to the end of the week. Then they go and buy another one. The proportion of really good class music which is recorded on the cheaper records as compared with music of the ephemeral kind is insignificantly small.  Even the amount of good music&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know if I heard the Deputy singing &ldquo;You are the cream in my coffee,&rdquo; I would know he was not singing a classical number. Again, even in the case of the higher priced record the same applies.  The best definition of good music I suppose is probably music which has lived.  That is good music.  Again that forms a comparatively very small proportion of &ldquo;recorded&rdquo; music, and by far the larger number of gramophone records are records of an ephemeral and passing kind which one hears from day to day for two or three weeks and never hears again.</P>

      <P>But I am not going to give away money, which is absolutely essential in order to balance the Budget, simply to make it cheaper for people to inflict this music upon them. There was one serious matter raised in the debate which might have some substance in it if it had any application at all to the section under discussion. That was the question of educational records, records which are used for teaching a language.  It was Deputy McGilligan who raised that matter. It is quite obvious that when Deputy McGilligan raised that he had not read the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>The section says: &ldquo;A customs duty ... on all records and other similar articles and intended for the reproduction of music by means of a gramophone,&rdquo; and so on. There is no tax upon records designed solely or which form part of a language course.  No tax is imposed on such records, because they consist mainly of the spoken word.  They are not dutiable and would not be dutiable. I take it, it was in the mind of every Deputy when the debate was centred upon this particular aspect of the question that we were going to tax records which constitute part of a course in language in which grammar and phonetic lessons were given and in which possibly songs were recited. Mainly or partly this course consisted of songs reproduced and I could not see how these records could possibly come under this tax.  There is no language course, as far as I know, which consists merely of the singing of songs.  Therefore there was no substance in the point made by Deputy McGilligan when he said records used for language teaching purposes.</P>

The attack on the duty has been based particularly on the fact that certain children's records would be made more expensive.  I do not know whether it would be possible for us to exempt such records <Col N="2051" /> without having to drop the tax altogether. I know that a number of children's records are sold around about 6d.  I will have that aspect of the matter looked into and if it is possible to meet the point which Deputy Sir James Craig, Deputy Dillon and Deputy Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll have raised in regard to children's records and if it is possible to exempt them in some simple way which will not involve us in administrative difficulties, I will try to meet that on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The Minister will have to go further.  I did not refer to records that might be called records of the phrase method of conversation. As far as I remember the phrase I used I talked about records that were as much an aid to the teaching of a language as novels by the best writers are an aid to a literary course.  There are quite a number of very good teachers in this country who insist on gramophone records as an aid, but not as Deputy Corry said, as a substitute for education.  I never heard of anybody who set out to teach a language by means of a gramophone.  I do know that the gramophone can be brought in when a certain amount of contact has been made already with the student and when a certain amount of progress has been made in the language.</P>

      <P>There are things used by the children apart from education, the singing of songs, and records are put up in that form because the best pedagogic opinions are that you can learn the language in this way.  The object is to aid the memory, by things from which interest will be derived.  That is an educational aid used for the very young type <Col N="2052" /> that I referred to.  It is not really a matter of formal education, but is useful before a child is sent to school or in the early days of a child's schooling. The Minister talked of the small number of records used by the very young.  Again I thought I had guarded against that error.</P>

      <P>It does not matter by whom they are bought.  The Minister is not serious in that interjection. If the price of records goes up and if parents cannot afford them they will not buy them.  So that is not a definite question of a child being able to afford them.  A child gets a certain number of pennies which it puts into records possibly, but there are still considerate parents in the country who actually bring home a few records of the small type for a young child.  It is not merely the young child who has to be considered. I spoke of young children as well, and I included in that phrase those who have gone the length of the Leaving Certificate in the schools or who are in their early years in the University course, because even there it is becoming recognised that a record is an aid.  I am still awaiting one item of information.  The Minister played about with figures and talked about reliable figures that Deputies should have given him.  The onus of proof is generally on the people in possession of the more reliable information. We have not heard from the Minister what he would not get if the tax on records were abandoned; in other words, what he estimates to get from the tax on records; what he will not get if it is abandoned, and what he is not going to get if the tax on records of a certain type is abandoned.  That is information that we might get before we are in a position even to frame further amendments to whatever amendment the Minister is going to put down for the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>For once I find myself in sympathy with the Minister for Finance.  I am rather surprised that he did not include in the list of <Col N="2053" /> tariffed or taxed articles that abomination known as the loudspeaker that we hear so frequently.  I did not think the gramophone had so many friends in the Dáil.  As we are talking about the teaching of foreign languages and the teaching of Irish through the medium of the gramophone, I wonder has anybody ever suggested that even in our schools we might use the gramophone as a method of teaching correct English and correct pronunciation.  There is one useful function that the gramophone might perform.  It does help through phonetics to teach a language. No case, however, had been made for the cheap records mentioned so frequently.  Most of these are of the jazz type.  As the Minister says, these cheap records are bought, inflicted on the neighbours for two or three weeks and then thrown on the scrap heap.</P>
      <P>Personally I feel that this is a most acceptable section.  The only thing I am sorry for is that the Minister has not included such things as loudspeakers, which are so objectionable. I suggest that it is not too late yet. Even the birds are silenced by them, because they have this apparatus even in trees.  One cannot go into the country now but somebody shouts a jazz song at one from some unknown quarter. For that reason, I feel myself in sympathy with the Minister.  At the same time, there is, I think, one instrument that the Minister might easily have left out of this section and that is the pianola, because it is on quite a different plane from the gramophone. While it may be automatic in action, it is altogether different from the gramophone.  I ask the Minister to consider the question of including loudspeakers in this section on the next Stage.</P>

      <P>Section 17, as amended, put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 18.</P>
      <P>(2) Neither the excise duty chargeable on tobacco under Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1918, as modified by Section 9 of the Finance Act, 1919, nor any other excise duty shall be charged on any tobacco which is grown in Saorstát Eireann in the year 1932 or any subsequent year and is duly delivered from warehouse and consigned to and received by a licensed manufacturer of tobacco.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  Any licensed manufacturer of tobacco who was on the 1st day of April, 1922, and has been continuously since that date a licensed manufacturer of tobacco carrying on business as such manufacturer in Saorstát Eireann and whose business as such manufacturer is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to be in the beneficial ownership of an individual who is an Irish-born resident or of individuals the majority of whom are Irish-born residents owning between them more than one half of the capital invested in such business or of a company <Col N="2055" /> of which the majority of the shareholders are Irish-born residents holding between them more than one half in nominal value of the share-capital of such company and to be under the management and control of persons the majority of whom are Irish-born residents, shall be entitled to receive a rebate of sevenpence in respect of every pound of unmanufactured tobacco received by such manufacturer upon which the duty imposed by this section has been paid and in respect of which no rebate under this section had been previously paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 38: &ldquo;To delete sub-section (2).&rdquo;  I move this amendment to give the Minister an opportunity of getting out of this farcical performance of pretending to encourage the growth of tobacco here. I presume no tobacco will be grown this year, or very little, because the time for sowing had passed before the Budget was introduced: I have not the figures in connection with the growth of tobacco at my finger ends but I think that produce is something like 1,000 lbs. per acre.  To relieve that tobacco from tax would mean, at the present rate of duty, giving a subsidy of something like £500 for every acre of tobacco grown, because if a pound of Irish tobacco is used it means that there will be one pound less of foreign tobacco used.  There has been ample experience to show that this country is entirely unsuitable for the production of that crop.  It means that if the crop is grown there is going to be a tremendous loss of revenue, a loss altogether out of proportion to any employment that could possibly be given.  To spend money in order to encourage the growth of tobacco here is quite as absurd as spending money in the way it was done in the famine days by getting people to dig a hole and fill it in again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thing has been amply tried out. The fact that it is not merely proposed <Col N="2056" /> to give an allowance of 2/- per lb., or something like that, but that the Minister proposes to make this tobacco duty free is an indication of how impossible it is to grow the crop in this country on an economic basis.  This provision will do no harm now but it will do no good to anybody.  It would probably be time enough to take it out next year, but I think that the Minister ought not to begin the performance that is indicated by this section. There has been a clamour raised by a few dozen people who care nothing about the general financial scheme, and who are only interested perhaps in having something adopted that will put money into their own pockets easily. There was a great deal of propaganda we all know a great many years ago about Irish-grown tobacco. The growing of tobacco in this country was given a chance then.  It undoubtedly had a fair chance.  Every effort was made to foster it and fairly substantial sums of money were wasted on it and I think another attempt is not necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was one of those who advocated, I think last year, that this duty should be removed and that home-grown tobacco should be free of duty.  I did so because I was absolutely satisfied that it could be grown in this country.  I am satisfied that, as Deputy Blythe has now stated, no injury would be done to the revenue for at least a year or practically two years because the Budget is introduced at a time when it is too late to sow the seed.  The seed is sown early in February. As far as the growing of tobacco is concerned in this country it can be grown in the same way as turnips, cabbage or anything else.  The experiments tried hitherto in this regard were unreal experiments, because largely behind these experiments was the idea to prove if at all possible, that the thing could not be done.  This, however, is a genuine attempt to encourage the farmers of Ireland to grow tobacco.  If they do not grow it no harms is done and nothing will happen.  If they do grow it nothing will happen in the way of loss of <Col N="2057" /> revenue for at least three years.  It will be time enough then to take any steps that may be thought necessary to restrict by taxation the growing of the plant.</P>
      <P>I do not see any reason whatever, when farmers have to pay annuities which are at least three times as high as they should be, why they should be restricted by taxation from growing anything they please.  I am convinced, and many more people are convinced, that this industry if it gets a chance will become extremely important to the agricultural community because it will introduce what is absolutely necessary amongst the agricultural community, an effort on industrial lines.  It will gradually bring the agricultural community into the position that they will adopt an industrial outlook.  I believe that the removal of the duty and the removal of the restrictions on tobacco growing would bring a number of Irish farmers to realise all the natural advantages that they have in this country.  As a matter of fact, there are few parts of the world in which tobacco can be grown as successfully as it can here.  As I said before the last experiment had a definite object and that was to demoralise the whole industry.  There are few countries that are more suitable for the growing of the plant than this country.  The damp climate which we have in this country is especially suitable for the cultivation of the plant.  In the last experiment the thing was wrongly handled.  Vested interests over which the Government had no control got control of the experiment, although huge sums were expended on it.  As much as £70 per acre was given in subsidy.  The result was that the farmers ploughed up their land, put in a few plants and drew their £70. I think everybody will admit that that was not the way to make a success of the experiment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are few farmers who do not know that they can grow tobacco as well as turnips, cabbage or anything else.  If it is not a success nothing will happen.  If they cannot sell the tobacco, or if they cannot smoke it no revenue will be lost.  On the other <Col N="2058" /> hand, if we find it is a successful industry and that the tobacco produced at home has displaced the foreign tobacco, I do not know that we will have done a lot of harm. Taxation can be raised in other directions, if necessary.  I think it is time that we should get rid of the rotten groove in which we have been moving heretofore and make an effort to start native industries in the proper spirit.  It is time we got rid of the habit of giving subsidies. There is no subsidy involved in this. If the farmers are successful in growing tobacco and can produce tobacco of the necessary standard, I think we shall have done the country a good turn even though taxation may have to be raised in other ways.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Blythe that the growing of tobacco will only employ a few people.  On the contrary, there is no branch of the agricultural industry which can employ more people.  I think that what is the policy of this Government should be the policy of every Government&mdash;to see that there are as many people employed in the country as possible.  The fact that low prices exist is responsible for unemployment. These low prices deprive people of employment because those who produce cannot sell their products at an economic price.  That has brought the whole world into a state of complete confusion.  I, for one, am perfectly satisfied that what the Minister has done in this matter is perfectly right.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;16. (1) Where a butter trader (including a butter trader who is the proprietor of registered premises) who is liable under this part of this Act to pay a levy on any farm butter acquired by him during a particular levy month sells such butter to an authorised person not later than the fourth day after the expiration of such levy month and such authorised person issues to such butter trader an undertaking (in this section referred to as a levy undertaking) in <Col N="2060" /> the prescribed form whereby such authorised person undertakes on behalf of such trader to pay to the Minister not later than the seventh day after the expiration of such levy month such levy, and such undertaking is sent to the Minister by such butter trader not later than such seventh day, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say&mdash;</P>

    <P>(b)  in the event of such authorised person failing or neglecting to comply with such undertaking, and such levy being paid by such butter trader and no refund being made to him under the immediately preceding section, the amount of such levy shall be a debt due and payable by such authorised person to such butter trader and may be recovered from such authorised person by such butter trader as a simple contract debt in a court of competent jurisdiction;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This does require some explanation.  As the Bill stands Deputies will note that if butter passes in the case of two or three resident buyers, from one to another, they will be all liable to pay the levy.  If a farmer sold butter to a dealer the dealer would be liable for the levy. He would have to keep books and on the seventh day after the levy month he would be assessed with 2d. for every pound he bought.  If that dealer passed on the butter to a wholesaler the same thing would apply to the wholesaler.  The wholesaler might pass it on to the factory and the same thing would apply to the factory.  We would collect the levy from the people through whose hands the butter passed.  Two of them would be entitled to a refund but there would be a considerable amount of money passing between different buyers and the Department and there would be some little time within which they might be out of their money.  This section is brought in to make it possible that instead of the different buyers through whom the butter would pass paying a levy the first buyers would give a levy undertaking. They would give an undertaking that they would be responsible for the levy when called upon.  In that way only one of the people through whose hands the butter would pass would pay a levy; the others would only give a certificate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for the purpose of applying to the scheme of discrimination in the tobacco duty the principles which are found in the Control of Manufactures Bill, now before the Dáil, that these amendments were put down.  It is certainly a thing that is exceedingly difficult to justify.  It is impossible, in fact, to justify discrimination between firms already operating, and which have been operating, for some considerable time. All these firms started operations without any objection being taken, or any suggestion being made to them that they were going to be subject to particular levies which other firms would not be liable to.  We have appealed under many heads for some consideration in this matter of the reduction <Col N="2065" /> of taxation.  It has been pointed out that it is quite possible, in the scheme as drawn up, for the Government, or for their Departments, to maintain the scale of expenditure outlined while giving some remission of taxation, that they have been taxing much more than has been shown necessary by the scheme of expenditure so far outlined.  If these amendments were adopted, it would mean that, for all practical purposes the increase of the tobacco duty would not be 1/2d. but would be 7d.  I do not know what the proportion of tobacco manufactured by the different firms is, at the present time, and I do not know what the average increase will work out at.  It will work out at something substantially less than 1/2d., because a considerable amount of tobacco will only pay the additional 7d.  By the acceptance of this amendment the Government will not lose anything like the total sum.  The amount may be anywhere from 3d. to 5d.  I do not know what it will be but it will be substantially less than 7d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the amendments are adopted, it means that firms that were working on the manufacture of tobacco, at the time of the introduction of the Budget, will be treated in the same way, and no one will be picked out for penalisation. The scheme embodied in the section as it stands is actually a scheme of penalisation.  It is as if in the settlement of the licence duty payable by publicans it was stated that publicans should pay so much, but a publican, or the publican mentioned in the Schedule, should pay twice that rate. Although it is not stated in words it is a definite proposal that particular firms, which can be easily identified, are going to be dealt with specially and charged upon certain tobaccos, a higher rate than other firms.  That is an indefensible principle and the Government should I think seize the first opportunity of getting rid of that principle. If extended there is scarcely any abuse which might not grow out of it.  If firms are arbitrarily selected for special penal taxes on a particular ground there is no reason why, in next year's Budget, there should not be <Col N="2066" /> other firms in some other industry arbitrarily selected upon some other grounds in order that they might have to bear penal taxes.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied if these amendments are adopted it will not put any of the native manufacturing firms out of business. It will not have any ill-effect which the Government is trying to avoid when it determined to increase the tobacco duty and introduced this principle of discrimination.  It will be possible, if this amendment is accepted, for a firm to go on, and for a progressive firm to continue to make progress, even under the high rate of duty that is charged.  It will be worth the while of the Government to do some scraping and scamping if necessary, if whatever loss of revenue that might arise in the acceptance of this amendment made it necessary in order that they might get out of the difficulty and leave the particular path upon which they would be entering by the enactment of the section as it stands.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether, as a result of negotiation and promises that Ministers have held out, the particular firm which was threatening to close down has decided to continue open. I think, if we look at this thing as it is, the question of the opening or closing of that firm is a minor matter. The evils that would spring from this section, if adopted, will be very much greater than the closing of a firm or two.  There would be a complete loss of confidence on the part of the firms that they could depend upon getting fair play.  Whatever the firms will be, and whether they are going to close or continue open, that are going to suffer the full rate of increase, while other firms get off with half the rate of increase, are definitely suffering unfair treatment and legislative penalisation. We have heard a great deal about retrospective legislation.  This looks like a retrospective fine.  This looks like imposing conditions over the right to carry on here which were not imposed when capital was invested and the industries were started.  I do not know whether any Minister would attempt to defend, in the abstract, this sort of treatment.  It certainly is going to make, not only foreigners, but <Col N="2067" /> many other sorts of people very timorous about investing very large sums in industries.  If we want to have industrial progress, we must make everybody feel that whatever the necessities of the Exchequer may necessitate in the future in the way of taxation, there is going to be fair treatment and some sort of equality of sacrifice for everybody, that there is going to be no such thing as deciding that we are going to put taxation on in such a way as to enable this particular firm to progress and push that other firm out of business.</P>
    <P>There should be nothing in the way of penalties imposed unless they are going to be imposed by a court.  This is a sort of fine which is proposed to be put on certain firms because they had the temerity to start their factories after a particular date, that date being many years ago.  If you give warning to people that they will be subject to certain disabilities before they start their industries or before they invest their capital, then they have no cause of complaint, but it is something in the nature of banditry on the part of the State to allow people to come in and invest money in industries under the definite impression that they will get the same treatment as other firms and that they will not be attacked, and thereafter to come down on them and charge them higher rates of duty on the goods in which they are dealing than other firms have to pay.  It would be better from the point of view of the country, if there was no other way out of it, to drop this taxation altogether and impose some other tax rather than start on the path the Ministry is starting on and rather than cause the fears that are bound to exist if this scandalously unjust thing is done.  But it is not necessary to drop the tax and impose another tax, because, if the amendment is adopted and all firms that were operating at the time when the Budget was introduced are charged only an extra 7d., the amount lost by the Exchequer will not be so great but that the Government can manage to carry on.  I am satisfied personally that they can very easily <Col N="2068" /> spare the money.  I am satisfied that the whole scheme of taxation is entirely too lavish and beyond the requirements of the Government, but, without suggesting that they should admit that, it is perfectly clear that they could effect economies sufficient to enable them to accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>I think there are many things to object to in the Budget, but there is none of them as bad as this or that will have the far-reaching effects of this.  If it is carried out it will do such damage as will not be remedied for a very long time, because if a Government or a Parliament deliberately carry through a measure that is palpably unjust, all the confidence that previously existed cannot be restored in any reasonable period of time.  Taxation is hard at any time, but unjust, unfair taxation and legislative penalisation of this sort is something far more damaging and far-reaching in its ill-effects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite impossible for the Government to consider the acceptance of the amendment put down in the name of Deputy Mulcahy&mdash;for two reasons.  First, to accept it, in the form in which the amendment has been put down, would cost the Government up to £175,000.  No matter what is Deputy Blythe's belief, we cannot contemplate dropping that amount, and if we are going to do away with the rebate altogether the only way in which it can be done away with would be to impose the full rate of duty on all Irish manufacturers.  The effect of that, the Government is convinced, would be to close down within a very short period of time every native manufacturer in this State, every manufacturer who continued to work on and give employment here through the trying years of 1916 to 1922, and to leave the whole of the Free State market to outside concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general policy of the Government is to secure that Irish industries will be controlled and owned by citizens of this State so long as this country is divided.  We are not going, simply because the Budget position drives us to impose extra taxation, to impose <Col N="2069" /> that taxation in such a way as will drive out of business any existing native manufacturer.  If we were to accept the principle behind Deputy Blythe's amendment, we would have no alternative except to impose the taxation at such a rate as would crush out the natives and leave the whole of this important industry in the hands of foreigners.  For that reason we cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephByrne" hpid="Mr. J.J. Byrne Mr. J.J. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that before this passes through the House it is only right and proper that the greatest protest, as far as this Party is concerned, should be made against the measure proposed in the Finance Bill by the Minister.  The Minister says he cannot accept the amendment of Deputy Mulcahy&mdash;that it would be impossible to accept it because it would cost a sum of £175,000.  Has the Minister forgotten entirely that if this passes he is going to wipe out a concern which has invested a sum of £250,000 in this country and that 300 hands are going to be disemployed?  Will it be a greater national gain to lose this £175,000 or a greater national loss to save that £250,000 invested in that industry and to keep these 300 people in their employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was anxious to know, during this debate, what action the Labour Party were going to take on this question. I see Deputy Norton in the House and I see other members of the Labour Party, and we want to know what they are going to do about this.  Are they going to allow these 300 people to be thrown on the streets and to allow the wiping out of a capital sum of £250,000? Have the claims of these 300 people no effect on the attitude of the Labour Party?  Is it their policy to permit these people to be destroyed, and, if not, what are they going to do in this debate?  Labour is anxious here, from what I can gather of their policy, to maintain in employment every possible citizen for whom employment can be obtained.  What are they going to do about this measure which the Minister for Finance proposes to pass through this House?  Do they think it reasonable or proper that a firm like Gallaher's should be permitted to come in and invest £250,000 in a great industry <Col N="2070" />&mdash;they are model employers &mdash; and that they should be penalised under this? Have they no criticism to offer?  Is it reasonable, fair or just &mdash; is it in the interests of the Labour Party &mdash; is it in the national interest of the country &mdash;and, if not, what action does Labour propose to take?  We, on the Opposition side of the House, know that it is perfectly futile to hope for anything from the supermen who now occupy the Government Front Bench, but we do expect assistance from the Labour Party, with whom lies the fate of 300 people.  We ask the Labour Party to take some action to save this factory. I believe that the Labour Party cannot possibly approve of this section of the Finance Bill.  The Government talked about setting up industries here which will be entirely controlled by Irish nationals.  Will anybody say that the firm of Gallaher's is not an Irish firm, that Gallaher's does not come within the category of &ldquo;nationals.&rdquo;  If the firm of Gallaher is a national firm, as we contend it is, surely the Labour Party will not vote for this amendment, knowing what it will mean to employment in the City of Dublin and knowing that the effect of the Bill will be to throw 300 people on the streets. Deputy McGilligan stated here on one occasion that if we wanted to prevent the industrialisation of the country we could not do better than bring foreign capitalists up and show them Gallaher's tobacco factory when it is closed, as, I presume, it will be closed if this section becomes law.</P>
    <P>In this amendment, we should have the support of the Labour Party.  I regret that there is not a single representative of Dublin city representing Labour in the House and, therefore, upon the shoulders of Deputy Norton there rests responsibility for a very important decision.  Will he oppose this section or will he go into the division lobby in support of it?  We are all anxious for the industrialisation of this country but I heard Deputy Norton on more than one occasion say that he did not believe in the setting up of a number of small firms giving limited employment.  I heard Deputy Norton say that he did not believe in small industries scattered throughout the country.</P>

Whether Deputy Dillon accepts it or not is a matter of complete indifference to me.  I am making the statement authoritatively.  I know that the information I am giving is perfectly correct.  This firm was working at a loss and when the time came to recoup the loss it was faced with this section of the Finance Bill.  We are anxious to find employment for 80,000 persons. Is this the means to do so?  Is pure, national sentiment to outweigh economic necessity?  Is this section going to be supported by members of <Col N="2072" /> the House when they know that, instead of resulting in increased employment, it is going to result in increased unemployment?  What action is the Labour Party going to take?</P>
      <P>The Labour Party have been sent, here to look after the interests of the workers.  Will they be protecting the interests of the workers of the country or of the City of Dublin if they vote for this section?  It is all very well to talk about setting up nationals in industry. But if we are going to set up a network of industries, absolutely inefficient in working capacity and in productive capacity and in a thousand other ways, all the efforts of the new Government are merely waste of time. There can be no gain from such a national policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know no country which would not welcome the advent of a firm of the importance of Messrs.  Gallaher's.  I know no country which, after it had invited a firm to come in and invest £250,000, would mete out to it the treatment which is being meted out under this Finance Bill.  We have been told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that employment will be found somewhere else for these 300 employees.  Coming from the constituency in question, I want to tell the Minister that these people do not want employment found for them elsewhere. They want to retain their jobs and it is the duty of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to use all the influence that in him lies to see that these people are given a reasonable opportunity to retain the remunerative work they have now got.  It is his duty to give this firm a reasonable chance of recouping the losses they have suffered.  As the ex-Minister for Finance said, this is one of the most senseless and prejudicial sections ever introduced into a Bill by a Government whose policy is the strengthening of the industrial arm of the country.  I have had experience of other countries and I have seen free sites offered, special railway facilities offered and special reduction in taxation offered to induce firms to invest capital in these countries.  When we get a decent firm to come here and invest capital, this section is introduced, a section which can only result <Col N="2073" /> in closing the doors of the factory. The cardinal maxim&mdash;equality of taxation &mdash; applies to all measures of this kind.  When any Government departs from that maxim and singles out certain firms to be dealt with in the drastic way that Gallaher's are being dealt with, there can be no justification of their action.  I hope I am not beating the air.  I hope we will hear from Deputy Norton or some other member of the Labour Party as to what action that Party proposes to take or whether they propose to allow the factory to be closed down and 300 hands to be permanently disemployed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When this matter was previously discussed in the House I indicated that preference of this kind, which might result in the disemployment of workers, was a kind of preference which I approached without any enthusiasm, and I indicated that this legislation introduced a feature of taxation which, so far as I am concerned, was unprecedented, namely, that it purported to impose taxation by reference to an entirely new factor, the factor of time.  It was provided in the Finance Bill that firms not in existence on the 1st day of April, 1922, were not to get any rebate, and that condition made it impossible, in my view, for, at least, one of the existing tobacco factories to get within the law and be entitled to the rebate for which it would qualify if the reference to time was deleted from the section. I object completely to the idea of imposing taxation on the basis of the date on which a factory was established. Of course Deputy Mulcahy's amendment is open to the same objection. It purports to establish a condition that on the 1st day of June, 1932, if the factory is in existence well and good, but if it is not, then the same penal effects are carried in the amendment if it is passed.  One could hardly discuss Deputy Mulcahy's amendment without encroaching to some extent on the Minister's amendment.  Since the question of Gallaher's was discussed in the House many things have happened and a good deal of water has flowed under the bridges.  There has been a good deal of discussion, and I think every Deputy who actively concerned <Col N="2074" /> himself in an endeavour to bring about a situation that would permit Messrs.  Gallaher's to remain open is probably in possession of more information to-day than he possessed on the last occasion.  In his amendment the Minister proposes to remove from the Bill the requirement that business should have been carried on in the Saorstát, by proposing to delete &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann,&rdquo; which is some slight advance, but which still carries, and so does Deputy Mulcahy's amendment carry, the objectionable feature that taxation has to be related to the date, the 1st day of April, 1922, in one case, and the 1st day of June, 1932, in the other case.</P>

      <P>In connection with these amendments I suggest to the Minister that all reference to dates ought to be deleted.  I suggest that the 1st day of April, 1922, in his amendment ought to be deleted.  If that were done it would then be possible for any manufacturer of tobacco in this country to carry on irrespective of the date upon which he was established here provided it is</P>
      <P>&ldquo;shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to be in the beneficial ownership of an individual who is an Irish-born resident or of individuals the majority of whom are Irish-born residents owning between them more than one half of the capital invested.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister in his reply is prepared to say that he is willing to delete &ldquo;the 1st day of April, 1922,&rdquo; from the amendment a position will then be created that any firm within the country could qualify for the full rebate under that section.  It is possible then for Gallaher's, which Deputy Byrne told us was an Irish firm, to so arrange matters that 51 per cent. of their capital could be held by Irish Free State nationals.  If they were an Irish firm it would be possible to have that arrangement carried out.  If so, the difficulty which has arisen in relation to that firm, and perhaps in relation to other firms, might be obviated.  Before <Col N="2075" /> contributing any further to the discussion, I would like to hear the Minister's views about &ldquo;the 1st day of April, 1922.&rdquo;</P>

I have carefully considered what position would be created, and I agree with Deputy Norton that there would be some injustice in restricting the benefit of the rebate merely to Irish manufacturers established before &ldquo;the 1st day of April, 1922.&rdquo;  I am prepared favourably to consider his suggestion to delete the words &ldquo;business was being carried on on the 1st day of April, 1922, and has been carried on continuously since that date.&rdquo;  That would be the substance of an amendment which I feel that I could introduce on the Report Stage, and I think it would meet Deputy Norton's point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been two points of prime importance raised in this matter.  Deputy Norton, rather late in the day, has come to realise that a discrimination which is founded on a particular date is bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I discovered it before the Deputy did.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>But his Party yesterday voted in a division against an amendment which sought to cut out that same discrimination by way of <Col N="2077" /> time applied to the rebate of 20 per cent. on dividends derived from companies founded in the State after a certain date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, after the passing of the Act, this discrimination by way of date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely a discrimination by way of date, and yet the Deputy's Party supported that proposal so that it is not principle only that rules in this.  These 300 people are going to be clamouring against the Deputy and they are going to stand as a sign of the Deputy's interest in the working class population.  That is the big thing, but this particular thing is, of course, a little vague and in the air, and there are no concrete examples of hardship caused by it. It is not principle that rules with the Deputy at all, and his speech to-day was an attempt to found a case for these 300 people on a principle that was not adverted to yesterday, and it is a matter that should be adverted to and a matter that will have to be raised hereafter.  Leave the date question aside, and the date question is one that has been accepted.  Let the Minister not take any pride to himself that he is accepting it as a matter of principle either, but because these 300 people have moved Deputy Norton to show his power in this House.  That is the beginning and end of it.  Let there be no nonsense about principle from the Minister in what he is going to accept.  The Minister shakes in his shoes with fear for his Government because Deputy Norton was also shaking in his shoes for fear of these 300 people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We heard Deputy Curran explaining later, and I do not think the House was very much influenced by what the Deputy said.  The second point made by the Minister was the point of financial sacrifice to the Exchequer, and we have down an amendment which we suggested was acceptable to him and following on a little bit of questioning on that, we come to the point that if the English companies, not Gallaher's&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Gallaher's is an English Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the combine desires to subject itself to certain relatively very trifling expenditure in the way of the issuing of shares here, and one thing and another in the details of company formation, they are going to get the rebate so that the taxation then will be 7d. all round.  It will take some time to do that, and it will not be accomplished this year, but let us say that next year we are at that point.  We then come a little bit further because if, through stress of Government pressure and the amendment that has been proposed, the Imperial Company are forced to reconstitute their company, it is questionable how far they will not fall also for the 20 per cent. rebate under the previous section as being a new business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had better read the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  We will consider it in relation to the amendment when we see the full effect of it, but I hint at that at the moment.  At any rate, say that in a year the position is that they are all on a footing of 7d.  The Minister cannot accept that this year, because it is going to lose him a couple of hundred thousand pounds.  Let me omit for a moment that £200,000, as a mere flea bite to the people who said they could save £2,000,000, and let us take the £175,000 that is going to be lost.  Is that going to be lost under the amendment, if the companies take the ordinary and obvious steps to qualify under the amendment, and if that is the position, what is the new <Col N="2079" /> situation then with regard to the Exchequer?</P>
      <P>We have also to consider the third point.  It has been fully explained here for the first time to-day from the Government Benches, although it was previously explained from the Opposition Benches, that this discrimination was rendered necessary, not by the circumstances in which the industry found itself, at any time, but by Government action.  The Minister has, I think, by implication at any rate, admitted to-day that if there was no new tax on tobacco, there was going to be no hardship on the Irish firm which it is sought to safeguard.  It was only when the Government came to the point of deciding that they had to impose extra taxation that it was seen that there was going to be a bad reaction on Irish firms.  That is understandable. The Irish firm is in a peculiar position.  It makes its business out of a particular type of pipe tobacco.  Its main sales are in that type and there is the obvious business apprehension that, if the purchasing power of those who use tobacco is lessened, the people who want to use tobacco will have to go from a dearer type of tobacco to a cheaper type, which is the product of the combine and not of an Irish firm.  But the reason why the Irish firm might find itself in difficulties is because the Government have reduced the purchasing power of smokers in the country by putting an extra tax on tobacco, and having done that, having decided to make this first blunder, they find that they have to safeguard the main Irish firm and to do that they have to get into this vicious position that Deputy Norton complains of, of having to make a discrimination pivoting around a date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will have to see this amendment when it appears in its proper form and get the full reactions of it realised, but even at this point we should get some indication from the Minister on the point that Deputy Dillon has so cogently put: What is going to be the sacrifice almost immediately to the Exchequer?  Is it not going to be something very nearly identical with <Col N="2080" /> the £175,000 which the Minister said he would lose if the rebate were accepted all round?  Supposing he does come to the point next year of discovering that the amendment in fact does mean the imposition of a 7d. tax all round and that the Ministry want the produce not of a 7d. tax all round but of a 1/2 tax all round, what is the new situation then going to be?  Are they going to put on the 1/2 tax, because I understood from the Minister's statement to-day that it was clearly realised that the Irish firm was going to suffer?</P>
    <P>I think this is the best possible example we could have of the effects of an ill-considered tax and of the results of the necessary amendments&mdash; necessary because of Deputy Norton&mdash; that are being put in upon the tax. Surely, before we come to consider it on Report Stage &mdash; and this is merely getting material for Report Stage&mdash; we should have some information from the Minister as to what he hopes to get from the tobacco business under this amendment, say, in the next six months or next year, and what is likely to be the position next year. Will it be that it is the equivalent of 7d. all, round if ordinary business people take ordinary business measures or that he will have to go further and look for 1/2 tax all round and what is going to be the effect next year of that tax on the main Irish firm?</P>

      <P>Since the establishment of the Irish Free State, all the requirements of our people in the matter of tobacco have been supplied from within the country.  The consumption of tobacco was, of course, increasing and, consequently, there was some development in the industry until last year when apparently saturation point was reached and the yield from tobacco duties showed some reduction.  Deputy Byrne made a very interesting statement. He said that in 1930 Messrs. Gallaher were induced to come in here. Does Deputy McGilligan stand for that?  Does Deputy Blythe stand for it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;from legislation of this kind than he will find amongst the members of his own Party.  I met those people and had a talk with them. If the Deputies opposite will consult their Party managers in reference to the efforts made by those Party managers to make political capital out of this incident, and find out what were the results of those efforts, they will have better information upon that point.  The principle behind this amendment arose out of the circumstances under which increased taxation was imposed.  We decided that the <Col N="2083" /> Budgetary position necessitated increased tobacco duties.  We were aware that an increase of the tobacco duty was going to have an adverse effect on Irish-owned firms, not because the purchasing power of consumers was to be reduced, but for the very reverse reason.</P>
      <P>We anticipated no increase in price would follow because the industry here is dominated by one big foreign combine. Whatever price it sets the other firms have to follow.  We anticipated that firm would not increase prices in consequence of increased duties.  We anticipated that that firm would bear the increase out of profits which it could afford to do.  The much smaller Irish-owned firms could not afford to do that and we decided a rebate should be given; the principle of differentiation should be introduced and, where an Irish-owned firm was concerned, the increase in the tobacco duty should be somewhat less than in the case of other firms.  The date was a minor matter. The insertion of the date had very little to do with the principle; it has nothing, in fact, to do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle in this as in other industries is that it is desirable, in so far as it is possible for the State to influence development, to influence it in favour of getting these industries into the control and under the ownership of our own people.  In this industry we are starting rather late. Deputy Blythe will remember the circumstances under which the Imperial Tobacco Company came here.  He will remember the representations made to him by the Irish tobacco firms in existence at the time.  Many of them have disappeared since.  He will remember the discussion between himself and his colleagues on the Provisional Government as to whether or not the Imperial Tobacco Company should be allowed to operate here.  The decision to allow them to operate was arrived at in the full knowledge that their coming in was going to mean the disappearance of the old Irish firms.  We were not going to repeat the tactics that were adopted then.  We found the tobacco industry dominated by external companies.  I have said here before and I repeat it <Col N="2084" /> now that there is no national danger to be anticipated by allowing foreign firms to engage in any industry or by allowing foreign capital to engage in any industry or enterprise, unless or until the foreign companies get to the position that they have dominated that industry.  Then the position was one which nobody sincerely concerned in the prospects of industrial development here could regard with favour. We were not going to take any action which would have not merely the result of stereotyping that position but in addition increasing the stranglehold which foreigners had upon Irish industry and increasing the dangers to the survival of the Irish firms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say how these foreign companies got the stranglehold?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Because they had very big capital resources; they had a very strong connection with the Irish market before the setting up of the Saorstát; because they were able to undertake large advertising schemes which the smaller Irish companies could not entertain and because they were able to give special bonuses and gifts to retailers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the very point that I want the Minister to come to. That is the very thing which the Irish firms always did and which the foreign companies resented and exerted themselves in trying to stop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate it is always possible for a huge combine with millions of capital behind it in a country like this, to dominate the industry as against the smaller Irish-owned concerns. The position anyway for the future is that any firm in this country the shares of which are owned to the extent of 51 per cent. by Irish-born residents and which is managed and controlled in the Saorstát becomes entitled to this rebate.  That applies with the amendment to existing Irish firms or to any new Irish firms which may be started.  That situation is in line with our general policy in relation to industrial matters, and if as a result of this sub-section as amended, the factories now owned and controlled <Col N="2085" /> by foreign firms become owned and controlled by Irish-born residents then I think a distinct national advantage will have been registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has neglected to give the House the information that is in the office of the Ministry in connection with a firm which he states is a foreign combine. The Minister for Finance has been served with that information or at any rate the information of the Minister for Finance is this: that approximately £8,000,000 of Irish capital is invested in that foreign combine which the Minister has just stated dominates the tobacco industry in this country.  The Minister knows that.  And Irish shareholders draw exactly the equivalent in profits from that foreign combine in this country.  The one question which was put to the tobacco manufacturers here in 1923, which was I believe the period when they asked for a three years' immunity from the activities of the Imperial Tobacco Company in this country, was what would they have to sell to the Imperial Tobacco Company when leaving the Government Buildings Offices with that guarantee in their pockets and they admitted that they would have more to sell than when they came in.  And then the question was &mdash; who would buy it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There happens to be in this country a very large number of consumers of tobacco and those are the people about whom neither the Labour Party nor the Government cares twopence. The Labour Party of course knows that it means the dismissal of 300 men in Gallahers' at the present moment. If the factory closes it is their votes and their presence here in the House and their policy that is doing it.  It is all nonsense to say that the employees of Gallahers' firm are perfectly willing to be the shock troops in this great economic offensive which the Government is pursuing having more casualties than there are victories in the course of their Irish activities. The Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance knows what profits were distributed to the Irish shareholders of the Imperial Tobacco combine.  I want to know <Col N="2086" /> whether it is a matter of any significance to them that the large sum of Irish money invested there should not get at least the consideration which possibly a quarter of that sum is getting in connection with this particular measure.</P>
    <P>Twelve months ago when we wanted a sum of £350,000, we considered whether we would put a duty on tobacco.  It seemed a sort of revenue which might be easily procured but we were informed that the result of the imposition of that tax would be such that the effect on the smaller Irish-owned firms would be practically enough to close them and so we put the tax on sugar.  As a result of that tax, in Kildare the Minister's Party won a seat.  Now the Government have got into the difficult situation in which they find themselves at the present moment, and all their talk and all their explanations will not get away from the fact that this was a bad tax.  It is a tax imposed on an industry in face of a reduction in the revenue from it last year of £13,000. The Government should have seen that the tax on tobacco had reached the saturation point.  Has the Minister inquired to know what is the amount of the tax in the case of 1/- spent on a packet of cigarettes?  Apparently not: the Government act first and find out from an examination afterwards, as the Minister has already admitted here.</P>

      <P>I have listened to the observations of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I am fully aware of the sources of information he has at his disposal when considering the putting on of a tax.  It is therefore a matter of great concern to this House that the Minister should inform us that he was influenced in his revolutionary procedure in the matter of taxation by the information that foreign tobacco combines, and he especially referred to the Imperial Tobacco Company, were in the habit of offering superior bonuses and gifts to the distributors who handled their products.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that a stranglehold was secured in the matter of this industry by foreign firms and that it was to grapple with that situation and to protect Irish firms he was acting.  I asked would the Minister say what enabled these foreign firms to get the business and he said they had great resources, great schemes of advertising; they had a far larger capital and that they had made a practice of giving superior bonuses and inducements to the tobacco distributors. Now if that slipped from the Minister and if it was not his intention to say it, I have not the slightest desire to nail him to it.  All I can say is this, that from my own experience of the tobacco trade, extending over years with Irish firms and with branches of the Imperial Tobacco Company, that the statement made by the Minister&mdash;the information he has given the House in that matter is not true.  I say that if Irish tobacco manufacturers made the representation to the Minister that they were being harassed by the Imperial Tobacco Company inasmuch as the Imperial Tobacco Company were giving bonuses or inducements to the retailers, then I have to say that the persons who brought that information to the Minister were deceiving him.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows from controversy in the Press that it has been on occasion the practice of the Imperial Tobacco Company to object to shopkeepers displaying in their windows the gifts or the goods of the Irish <Col N="2088" /> manufacturers of tobacco and the ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to the matter in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the habit of the Imperial Tobacco Company to have made a bonus agreement with distributors and in this agreement it is set out that no undue preference was to be extended to another firm in the same line of business and that in such circumstances they would withdraw the bonus from these retailers. They took up the position that the display of gifts involved in the gift scheme which this preference is designed to finance would be regarded by them as an unfair discrimination against their merchandise.  They also attached conditions in the agreement that some display will be made of their merchandise and that proviso extends to everyone.  But if the suggestion was made to the Minister that the Imperial Tobacco Company sought to compete by offering superior advantages, then that information is false to the best of my knowledge and belief. I think it is a very grave thing that the Minister should allow himself to be influenced by such a consideration, if he has so allowed himself to be influenced.  I have already expressed my views on this principle of discriminatory taxation and I need not repeat them now.  I detest the whole principle of discriminatory taxation.  I do urge the Minister to inquire strongly into that information that he says was conveyed to him, and to call to grave account whoever came to him and deliberately deceived him.  I would remind the Minister when he speaks of the impossibility of the comparatively smaller factories standing up against the Imperial Tobacco Company, that there are factories here at present that are run in such a way that they have not only held their own against the competition of the foreign combine but they are actually beating them in their own field.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other firms who to my knowledge, without any preference, met the Imperial Tobacco Company on their own grounds and <Col N="2089" /> beat them and are beating them.  My experience of business leads me to believe that the very fact that it could be spread about that the Government are helping and subsidising them will be an injury to these competent business men rather than an assistance.  I know that certain Irish tobacco factories were going down, were being squeezed out, and I know why.  I will tell the Minister why, but I do not think it is expedient to go into a business question in a public debate.  I know another factory which had the same difficulties and took steps to overcome these difficulties.  Men were sent round to say to people: &ldquo;Let us know what your trade is and we will put in machinery if necessary in order to produce what will suit your trade; we do not want you to take what we want to sell but to provide what you want to buy,&rdquo; and that firm took away hundreds of pounds worth of business every year from the Imperial Tobacco Company simply because they took up that position.  Other firms were prepared to follow on these lines.  I am not going to discuss that aspect of the case, as I do not think it would serve any useful purpose to decry Irish firms in public.  I will be very glad, however, to give the information to the Minister. He would be surprised if he went into the every-day working of that factory, so far as distribution is concerned, to see how an efficient factory was able to face the Imperial Tobacco Company and take business away and how inefficient ones, whether he gives 7d. 1/2 or 1/9 to them, will be dragging the devil by the tail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the position now is that the Government have offered a way out to firms that will reconstruct or form an Irish company and bring themselves within the conditions laid down here.  They are doing something in that that they are not proposing to do in the Control of Manufactures Bill, because that Bill is going to allow a firm which is already in existence to carry on the same business without suffering any penalty or being molested in any way.  What is being done in the case of the tobacco people is that they are forced to pay certain charges; they are forced to reconstruct the company or <Col N="2090" /> form a new company or else they are going to be penalised to the extent of 7d. in the £.  In any case, I gather from the Minister that his reason for preferring his own proposal to the proposal in Deputy Mulcahy's amendment is that he wants £175,000 this year from them anyway.  I think that the Minister cannot justify for the sake of getting £175,000, an attack on firms that came in and opened business legally and without any discouragement being offered to them at the time they did so.  There are things that a Government might well do, and do without being subjected to any criticism, for the purpose of balancing the Budget. There are other things which they are not entitled to do to balance the Budget.  What the Minister is proposing to do in this section is scarcely less discreditable to the State than to say, &ldquo;We do not propose to pay the interest on the National Loan because we cannot afford it.&rdquo;  The Minister has relied on nothing more than that he cannot afford £175,000.  The £175,000, if it is necessary to get it, could be got in other ways and it ought to be got in some way that is not discreditable to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not attempted to deny so far, at any rate, that to penalise a couple of individual firms by legislation drafted to impose burdens on them that are not imposed on others is something discreditable to the Government and Parliament and is going to shake confidence and do a continuing injury to the State. When the Minister has gone so far that he has accepted an amendment which is likely to lose him this £175,000 in a few years and that will probably lose him a good proportion of it this year, he ought to make up his mind to avoid doing the thing that this section does &mdash; adopting the course of allowing firms to come in and invest capital, start business on equal terms with other firms and then put a penal taxation on them.  That is a wholly discreditable thing.  One may object on grounds of policy to things that the Government have been doing.  This is objectionable on the ground of principle.  Deputies on the Government Benches talk a great deal <Col N="2091" /> about standing on principle and the honour and credit of the State and disregarding the immediate financial results of some of their actions.  That could be applied with a great deal more force to this than to many of the things to which they applied it. Here for the sake of £175,000 this year the Government are deliberately setting out on an unjust course and a course which is going to shake business confidence, not merely amongst foreign firms, but home firms. If a thing so discreditable and shady as this can be done, nobody can feel confidence that some sort of shocking discrimination is not going to be applied to themselves in future.  It is just a shade better than repudiating the National Loan.  It is the kind of thing that no firm ought to fear that the State would do.  The State ought to take such a line that people will know there are certain things to which there is no danger of their being subjected.  They should know, if they are to be subjected to heavier imposts, that they are to be subjected to them in common with neighbours and competitors and that they are not going to be specially picked out for imposts which will not fall upon others.  The fear of actual and deliberate injustice from the State ought not to be present in the mind of any man in business.  To create that fear is something that certainly means that the future development of the country will suffer.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce talked a terrible lot of rubbish about the stranglehold on this industry and the great national advance that was going to be registered as a result of what was being done in the Budget.  Does it matter twopence from the national point of view whether or not this industry is mainly in the hands of foreign firms?  It is not a basic industry in any sense.  It is a very minor type of industry, though it employs a large number of hands.  It does not affect the general economic position of the country and it is not capable of developing a big export trade.  That is quite impossible. It is one of the industries in which <Col N="2092" /> it is really a matter of indifference whether the main firms are foreign or home firms.  To try and put some sort of a patriotic halo around this act of injustice is entirely ridiculous. It is more ridiculous than many of the things which the Minister for Industry and Commerce indulges in along these lines.</P>
    <P>The Imperial Tobacco Company was allowed to come in.  The Government of the day refused to consider any proposals to protect the firms here because many of them were not so competently conducted as to have any claim to be allowed the monopoly of the market or to be given special opportunities to survive.  The good firms have been able to survive and we were always anxious that they should be enabled to survive and progress.  It would be possible for the Minister to get his 7d. and allow these good firms to survive and progress.  It would be desirable certainly not to do this thing that never has been done in our legislation before for the sake of the difficulty of finding a sum which may be about £100,000 or £120,000.</P>

      <P>Certain questions were asked which have not yet been answered about taxation and the effects of the amendment.  I wish to put these questions again and I should like to debate one or two of the points that have been raised by way of answer to these.  In addition to what the Deputy who last spoke has described as the rubbish enunciated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this matter, there was one startling blunder made by him in that respect to which Deputy Dillon has already called attention.  In relation to this tax the Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke of the bonuses, the remissions and the rebates that foreign firms give over and above what the native firms give and indicated that as one of the matters which in his opinion enabled the foreign firm to establish its stranglehold on Irish industry.  When he was questioned on the matter by Deputy Dillon he at first seemed to deny that the point had been raised as a relevant one on this tobacco business but later he showed that he had still somewhere in <Col N="2093" /> his consciousness the thought that it was a point to be made as he alluded to a certain debate that had arisen here some time ago in which I had to reply on action that was being taken by the Imperial combine against the Irish firm.  A little consideration would have shown exactly what conclusion had to be drawn from that debate.  The debate arose over this: that the combine was threatening to withdraw their bonuses from people who gave a particular display.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has got to do with the amendment because we are told the whole object of this is to prevent a stranglehold on Irish industry.  One of the ways in which that stranglehold could be effected on Irish industry was by remissions of rebates.  The only concrete instance mentioned of how the stranglehold was alleged to have operated was these displays and gifts. The argument was that these bonuses given by the foreign firm were going to be withdrawn if a certain advertisement and a certain scheme on the part of the main Irish firm was given any prominence in the windows.  What was the scheme?  A remission scheme or bonus scheme by way of gifts which the foreign firm considered an unfair advantage that the native firm was getting over it.  I feel sure that the native firm has been driven to make other rebates other than those given through gifts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce asked me to visit the workers in Gallaher's factory.  I have asked him to visit them and to make to them the points he made here previously.  The only comfort he could offer them was that there were going to be some casualties&mdash;probably <Col N="2094" /> they will be amongst the first casualties.  He was not going to turn away from the course he was pursuing because certain people fell by the wayside.  At that time the Minister did say or did make one point which he has rather denied to-day.  He said that they had been asked the reason for this differential tariff and that they were told that the reason was that they wished to give preference to Irish manufacturers.  That, he said, was not the reason.  To-day the whole tenor of his speech was that the reason of the differential tariff was to give a preference to Irish manufacturers, although he previously said that was not so.</P>
    <P>He had also previously said that the Government had done everything possible to try to keep the possible adverse reactions of the increase of duty down to the smallest possible dimensions, and that he thought they had succeeded in doing that.  I would like some indication of what that means.  Whatever the number of workers is &mdash; the number has been variously estimated &mdash; if all that number is going to be put out of employment, I do not see how it can be said that the adverse reactions of the duty have been kept down to the smallest possible dimensions.  Further, on that occasion, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that he was satisfied that if the firm desired they could find means of continuing their existence here, and he was not satisfied that it was the difference which had been effected in the rate of duty which had caused them to close down.  He said further &mdash; and this is the point to which I want to draw the attention of the Minister for Finance &mdash; that the case they were making with regard to closing down was largely a case based upon the increase in the duty, an increase which they were not prepared to pass on to the customer, and not a case based upon the differential rate of duty.  So, according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on that occasion the reason that the firm of Gallaher was going to close down was not because of the differential, but because of the increase in the duty which they were not prepared <Col N="2095" /> to pass on, and therefore would have to bear themselves.</P>
    <P>What is the new situation?  We are going to have an increase, although not 1/2d. but an increase in duty certainly put on the tobacco manufacturers in this country.  Is it going to be passed on?  Presumably not.  If the Imperial Tobacco Company fancied themselves strong enough not to pass on the heavier duty of 1/2d. they surely are going to consider it within their powers to withstand the 7d. duty without passing it on.  Suppose there is a 7d. duty on as a result of all the chopping and changing, a new 7d. duty imposed on all tobacco manufacturers in the Free State, and supposing that is not passed on to the consumer, what is going to be hereafter the situation as between the main Irish firm, between Gallaher's and between the Imperial combine?  Is the Minister satisfied that that figure of 7d. duty all round is not going to have as bad an effect on the main Irish firm as the imposition of the 1/2d. threatens to have upon Gallaher's?  We have got to get back to the foundation of all this, that the tobacco firms were all getting good business as they said in pre-Budget times and the main Irish firm wanted no differential taxation prior to this Budget.  They were prepared to carry on, prepared to hold their own and satisfied that they could hold their own. The new situation is that they are going to have 7d. extra put upon them. Is the Minister satisfied that the main Irish firm is not going to suffer very definitely from that and will the new situation not be worse than the present if the inclination on the part of the main Irish firm be to give up some part of their industry in the struggle, and to dismiss certain employees?  I think it is realised, quite clearly, by the Minister that the old situation was satisfactory to the Irish producers as well as to the nonnative producers.  Though the Irish producer was under a handicap, and felt the intolerance of whatever stranglehold that might be operating or not operating he was not merely holding his own but increasing his trade in a very imposing way.  The new <Col N="2096" /> situation is not that.  It is one in which there is at least going to be 7d. upon everybody although there may be some differentiation against some of the others.  Are some of the competitors of the main Irish producers to be under the 7d. rate?  What will be the situation then?  Are we then to be faced with another proposal, that now that we have seen this increased taxation work out to the disadvantage of the Irish firms there must be some other concession, and we may have to go back to discrimination again though going away from it at this point?</P>
    <P>I spoke previously of an Irish firm here, and, definitely, it was that Irish firm's contention that the increased tobacco taxation would mean that there would be a tendency to drift away from good tobacco which the Irish firms manufactured to a cheaper kind.  Is the idea that the tendency would be to drift away from the goods of the Irish firms to those of the nonnative firms?  That is denied by the Minister, because he is clear that there will be no reduction because the tax is not going to be passed on.  But the purchasing power of the consumer has been reduced otherwise than by the imposition of the tobacco tax.  It is reduced owing to the enormous taxes since the time the Budget appeared and that purchasing power has lessened and lessened very considerably.  At any rate the contention was advanced that as the purchasing power of the consumer waned the drift would be away from Irish manufacture to the foreign and cheaper article.  That situation is going on here already even if there was no tobacco duty, and that drift is going to increase because of the increased tax on tobacco.  I asked earlier, and would press again, for information as to what is the financial sacrifice involved if all or most of the tobacco manufacturers decided to qualify for the 7d. rebate, if they decided to operate their Irish companies on a footing within the terms of sub-section (3) of Section 18, as presumably it will be if amendment 40 is included. What is the financial sacrifice that would be involved?  It is only then that we could get a proper idea as to whether or not the 7d. ought to be put on. <Col N="2097" /> I think it is clear from the Minister's admission that the only way out of the difficulty, if he wants to avoid doing a discreditable thing, and to avoid hitting Irish industry, is the complete abolition of this new tobacco duty &mdash; the remission not merely of the 1/2 duty on those having a differential duty imposed against them but the whole lot.  An estimate, I think, at any rate, could be given, and we could relate that with what other means there may be of getting it, or what other means there may be of saving the money that would be lost if this tax is not put on.</P>
    <P>The last point I asked information on is this &mdash; I am not so sure that it is under the Minister's control that the estimate could be given &mdash; but there are in the main three companies concerned in this whole business. One of these I have called the main Irish producing firm, the other is the firm of Gallaher's and the other is the Imperial Tobacco Company.  Is it possible to get any comparative figures as to the amount of Saorstát capital involved in these three firms? I do not know if a very detailed estimate could be given, but I think nobody will deny that there is much more Saorstát owned capital in the Imperial Tobacco Company than there is in the other two companies combined.  If that is so, I wonder what is the point of the discriminatory taxation as it was previously intended.</P>

      <P>I move amendments 43 and 45:</P>
      <P>43.  In sub-section (1) (a), line 56, after the word &ldquo;is&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;over two ounces and.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>45.  In sub-section (1) (b), after the word &ldquo;measure,&rdquo; line 2, to insert the words &ldquo;and the content of the package exceeds one quarter of a pint.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What I really want to put to the Minister is that there are certain very small packages coming in here, and I think it would be a hardship, and unnecessary to have 2d. packages taxed, such, for example, as Oxo cubes.  I understand that none of the amendments of the Minister would exempt them.  There are other cases like this. Certain cheese is brought into the country wrapped up in small triangles.  I think it would be absurd and a hardship to have a charge of 2d. upon a small triangular piece of cheese that might not be an ounce in weight.  It is with the object of exempting certain small packages of very inconsiderable value which could not be well packed up here that I move these amendments.</P>

      <P>With regard to the small wrappings, rather than packets or something bound up ready to give <Col N="2101" /> away, that might be so, but in the case of Oxo cubes they would be covered by the terms of amendment 47.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of cheese, that has been given a great deal of consideration and I have not yet been able to find a way to meet it. I could not possibly accept the amendment in the terms which the Deputy proposes because it would mean that a very large number of things would escape duty altogether&mdash;such as cosmetics.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-section (4).</P>
      <P>I do not want to take up very much time but I think it is an undesirable thing to carry out this business of giving licences and exemptions to individual firms by the order of the Minister to the extent to which it is proposed to be carried.  It may cause some temporary inconvenience to a firm to be taxed if it is going to start packing here, but I think it is better that that should be borne than that we should carry this discriminatory principle to the lengths it is proposed to carry it.</P>

      <P>I think that the Deputy has not fully appreciated the point.  The position is that certain firms &mdash; and we have already indicated that this will result because of the effect of the tax &mdash; are prepared to come in here and pack their goods for the public and instal machinery and probably give extensive employment. In order that the community may reap the full benefit of that, it is essential that these firms should maintain their present trade.  It will take a very considerable time probably before they can get the machinery installed, and we have either to put them in the position that they will have to pay the tax to prevent it being put on the public or else lose their trade altogether and their competitors have the full advantage of this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Well some other people possibly, if not Saorstát competitors. Some other people might find some alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily. People might give up using Oxo cubes or Bovril altogether and use some other substitute and nobody would know whether it was a Saorstát competitor or somebody outside that would reap the benefit of that.  The reason we are asking for powers to give a licence is that if these people are allowed to come in here &mdash; and they will only be allowed to come in if there is no suitable Saorstát alternative &mdash; if they are going to provide employment within the Saorstát then they would be put in this position either to have to spend a considerable sum in paying the tax and maintaining their trade or come in here and find that their existing custom had altogether disappeared.  One of the main purposes of the package tax would be defeated.</P>

      <P>It is only on an occasion like this, when the Minister is off his guard, that you can get some appreciation of his economic principles. He says these people will either have <Col N="2103" /> to pay the tax themselves &mdash; and I gather that that was not before his mind &mdash; or else that they will have to pass it on to the consumer.  If anybody had been incautions enough to make an insinuation that a tax was likely to be passed on to the consumer, when previous taxation was being discussed, we would be told that it was almost un-national.  Take the case of boots and shoes.  All these taxes are being borne by the people on the other side. Another example was Oxo or Bovril cubes.  He suggests that the people might lose the taste for Bovril or Oxo cubes.  What are they made for? Where does the meat from which it is an extract come from?  Is it Irish or Argentine stuff?  Is there any possibility of getting an Irish substitute? If so, and if there were a tax put on them, and anyone complained, we would be told immediately that these things would be manufactured here &mdash; home produce &mdash; the home article &mdash; all the way.  The other arguments to my mind are equally weak and bad on this matter.  The Minister wants to be empowered to grant licences.  He says it <Col N="2104" /> will take people a certain time to get the machinery going, and in the meantime you are going to have people drifting over to something else or stopping the use of the article altogether. If they are anxious about their trade what better lever can you get in order to get them to come in than by telling them that they will be up against this tax before the period in which they can get the machinery established?  The argument is weak anyway, but in relation to the particular matter we are discussing it is very weak.  We are arguing against a particular, invidious type of control being left to two Ministers.  It is not the Revenue Commissioners, as might appear from a casual reading of the amendment, who are to decide anything.  It is two Ministers.  They are going to be satisfied about certain things, and then the Revenue Commissioners may by licence authorise these things to be done.</P>
