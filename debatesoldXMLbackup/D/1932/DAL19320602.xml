      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state whether under any provisions of the Housing Acts, 1925 to 1931, authorising the Minister to make grants to persons or public utility societies erecting or reconstructing houses, grants have been made in respect of houses erected or reconstructed by or for (1) Patrick Coleman, Dundrockan, Carrickmacross; (2) Joseph Lavelle, Momoney, Inniskeen, and, if so, whether he will state the amount of the grant made in each case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether numerous applications have been received for sites for the establishment of new factories and packing houses in the Irish Free State, and, if so, what steps, if any, have been or will be taken by the Government to encourage the establishment of same in provincial towns and villages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>My department has received notifications from various parts of the country as to vacant premises which might be used as factories and as to sites suitable for the establishment of new factories.  This information is always available to inquirers for such premises or sites.  The policy of the Government is to decentralise industry <Col N="326" /> and consequently particular attention is paid to the claims of provincial towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneJOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to draw attention to is that as a result of the tariffs most of the new factories or industries set up will be set up in port towns and the rest of the country will be paying for them.  I think their Government ought to encourage their establishment in other country towns.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister power to convey to private corporations Government property by way of sale or has he any power to lease such property?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is power to lease for a period of 99 years under the State Lands Act.  As regards the other point it is not correct that all, or even most of the propositions, in respect of new industries put to the Department relate to factories to be established in Dublin.  It does apply in respect of most of the establishments opened in consequence of the imposition of the package duty.  In relation to most other industries, the tendency is, and it is a tendency which is fostered by the Department, to seek sites in other centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneJOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister received any representations from the Cork Harbour Commissioners in regard to vacant sites at Tivoli and other parts of Cork City?  I handed in a question into the office a couple of days ago asking for information on the same point, and the question I want to put is, has he received any representations on behalf of the Cork Harbour Commissioners, acting on behalf of the citizens of Cork, pointing out that there are sites available in Cork city for factories?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): Would the Minister take some steps to indicate, say, through the &ldquo;Trade Journal,&rdquo; or <Col N="327" /> in some other way, the names of firms seeking premises in this country, so that corporations, public bodies, and others interested, may be able to make representations to have their towns or villages considered as centres for industries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid there is some misunderstanding.  We do not often come up against firms seeking information from the Department as to suitable sites.  A number of firms approach the Department with relation to products of one kind or another in which they are interested, and the Department brings to their attention such information as to facilities available in different centres as would seem to meet each particular case.  Very often that information is taken by the firms in question for the purpose of examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention had been called to the action of the Great Southern Railways in closing down the railway between Monkstown and Crosshaven, County Cork; if he is aware that this action will cause serious inconvenience to the tourist traffic and consequent loss, and if he will be prepared to make representations to the railway company with a view to having the line kept open until at least the end of the tourist season.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no power to compel the Great Southern Railway Company to keep this short section of line open for traffic.  I am informed that adequate alternative road services are available to the public, but I am conveying to the company the suggestion contained in the last part of the Deputy's question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he is aware that the whole of the branch lines in West Cork are threatened in a similar fashion?  While it does not exactly arise at present, may I ask him if he will consider making representations to the G.S. and W.R. Company pending the proposals he has in preparation to bring in in the autumn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is under consideration.  In relation to other proposals of the railway company to reduce the services upon certain lines the sanction of the Department of Industry and Commerce is required, but in relation to this particular section that sanction is not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that serious hardship will be inflicted on many poor families in Cork City by reason of the fact that they will be cut off from enjoying five or six hours at the seaside by the closing down of this section?  Very reasonable facilities have been granted by the Cork, Blackrock and Passage Railway to enable the very poorest of the community to get to Church Bay&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no obligation on the railway company to secure the sanction of the Department of Industry <Col N="329" /> and Commerce in relation to its proposals to close this section of the line. There is no power in the Department to compel them to keep it open.  There are sections of the line in respect of which the railway company cannot cease or reduce the services without the sanction of the Department but this section is not one of them.  This section is not covered by the Act to which the Deputy refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say that the cessation is due to the extra facilities granted to bus services?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Minister can take powers under the Emergency Powers Act to prevent the closing down of the line if he thinks that in the national interests or the local interests it is necessary to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the railway company can offer better facilities to transport thousands of persons to a given point than any other undertaking?  The Cork, Blackrock and Passage railway have been able to transport thousands of persons on this section.  I want to ask the Minister is he aware that there is no bus service that could possibly transport eight or nine thousand people to the seaside as the railway can?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if the report of the engineers who went down to investigate the Brick and Cashen Drainage Schemes, County Kerry, has been submitted to him, and, if so, if it is intended to negotiate with the Kerry County Council with a view to having the schemes carried into effect as soon as possible, and thereby provide the workless people of those districts with much-needed employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have not yet received the final report of their engineer with regard to the Brick-Cashen proposed Drainage District. In addition to the engineering survey, a detailed valuation of the affected lands has been in progress for some time, and the results must be awaited before the financial position of the scheme can be definitely known. Over 12,000 acres of land have to be inspected and valued, so that even under the most favourable conditions the detailed investigation of the proposal cannot be completed for several months.  When it is completed, there will be no undue delay in preparing a drainage scheme for the district, if it is found feasible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that it <Col N="331" /> is alleged that congestion in regard to imported goods exists at the Dublin import stations owing to the difficulties which customs officers are experiencing in levying the new duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that such allegations have been made, but I am informed that there is no acute congestion of traffic at any Import station in Dublin, and that deliveries are taking place with reasonable despatch at all stations.  The recent extension of the tariff has caused some difficulty in the offices of the agents who prepare the Customs entries for imported goods, and, in addition, importers are not supplying full information and documents to the agents to enable them to prepare the entries.  The consequence is that the entries are not being presented promptly on the arrival of the goods, or, if presented, are, in many cases, incorrect or incomplete. Any difficulties in the way of prompt clearance can be avoided if importers will furnish promptly to the Customs Officers or the clearing agents all information relating to the goods and will arrange for payment of duty where such is chargeable.  In this connection it must be remembered that if goods at present liable to duty become exempt during the passage of the Financial Resolutions or the Finance Bill through the Dáil by reason of an accepted amendment with retrospective effect, any duty paid, which under the amendment would not be chargeable, will be repaid.  I wish to add, in view of the vague and general but persistent statements which have been made in many quarters, that, if particular instances of alleged neglect or delay on the part of the Customs staff in the examination and clearance of goods which have been duly entered are brought to my notice, I will have them fully investigated and steps taken, if necessary, to remove all grounds for complaint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider the desirability, having regard to the situation arising out of the introduction of the Budget to appoint experts at some of the ports?  That would possibly ease the situation.  I can give the Minister several cases in which business has been held up as a result of the imposition of certain tariffs where the officers cannot be expected to have the expert knowledge to enable them to discriminate, in regard to certain classes of merchandise. I refer particularly to articles required for the printing industry and newspaper production.  A whole lot of inconvenience has been caused by holding up certain articles which are necessary for the production of newspapers&mdash;materials which are absolutely necessary and essential for the production even of commercial printing. These articles are not manufactured in this country.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister investigate this fact as I believe it to be the case, that the Revenue Officers will not accept a verbatim typescript of the requisite form that is required to be filled in order to gain Imperial Preference? British exporters are required to get the forms in Dublin, fill them up and forward them with the consignment to the Irish port.  For the present at least this procedure involves vexatious delay.

      <P>There was some discussion within the last few minutes.  Members of this Party feel that as the Resolutions would lose their effect and complications would be caused if they were not passed before 10.30 to-night, it is advisable that we should allow the Resolutions to be passed down to Number 26.  That Resolution could be taken to-morrow and on Tuesday, if necessary, and on it there could be a discussion covering the subject matter of the other Resolutions for which sufficient time is not available to-day.  Of course it is under stood there will be adequate time when we come to the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill to discuss various things in detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the making permanent of this tax of 33? per cent. on musical instruments the Minister I am sure will admit that this is not a protective tax but a revenue tax.  It imposes a very considerable burden on one aspect of culture both in the schools and elsewhere about which Deputy Anthony has been speaking.  The neglect of music has been very considerable in this country.  This is a tax which it is proposed to continue at a time when the cost of living has greatly increased in other directions.  It means a very substantial tax on pianos and other musical instruments.  I would urge the Minister that in making the tax permanent he would have the matter fully considered in consultation, if necessary, with the Minister for Education.  There is about £40,000 got in taxation as a result of the tax on musical instruments. I suggest that it ought be reduced by 50 per cent.  If revenue has to be got in relation to music I suggest that the Minister might get revenue of an improving and developing kind by transferring some of the taxation he gets on musical instruments to schools and others who send fees out of this country in connection with musical examinations conducted by musical establishments that are not of this country.  He might consider putting a poll tax on every examiner coming in here from such institutions to examine in music in this country.  That has had the effect of leaving us with musical institutions here that are not properly organised.  The revenue which the Minister got in that direction could be used to assist music by taking some of the tax off musical instruments.</P>

I do not see that at this stage it would be possible to consider any reduction on the tax on musical instruments. With regard to the question raised about fees paid to outside bodies for conducting musical examinations here, that is a matter that has been brought to my notice.  I believe it was also brought to the notice of the late Government.  I am having it investigated, and possibly next year I may be able to do something in regard to it.

      <P>I move: That the Dáil agree with the Committee in Resolution No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the following rule shall be added to the rules applicable to Case III of Schedule D of the Income Tax Act, 1918, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>5.  Notwithstanding anything in Schedule A or the rules applicable thereto or Section 187 of the Income Tax Act, 1918, in any case where the annual rent payable for any premises occupied for the purposes of any trade, profession, or vocation is in excess of the annual value ascertained as prescribed by the said Section 187, it shall be lawful for the Revenue Commissioners to cause an assessment to be made upon the person receiving or entitled to such rent in respect of so much of the excess of such rent over the said annual value as will, together with the amount of the assessment, under Schedule A, make up the full amount of the income arising from the letting of such premises.</P>
      <P>Any assessment made under this rule shall be computed in accordance with Rule 2 of the rules applicable to this case and subsection (1) of Section 10 of the Finance Act, 1929 (No. 32 of 1929), shall not apply to any income so assessed.</P>
      <P>Rent for the purpose of this rule shall be taken to be the full amount payable by the occupier, and in arriving at the amount chargeable under this rule a deduction shall be made for any sums which the person receiving or entitled to the rent is obliged, by agreement with the occupier, to pay or satisfy out of the rent in respect of any rates or assessments which by law are charged upon the occupier, and for the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance, and management, ultimately paid or borne by the person receiving or entitled to such rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an assessment under Schedule <Col N="342" /> D is made under this rule no allowance shall be granted under Rules 7 and 8 of No. V of Schedule A or Section 203.</P>
    <P>Where a rent in excess of the annual value ascertained as prescribed by the said Section 187 is payable by the person assessed then, in arriving at the amount of the assessment under this rule, no deduction shall be made in respect of such rent, but the person assessed shall on making payment thereof be entitled, in addition to the deduction of income tax which he is entitled to make under the rules of Schedule A, to deduct and retain there out a sum representing the amount of the tax on the excess of the rent over such annual value at the rate or rates of tax in force during the period through which such payment was accruing due.</P>
    <P>This Resolution is designed to stop a serious leakage of revenue which arises in large towns where business premises in some cases are let at rents far in excess of the valuations, and in respect of which the owners escape assessment on the amount of the excess.  It does not apply to and does not affect in any way private dwellings. nor does it affect those cases in which the proprietor of the business is also the owner of the premises.  To take one or two specimen cases.  The first is the case of premises which have a valuation of £205, and in which the rent paid is £1,000 per annum, the tenant paying the rates.  In another case the valuation of the premises is £300.  The rent charged is £1,250 per annum, the tenant paying the rates. The Resolution provides that in such cases the amount by which the rent exceeds the Schedule A assessment based on the valuation shall be assessed under Schedule D on the recipient of such rent, but that where the recipient is liable for any occupier's rates an allowance shall be made and that an allowance shall also be made in respect of repairs, or other outlay, if any, borne by the person assessed. The final paragraph of the Resolution is intended to cover the type of case in which the occupier pays the rent to another person who in turn pays a <Col N="343" /> smaller rent to a third person.  The assessment in such case will be made on the second person who is given a right to deduct tax on the full rent payable to the third person.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister two or three questions. In the third paragraph, the phrase occurs &ldquo;the full amount payable by the occupier,&rdquo; and I want to ask the Minister if he has considered the justice of that phrase.  I take it that this will come under Schedule D in the future, and, therefore, the owner of a property will be liable for rent for the preceding year, and it will not therefore be possible for anything like fraud to occur.  It seems to me to be only just that the owner of such property should pay income tax on the rent which he has received for that property, and very often that is quite a different thing from the actual amount payable on the property, the rent for which the property is let.  I <Col N="344" /> do not think it would be just that the owner should be charged tax on money which he has not received at all.</P>
      <P>I want to suggest also to the Minister that something more explicit should appear in the Finance Bill in reference to the terms &ldquo;maintenance and repairs.&rdquo;  Otherwise, there will be a lot of doubt and ambiguity as to what can properly be accounted as charges for maintenance and repairs. My third point is this.  It would appear from the last paragraph of the Resolution that the tenant or rent payer will be allowed to deduct the income tax on the rent, when he is paying the rent, and I suggest to the Minister that that is quite a wrong proceeding, because it ought to be possible for the landlord, when making his payment of the income tax, to get allowed for whatever his costs on maintenance and repairs, and so on, have been.  He should not have to go to the lengthy process of recovery.  The tenant cannot possibly know what deduction the landlord is entitled to make.  The landlord is the only person who could fill up his form properly and show what allowances he was entitled to, and what his expenses had been.  I am not moving amendments on the matter at the moment, but I ask the Minister to consider these points when preparing the Finance Bill.</P>

The phrase occurs, in the first paragraph of Resolution No. 6, at the relative point &ldquo;the annual rent payable for any premises occupied for the purposes of any trade, profession or vocation.&rdquo;  The Minister said that this does not apply to private houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose a private dwelling-house is used for the purpose of a doctor's profession, does that apply?  Which category is the house in?  Is it the dwelling-house that overrides the house used for the purpose of a trade, profession or vocation, or does the element of professional or vocational use override the house that is mainly used as a dwelling-house, or is <Col N="345" /> there going to be some examination turning on the point as to whether it is or is not mainly used as a dwelling-house or mainly used for the purpose of a profession or vocation?  The same matter will arise in connection with houses occupied by persons who are practising at law, whether it can be said that, because they keep libraries in their house, and because, at times, consultations go on there, they are using the house for the purpose of a profession or vocation.  That is one point.  The second point is the case of the owner who is also an occupier. He is not in receipt of any rent because he himself is the owner.  Is there going to be some rent assessed on that premises and charged to the person?  Thirdly, this tax is estimated in this year to bring in only £13,000, but it is hoped that it will bring in an immense amount of money hereafter. Why the small amount this year, in contrast with the hopes held out for the future?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether this proposal will apply to a number of small shops all over the city?  In a number of these cases, these shops are a portion of the letting of the house, the upper portion of the house, in some cases, being set in tenements.  In those circumstances, would it not be advisable, instead of raising a big question of this kind, which may involve difficulties, to put a limitation on the valuation, and start at a valuation, say, in excess of £25?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite in sympathy with this Resolution, but I would like to ask the Minister how he proposes to administer it.  I preface what I am going to say by the statement that I am in sympathy with it, but we do find in a number of country towns, and even cities, professional men, such as dentists and doctors, who pay weekly visits to outlying districts and I would like to know whether the Minister would consider in such a case, the whole of the premises as being <Col N="346" /> occupied by that dentist or that medical man, a physician, possibly, as instanced by Deputy McGilligan, a few moments ago.  I can quite see an amount of difficulty in obtaining revenue, and I would like to know how the Minister proposes to act in such a case.  The Minister must be aware&mdash; let us take Dublin or Cork&mdash;that many of the leading dentists visit outlying districts, where they have premises taken, possibly by the year, or by the quarter.  Does he propose in those cases to designate these places according to the Act, as &ldquo;premises occupied for the purpose of any trade, profession or vocation&rdquo;?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>Would the Minister say what is the position of a person holding a freehold under this section?  Has he simply got the old valuation basis or how exactly is he situated?</P>

      <P>Arising out of the question Deputy Dillon has asked, I would like to emphasise that this only applies to a case where there is a rent paid, and that, therefore, it does not affect at all the question of the owner-occupier. In the case of doctors' or lawyers' residences, if the occupier owned the residence, he would be quite outside the scope of this Bill and the occupier, under no circumstances, is liable for the tax.  It is the owner who pays the tax where the rent exceeds the valuation of the premises.  I did not quite catch the force of Deputy Thrift's point when he said that we propose to assess the tax on the rent payable, but he seemed to indicate that that amount might be something different from the rent received, presumably, through a default of the tenant.  Of course, the tax is an income tax, and if the rent payable is not collectable, I cannot see how the owner would be made liable for something he had not received.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The same thing applies, I believe, in a lot of other cases, but the Deputy may be quite certain that the Revenue Commissioners are <Col N="347" /> not going to try to collect tax on any income which has not, in fact, been received by the taxpayer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill will, I think, make that clear.  We have got to understand this, in regard to the whole of the income tax law, and I am sure that Deputy Blythe will agree with me, that it could not be possible to cover every particular case, and it is because of that, that you have Special Commissioners to adjudicate in matters which could not possibly be covered by any Act of the legislature, and this is possibly one of them.  I am quite certain that, if the case should arise, it would be decided by the Special Commissioners in favour of the man who had not received income on which he was being assessed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister, in that case, consider the substitution of the word &ldquo;received&rdquo; for &ldquo;payable&rdquo;? A lot of rents are payable, but they are not paid, and it might make the thing very much clearer.</P>

      <P>We are putting this before you in this way, so that you may, more or less, have material for discussion on the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  If any Deputy cares to put down amendments covering the points which have been raised, I will have them considered.  I could not possibly give a promise, at this stage, to accept or reject any proposal which might be flung at me across the House, because I do not know what the implications of the proposal might be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>

      <P>It is always valuable to get on record at this stage a question which may be examined later.  I should therefore, like to ask whether income tax will be payable in respect of premises which have become vacated.  If the word &ldquo;payable&rdquo; is used, it will make the matter doubtful.  Is not income out of rents on exactly the same basis as any kind of unearned income &mdash;say income from dividends?  I do not wish to press the Minister for answer to these questions at the moment but it is useful to get questions of this nature on record, so that they may be dealt with subsequently.</P>

Is it agreed that the equity of the situation rests with Deputy Thrift in the case to which he referred and that all that is required is to get an amendment framed in the proper form?  Where a tenant defaults and rent payable is, in fact, not paid, will this section be applied only to the amount of money received?</P>

      <P>I should like to consider that.  There is a provision in the valuation law to assess the valuation of a shop separately from the residential portion of the premises.  That might come into force here.  Owing to the practical difficulty of getting the new proposals into operation, Deputy Good may be satisfied that cases of this kind are not likely to arise in the present financial year.  With regard to the question put by Deputy McGilligan as to why we had made such a low estimate of the yield, that is due to the fact that it will take some time&mdash; possibly a considerable time &mdash; to get the premises into assessment.</P>

      <P>(1) That there shall be charged, levied, and paid on every of the articles mentioned in the second column of the Schedule to this Resolution imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 12th day of May, 1932, a Customs duty of an amount equal to that percentage of the value of the article which is stated in the third column of the said Schedule opposite the mention of the article in the said second column.</P>
      <P>(2) That the provisions of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall apply to the duty mentioned in this Resolution in respect of any article with the substitution of the expression &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; for the expression &ldquo;Great Britain and Ireland&rdquo; and,</P>
      <P>(a) where a percentage is stated in the fourth column of the Schedule to this Resolution opposite the mention of such article in the second column of the said Schedule, as though such article were included in the Second Schedule to the said Finance Act, 1919, in the list of goods to which two-thirds of the full rate is made applicable as a preferential rate, and</P>
      <P>(b) where the word &ldquo;free&rdquo; appears in the fourth column of the Schedule to this Resolution opposite the mention of such article in the second column of the said Schedule, as though the said Second Schedule to the Finance Act, 1919, contained a list of goods which were, by way of preferential rate, to be admitted free of duty and such article were included in that list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) That the provisions (if any) set forth in the fifth column of the Schedule to this Resolution opposite <Col N="351" /> the mention in the second column of the said Schedule of any article shall apply and have effect in relation to the duty mentioned in this Resolution in respect of such article.</P>
    <P>(4) That, whenever it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that the duty mentioned in this Resolution in respect of any article has been duly paid in respect of such article and that such article has not been used in Saorstát Eireann otherwise than for a purpose of manufacture, a drawback equal to the amount of the duty so paid shall be allowed on such article or on any goods in the manufacture or preparation of which such article is shown to have been used if such article or such goods (as the case may be) is or are exported as merchandise, or shipped for use as stores, or deposited in a bonded warehouse for shipment as stores.</P>
    <P>(5) That Section 6 of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1879, shall not apply to any article liable to a duty mentioned in this Resolution.</P>
    <P>(6) That any article liable to a duty mentioned in this Resolution which is re-imported into Saorstát Eireann after exportation therefrom shall be exempt from such duty if it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners either</P>
    <P>(a) that such article had not been imported prior to its exportation, or</P>
    <P>(b) that such article had been first imported prior to the 12th day of May, 1932, or</P>

    <P>(d)  that such article had been first imported on or after the 12th day of May, 1932, and that all duties of Customs to which it was then liable had been duly paid and either no drawback of duty had been allowed on exportation or all drawback so allowed had been repaid to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> (7) That articles which have been imported and exported by way of transit only shall not be deemed to have been imported or exported for the purposes of the next preceding paragraph of this Resolution.</P>

    <P>(a) the importer of such article resides or intends to reside permanently in Saorstát Eireann, and</P>
    <P>(b) such article had been previously used by the importer or his family or household or had been previously used by the importer for the purposes of his trade or business, and</P>
    <P>(c) such article is being imported into Saorstát Eireann for the use of the importer or his family or household or for the use of the importer for the purposes of his trade or business,</P>
    <P>the Revenue Commissioners may, subject to compliance with such conditions as they may think fit to impose, permit such article to be imported without payment of any duty mentioned in this Resolution.</P>
    <P>(9) That where an article could be regarded as chargeable with two or more of the duties mentioned in this Resolution, such article shall be deemed to be liable only to that one of those duties in respect of which the greatest amount of duty would be payable, and such article shall accordingly be chargeable only with such duty.</P>
    <P>(10) That the value of any article for the purposes of this Resolution shall be taken to be the price which an importer would give for the article if the article were delivered, freight and insurance paid, in bond, at the place of importation, and duty shall be paid on that value as fixed by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>(11) If any person does any act (whether of commission or omission) which is a contravention of any condition prescribed by the Revenue Commissioners under this Resolution <Col N="353" /> or under a provision contained in the fifth column of the Schedule to this Resolution, he shall be guilty of an offence under the Customs Acts and shall for each such offence incur a penalty of fifty pounds, and any article liable to duty in respect of which such offence is committed shall be forfeited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask if artificial stone and marble chippings are included in No. 1 on the Schedule.  There is another item which I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister.  Under this heading Aberdeen polished granite, black and blueblack, would be included and liable to duty, and from the shop fitting point of view that is very serious.  I am not aware that there is any prospect of getting this polished granite worked here, so that it becomes a purely revenue producing tax.  That brings me to the fact that that is going to <Col N="369" /> increase the cost of the very best class of shops in the best thoroughfares.  I should like to appeal to the Minister from the point of view of the amenities of this city, because it is desirable that shops should have the very best appearance possible.  It occurs to me that if the cost of this is going to be run up enormously, you are going to have a class of shop put up that will not redound to the credit of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what Deputy Dockrell has said.  I have had information supplied to me which leads me to believe that it is impossible to get this polished granite work done in the State, and I would urge the Minister to reconsider the matter.  I am convinced that the effect of this tariff will be to cause more unemployment, rather than to bring about employment.  Most of the employment that comes from working on the stone comes after the polishing. A great deal of that kind of work, such as lettering, etc., is done on the stone here.  I am informed that there is no possibility, certainly at present, of getting the granite itself polished in this State, and that the only effect of this will be that less purchases will be made, and therefore there will be less decorative work to be done, and hands will be actually put out of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to add that in the case of marble, for instance, what has happened in similar circumstances has been that a corresponding export duty has been placed on outgoing marble from the country which supplies it, the result being that there is hardly any difference between the cost of the polished marble and the untouched marble, that each can be bought at practically the same price.  The effect will be that that will mean a much higher price to the purchaser here, and therefore all the less business will result. There will be less of the final work, such as lettering, to be done, and therefore less employment will be given to workmen engaged on that work.  I would ask the Minister to inquire into the matter very carefully because I am convinced that the tariff <Col N="370" /> will actually cause less employment and not more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether he has considered the great hardship that will be inflicted on contractors already engaged in the erection of buildings, for which they have estimated as long as 12 months ago, with regard to getting the dressed stone from round about Newry. The Minister is aware that very large quantities of this stone have been imported into the Free State.  It is largely used by certain builders who will suffer a great loss if they are not allowed to have as much of this stone as will enable them to finish the contracts on which they are engaged.  I would ask the Minister to consider allowing a sufficient quantity of that stone to be imported under licence to enable these builders to finish the contracts on which they are engaged. Dealing with the question in general, I agree with Deputy Thrift that it would be a wise policy on the part of the Minister to re-investigate the question of the import duty on stone.  Take Portland stone.  As far as I understand, the cost of the raw material is almost half of the finished article.  In that case, it will mean very little additional employment to the stone-cutters in the City of Dublin.  The fact of allowing the raw material to come in free of duty means that it is going to have a serious effect on the opening of our native quarries.  I wonder has the Minister considered that aspect of the question, that it will mean that no quarries will be opened in the Free State if he allows the raw material to come in duty free.  I ask him to give very serious consideration to the question of the import of Newry dressed granite under licence in connection with certain contracts.</P>

      <P>As regards the effect of allowing the importation of raw stone in free of duty on the quarrying industry here, of course that industry is in no worse position than it was before the duty was imposed.  I agree that there is a case for consideration as to the action which might be taken to develop the quarrying industry and to ensure that stone of one kind or another <Col N="371" /> from Irish quarries would replace the imported stone, where feasible. That question is being examined. As to the point made by the Deputy in relation to contractors who have entered into engagements to import worked stone from over the Border, I am afraid nothing can be done.</P>

      <P>I know the quarry to which the Deputy is referring and all the circumstances of the case that he has in mind.  As it is only a few yards across the Border, it means merely importing the sawn stone across the Border and getting the work of finishing it done in the territory of the Free State, in which case no duty will be payable.</P>

Monumental and architectural stone is subject to duty. As to whether artificial stone is subject to duty would depend on the amount of stone and that is a matter I am afraid the Deputy will have to argue with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>The question of slate is a different matter.  I am proposing to amend the Resolution definitely to exclude slate from its scope.  There is no need for the imposition of a protective duty on slate.  It is intended therefore to make it quite clear that slate is not included in the scope of the duty.  Other provisions are under consideration for the development of the slate quarrying industry.  It is hoped that these provisions will be quite adequate <Col N="372" /> for some time to come.  I am proposing also to amend the Resolution by putting in after the word &ldquo;sawing&rdquo; the word &ldquo;crushing,&rdquo; to ensure that the marble chips which had been referred to will not be covered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This paragraph of the schedule imposes the first duty and I would like to take exception to one thing which the Minister said without going into the details of the paragraph. In dealing with the question of artificial stone, he said that Deputy Dockrell would have to argue the matter out with the Revenue Commissioners. It seems to me that the Minister is under a misapprehension as to the functions of the Revenue Commissioners. When we have passed certain laws here it is undoubtedly the function of the Revenue Commissioners to interpret them but while we are in process of making these laws, it is for us as clearly as may be and as clearly as we can to define these laws.  It is quite wrong, I suggest, for the Minister to say to a person &ldquo;We say it is stone if the Revenue Commissioners think it is, and it is not stone if they say it is not.&rdquo;  I suggest to the Minister that it is for this House now to make clear whether it is included in the definition given.  It is for the Minister to say what he intends and for us in the House in the process of making the law to make clear to the Revenue Commissioners what we mean the law to be.</P>

      <P>Again I say that the Minister is completely wrong in his conception of the duty of the Revenue Commissioners.  It is a very difficult thing to impose a tariff and be quite clear as to what you mean to cover by the tariff.  This Resolution will go down in history as the greatest example of that, but if a particular difficulty is raised, it is for the Minister to consider it on its merits and if he finds it necessary to do so to bring in an amendment to elucidate it.  It is not for the Minister to say, &ldquo;Here is a tariff; if you think that certain articles are not included in it, you can ask the Revenue Commissioners.&rdquo;</P>

I am not asking anything for the purpose of creating difficulties in the Minister's <Col N="374" /> mind, but the question that occurred to my own mind is this, does stone include marble?  We can in this country produce black and grey marble, but we do not produce white marble. I want to know is marble included in the word &ldquo;stone,&rdquo; because the Minister might exclude white marble which is used in ecclesiastical work and which cannot be produced here.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment a2:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Schedule, Ref. No. 3, page 6, in the second column, before the <Col N="376" /> word &ldquo;Hollow-ware&rdquo; to insert the word &ldquo;Domestic,&rdquo; and after the word &ldquo;iron&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;or steel, including galvanized gutters, pipes, and ridgings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In order to make it clear, I may say that this duty applies only to domestic hollow-ware or galvanized wrought iron or steel and it includes galvanized gutters, pipes and ridgings, but not galvanised tanks or cisterns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on that definition. I may say that the proposal originally left the trade gasping as to what was meant.  As regards galvanised gutters, pipes and ridgings, has the Minister assured himself that there is an adequate source of supply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have examined the matter fairly fully and I am satisfied that the existing concerns are quite competent to supply all the requirements of the country in relation to the articles subject to duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that there is an adequate supply of these commodities in this country. I will refer particularly to galvanised buckets, which are, as we all know, very widely used by the agricultural community.  If the Minister imagines that he can put on 30 per cent. on Continental buckets and 20 per cent. on British buckets without increasing the price to the small farmer in the Free State, he is living in a fool's paradise.  Unless the Minister takes legislative powers to ascertain the current prices in England and enforce those prices on the manufacturers here, it will mean that the cost of those articles is going to go up and every farmer who feeds cattle and pigs and who utilises these articles for the purpose will have to pay more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that, a good many country people use galvanised pig troughs, a very desirable change.  I do not know of any place in this country where these articles are effectively made or cheaply made.  I know they were at one time manufactured, but from the point of view of price they were almost unpurchasable.  It simply means now that if you put 20 <Col N="377" /> per cent. on them every one using those articles will go back to the wooden trough.</P>

It is not a question of the Minister's ruling; it is a question of what we pass by way of legislation and what will be the interpretation put upon it by the Revenue Commissioners or a Court.  &ldquo;Domestic hollow-ware&rdquo; will include a bucket but not a pig trough.  Is it because the bucket is to be used about the house and the pig trough is not?  Will &ldquo;domestic&rdquo; apply to articles used mainly in the house?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended to bring in cans and buckets and trays-articles of domestic use.  There are some other things that could be made here, but they will not be subject to the duty unless they are domestic hollow-ware. As regards Deputy Dillon's point about prices, I have been assured that the <Col N="378" /> prices which will prevail here will not exceed the English prices.  That is a different proposition to saying that the prices prevailing here will be no higher than the prices at which we could buy English galvanised hollow-ware.  There has been a consistent price cut on behalf of English firms in order to put Irish firms out of business.  They succeeded in putting the major firms here out of business within recent months. That activity has been re-started and under the protection of the duty it is felt that the price cutting which operated before cannot now be successful in preventing the development of the industry.  For a long period we could buy English galvanised hollow-ware in this country cheaper than they could buy it in England.  That was the confirmed policy of manufacturers and it was designed to clear the market here of competition.  It succeeded. The protection afforded by the duty will help to alter the situation that previously existed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered the case of a contractor who entered into a contract, say to construct some building, before this tax was imposed and who now finds himself faced with very heavy additional cost?  I am informed that in one case the extra cost will be approximately £2,000 and in another case the extra cost will be much in excess of that figure.  In what way will provision be made in respect of that, if there is any provision made?  There are, of course, the two sides to the question. A person enters into a contract for a given sum, say £20,000.  This particular impost will make the cost of construction £22,000.  It is unfair to the builder who enters into the contract without any information as to a likely increase to be asked to pay the extra amount.  On the other hand, the person who gave the order might have hesitated if he were aware that the building was going to cost him £2,000 more than the price he originally agreed to pay.  In respect of that particular problem, I would like to see some solution attempted on the part of the Minister.  In cases where contracts have been entered into, special provision ought to have been made to allow in the goods free of charge pending the completion of the contract.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="380" /> There are very few people who normally would be prepared to spend £22,000 on a building which it was calculated last year would cost only £20,000.  On the other hand, the Minister might examine the question whether builders' profits would admit of such a contraction as £2,000 on, say, a £20,000 contract.  I can get particulars of one case and possibly of another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally I have considerable sympathy with the view that there might be some provision in the law, where a customs duty is imposed, that because of special hardship of the kind referred to there might be a temporary period during which the importation would take place.  The situation to which the Deputy referred was effected by the fact that it was largely by accident that the goods became subject to the duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That was one case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That affects the ultimate cost undoubtedly.  It does not affect the builder's profits.  I think it is correct to say there is a provision in the law by which a builder is entitled to increase his price by the amount of a duty if a duty is imposed that affects the cost of his material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure of that.  I am urging the other case, that there are few people who, if they were willing to accept a tender of £20,000, would just as willingly accept a tender of £22,000.  A man makes up his mind as to what a thing is going to cost.  He is prepared to go that distance, but he is not prepared to go the other distance although he is getting delivery of goods value for the money.  The only solution I can think of in connection with such a case is to allow in the goods free of duty in respect of contracts made and in course of construction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sympathy with that point of view and will consider what can be done.  At the same time, it seems to me that it is almost impossible to get a provision that would enable anything to be <Col N="381" /> done and at the same time that would not enable abuses to take place.  The Minister empowered to do that would have to get very wide powers and, in my opinion, the Dáil should refuse to give them.  Only in cases where it was shown that hardship had been inflicted or something of that kind should he admit the importation of goods free of duty.  I am afraid the powers required would be so wide that the Dáil would hardly grant them.  Of course, if you were to take such powers in respect of any class of goods subject to duty, you would have to take them in respect of almost every class of goods.  Every time a duty is imposed you will have cases where somebody has been caught out. The goods may be in course of shipment or actually at the port but not cleared, and in such cases, hardship is inflicted.  It is impossible to see how you could do what the Deputy suggests without running great risks. We know that in another country, when the Government proposed to impose duties they gave notice of their intention to do so.  As a result there was considerable forestalling, and the rushing in of goods before a particular date.  In our case, we could not risk that.  It was necessary to follow the method which always operated here, to impose the duty without notice and bring it into effect at once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>While I will admit, with certain reservations, what the Minister has said, I do not say that it is not beyond the bounds of possibility to set up an arbitrator to consider a question of that sort.  Practically every contract has a stipulation that, in the event of a dispute, the matter can go before an arbitrator.  We do not want in this case to confer a benefit.  I suppose we may start out on the assumption that we do not want to impose any disabilities.  If there be acceptance of that then it may be possible in the way that I have suggested to have justice done.  One of the contracts that I speak of is to last, I understand, for four years.  It is inevitable, I think, that contractors in future will hesitate before taking big contracts.  If they do not hesitate they will certainly put in a provision to recoup themselves <Col N="382" /> against loss.  Obviously no person is going to give a contract in a case of that sort, where he does not know over a period of years what the increase is likely to be.  I suggest the desirability of examining the case from the point of view of having an arbitrator appointed in these cases in which contracts have been entered into and are in course of execution so as to ensure that no injustice would occur as a result of the policy which the Government are adopting.  I am quite sure that when they were considering their policy on the matter that particular complexity was not before the minds of Ministers.  Now that the Minister is in possession of the facts I hope he will see that no serious injustice is done. It may be that as regards some of these contracts the man giving them would not have an extra £2,000 or £3,000.  I knew a case in which the Dublin Corporation entered into a contract in which the plant and all that sort of thing came to such a sum&mdash;something like £20,000&mdash;that though the man was perfectly solvent, it actually put him to the end of his resources and he had to get out of the contract, not having the extra £4,000 or £5,000 that would allow the work to go on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It happened many years ago.  The point that I wish to put is that it may be that a man may find himself at the end of his capital resources and, in that case, very serious hardship would occur not alone to the builder himself but to whoever had given the contract for the building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know if the Minister has been fully advised on the question he referred to, the power of a contractor to increase the price of his contract by the amount of the increase imposed on him as a result of the tariff.  I know that a contractor who supplies goods is entitled, under a provision of the customs law, to raise the price of the goods that he supplies.  I know one builder at least who has had counsel's opinion, and it was to the effect that the section would not cover him, that he is not <Col N="383" /> a supplier of goods, that he is in a sense, if you like, a manufacturer.  He has had counsel's opinion that he is not covered and would not be allowed to increase the price of his contract. It may be that the counsel's opinion which that builder got was not sound, and that the Minister has had other advice.  At any rate, there seems to be doubt about it.  If the counsel who has been advising my informant is correct, then there is a special hardship applying to one class of trader, if you like, which would call for the giving of some sort of exemption in regard to work already contracted for. I think it should be possible to do that.  There may be some difficulty, but if the matter is confined to steel work required for buildings for which the contract has already been taken, and for no others, there should be means at the disposal of the Revenue Commissioners for checking the quantities which seem to be required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have the matter examined as well as the suggestion made by the Deputy which I think is feasible, because as far as I know there is only one case in which fabricated steel intended for constructional purposes subject to the duty arising out of a contract was brought in.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Having examined the matter, if the Minister finds himself disinclined to introduce a provision to the effect that has been discussed here I would suggest this to him: At the present moment there is considerable unemployment in the building trade, and naturally everyone is anxious to see as much building work done as possible; but there is also uncertainty as to what other additional taxes or other increases may not be put on in the case of building materials.  There is a considerable amount of talk with regard to the setting up of the cement factory.  Persons anxious to engage on either big building schemes, or the building of any big institution, will, under the <Col N="384" /> present circumstances, either inflate their building cost against possible risks of a rise like that, or they will be caught by any additional tax that may be put on.  I think that a clearing up of this aspect of the position of contracts, after increases like this have been put on, would assist those who are running the building industry in making up their minds as to what exactly they are going to do in the constructional line at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a special case where the fabricated steel is involved, because the amount of steel which might be imported under one contract might run into many thousands of pounds, and, consequently, the duty payable, if the steel had been ordered and fabricated before importation, might be very considerable indeed. I am afraid there might be a very large number of cases similar to that in which Deputy Coburn is interested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say that contractors were protected against these duties imposed after the contract had been entered into. Some of us were under the same impression&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>We feel much indebted for the assistance we have had from <Col N="385" /> Deputy Cosgrave, but might I point out that it was the intention that contractors and others should have such protection, as far back as 1901.  The particular section he refers to, Section 10, is embodied in the Finance Act of 1901, and it is there prescribed that the buyer and seller shall be protected, and it was the intention, I am quite satisfied, when that clause was incorporated, that contractors should be included in the terms, but now it has been found that there is a question about their inclusion, and consequently an unfair and unjust liability will be thrown on them.  Under those circumstances, it has been pointed out that it is only fair that such an injustice should not be thrown on them. There is, then, the other aspect of the case as to contracts entered into in the future.  Of course, there the burdens would have to be borne by the building owner, but I would point out to the Minister that it is desirable that in all businesses there should be stability. If we are going to have these tariffs dumped on at intervals, it is going to affect all businesses, because supposing we transfer the liability to the building owner, and the building owner feels that if he enters into a contract of some considerable magnitude, he might become liable for additional liabilities of this particular character, he will then say: &ldquo;Well, until things are much more settled, I will not enter into a contract,&rdquo; and in that way, work is stopped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite obvious that we want stability in these matters, if we are to get work done, and people to embark on building work.  I would urge, except it were a matter of absolute necessity, that disturbance of this character should not be introduced at intervals.  If that policy be adopted for the future, we have only to meet the present difficulties, and I think they may be met, if the Minister will inquire into the matter and see if something cannot be done by way of amendment to widen the scope of that particular section, so that it will carry out all that I am quite satisfied it is intended to carry out, that is, that if the words &ldquo;buyer&rdquo; and &ldquo;seller&rdquo; in that section of the Finance Act were <Col N="386" /> enlarged, say, under a definition in the new Finance Act.  I think it would get out of the difficulty in a simple way. I agree, however, with what Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Blythe, and Deputy Mulcahy have said, that it is an injustice to throw this liability on to an individual who is carrying out a contract, and which he entered into, either six or twelve months previously, without any idea in his mind or without making any provision in his contract against such an emergency.  To ask that man to pay a large sum of money in those circumstances, I think, is quite unfair, and I am quite sure it is not the intention of the Minister.  If something can be done to get out of that difficulty, it will satisfy those engaged in the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister also take into consideration a matter on which I have been in communication with him&mdash;a factory which, also, has contracts dependent on the importation of metal casings and which is seriously compromised at present.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This thing divides itself into the question of existing contracts and future contracts.  The point about existing contracts again divides itself into the position of the contractor, and the position of the person for whom the building is being erected.  I understand that, although no promise has been given, the Minister's attitude is that the contractor is protected under the old clause of the 1901 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is considerable doubt about that, and would it not be a good thing to clear it up? I take it that the Minister's sympathy, at any rate, is with the contractor, and that he would like to see the provisions of the 1901 Act clarified to make their position clear, beyond shadow of doubt.  If that is so, it will mean a very small amendment, and we have had amendments, from time to time, for the purpose of clearing up doubt when it has appeared, but that does not get away from the difficulty that arises in a case of existing contracts&mdash;the difficulty of the purchaser or the person for whom the building is being put up.  If the contractor can pass on the amount, then the person, say, who has contracted for some building with, say, £20,000 worth of steel work in it, is <Col N="388" /> going to find himself landed with an additional five or six thousand pounds, and the question is one of protecting that person.  Clearly, that steelwork was never going to be done here, and, clearly, a person who has entered into a contract cannot get out of it.  I am not speaking of the contractor, but of the other party to the contract&mdash;a contract entered into in good faith&mdash; the person for whom the building is being put up.  He may contract, at a certain price, subject to certain contingencies and fluctuations, as is always the case.  Suddenly, there is to be put on a building which would have £15,000 to £18,000 worth of steel an addition of one-third.  That is a a tremendous hardship and that is not the contractor's case if he can take advantage of the 1901 Act, the cost is going to be passed on.  Suppose the contractor has not got protection under the 1901 Act, our sympathies must shift back to him.  He has entered into a contract to do a particular piece of work at a particular price and he suddenly finds that one item of his constructional costs has gone up by one-third.  Some sympathy should be extended to that person in relation to a duty put on an item in a contract bona fide entered into, not by way of forestalling but as a matter of business. If the Minister desires to clear up the contractor's position, that is easily done, because it only means a clarifying amendment to the 1901 Act setting forth that those terms &ldquo;purchaser&rdquo; and &ldquo;seller&rdquo; and so on include all that we intend them to include. The other part of the contract must be looked to but we must leave that to see what will come from the Minister on the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  It is a case for sympathetic consideration, and it is not a case into which any item of forestalling could enter.  We are told that to do anything of that nature would give terrific powers.  If the Minister is afraid of taking too great powers to himself or to the Executive Council, if he looks at amendment 23, he will see what startling powers are being sought by the Minister for Finance.  The powers there will lead to something in the nature of a rival to the Hospital Sweepstakes, because there will be an <Col N="389" /> element of gambling in relation to forestalling that was never thought of before.  In future contracts, the great consideration is stability.  Nobody is going to enter on the construction of any premises into which steel work enters on the basis of existing prices, because nobody will know what addition to the final price is going to take place.  I think that there should be some declaration as to when the Ministry shall have come to the end of their tariff policy in regard to all these matters that enter into building construction so as to give the public security in respect of the building of private houses.  It would be well to have some statement from the Minister also as to when he believes steelwork is going to be fabricated, in the more general sense of that word, here and at what price to the consumer, in comparison with the present price, that fabricated steelwork is to be sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another aspect of that question to which I should like to draw attention.  Even assuming the contractor has power under the Act of 1901 to recoup himself for losses sustained as a result of this import duty, it is a well-known fact that contractors, as a rule, do not like to bring their clients to court.  In many cases, they would prefer to suffer a loss. That applies, particularly, to certain types of men, and it is another reason why the Minister should give sympathetic consideration to the suggested remission of this duty on building material.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, it is subject to duty.  With regard to the points raised by Deputy McGilligan, I am satisfied that all the fabrication of steel that is, or is likely to be, required, can be done by existing firms engaged in the industry here.  One <Col N="390" /> firm, if not two firms, is at the moment opening works, or proposing to open works, for the purpose, so that the capacity of the industry to meet the requirements of the country will have been increased in a very short time over what it was when the duty was imposed and at that time the existing firms were capable of supplying our requirements.  As regards price, the Deputy is, I think, aware of an arrangement which put constructional firms here at a considerable disadvantage with competing English firms. These English firms get a rebate from English steel manufacturers which is not available to Irish engineering firms. Consequently, it was always possible for the English firms to underquote the Irish firms, particularly in contracts for public buildings, where British steel was always specified.  It is intended that this duty will go part of the way towards redressing that position in favour of the Irish firms. The point concerning the position of contractors is being looked into, but it is intended that we shall get done in this country all the fabrication of steel that can be done&mdash;and all of it can be done here.  The boring of holes and the cutting of bits off the end, to which Deputy Good referred, can be done here.  It is our intention that it shall be done here.  If it is done elsewhere and the steel is imported, it will be subject to duty.</P>

      <P>One firm has been engaged in the manufacture of these things and another firm is about to engage in it, one in Dublin and the other in Cork.  The position is that we can do without metal doors and window sashes, as, generally speaking, wood is used to a much larger extent than metal.  Now that a duty is imposed upon builders' woodwork, Irish firms engaged in the production of these doors and sashes and the like, having much larger orders available than would have been available before, are in a position to get down to the point where they can produce supplies for building contractors at prices which are equal to, or almost equal to, those at which the imported material can be supplied.  Metal door frames and window sashes and the like are available.  The cost at which they are available is slightly higher than that at which they could have been imported.  That is due to a variety of causes.  It is not due to any excessive profit-taking or anything like that, but to certain higher costs of production involved here.  In so far as people do not wish to use this class of material, or to pay the cost involved, there is always the wooden door frame and sash to fall back upon.</P>

      <P>There is a certain type of bag made from paper, manufactured in the country.  There are certain bags which are made from imported paper. In so far as common brown paper bags are concerned, practically the whole trade, or very nearly the whole of the trade, is in the hands of Irish firms, both in the production of the paper and the bags.  There are other firms engaged in the manufacture of bags for which imported paper is required. There is quite a number of these firms here, and one additional firm has started since the duty was imposed. Between them, they are competent to supply all the requirements of the country.</P>

      <P>In all the varieties required if the package tax is kept at its present point?  The Minister must know that the packing at present is a very specialised industry.  Packages are made with a variety of aims.  Some are hygienic.  Others are show containers. In the main, paper or cardboard is the foundation of most of these containers. But where some sort of liquid or viscous type of stuff is being put up, the container has to be of a very specialised type in order not to have any deleterious material introduced into the substance being packed.  Has the Minister an appreciation of the limited variety of paper that is being turned out, or is likely to be turned out, and the enormous varieties of paper required for these containers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>On No. 8, I should like to refer to a question that I asked some days ago as published in the Official Report, column 1589:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Mr. Dockrell: What I want to find out from the Minister is if paints and distempers in dry form and in paste form are included or excluded?</P>
      <P>Mr. Lemass: The duty applies only to paints and distempers in liquid form.</P>
      <P>I take it that that is as clear as anything could possibly be that distempers and paints in paste and dry from were not dutiable.  I now see an amendment on the paper, after the word &ldquo;liquid&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;or paste&rdquo;.  Does that mean that the Minister has changed his mind since he answered the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I move the amendment, C2:</P>
      <P>In the Schedule, Ref. No. 8, page 7, in the second column, after the word &ldquo;liquid&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;or paste&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is intended for the purpose of clarification only.  It was intended that paint in liquid or in semi-liquid form, or paste form, if we may call it such, should be subject to duty. There is considerable difficulty in determining whether paint is liquid or solid.  As a matter of fact when the average paint tin is imported the top is quite liquid and the bottom is quite <Col N="395" /> paste until it is stirred up.  It is impossible to distinguish between liquid and paste and it is necessary for the purpose of making everybody know what the duty applies to, that the words &ldquo;or paste&rdquo; should be inserted. It will be clear that the only paints excepted from the duty will be those in a completely solid form with one or two exceptions mentioned.  It is quite clear that we will have a number of additional concerns engaged in the production of these things in a very short time.  There are five or six firms engaged in the manufacture of these paints and colours at the moment and two, at least, of them are undertaking fairly extensive additions to their plant.  In addition, some other firms are proposing to engage in this industry, and it seems to me that there need be no fear of any scarcity of supplies.  As a matter of fact, the competition will be sufficiently intense to ensure that minimum prices will be charged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, the Minister's reply is anything but satisfactory because there are three distinct classes of paint imported. There is paint or distemper in dried form, and there is this paste form and the liquid form.  My precise question was in order to elicit information. I may say that for some days past other people and I have acted on the assumption that it would apply to liquid form only.  It is a terrible thing to find that a couple of days, after the Minister has given an answer in a most categorical way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There is one item especially in contemplation, a certain form of cellulose paint used by coach-builders and others.  It is intended to take power to permit them to procure supplies of that without its being subject to duty.  It is not possible to get a definition which will permit of its explicit exclusion as the same definition would cover certain classes of commercial paints which are made here and which there is no desire to admit free.  The intention is to ask for powers but we may not discuss that matter now.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="401" /> Various representations have been made in the matter of books and, after giving careful consideration to them all, it has been decided to amend the duty as set out in the amendment.  If the Resolution is amended as we suggest, the duty will apply, in the first place, only to books printed in the English language.  In the case of books which are, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, works of fiction, there will be a duty of 15 per cent. with a preferential rate of 10 per cent.  That is to a large extent a revenue duty.  There is, of course, a very substantial industry in the printing of cheap works of fiction here and, as some Deputies are aware, there is one firm in Dublin with a very substantial export business in these goods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Will this tariff injure it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite the contrary; it is calculated that this tariff will assist it in a fairly substantial way. The second paragraph relates to books printed in the Saorstát and bound abroad.  Representations have been made by those engaged in the book-binding industry here, particularly on behalf of the Guild of Bookbinders, that a recent development which has taken place in relation to their industry is injurious to their interests, namely, the sending of books printed here to be bound on the Continent, where the binding is done practically for nothing by children and others working in their homes.  The loss of employment to book-binders here has been quite considerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, in fact, a couple of hundred of them, highly skilled workers, without employment in the city at the moment.  The imposition of this duty will not restore employment to all of them, but it will go a considerable way to ensure that the practice which has grown up will stop, and that the binding of these books, mainly books of a religious nature, will be done as heretofore in the country.  The third duty relates to the 10 per cent. duty on books bound in leather or imitations of <Col N="402" /> leather.  Most works of that kind are of a special nature.  The binding can be done here and is done here.  Irish bookbinders, in fact, have quite a substantial reputation for the skill with which they do that work.  We realise that the imposition of a protective duty will not restore the bookbinding trade to anything like its former prosperity, but it will at any rate go some little distance while other methods of putting it on its feet are under consideration.</P>
    <P>I might refer here to Amendment 18a.  The words in brackets:&mdash;&ldquo;Other than books which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, are works of fiction and other than books chargeable with any other duty&rdquo; should be deleted; they were inserted there by error.  There is the imposition of a duty of 1½d. per copy with a preferential rate of 1d. per copy on books printed outside the Saorstát and bound in paper covers.  These are mainly cheap novels.</P>

      <P>The intention is that the duty should apply to books printed in the English language only.  It may be necessary to have a slight modification of it because of a splitting up of the Resolution.  This duty will be leviable upon the cheap covered novels. In the printing of these there is also a substantial industry here.  The output last year ran into a considerable number of millions of copies.  The imposition of the duty will assist the industry. I went into the matter with very great care and was satisfied that this industry is likely to be assisted in a very substantial way by the imposition of this duty.</P>

There are practically only two firms in these islands which are able to compete upon the very keen basis on which these things are done: one firm in the Saorstát and another in the north of England.  The Saorstát firm has been able, very successfully, to hold its own in the world's market.  Most of the <Col N="403" /> novels sold retail throughout the world by a very well-known firm of chain stores are in fact printed in Dublin. The ability of the firm to hold its own in the market will depend largely upon its being able to keep its costs as low as possible.  It will be assisted by the imposition of this duty.</P>

      <P>Personally, to me a tax of this nature&mdash;the very conception of it&mdash;is a complete reversal of values: it suggests that the interested party in a book is the printer and the binder.  There used to be the idea that teachers thought that education existed and children existed merely that they would draw their salaries. It seems to me a thoroughly bad thing for this country that there is this implication in this tax, that books exist for the purpose of providing jobs for printers and book-binders. I think that a great many things that will come under the heading of fiction are very necessary towards the general culture of this country.  I read the amendments very carefully, and did not get out of them the reading that the Minister now assures us is there.  What the Minister has said modifies my objection to the tax very considerably. I do not want to use the word &ldquo;disgraceful,&rdquo; but at the same time I do think that the implication of this tax is a complete reversal of values.  This tax implies that all culture exists for the purpose of providing people with jobs and, in my opinion, the whole conception of it is bad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister would take the trouble to subtract from that what he knows about newspapers, and what he knows about other printed matter&mdash;and he knows more than I do&mdash;I think he would be surprised at the smallness of the figure that remains for books, and if he will subtract from that figure again the value of books other than these books of fiction, I think he will be still further surprised at the small sum remaining to which he is applying the tariff.  The reason I am asking for this information is, that, with Deputy Fitzgerald, I am convinced that, in regard to this whole tax, he is under a misapprehension, and he is doing something which is a real harm to the people of the country for a very small return. Obviously, what the Minister desires is to restore bookbinding as an industry, but the Minister, in plain language, is up against it.  Book-binding is an industry that is dying. Books are going to be bound, and are being bound more and more every day, I am assured, by machinery, and the bookbinders' trade is very rapidly becoming defunct.  The Minister is going to do for a very small return something which will be of permanent disservice to the people of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced that the Minister is doing something which is not worth his while doing.  It is not worth his while imposing this tariff on books which has put the country through a period of great confusion, with regard to books generally.  It has damaged the booksellers' trade already, by reason of the difficulties they have been under in getting books, and he <Col N="406" /> has encouraged the individual to buy his book direct, rather than from the bookseller, and that is a habit which will grow and increase.  I understand from the Minister's answer to my question, a little while ago, that under the modified Resolution, which I admit is a very great improvement on the original Resolution, the purchaser will now have to pay his ten per cent. duty on an English book, whether he gets it direct or through a bookseller?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a ten per cent. duty if the book is cloth bound and a penny per book, if it is paper bound.  Is that right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>I am, of course, postponing this amendment for the Finance Bill, but I would like to know what the Minister's opinion is of the amendment I have tabled, amendment No. 5, because it is an urgent matter, indeed.  Until his decision is known, the printing of a certain number of local magazines will be suspended.  I think I have explained the matter at length to him already.  It is briefly this.  A small inset is printed in England and distributed to certain centres in Ireland, where local editions are made, with advertisements and local announcements and news, and the result is a parochial magazine, printed in Cork, Dublin and other centres.  A good deal of money is spent in Ireland on the printing, and, in Cork alone, last year, the bill for printing was between £300 and £350.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Professor Alton Professor Alton">
      <NameTxt>Professor Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will keep my remarks about the tariff in general for <Col N="407" /> the Finance Bill.  I agree very largely with the opinions expressed by Deputy Fitzgerald, and by my colleague, Deputy Thrift, as to bookbinding in the city of Dublin.  I am a person who has to get a considerable number of books bound each year, and I know the defects of the trade, and there are defects.  The finer book-binding in Dublin is splendidly done, but the cost, as it is elsewhere, is pretty prohibitive.  The cheaper book-binding is not done at a reasonable cost, in most cases, and is not, I am sorry to say, sometimes done as well as one can get it done elsewhere.  It is a very serious item in the ordinary person's expense.  I frequently had to pay more for the binding of a book in cheap form than the book itself actually cost, and the price of book-binding in Dublin has gone up.  I think it has come down a little now, but it is one of the things that, unfortunately, owing to tariffs the ordinary person will have to economise on this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was told on the second day of the Budget that this Reference No. 15 included, and was intended to include, books I was very much surprised, but, on consideration of the matter, I was not quite as disturbed as many people were, because I felt that the proposal, as it existed originally, was so outrageous and so ridiculous that the Government could not possibly stand over it, and consequently, I was expecting at least some such amendment as was put before the House to-day.  That amendment demonstrates that there was no consideration at all given to the original proposal, and that having given a little consideration to it, the Government has come to the conclusion that it cannot be defended.  I think that some further consideration ought to be given to this and that the original proposal should be still further reduced.  The Minister was constrained to admit that so far as Item 1 (3) is concerned it is largely a revenue tax.  I do not think that the revenue that will be obtained will be considerable at all and I think it is the sort of tax for which there is no real defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="408" /> Remember that in paragraph 1, we are not really dealing with any question of bookbinding, nor with any question of printing or employment either, because I do not believe that a firm printing here will get a single order for printing in consequence of this tariff.  The circulation of a single book here, of an ordinary work of fiction, leaving out school books, is so small, that the Free State trade is not going to influence any firm in placing a contract here.  The result, so far as the imposition of this duty is concerned, will be only one thing, and that is, to make these particular classes of books dearer.  There is no use in taking up any sort of puritanical view about the reading of fiction, or the purchase of books of fiction.  I think it would be much better for this country if there was more reading&mdash;I do not really care what class of reading it is, but it would, of course, be better if it were a good class&mdash;but it would be better if there were more reading and a more extensive purchase of books in this country.  There are books of fiction for children which are really of a definitely educational value.  They are necessary for children.  You cannot expect children to begin to read anything but fiction, and you cannot expect them to acquire the habit of reading unless you provide fiction for them, and I think that the imposition of this ten per cent. tax, while not very heavy, is a definite handicap on the provision of reading matter of a definitely educational value for children and on the provision of matter of undoubted cultural value, and in other cases, matter representing a pastime and a relaxation of a desirable type.</P>
    <P>Really, no case remains and the amendment admits that a mistake was made.  I think no other construction can be put upon it.  It would be better to admit the full extent of the mistake and to wipe the tax out.  I can see some point in Number 2 and even in Number 3, but where the question of binding does not come in it would be better to remit the tax altogether. All I have heard about the matter coincides with what Deputy Alton said, that one of the reasons why books are not bound here is that <Col N="409" /> the cost is outrageously high and the work frequently is not up to the standard that can be obtained at lower prices outside the country.  The number of books that would be sent out of the country to be bound is not so very high.  Only a limited number of people do that, but there are institutions which will be hard enough hit by being obliged to have binding done here.  The Minister might be satisfied with that and, perhaps, in view of the difficulties the binding people have experienced here, some attempt would be made to so organise the industry or so change the methods that it will be possible to get the binding cost here brought somewhat more into conformity with competitive prices. Where book-binding is not going to be affected and where printing is not going to be affected, where it is a mere question of revenue, the amount will be so small that it will be of no importance in the total of the Budget.  I think that the Minister ought to agree in those cases to remit it altogether. I cannot imagine more than one or two works of fiction, at most, in the year being printed here in consequence of paragraph (1).  Perhaps an odd author expecting a local circulation or publishing a class of fiction which would have no sale in England would get it printed here.  Even at present, authors get a book of that sort published in this country.  So far as books that are likely to have a sale outside the country are concerned, the sale in the Free State would represent such a small proportion of the total that it would not affect the matter at all.  The Minister knows very well how extremely small the book-purchasing public is here, how undesirable it is to discourage book-purchase and the actual having of books in houses, apart from the mere borrowing of a book occasionally from a public library.  The fact that children and everybody in the house have access to books is a good thing and I think this is a tax that ought to be remitted.</P>

      <P>The Minister may have been misled somewhat when he was told that binding is done here very well and that it is not so much dearer than it is in any other place.  When <Col N="410" /> we talk of a book being bound, it is very often not bound, technically, at all.  A book is really only bound when the stitching of the leaves of the book is actually caught on to the hinge of the book.  Most books such as the Official Debates are not really bound at all.  I can speak from experience. I have got books bound in France which would have cost me three times as much as the cost of the book itself, plus the binding, if done here.  When it comes to what is colloquially called &ldquo;binding&rdquo;&mdash;when the paper is just caught at the end&mdash;there, the Minister will find it is quite different.  There is no place here which can really compete in binding in that way.  Within the last week or so, I happened to get a book which was printed and bound here&mdash;a very expensive book, as the ordinary prices of books go.  The first thing that struck me was that the thing was thoroughly badly done.  The illustrations fell out.  They had not been caught in.  That book was thoroughly badly bound and it was an expensive book.  For less than half the cost, I think&mdash;I could not, perhaps, stand over the statement&mdash;that book could have been better bound in England.  The Minister talked about certain bookbinders.  Very few people can afford to have books bound.  Most of them have them caught in cardboards. I think the Minister may have been misled by people talking about bound books in the non-technical sense. If it comes to the production of books in boards, as done in England, I think the Minister will find that neither price nor quality will bear comparison at all.</P>
      <P>Religious books are very largely bought in the country and they are bought by the poorest people.  The poorest person in the country when a child is receiving First Communion or is being confirmed buys a book for the child&mdash;often at a fair cost.  It seems to me rather an iniquitous thing to have that poor person who wishes to provide something which is of a very high value to the child, taxed so that binders in this country should be placed in circumstances which will enable them to charge more for doing the same work than is charged in other countries under the same conditions.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputies Thrift and Blythe regarding the duties imposed under this heading. I think, since the Minister brought in these amendments, that he also is of opinion that these duties are not worth while, and that he is trying to patch up his original mistakes by introducing these three amendments. From the point of view of revenue, I can see reactions from this duty on certain firms in this city which the Minister knows.  These absurd duties will bring very little revenue and will not bring into employment many bookbinders, while I think that there will be serious reactions from across the Channel on Dublin firms.</P>
      <P>Amendments b (ii) and b (iii), I think, require a little explanation. Books printed in Saorstát Eireann and sent outside for binding and returned here are liable to duty of 50 per cent., with a preferential rate of 33? per cent.  Books printed outside the Saorstát and bound outside come in at a duty of 15 per cent., with a preferential rate of 10 per cent.  I fail to see how that is going to help the book-binding trade in this country. If a book printed in the Saorstát and sent to be bound outside is charged 33? per cent., if bound in the Commonwealth, and 50 per cent. if bound outside it, why should a book printed and bound outside the Saorstát come in at a duty of 10 per cent.?  Surely, there is something wrong there.  This seems to me to be a hurried attempt to patch up the original mistake of putting a duty on books at all.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the whole question.  If he does, I am sure he will ultimately come to the conclusion to knock out No. 15 entirely.</P>

      <P>I agree entirely with Deputy O'Hanlon, that the amendments which we have in the name of the Minister to-day indicate that the tax upon books must go entirely or, at any rate, that it must go further than it has gone already.  Before dealing with that question, I should like to know if the Minister mentioned&mdash;I was a few minutes late in coming in&mdash;the amount he expects to get from the revised tariff, what the revenue result is supposed to be.  I <Col N="412" /> should also like to ask him whether any refund will be given to those who have already paid the duty on books.</P>
      <P>When the original proposal was put before us it was made clear that books were taxed.  Then we heard that only books coming in in bulk would be taxed and not books coming in singly to individuals.  That of course really meant, and I am sure it is the cause of the Minister's change of front, that under the original scheme the Minister was going to encourage people, particularly people buying expensive books, to buy books directly.  He was going to prevent Irish booksellers getting any profit.  He was going to put people in the position that they could buy from abroad cheaper than in Dublin, thus giving the profits, not to the Minister for Finance nor to the Dublin booksellers, but to foreign booksellers.  Also we were told that books coming in to libraries were to be exempt. I take it that has completely gone now. There is no exemption for libraries now.</P>
      <P>Altogether, the whole proceeding in this matter indicates that in a gay moment of irresponsibility, the Government said, &ldquo;What about books?&mdash;we will just see what a tax on books will be like&rdquo;.  It has been a very serious thing for people who make their living by selling books, and it has been a very serious thing in the past three weeks for people who make their living by using books.  The question of a refund is rather important.  For example in spite of the Minister for Finance's statement of his intention that books for libraries would not be taxed, I was informed that the Royal Irish Academy Library had to pay duty&mdash;it was only a small amount&mdash;on books that were certainly not works of fiction, but books from a Dutch Academy.  I wonder whether any arrangement has been made for a refund, because a refund is due, seeing that people who have already paid the tax on that kind of a book have paid it because of the Minister's indecent haste in imposing the tax.  Tere is another point.  As I understand it, the tax is entirely confined to English fiction, and to any book, whether in English or any other language, bound in leather.</P>

      <P>English fiction or other books bound in leather.  One would like to know whether this tax is looked at from the point of view of revenue, or from the point of view of the amount of assistance it will give to any Irish industry, whether book-binding or printing.  I happen to have had an opportunity of knowing, in the course of my official duties in the last ten years, that one firm in Dublin, as the Minister mentioned himself, was able to compete successfully with English firms for the publication of cheap paper-bound novels, and, as the Minister stated, very cheap books sold by a well-known chain store were printed here and even exported to England&mdash;printed in millions.  I was in these printing works and I was told that on the 31st December some millions of copies were going out to that firm&mdash;I remember some enormous figure was mentioned.  I should like to stress that that trade was done without a tariff, done by organisation, by ability, and business management of a proper kind; done by Irish people under Irish conditions in Dublin, without assistance from a tariff.  I wonder whether a tariff is going to assist these people to do any better.  We would like to know whether the Minister has any figures to support the contention that it will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing that strikes one immediately about the fiction question is that it is the cheap fiction which will not be affected.  Those who read Edgar Wallace's books or any kind of cheap fiction will have an opportunity now of getting it printed in Ireland. The smaller number of people who read the better type of English fiction, for example, the senior classes in our schools, cannot get what they require here.  The Minister possibly has not adverted to this fact: that one of the educational reforms introduced in this country is that, instead of prescribing a book in English for a course in a secondary school, teachers are now allowed to recommend to their class their own favourite authors or the authors who they think would be most suitable.  Before that change there <Col N="414" /> was a process by which you prescribed a book for a particular grade.  A particular publisher got the book out and made a fair profit.  He got it printed here and he was sure of a particular sale.  Every boy or girl going for Junior Grade, for example, had to buy a copy of, say, &ldquo;Treasure Island.&rdquo; That system has been changed.  Teachers can now recommend such books as they please to students.  The result of this tax is that that kind of book will be taxed, because there is not very much prospect of getting a separate Irish Free State edition printed here of the better class of English fiction.  There is a chance of getting other classes, but not the better class.</P>
    <P>If you take the series of books published in England, which includes fiction of a very good class, say, at 2/6&mdash;there is a new series coming out recently I think at 9d.&mdash;there will be no chance in the world of a sufficient market being found in the Free State to make the publisher get an Irish edition printed.  I, at any rate, would not imagine there would be.  If the Minister has contrary information, I should be glad to hear it.  But, from my conversations with printers recently I never gathered that there would be any sufficient Irish market for such a series.  The result will be that those who desire to avail of the cheap editions of English classical fiction will have to pay the tax, but the people who want to read the type of fiction which the Minister, in his more national and Christian moments, would like to keep out, will be able to get it free of duty.  The changes made now simply illustrate with what precipitancy the matter was first considered. It leaves people who have paid the tax up to the present in a position that they must get a refund from the Minister.  Considerable dislocation of the trade of booksellers has occurred, and we are now in the position that those who want to read the better class of English fiction will have to pay extra for it, and, incidentally, those who want to read the cheaper and the worst class of French fiction will not have to pay extra for it at all.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister made any provision in his amendment <Col N="415" /> that books coming into public libraries will be exempt from the tax?  I do not think the Minister has considered the great traffic that there is in books between this country and Great Britain in the way of exchanging and lending to students; libraries lending books for the purpose of research and study to one another.  There is a considerable traffic in that way.  We lend books from our libraries here and send them across, and there is reciprocation on the other side.  If the Minister is not to put another stone in the way of the poor student's feet I wish he would look into this matter a little more as regards this question of exchange between libraries.  A lot of these books are bound here.</P>

      <P>With regard to the general policy of which this tax is an illustration, I shall not go into it at present, as we shall have another opportunity of discussing it.  I gather from the Minister that No. 1 of these is mainly intended as a revenue tariff. That is what he definitely stated.  It may, to some extent, assist local industry. I wonder has he considered that it might have the very opposite effect, that it might very seriously interfere with that particular industry? He has put a tariff on books imported into this country notwithstanding that there is a big export trade.  In fact, the particular firm which he refers to would depend largely on that export trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This raises the general question of the advisability of putting a tariff on an article in respect of which there is already a big export trade.  In this particular connection, we are discussing the effect on a firm whose export trade is more important than its home trade.  I think the policy itself has obvious dangers that I need not insist on, but I gathered from the Minister that the main purpose of paragraph B 1 is to impose a revenue tax.  That being so, the principal effect undoubtedly will be that which everybody has emphasised, to increase the price of reading literature for the people of this country.  The complaint has often been made, and I fear with a certain amount of justification, that we are not a reading public and still <Col N="416" /> less a book-buying public.  That has its disadvantages so far as the general outlook of the country is concerned. I fail to see how that will be improved by the imposition of what the Minister has said is a revenue tax.  The Minister will surely not contend that a man buys a book which is cheap literature merely because it is printed in Ireland.  There are a number of us who buy various materials because they are made in Ireland, but I think people generally buying fiction have an entirely different motive and the fact that it is printed in Ireland will have very little to do with the choice of the actual purchasers.  That, of course, will be only bearing out what the Minister has himself acknowledged, that this is a revenue tax so far as paragraph B 1 is concerned.</P>
    <P>As regards B 2, it refers only to books printed in the English language. So far as the great bulk of book buyers are concerned the books we buy unbound are books not printed in the English language.  The books we want bound are books printed in other languages.  Undoubtedly, if he wanted to help the bookbinding trade he would not do what he is actually doing in sub-section (2).  So far as the ordinary individual is concerned, he has these books printed in other languages on his shelves and he leaves them&mdash;unbound, unfortunately, as most of us know, because the cost of binding is altogether too much.  The cost of binding books is excessive.  I think, as the Minister himself has admitted by imposing a tax on these books he is imposing a tax on the reading public.  That is the main purpose of this as it stands.  Deputy Hayes has clearly indicated the various stages through which this tax has gone. Again, I would like to point out that the Government has yielded to pressure from large consolidated interests. In doing so, the Minister was quite right, but that does show the extreme haste with which these taxes were imposed in the first instance.  That is an aspect of the matter we can discuss when we are dealing with the tariffs imposed by this Schedule and Schedule 8 as a whole.</P>

      <P>I desire to say only <Col N="417" /> a few words.  I object on principle to a tax on books at all, but assuming that there has to be a tax on imported books, I would like to suggest that it should be properly arranged.  There is a great deal of rubbish printed that is not fiction.  There is a great deal of rubbish printed in languages besides the English language.  Instead of discriminating in the way in which it is proposed here, I would suggest that an attempt should be made both on cultural grounds and financial grounds, because I know it would be a method that would produce most revenue, to tax worthless books and to let in classics.  In other words, I suggest that a time test might be imposed.  If a book has been printed for 50 years and is still being read, it can be assumed to have some value.  If you are importing works of art into the United States of America you have to pay a customs duty on them unless they are 100 years or more old.  After the lapse of that length of time it is assumed that they are of cultural value to the country.  I suggest that English classics and in fact the classics of all countries which have been written for 50 years or more should be allowed in free of duty.  In other words, if it is desired to raise revenue in this way and to tax books, books of all countries written less than 50 years, whether in the English language or any other language, should be taxed and books written a longer period should be allowed in free.</P>

If we are unsuccessful in persuading him of that, I hope that we shall be successful in persuading him that he should not try to get a revenue tax out of educational libraries.  I am not now referring to the ordinary circulating libraries.  I am referring to libraries such as the National Library and the library attached to the institution with which I am connected which is conducted purely for the purposes of education. Whatever the Minister may do with reference to general fiction, I most strongly hope that he will yield on the <Col N="418" /> matter of these educational libraries. I want to point out that there is much more involved in putting a tax on these libraries than the mere payment of the tax.  The extra trouble that would be entailed on educational libraries in looking after books in connection with a duty of this kind would mean a very considerable expense in the administration of the library.  That is an expense in connection with the library with which I am associated that I simply could not face with equanimity.  It would have an extremely bad effect on the manner in which that library carries out the function of providing books which are merely there for educational purposes.  I hope that on that point, at any rate, the Minister will yield.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister to abandon this tax if he can possibly see his way to do so.  In the first place it will not bring in anything like the amount of revenue he imagines.  It is also a tax about which there is a good deal of feeling in the country.  It is one that is likely to make the Government very unpopular.  It is extraordinary that, having survived the Penal laws and the limitation of opportunities for education of the people, a native Government should now come along and put a tariff on the educational and intellectual progress of the people.  That is the way in which the matter is being looked upon in the country, and it is likely to have some unpleasant reactions for the Government. If the Minister cannot see his way to abandon the tax altogether I think he should make an exception with regard to circulating libraries. These libraries do not all circulate fiction.  Sometimes it is necessary when a person is engaged on some particular work to get a book of reference which he cannot get at home.  He is obliged to go to some library such as the Times Book Club, or some other circulating library to get the use of the book for a short time.  I think that if the Minister cannot see his way to abandon the tax as a whole, he would be conceding something to feeling in this matter to remove the tariff <Col N="419" /> so far as it affects such circulating libraries as the Times Book Club.</P>

      <P>One hesitates to encourage the Minister in any way by referring to the smaller details of this particular imposition, lest one might persuade him that people generally would be prepared in certain circumstances, to tolerate a tax on books.  I think that a tax on books will be resisted week in and week out, until it is got rid of.  For that reason one hesitates to talk of the smaller aspect of the matter.  With that preliminary warning I will turn to one aspect.  I would like to extend rather more widely the range of lending libraries that have been called by Deputy Thrift educational lending libraries. Let us take the county libraries generally. With the system adopted in the administration of the libraries, although the control of them is more or less repudiated by the Department of Education on the one side, and cannot be well directed by the Department of Local Government on the other, more and more these libraries are bound to become educational rather than the type of fiction-distributing machinery that they have tended to be for some time.</P>
      <P>It is a fact that any serious student in the remotest part of Donegal or West Kerry can get through the county library any book he wants.  By means of the machinery through which the county libraries operate through the central book repositories here in Dublin, books can be got from libraries in Scotland and England by the county librarians in the most remote parts of the country.  I would like the Minister to consider, if there is any vestige of these books left on the face of the Budget when we are finished with it, what machinery there is for the non-taxing of books coming in in that way, or, if there is a tax, what refund will be given when these books are returned.</P>

      <P>Before going into the matter of the books, I want to draw attention to an item which, I think, will be caught by the definition which originally stood alone on the <Col N="420" /> paper and which is now, I understand, lettered par. (a): &ldquo;Matter printed on paper and imported in bulk quantities,&rdquo; excluding certain things.  Certain articles which come into the country at Christmas, such as crackers and Christmas stockings, are likely to be caught under this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was never intended and it was discovered with horror at a late point that the Commissioners had decided, under the powers given to them, that crackers ought to be charged because the paper caps contained in them constituted wearing apparel&mdash;a most outrageous thing, and a definition that was never meant.  Does this particular definition mean to catch Christmas crackers and stockings simply because there might be included in them mottoes and other things which are printed on paper? These and other items of the sort could be described as matter printed on paper and they are certainly imported in bulk quantities.  What is the Minister's mind on the subject? Does he want to catch these articles or not?  The type of article concerned will not, in my opinion, give very much employment here.  There is not even much in the way of revenue to be derived from this tax, because the articles I have referred to come in only at a particular time of the year and they are mainly intended for the benefit and enjoyment of young people.</P>
      <P>This book tax, even in the modified form in which it now comes, is likely to draw down upon us the ridicule of most civilised and educated people.  It will possibly lead them to think that we are setting out to make this country a notable type of Boeotia.  Probably we will soon find ourselves in the position of the young French lady to whom a gentleman was thinking of making a Christmas present.  When he intimated his intention of giving her a book he got the reply: &ldquo;Do not bother; I have one already.&rdquo;  We presumably will get ourselves into that position with regard to fiction at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="421" /> What is it proposed to exclude under the title of &ldquo;fiction&rdquo;?  Most of the statements of the Minister for Industry and Commerce with regard to the manufacture of certain articles could be classed as fiction.  What is the definition of fiction?  Take a very popular edition of classical works, the Loeb Library, which gives the classical text accompanied by an English translation.  There are certain books that cannot be classed as fact records. Plays by Aristophanes are not to be classed as records of fact.  They must be some type of fiction.  Are we to pay tax on the Loeb classical library volumes which come into the country because they contain English translations of the best fiction of a high class type that has ever been produced? Is it intended to catch that type of literature?</P>
    <P>We have often heard the comment made that history is nothing but &ldquo;a fable repeated,&rdquo; a fable that has gained currency.  Quite an amount of history as written is alleged to be not definitely of the fact type.  There possibly is a certain amount of fiction again.  Are we going to have any additions made to the Board of the Revenue Commissioners, men of literary turns of mind, so as to ensure that we shall get a proper definition of what comprises fiction for the purpose of these taxes?  One of the best biographical works ever written is published in fiction form. It is probably the best written account of the life of one of the foremost men in the early days of the American nation.  I refer to a particular biography of Alexander Hamilton. There are probably from fifteen to twenty first-class biographies of that most notable historical figure.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the best description of his life has been thrown into the form of a novel written by an American authoress, Gertrude Atherton.  It is reckoned as a first-class work.  From the point of view of a student set to study biography, it is much more stimulating than any biography of the ordinary type.  Yet the preface to that work includes what amounts to an apology from the authoress that she had to cast such a life into the form of fiction.  It classes itself by its preface <Col N="422" /> as fiction.  There is certainly no life that would repay reading more than the life of Hamilton, yet we shall have to pay 10 per cent. extra on a book of that type, and if it is printed in America it will be even dearer.</P>
    <P>There are numbers of people in this country who get their only touch with the classics from what I might call Kelly's Original Key to the Classics printed in English and dealing, of course, with matters that are not anything except fiction.  Are they also to be taxed?  If so, there is imposed a tariff, if not on education, certainly on the passage of examinations, which is a somewhat different thing.  These, however, are matters that probably will be left to the Revenue Commissioners to decide &mdash;&ldquo;books which in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners are works of fiction.&rdquo;  Some of their judgments might pass as fiction, according to what we have heard from disappointed importers.  None of the Revenue Commissioners has been chosen with that particular type of discriminatory flair in mind which would enable him to distinguish between one type of work and another.  This, I understand, has been declared to be a revenue tax&mdash;a tax on reading, even though it be only on fiction.</P>
    <P>Is it considered an undesirable thing to have the lives of the people in the country frightened by the type of reading that they like to indulge in? I do not care how worthless it may be, whether it would pass even the time test to which Deputy MacDermot alluded?  If people are oppressed by the boredom of the countryside and find it necessary to take refuge in the works of Charles Garvice or Edgar Wallace, well why should they not? Are they the people from whom it is thought desirable to take the amount of money aggregated here as arising from the different taxes&mdash;a sum of £123,000?  We have no indication whatever of what this in its modified form is supposed to bring in.  Would the Minister venture an opinion on that now?  Some tax is going to be put on.  It is quite unfair and it cannot be defended on any ground, cultural or any other. Certainly not on cultural grounds; there might have been an attempt to defend it on the basis that all fiction <Col N="423" /> is rubbish, but that particular judgment would not stand any test at all. This tax cannot be defended on cultural, censorship, or any other ground. It is simply put on for revenue.  I would rather have extra tariffs on manufactured goods than see a tax on reading material.</P>
    <P>There is another difficulty going to arise in the case of books bound in leather.  Quite a number of prayer books and missals come in.  Missals in general would be printed in Latin, but there is a certain amount of English included in the text at times.  Certainly most prayer books, those of the gift type rather than of the purely utilitarian type that come in, are bound in leather and, in the main, are in English.  These will fall for the tax. Is that considered to be a proper source of revenue?  In the main it is going to be a revenue tax, and it is not going to be possible to get unbound prayer books sent in here to have them bound.  I am referring to the type of book which a parent will give to a son or daughter on a particular religious occasion&mdash;a prayer book done up in good leather.</P>

      <P>I want to refer very briefly to this tax.  The Minister, I understand, is not in a position now to form an estimate of what the revised, amended Section 15 to the Schedule will produce by way of revenue.  May I ask him has he formed an estimate of what the amended Schedule 15 will produce?  What I want to suggest is that the probability of the yield of large revenue is remote. I assume that the amendments do not do away with the right of an individual to purchase an individual book free of duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then that privilege is withdrawn.  That makes my task all the easier because I agree with Deputy Mulcahy that this is not a tariff which can be discussed in detail.  The Minister must realise that the whole sense of the House is against the principle of raising revenue on literature. I do not think it is necessary to go into the categories of prayer books, fiction and so on, but the whole trend of opinion in civilised countries&mdash;I am convinced it is a trend of opinion that Ministers feel a real sympathy with&mdash; is against raising revenue from literature or placing obstructions in the way of people having free access to the literature of the world.  The result of this inevitably will be to reduce the purchase of books, and as Deputy O'Sullivan said our people have an unenviable reputation for not being a reading people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All sides will agree that is a most undesirable state of affairs.  Whatever revenue is derived from this it cannot be a very large sum.  I believe the Minister would do well to forego even a large sum rather than admit the principle that for the purpose of rais- <Col N="425" /> ing revenue or for any purpose, other than that of protecting the public, absolutely free access to the literature of the world should not be made difficult to our people.  Once this principle of taxing books or learned literature is admitted, then I fear it opens the way to very grave abuses indeed.  It would open the way to a variety of abuses into which it is not necessary to go.  It certainly opens the way to the frame of mind of a disinterested Deputy like Deputy Corry who, in regard to some particular publication, feels that some special penalty should be visited on it for some disinterested reason.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, my suggestion was that a tax should be put on an English daily paper coming in here.  It has a very large circulation.  It was employing 33 hands in Cork City, and has now dismissed them for no reason whatever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand corrected by the Deputy.  To admit the principle that it is a legitimate thing for revenue purposes or for any purpose except the protection of the public to interfere with the free access of our people to the literature of the world is to open the gate wide to abuses.  I am not prepared to follow some of my colleagues in their cogitations as to the frame of mind Ministers were in when they considered this tariff.  I assume they considered it with the same care as the other tariffs.  I do say that, having considered the economic aspect of this tariff and the representations that were doubtless made to the Minister by those employed in this particular industry, even now or at a later stage of the Bill the Minister should weigh against the grave responsibility he takes in admitting the undesirable principle of taxing literature, the very questionable advantage that he will secure for the book binding trade.  If the Minister makes up his mind that the balance is in favour of literature, <Col N="426" /> then it would be a handsome and a useful gesture on his part if he were to consent to remove this from the Schedule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to say a word as to the undesirability of this tax.  I am quite sure that all the arguments that have been used from all sides of the House, from the Independent Benches and from these benches, will have due effect on the Minister, and will soften his heart, so far as the reading public are concerned.  We often hear it mentioned, at the present day, that what we used to call home life is becoming more and more a thing of the past.  There are all sorts of amusements to which young people can go.  They go to the &ldquo;talkies&rdquo; and they go here, there and everywhere. There are still, however, I must say, some homes where reading is carried on, to a great extent, and where the children are encouraged to save their pennies and sixpennies, and to buy books of fiction, and if the Minister imposes this tax on books, it will do a great deal to destroy home life, and to encourage children to spend their savings on something else.  I know that younger people read what some people might call a good deal of rubbish, but, still, it gives them a taste for reading.  You cannot introduce a boy or girl to the classics all at once, without having some sort of attractive reading beforehand. Such books as &ldquo;Nan, An Old-Fashioned Girl,&rdquo; while not intrinsically of any great value, so far as improvement of the mind is concerned, are books of fiction&mdash;adventures of college girls&mdash;and I read them myself at one time.  I could name scores and scores of them, and, of course, there are similar books for boys.  I am quite sure that the Minister, if he gives the matter further consideration, will take away what will be a very irksome tax. Deputies have pointed out that the revenue from this tax would be very limited.  The demand for fiction will be very much less, because, as I say, people will spend their savings on something else, and I would appeal to the Minister to take away this very irksome tax on books.</P>

      <P>May I add, to what I said about libraries, something in the way of a little information.  I have got before me a short list of some of the libraries that send over books to the Free State.  I will just mention the London Library, the Roman Society's Library, the Mathematical Society's Library, the Hellenic Society's Library, the Carnegie Students' Library, connected with about one hundred other libraries, and these are only a few of the libraries that send their books over here.  In addition, there is a very large number of foreign societies, which regularly send over their publications, and usually, these publications are bound in leather.  Unless the Minister is prepared to meet me, at least on the question of the libraries, these books coming over here will form a very serious source of expense to the libraries that receive them, and it will lead to the breaking of a very valuable link between our societies here, and very many foreign societies, as well as cutting off many of the books that are supplied to this State by these foreign libraries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>A good deal can be said for exception in the case of public libraries, but I do not find myself in agreement at all with Deputy McGilligan, particularly in regard to (b) 3, because, under this heading &ldquo;books (other than books included in either of the preceding sub-paragraphs) bound in leather or any material which is an imitation of leather&rdquo; thousands and thousands of prayer books have been and are being imported into this country.  I called attention in this House, on more than one occasion, to the fact that the prayer books used in both the Catholic and Protestant churches are mainly printed in Belgium, or some other place.  We get the very pious aspiration found on tickets handed out at Sunday schools, for instance, &ldquo;Suffer little children to come unto Me,&rdquo; printed in Belgium. That is a thing that is quite common, and then again, you have on the prayer books, &ldquo;Published by Messrs. so-and-so, in Ireland&rdquo;&mdash;Dublin or Cork, perhaps, and then, you have &ldquo;Printed in Germany&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bound in Belgium.&rdquo;<Col N="428" /> A very big traffic has gone on in prayer books in this country for many years, and this paragraph alone would mean a good deal of employment, and I might mention in this connection, that Dublin and Cork firms have been known to take contracts out of English cities.  That might, of course, be used as an argument against this section altogether, but I want to show by that that these things can be done just as well in Ireland as abroad.  The skill is there, and the most up-to-date and modern machinery is there; efficient management is there, and I do not see any reason at all why it should put even a penny extra on the reading community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case has been made, and can easily be made that public libraries should be made an exception, especially where there is an interchange of books. I know that that does obtain, because I happen to be a member of a library committee, and I know that we get very many books, by way of exchange, from many libraries here and abroad. It will be a very serious handicap to many of these libraries, if they have to pay an extra penny or twopence duty.  Many of these libraries are handicapped from want of finance, due, as has been pointed out here, to the fact that we are not a reading public. There is a fairly decent circulation for all kinds of cheap rubbish, political publications, and all that sort of thing, but there is very little sale indeed for good serious literature in this country. The books which come under the heading of fiction in this amendment will make matters very difficult, and will raise many administrative difficulties at the port.  How is the examining revenue officer to distinguish between what is fiction and what is history? A historical novel, while a very attractive way of presenting history, might come under the ban of the revenue officer.  I quite see the difficulty in administering (b) 1, but I feel, at the same time, that that difficulty can be got over, because as a general rule, these cheap works of fiction come in in paper covers, and, very frequently, in cheap buckram covers, so that it would not require very much expert knowledge to differentiate between what is fiction <Col N="429" /> and what is not fiction, and what is scientific and what is only pseudoscientific. I intend to support this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Michael Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies, there is a question I would like to ask.  As we got the amendment very late, it is difficult to get the exact hang of it, but one point strikes me under paragraph (b) 3&mdash;&ldquo;Books (other than books included in either of the preceding sub-paragraphs) bound in leather.&rdquo;  It seems to me that the Minister might reasonably make, in the Finance Bill, a distinction between books imported for use as distinct from books imported for sale that come under that category.  I think that Deputy Thrift alluded to that point already.  Take the Carnegie Central Students' Library, which is a very valuable asset to students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very valuable asset to students, teachers and persons who engage in a good type of reading.  They will get you any type of book.  I saw, for example, in University College, a few days ago, the proceedings of a German medical society, got by the Carnegie Library for the use of one of the medical professors in the College.  Its price would be about six guineas, if it could be obtained at all.  I had not this amendment in mind, and I took no special notice of the binding, but I am pretty sure that the book was bound in leather or in imitation leather.  That book was got for educational use&mdash;for the use of a medical professor in the practice of his profession&mdash;and it was got free.  I think the Minister will agree with me that it would be outside his intention entirely to get revenue from an institution like that or from an individual professor or any individual who obtains a book only for use. He might have it three or four months, but he would be bound to give it back. It would be difficult for a private member to frame an amendment which would cover that kind of case, but if the Minister would favourably consider the suggestion, it would be open to him, with the assistance of the Revenue Commissioners and the Parliamentary draftsman, to provide that such books, imported for use and not for sale&mdash;I <Col N="430" /> know that the draftsman has an objection to mentioning any institution like the Carnegie Library&mdash;would be exempt from the operation of the paragraph that imposes a tax on books bound in leather.  In the case of American and Continental learned societies, you would have books coming in which would cost four guineas and five guincas, and a 50 per cent. duty would be very considerable.  It would be taxing a gift and taxing education.  I am sure that that is not the intention in inserting this sub-paragraph, and I should like the Minister to give the matter consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir James Craig Sir James Craig">
      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the greatest objection to putting a tax on anything which will prevent people from reading, but I have a particular objection to the tax referred to by Deputy Hayes&mdash;a tax on books sent from these societies.  So far as the medical profession is concerned, we get many books from American and other foreign societies, and all these books will be taxed at a heavy rate.  To my mind, it is most objectionable that we should have to pay a high tax on these foreign books, which are required almost entirely for reference.  If we want to keep up to the standard of other countries, we must know what other countries are doing and we must get the reports of the societies of these other countries.  I do not think the Minister would like the country to fall back because of having to pay a heavy tax upon its books.  The impost will be very serious, particularly to persons who are teaching medicine in all its branches.  As Deputy Hayes mentioned, these books cost from one to five guineas, and a tax would be very considerable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Professor Alton Professor Alton">
      <NameTxt>Professor Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been looking at Item 3.  The Minister has, I think, not realised that a great many of the books purchased for our libraries and by our professors are second-hand books.  They are invariably bound in leather and are dear books.  A 15 percent. duty, with a 10 per cent. preferential rate, will be a very heavy charge in many cases.  Our books were supposed to be allowed in free under <Col N="431" /> the legislation of the previous Government, but we had to pay a statistical tax of 6d.  I had hoped that this Government, being an enlightened Government, being interested in matters educational, and members of which had joined me in attacks upon the late Minister for Education for not paying sufficient attention to things of this sort, would pay the freight on books in order to help scholars, as they do in Germany.  In Germany, they are providing cheap books for educational institutions.  Big grants are given in respect of that.  Here, they are taxing us.  It is incredible.  I do not think the Government have thought about it. I do not believe that this is a Fianna Fáil tariff at all.  I believe that some barbarian, some vandal, has crept in at night time and jammed this tariff down on their list.</P>

We are prepared to accept the principle of amendment No. 5, in the name of Deputy Alton, and an amendment will be introduced on the Finance Bill to meet the point.  A strong case has <Col N="432" /> been made for the exemption of books intended for libraries from the scope of the duty, and we will arrange to have an amendment introduced to exempt from the duty books intended for libraries other than proprietary libraries.  I think that meets most of the cases made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be practically impossible to exempt them from duty. Virtually, the books are sold.  Let us consider the main questiton.  I cannot admit that there is any good ground, in principle, for not imposing a duty upon works of fiction if there are good grounds in principle for imposing a duty on sugar or other articles of common consumption.  The amount of the duty imposed upon works of fiction is small.  It is very difficult to make an estimate of the amount of revenue which will be produced, but some revenue will be produced.  It is not unlikely that in respect of quite a large number of books sold here, the duty will be paid by the importer.  To a considerable extent, the duty has a protective effect.  Under these circumstances, it seems to me that it is completely justified.  I do not believe for a moment that because of this tax one person is going to sit idly at home of an evening in the coming year who would otherwise have spent his time reading a book.  The amount by which any book would be increased in price in consequence of it is trivial.  In fact, even at the moment the duty upon a certain general class of books is being paid, and I believe will continue to be paid, by the importers. The duty has a protective effect.  I went into the matter with great care and I was satisfied that not merely would no damage be done to any export trade which we may have in works of fiction, but, on the contrary, that the export trade would be fostered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A wrong impression is being created by statements made that the industry here is only interested in the very low-grade <Col N="433" /> fiction.  The industry here is, in fact, interested and is engaged at present in producing for export as well as home consumption works which are retailed up to 2/6, and even up to 3/6.  It is quite possible that we may be able to improve that business considerably. I do not at all accept the statement that the home market for the sixpenny or shilling novel with a cloth cover is a small one.  It has not been found to be so.  I think it is sufficiently substantial to make it a matter worthy of consideration for any publisher to have the books printed here and thus escape the duty.</P>
    <P>The imposition of the duty upon prayer books has also been questioned. There was, and is, a very substantial trade in this country in prayer books. To a very large extent in the past the requirements of the country were met from within the country.  Recently that trade has passed abroad.  It is noticeable, however, that people who might otherwise be indifferent appear to object strongly to having &ldquo;Printed in Belgium&rdquo; or &ldquo;Printed in England,&rdquo; or anywhere outside Ireland, appearing on their prayer books, and the mere fact that a prayer book is described as &ldquo;Printed in Ireland&rdquo; secures a readier sale for it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice grew up of having the prayer books printed in Ireland and described as &ldquo;Printed in Ireland,&rdquo; but sent abroad to be bound. It is to stop that practice that this is being imposed.  The binding can be done here.  There are, of course, two kinds of binding, machine binding and hand binding, and both are being done here.  In relation to the export trade, it is as a saving in the cost of production in regard to the binding, and more efficient and more effective work here, that the external market is being held.  There is no reason, in my opinion, why the requirements of the country in prayer books cannot be supplied from within the country.  I am certain it can be done, and the effect of the duties will be to ensure that it will be done.</P>

Is the Minister aware that the prayer book business is a highly specialised one, done not only for Ireland, but for the whole world in one organisation, produced in one factory, in perhaps ten or twelve languages?

There is something to be said in support of the Deputy's latest contention.  It is quite true that the trade is being taken from the workers <Col N="435" /> because of the fact that the imported prayer book is produced under methods which enable it to be sold at a very cheap price.  We have to consider that.

      <P>I am, for a number of reasons, particularly interested in these industries to which it is intended to give some measure of protection.  I am referring not so much to the printing industry as to the publishing and bookbinding industries.  Although I realise that we are giving a very small measure of assistance by this duty, I think it should be given, and we can consider and, in fact, are considering, if it is not possible to assist this development in some other way.  They are industries in respect of which the output in this country will always be particularly circumscribed and limited, for a variety of reasons.  It seems to me that there is no reason, if we tackle it properly, why we might not get even a substantial export trade in home-produced and home-published books of one kind or another.  That may seem to be a Utopian dream, but I believe it is possible.  What I am anxious to do is to keep some vestige of the industry here until we can consider ways and means to develop it in the manner indicated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to item No. 16, I do not wish to make any comment on (a), (b) or (c).  In regard to (e), catalogues imported in bulk quantities, I do not wish to support the proposition that a merchant or manufacturer in this country who gets a trade catalogue printed in England or abroad should be allowed to bring it in without paying duty, but quite apart from that, there is a very large amount of catalogues imported into this country in very small quantities by what I might describe as specialised manufacturers.  They are supplied to various merchants and trading firms free, and they distribute those catalogues to their customers.  I contend that if you pass this amendment it will result in having those catalogues sent individually to the customers from the manufacturers.  I further contend that that would neither be good for the postal revenue nor for the merchant in this country who is competing against other firms in England.  He has already paid for the literature under the heading of the goods he buys. Catalogues are supplied in all those cases practically free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to (d) and (f), namely, labels and tags imported in bulk quantities, and tickets imported in bulk quantities, at the present time the production of labels, tags and tickets is practically a negligible quantity, and it is done on highly specialised machinery.  If you persist in putting a tariff on these articles you are really putting a tariff on the printer's raw material.  He is competing with imported printed tickets or labels, and I suggest that he will want the full protection <Col N="439" /> that he will get under the preceding paragraph.  If you force him to pay an extra price for his raw material, you are only handicapping him when he comes to give the finished article to his customer where he is in competition with the manufacturer on the other side who had bought tickets at the lowest price and paid for them as printed matter.  I suggest that that aspect has been entirely overlooked, namely, that the printer wants all the advantage he can get so as to enable him to get the printing, and if you put a tariff on his raw material you are only handicapping him in his business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not comprise what is known as printers' raw material.  Printers' raw material consists very largely of rollers, leads brass leads and clumps&mdash;things of that character, highly technical terms that I do not want to go into now.  In the manufacture of tickets, labels and tags much employment will be given in the printing industry.  There is no reason to fear that it will add to the cost of production of the finished article&mdash;the printed matter.  These tags can be made here; the lables can be made here and the printed matter can be put on them.  I am fully in sympathy with the proposal.</P>
      <P>With regard to the raw material for printers, numbers of commodities have been held up.  The materials I have in mind particularly are brasses and leads.  These are not made in this country.  I am sure the Minister will see that that position is remedied in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to this <Col N="440" /> matter of tags, it is a very small thing. I have it from one of the principal printers in Dublin who does a lot of work in tags that he can pay this 33? per cent., get his tags printed in England and delivered here at a cheaper rate than he could possibly get them done in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>However, that is only a minor matter.  With regard to stationery, I do not think there is going to be any great revenue derived and the net result will be to upset the printing and stationery business. Not alone will these things be held up, but every parcel of stuff that looks like stationery, tags or catalogues will be lying at the North Wall or at other ports and printers will be terribly inconvenienced trying to get stuff through that is not tariffed at all.  It is one of these insignificant tariffs that will yield nothing to the revenue.  There may be some extra employment in the way of folding notepaper by machinery and there may be other little things scarcely worth talking about.</P>
      <P>If there could be three extra hands brought into employment in Dublin I would say &ldquo;Go ahead with it,&rdquo; but I do not see that there will be any extra employment.  There will be inconvenience caused to printers in the country and stationers and people generally in getting stuff through. Surely it is hard enough for people, who have to run on small stocks, when they order paper of some kind to be held up perhaps a month before delivery is made.  I think the inconvenience will more than outweigh any little extra employment given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>An amount of inconvenience has been caused because of the fact that certain expert knowledge is not availed of by the revenue officers when dealing with printed matter set out in the Schedule.  In the case of trade catalogues and other printing mentioned by Deputy O'Hanlon, a practice has grown up here of agents touting for orders, getting <Col N="441" /> orders from good customers and having these orders executed abroad, their clients all the time believing that the matter is manufactured and printed in this country.  With regard to trade catalogues, the practice is growing up of Irish manufacturers and others, notably nursery men who trade under Irish names and who ask their patrons to buy the products of Irish gardens, to get their trade catalogues printed across the water and, in order to deprive this State of postage revenue, they get the catalogues posted from Liverpool or elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the postage is lower.  This tariff will not have the least affect on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>This tariff will do this much, it will bring some of these people to a sense of responsibility. They can get that work done as cheaply and as well in Cork or in Dublin.  As Deputy Dillon says, it is to save the extra halfpenny in the postage that they get the stuff printed and posted abroad for their customers in Ireland.  It is time to stop that practice.</P>

I think it is rather a harmless traffic and I think it is very unlikely that this tariff will result in these catalogues being printed here. It will mean that such information as might be available for a retailer or purchaser will not be available.  The purchaser will have to take the word of the trader.  I particularly want to know whether books of instruction with regard to imported machines will be taxed.  It would be anomalous if they were.</P>

      <P>There is no difficulty in getting our requirements in labels and tags supplied in the country or in getting our requirements of trade catalogues required by native manufacturers supplied here.  The difficulty of exempting from duty the trade catalogues which outside manufacturers send in here is that very frequently these catalogues take the place of catalogues used by the native manufacturer.  He gets his name printed on the cover and uses them as his trade catalogue.  It would be almost impossible to find a means by which we could admit free of duty catalogues sent in here for information only.  A catalogue sent in here for use by a merchant or manufacturer is his trade catalogue among his customers. In our opinion, he should get his catalogues printed in this country.  On the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill I propose to move an amendment <Col N="443" /> putting in before the word &ldquo;tickets&rdquo; in paragraph (f) the word &ldquo;printed.&rdquo; Unprinted tickets will be admitted free.</P>

If they come under this, I wonder if the Minister has considered the desirability of having them allowed in free. There is no possible chance of their being manufactured in this country, and I am informed that there is occasionally an opportunity of re-exporting considerable quantities of those goods, and with the approach of the Congress, it would be inadvisable to have them held up, as I believe they are being held up, at present at the ports.</P>

He cannot get a supply except from the person from whom he rents the machine, and, consequently, he must import them.  Similarly, frames for honey-cases which are made out of a type of wood grown in the U.S.A. and the exportation of which from America is prohibited, and we shall consequently have to allow these frames in free of duty also.  There are some minor items of that kind, the difficulties in respect of which we propose to meet by a licence arrangement of the kind we have at the moment in relation to knitted fabric.</P>

      <P>I suggest that you will find it difficult to find him.  However, that is neither here nor there.  I suggest that certain types of things may be brought within this category which it is not intended to bring within it.  Take electrical goods.  The ordinary switch has a wooden base.  I cannot imagine the brass top coming in and being assembled on a wooden base here.  I take it that it is not intended that such things as the wooden bases of switches, wooden fuse boxes and things of that kind should come within this category.  If they are intended to come within it, they should be specified.  There are also covers for fuse boards which I suggest should be specifically exempted, if the Minister can see his way to do so.  Personally, I think the broad lines&mdash;doors, sashes, stairs, greenhouses, etc.&mdash;ought to fill the bill, and the Minister might very well make a start with them instead of giving the Revenue Commissioners a roving commission over every mortal thing that contains wood and that is brought into this country.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say how we are to substitute the toys that will be prohibited, because the duty, if this proposal is passed, will in the majority of cases raise the price of these things by almost 100 per cent. In the main, as the Minister, I am sure, understands, these things are made from waste material got from certain timber works.  A very specialised industry in these things has been established in certain parts of Germany and in some of the Scandinavian countries.  A further article which would not be classed as a toy, but which may be cited as an example of small things caught by this tax which cannot be produced here because they are made from waste wood, is the clothes peg.  Clothes pegs are going to be subject to this tax.  I would like to know from the Minister what is the likelihood of these being substituted by a home-made article or is it proposed to get some extra bit of revenue by taxation of children's toys and things like clothes pegs?</P>

It seems to me that there is no reason why the industry should not go ahead.  The skill required can be supplied by competent carpenters, and it only needs a little initiative and business ability to build it up.</P>

Did it go in for the type of thing that constitutes a specialised industry in certain portions of Germany, where it is such a tradition that the making of even one fractional part of a penny toy comes down from father to son, and where you see the people collecting at certain times with the specialised parts in a certain town, where the parts are gathered and assembled?  These things are then sent out, and after they have paid freight in respect of long journeys over land and sea, they can be sold by the retailer at from 1d. to 3d.

I believe the medicine itself will be taxed under another resolution.  Is there, in addition, going to be a tax on the wooden container?  That medicine is indispensable for the treatment of blackquarter in cattle. If there is to be a further tax on the wooden container, it will be a very serious matter.</P>

      <P>As to No. 19, which deals with disinfectants, insecticides, germicides, etc., I should like to know if the tax is being imposed for revenue purposes or in order to have these things manufactured here.  I am not aware that there is sheep dip made here in any quantities.  I am not aware that there is a non-poisonous dip made here.  It is an absolute necessity for the late autumn dipping. According to this, it will cost us more to kill all kinds of vermin.  It puts a tax on cleanliness and sanitation, and on a lot of desirable things, and I should like to know what is the object in introducing it?  Jeyes fluid, Condy's fluid, and all the sheep dips, are to be taxed.  I should like to know the case that can be made for this before we go any further.  Store lambs will be selling about 18th July at anything from 10s. to 15s.  Wool is selling as cheap as 3d. and 4d. per lb.  In these circumstances, I do not know how the Minister can justify these taxes.  Quality is more important even than price.  If we cannot get a dip, or a disinfectant, equal in quality to what we have been getting, a very serious situation will arise.  I ask the Minister to give us some indication of what he has in his mind with regard to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some substitutes for the popular disinfectants manufactured here, but I entirely agree with Deputy Gorey that the Minister in this tariff may be doing something, the full significance of which he does not realise, because a <Col N="455" /> large number of the non-poisonous dips that come into this country are the only safe preparations to place in the hands of people.  If there is a tariff on an article, a lot of country people will not buy it, and they will try to use substitutes for things like sheep scab and the other ills to which cattle and sheep are heir and as a result very grave danger will arise.  If an ineffective sheep dip is used in any particular area the whole administration of the Department of Agriculture may be interfered with.  We know the reluctance of people to buy an article on which there is a tariff.  The danger is that if you put a tariff on sheep dip, germicides, insecticides, and things of that character, you may do the agricultural community a very serious injury.  There is not the slightest doubt that these dips and preparations of that character largely depend on the advertisements, on the grip they have on the people, the confidence the people have in them, and the knowledge they have of how to use them.  I suggest to the Minister that he should carefully consider, in consultation with the Department of Agriculture, the desirability of mitigating the rigours of this tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that there are sheep dips made in this country which, in fact, are better than the imported dips.  One sheep dip made in Cork is recommended by the Department of Agriculture and is used under three-fourths of the county councils and has been proved to be successful.  I think this argument is rather nonsensical when there are dips made in this country which are second to none.  I see no case for importing foreign dips when they can be made at home and employment given in the making of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there is any effective non-poisonous sheep dip available in Ireland.  Perhaps the Minister will inform us if there is.  There were some disinfectants supposed to be non-poisonous used on various animals which have been proved in use not to be so.  If I might <Col N="456" /> refer to domestic animals, a matter which might concern the Minister himself, McDougall's make various washes for dogs, horses and other animals which are absolutely non-poisonous.  I do not know if there is any similar preparation made, but certainly it is not in common use if there is.  I do not think the Minister would like to see his child poisoned after washing his dog. Deputy Gorey was perhaps a bit modest with regard to that matter.  I am not a bit modest in that way.  It is well-known that McDougall's provide a non-poisonous disinfectant which has no equal, as far as I know, in the Irish market.  If you are going to prevent that coming in you are going to put the owners of dogs in a very serious position.  Again, certain people use a non-poisonous sheep dip.  If there is any non-poisonous sheep dip from Cork which is effective, it has not been very well advertised.  I know that people who are engaged in poultry rearing are very loth to use a poisonous sheep dip, because if they did they would endanger their whole poultry stock.  It is a question that the Minister should seriously look into.  It may, as Deputy Dillon says, have a disastrous effect on the whole policy of his brother Minister, the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

I agree with my colleague on the other side that the Cork sheep dip is able to hold its own with any other.  This Schedule, however, includes a lot of other things, such as fungicides and vermicides. I would like to have an assurance that such things are produced in any quantity here, and, if so, that they are equal to the imported articles, particularly the proprietary articles against the importation of which this Schedule is directed, such things as &ldquo;Catakilla&rdquo; and &ldquo;Weedicide.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I would like to know if there are two different classes of sheep dip made in Cork.  It is all very well for ignorant people to laugh, but there is an arsenic dip and a non-poisonous dip.  A waterproof, non-poisonous dip <Col N="457" /> is quite a different matter to the arsenic dip.  I would like if the Minister for Agriculture or somebody with authority would say if both classes of sheep dip are available, and whether they are effective.  I have not the remotest hostility to anything from Cork, even if it came from Glounthane, where, I understand, disinfectants, are very largely used.  This is an important matter, and I think we might treat it seriously.  I did not mention fowl, but it is absolutely essential that the vermicides used in the fowlhouse should not be poisonous, and that it should not be in liquid form.  There are times in the year when the fowlhouse should be treated with grey powder.  I would be inclined to think in the absence of something convincing from the Minister that he has converted the Executive Council into a society for the propagation of fleas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Saorstát.  We have heard two glowing testimonials as to the effect of the Cork sheep dip. We have heard of the manufacture of the non-poisonous and poisonous varieties.  The one thing that operates in the mind of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in recommending this tariff is that in 1926 the home production of disinfectants of this description was worth £5,721, and in 1929, £7,930.  As against that we import £60,000 worth of these manufactures in the year.  Quite frankly, I am not an authority on these matters, but I do not see that there would be any great difficulty in manufacturing them here.  Most of them are proprietary articles which have been in the market for a considerable number of years.  The chemical composition of virtually every one of them can be ascertained by analysis.  I think there is not one of them protected in this country, so that it would be open to any enterprising manufacturer to put on the market here an exactly similar <Col N="458" /> article if it paid him to do so under the tariff, and to supply the needs of home farmers, whatever type of article of this sort they wanted.  Apart altogether from that, I do not think that the burden of the tax is going to be very heavy.  The rate of preferential duty, which will probably be the effective rate, is only 15 per cent.  None of these things costs a great deal of money.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy McGilligan, let me say that the value of the castings of iron and steel produced by native firms in 1926 was £58,227 and in 1929 it had risen to £74,771.  With regard to the question of trained and skilled workers, I believe they are all here.  The moulders, pattern makers, furnace men and others who are required for manufacturing iron and steel castings are already manufacturing articles of that description.  If a person has to make a gully trap or a lamp standard it is only a question of having the appropriate pattern and mould made and then the casting can proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This will involve a considerable increase in employment.  The skill is here.  Possibly at the present moment some of it is not being utilised.  Many of the skilled workers who could be engaged are probably idle.  If Deputy McGilligan will walk through Dublin he will see lamp standards and pavement boxes and all sorts of cast articles bearing the imprint of Dublin foundries, some of which, as a matter of fact, have been closed down within the past few years.  He will see articles manufactured by Dublin firms which have gone out of business within the past two or three years, and the <Col N="461" /> employees of which must be idle now.  I believe this tariff will help to reopen those places and extend existing ones.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received no answer to my question.  I asked certain questions in order to get a comparison, and so that people might have something on which to form their own opinions, not to be relying on the assurances which the Minister for Industry and Commerce so readily swallows from manufacturers who come to him looking for a tariff and who, of course, will say anything.  I asked what was the value of the products in a particular year of the 14 firms upon whom, apparently, we have to rely.  I was told the figure was £74,000 odd.  I asked what was the value of the imports in this range of articles now being tariffed.  I have not got that information.  I want to get it in order to make a comparison.  We are producing £70,000 worth, and we are importing so much.  We would then have some data upon which to found an opinion as to whether or not these articles are going to be made, whether or not the skilled workers are here to make them, what extensions of plant are required, and what is the further capital that has to be involved. I have had no information on the second point.  We got from the Minister his view about the skill that is here. I suppose that is derived, too, from the statements of manufacturers who, naturally, have to make the best case they can when looking for a tariff.  It is a fact that three years ago there was an importation of not less than £200,000 worth of iron pipes.  Put that against £74,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be impossible to get that information.  The figures in the trade and shipping statistics relate to all cost-iron goods.  We have only taken out particular types of cast-iron goods, and there can be no doubt as to the ability of our manufacturers to supply these.  The cast-iron industry here was largely a jobbing industry. In the original duty we included certain types of goods which, to a large extent, were produced more or less by mass production methods. They were produced by semi-skilled labour.  We are now adding to that a number of classes of goods which require the labour of the highly skilled cast-iron founders.  There are a large number of these in the country.  In fact, for a number of years our requirements in relation to these goods were supplied by the Dublin foundries.  Recently, because of a variety of reasons, the industry came upon bad times.  As Deputy Cosgrave and other Deputies are aware, some of the Dublin foundries in fact closed down.  I understand there is some prospect of these foundries now reopening in the new circumstances.  In any case, the <Col N="463" /> existing foundries in Dublin, Drogheda, Galway and elsewhere are quite capable of supplying the goods that are now subject to duty.</P>

The Minister for Finance expressed himself as absolutely satisfied as to all the skilled workers there are, and referred to big industrial firms.  We have now got a proper description of it as a jobbing business from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

In regard to all the items mentioned, and to quite a large number that are not included and that normally are manufactured here, the industry is quite capable of supplying any needs that are likely to arise.</P>

      <P>If the Minister desires to see the industry re-started, I do not think this is the best way to do it.  In the first place, practically all the people purchasing these goods buy what are called standard goods.  They know pretty well what they want, who supplies them and they go to him. Normally, the persons so requiring these goods will pay the 15 per cent. extra and simply add it on to the price of the house, whatever it may be.  At the moment and for some time to come, that additional cost is going to go on and it certainly is going to interfere with the cost of building.  It must increase the cost of building, and I do not think that is the Minister's intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect to external water-pipes and down pipes the Deputy is probably aware that these are being made in the country and exported from it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, but that is not always the case.  Everyone does not buy them.  Is the 15 per cent. likely to tilt the scale in favour of the home article and to get a demand for it at once?  Personally I do not think it is.  I think it is too small, and that it is too much on the other hand for those who have to pay it extra in respect to building &mdash;those who will not use the home material.  I think the Minister ought to look into that and see whether it is not possible to get a stock of these ready and have it brought home to the builders of the country that they are available.  One drawback about this enormous list of tariffs is that people are not in a position to know actually what is tariffed.  They know <Col N="465" /> that everything is up, but they are not in a position to know all the goods that are manufactured here and that are available here.  It is quite possible that the engine is away from the train.</P>
      <P>If it is intended to make a success of this tariff policy a good deal more work than merely having it dealt with here in the Dáil will be necessary. Undertakings from the firms in question as regards continuity of supply, the excellence of the material, the same terms in respect of damaged material that people here are accustomed to get from British manufacturers and so on should be the rule. In addition to that, in respect to quite a number of these items, there ought to be some inspection not of the inquisitorial sort but made rather with a view to ensuring that quality will distinguish the goods they are manufacturing.  That is not an unreasonable request, because if people who have a sort of line ball business are going to be placed in a fairly strong position, then the public are certainly entitled to get value for their money.  Within a short period there ought to be no addition to the price if they really enter into the proper spirit.  I am rather inclined to think that the 15 per cent. is not enough for a business which, as the Minister said, was of a sort of a jobbing character up to now, with perhaps one exception.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as housing materials are concerned, in addition to the protection that we are giving here there is a more direct form of protection which we intend to bring in under the Housing Bill, namely, that the grants given will be conditional on the use of certain specified standards of Irish materials.  At present we are endeavouring to get into touch with the manufacturers in order to get standards fixed and prices ascertained at which these manufacturers will supply certain standardised materials in quantity. In that way we will be able to get produced, on an economic basis in this country, that range of goods that could not otherwise be produced at all. So far as what the Deputy says, relating to the amount of this duty, is concerned, <Col N="466" /> it is true that those engaged in the industry did press for a larger tariff.  They made the case that the competition they were up against, in respect of some of these articles, was particularly severe; in other words, that industries in other countries, because of depressed conditions, and the rest of it, were selling goods at a minimum cost merely to keep production. I went into the matter in some detail, however, and satisfied myself that the protection we are giving is sufficient to tilt the balance in favour of the home foundries, and to insure that orders for these goods will be available to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a different impression amongst practically all builders and builders' providers as regards the cost.  In fact, the impression outside is, and it is the impression of people in the trade, that the increased grants barely compensate for the increased costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are trying to do is by standardising the materials to bring the cost down to the minimum. There may be some additional increase in cost, and I would like to dispel any false impression on that account, because, in some of the industries affected, the prevailing rates of wages here are somewhat higher than in England and in so far as that is so, the cost may be slightly higher.  By standardisation of the type that we have in mind, however, we hope to be able to get down to rock-bottom prices, and to make the materials available to local authorities and to individual builders at prices which will insure that they will be at no disadvantage when they are required to use the products of Irish factories.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been listening to the proceedings here for weeks past and everybody knows that <Col N="467" /> agricultural prices were never as low in the last 15 years as they are at present.  People know fairly well that their prices are higher than they have been.  For instance, one need only look at the newspapers to find that we are paying 130/- for butter here, which is sold in England for 100/-  These costs are all on the main producers of the country.  Can they bear any additional cost?  If there is going to be accommodation in respect of these matters costs are an essential item, and it is a nice question whether farmers, who will take some of the houses, can afford to pay higher prices for goods here than the prices at which they are capable of being produced in other countries.  Tariffs in order to be a success must produce goods at something like world prices and we cannot afford to have here prices in excess of those world prices.</P>

      <P>There was a question asked by Deputy McGilligan of the Minister, namely, as to the estimate of the amount of these cast-iron goods that are imported, and the Minister refused to give even an estimate. He will remember, however, that, some time ago, we asked him for an estimate of how that £910,000 was made up.  In that is included, I see from the type-script paper that was circulated, the item &ldquo;cast-iron&rdquo; articles.  It is lumped in with the other articles making up that £271,000. Again, I suggest that that was made up by addition of the various items.  Would the Minister mind telling us merely as an estimate, of course, what estimate there was, under the separate items, for cast-iron articles.  That will, to a certain extent, at all events, give us some idea, and we can go on, then, perhaps, from that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will understand that the yield from the duty will be very greatly influenced by the rate at which development in the industry proceeds.  If what we hope happens, the yield will be very low, <Col N="469" /> and if what we do not think is likely to arise, should arise, that imports should continue and that the duty has been fixed too low to tilt the balance in favour of the Irish industry, a slightly larger yield will result.  But, in respect of the articles mentioned there, there can be no question that, not merely are the firms capable of producing all our requirements, but they have in fact, been producing the bulk of our requirements over a number of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite the question raised or the question I am nisraig now.  To get at this £271,000, the Minister had some estimate. That estimate may be false or not, I grant the Minister, according to whether the tariff is effective or not, but an estimate was formed, and must have been formed, and it can only have been formed on some estimate of the amount of these goods used in the country at present. Could we not have that estimate? Granted that that estimate may not be very accurate&mdash;it may be a guess&mdash;but some estimate the Minister must have had, if this list is not entirely worthless.  I do not ask for his estimate of the yield of the tariff&mdash;that may be falsified by events &mdash;but an estimate must have been formed of the amount of the goods used in the country, and we should have that estimate, I think.</P>

      <P>In view of the importance, from the Minister's point of view, of housing costs, I will put it to him that he will remember that, when I got an estimate that the tariff on steel windows would increase the cost of an £800 house by £15, he suggested that the use of wooden windows would obviate any necessary rise in the cost of building a house of that particular kind.  Taking the cost, however, in respect of the different articles that have been tariffed here, I have got an estimate that the increase in <Col N="470" /> cost on, say, an £800 house would probably run as high as 12 per cent.</P>

      <P>It is given as the ordinary £800 house here in Dublin, but I want to point out to the Minister simply the danger he is running at present, if he does not carry out the examination that I suggest he should carry out.  Every single possible &ldquo;if&rdquo; that a builder can see in front of him is going to be taken into consideration by him, in quoting his building costs, and down on top of a very necessary housing programme that is being planned by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health is going to fall the burden of all these &ldquo;ifs,&rdquo; if by an examination of the position by the Minister with the machinery at his disposal, all the alternatives are not thoroughly pointed out, and all the &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; that can possibly be exorcised and made to vanish are not made to vanish.  As I come across opinions amongst the people handling these materials for sale and among builders, the estimate of 12 per cent. is given as the increase in the cost of building, and I think it would be most desirable that the Minister should have the different items that bear on the cost of building examined, with a view to seeing what kind of case can reasonably be made for an increase in the cost of building.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been done. The Deputy understands that in relation to tariffs we are bringing in these cast-iron goods, rain-water pipes and down-pipes, and we are bringing in builders' woodwork.  The position in regard to builders' woodwork is, so far as local authorities and the organised building trades are concerned, that home-produced woodwork has always been used because the trade unions <Col N="471" /> refuse to handle any other.  It only applies really to the unorganised trade, the smaller building people in outlying, unorganised districts.  They are now going to be required to use the home-produced doors and window-frames and the like.  The local authorities always use the home product, and the larger builders in the organised areas also use the home product.  So far as the cast-iron goods are concerned, we are very large exporters at the moment of cast-iron goods.  A very large firm in this country is engaged in their production and is supplying them to other countries.  We can make cast-iron goods&mdash;commercial castings&mdash;at a price which compares with that of anything that we can import.</P>

If we find that they can do what we require and that the price is right, well and good.  If we find that the price is too high, we have to cut it out for the moment.  But the intention is, by standardisation and concentration of orders, to try to get the largest amount of Irish materials put into houses that are to be built.</P>

      <P>As regards item 21&mdash; superphosphates, ground mineral phosphates and compound manures&mdash;there is a considerable amount of anxiety amongst the farming community over this tax.  Superphosphates are an indispensable commodity on most farms. So far as my inquiries have gone, it is possible that there will be a rise in the price of these articles.  If there is, it will be almost disastrous for the working farmers on the poorer lands.  The Minister might give us some particulars as to the amount of superphosphates and other manures imported from England and foreign countries.  I know that there is only a tax on foreign phosphates, but until we see the amount of superphosphates and other manures imported from foreign countries we will not be able to make any guess at what the probable effects of the prohibitive tariff&mdash;it really amounts to prohibition&mdash;will be.  There is considerable anxiety on the part of farmers on this question.  Superphosphates and the other mineral manures mean, perhaps, more to the farmer than even the remission in rates.  They mean practically the existence of the small farmer at present.  Even the <Col N="473" /> smallest addition to farmers' costs would be lamentable.  I should like the Minister to give us an assurance that there will be no increase in the cost of any of these manures.  I do not know whether he is in a position to give that or not, but the farming community will expect it from him.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister not to enforce this tariff. Fertilisers are very important to a large section of farmers in my constituency. It is absolutely essential that their land should be fed with fertilisers in order that they may be able to carry on their business.  Our great want in County Limerick is lack of sufficient cash to buy artificial manure.  I am in a position to tell the Minister what the effects of this tariff will be, because I am the medium through which a large area has been supplied with this superphosphate for a number of years.  I bought last spring over 100 tons for the farmers.  If this tariff were enforced, I would be only able to buy 80 tons and if I had to buy the home manufactured stuff I would be only able to buy 75 tons.  That is the position and it is a very serious position for the farmer.  It is a sort of tradition that a Government should attempt to make two blades of grass grow where one grew before. To do that, is to serve the country well.  I do not say that the Minister, by this tariff, would stop that growth altogether, but I say that if the tariff is enforced it will prevent the farmer from improving his land to the extent that he wishes to improve it.  Deputy Bennett has said that this is more important to the farmers than the agricultural grant given for the relief of local rates.  I say that in a large area in my constituency it is more important that this tax should not be put on than is the addition to the agricultural grant and the Butter Bounty Bill.  I make this appeal to the Minister in all sincerity and good faith.  I hope he will remit the tax. If he does not do so, he will be placing a barrier in the way of many farmers in my constituency which will prevent them carrying on the work they are at present engaged on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose this tax because I look upon it as a tax upon production.  If you have no imports of superphosphate, the price is bound to go up.  The manufacturer in this country has to import superphosphate and the handling of it and bagging of it is his only part in the industry.  Surely, if there is an increase in the price of superphosphate, it will be a tax on production.  The tax will hit the tillage farmer particularly.</P>
      <P>He has not much stock to make what is the most valuable adjunct to the farm, and that is farm manure.  He must fall back upon the artificial manures which are at his disposal. Probably he will not be able to pay cash for them and may have to pay a little extra simply because he gets credit.  How much more will he have to pay when there is an added tax of 20 per cent.?  It is the same with compound manures.  Every practical farmer knows that the best thing he can do, and what will be of most assistance to him in farm economy, is to mix these manures himself.  Every intelligent farmer who has been educated by our agricultural instructors or in our agricultural colleges knows well the proportions in which these manures ought to be mixed.  He has not got any information as to what the compound manures are like.  There is no section of this industry where there is so much profiteering as in compound manures. An excessive price is charged simply because they are bagged and sold as well-balanced manures.  A farmer who has experience and who carries on his farm economy in an up-to-date manner usually makes his own manures in the proportions which his land requires and which his experience considers justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This tariff might have a tendency to encourage the production of another commodity which has gone back in this country, and that is the burning of lime.  Many farmers regard that as a valuable adjunct to farm economy.  I, for one, am very anxious to encourage that side of it, but not by putting a tax upon what must be considered as a most valuable necessity for the tillage <Col N="475" /> farmer in particular, and all other farmers, whether grass farmers or those who carry on mixed farming. Everyone knows that it is only by intensive cultivation of your farm that you can make agriculture pay now; by top-dressing land for meadowing, by highly manuring crops with well-balanced manures.  Anyone who taxes an article which the farmer requires is striking a blow at agriculture which will have a more severe effect upon the farmer than any other form of imposition that could possibly be placed upon him.</P>
    <P>Recently I was talking to a most intelligent farmer in West Cork, whose rent and rates were not very high.  The way he put it was, that a shilling in the cwt. less for meal, and a halfpenny in the pound more for pork would be more to him than either derating or de-renting.  He was carrying on production on a very small farm at a rate which showed what can be done with land when intelligence and capital are brought to bear.  I happen to know the tillage farmer, and this is the one imposition which the tillage farmer is least able to bear.  He may possibly do without a new plough.  He may make the old one do, or he may work with deficient implements, but the one commodity he must have an adequate supply of, if he is in any way deficient in farmyard manure, is the artificial manure necessary for proper production. At the present time, that is the position which exists with a large number of farmers in tillage districts. I venture to say that there is very little of the land of the country that is not under-stocked, and that an adequate supply of farmyard manure is not made.  No matter how much farmyard manure is made, you must supplement it by adequate mixtures of artificial manures if you are to carry on an expert and adequate farm economy.  I have no hesitation in asking the Minister, therefore, not to place this imposition upon the agricultural community, who are already sufficiently burdened, particularly the tillage farmer.  We have had recommendations from the Agricultural Department to go in for what is called <Col N="476" /> rotational grazing.  Is there anything which will put a stop to all the advantages which agricultural education has placed at our disposal more than the imposition which is about to be placed on it by the Minister?  I certainly have no hesitation in opposing it.  I believe that injury will be done to the agricultural community, from which they will not recover, by an imposition such as this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister put this tariff on superphosphates deliberately in order that he could withdraw it afterwards. Possibly that was his intention, and so lead the farmers to believe that there was only one thing in this list of tariffs which bore heavily upon them, and that having given that away he was giving a big concession to the farmers. If for no other reason than that it will promote competition, I think the Minister should give way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assuming even that the tariff of 20 per cent. would not affect prices, by allowing foreign manures to come in he will keep the home manure manufacturers and the English manure manufacturers within bounds in price. We have had it from experienced farmers, and those who sell manures, that undoubtedly there is from 17/6 to £1 per ton difference between the foreign and the home-manufactured manures.  If this tariff goes on, undoubtedly there will be a much greater difference, probably about £2 per ton.  In my own county, and also, I heard, in the Midland counties, some farmers this year were so badly-off that they could not use any artificial manure, and the crops had to go in without it, because they had not money to buy it.  Here we have an opportunity of maintaining competition in the artificial manure business, and if you do away with that competition you will leave the farmers in a very bad position.  I ask the Minister to withdraw this.  So far as the yield to the revenue is concerned, I am sure it is not worth considering.  If it is in the interests of any particular home manufacturers, I think that the interests of the farming community as a whole are far and away superior to <Col N="477" /> the interests of any small group of manufacturers, who might by this tariff possibly give employment to a few extra men at the expense of the thousands of agriculturists in the country.  I appeal to the Minister not to proceed with this.</P>

      <P>You would think by the arguments put up here that this was a terrible imposition altogether.  Those on the Opposite Benches who pretend to represent the farmers think that they should get foreign workers to grind the maize, foreign millers to mill the flour, but that they should get Irishmen to eat what they produce on the land.  The total import last year of these manures was 32,000 tons.  The tariff, therefore, would amount to something like £18,000.  Deputy O'Shaughnessy said it was more than the agricultural grant&mdash;£18,000 as compared with £250,000!  It shows the manner in which they make up their accounts.</P>

In all these speeches Deputies assume that the farmers of the country have been depending on foreign sources for the supply of their artificial manures despite the fact that four out of every five farmers never use foreign manure. Out of a total consumption of about 200,000 tons, over 140,000 tons were produced within the country.</P>

      <P>I shall tell the Deputy. We are going to put on a tariff for the reason that the British put on a tariff, and because the British put on a tariff, the foreign product, the Continental product, was being dumped into this country.  Such a quantity came in here for the first few months of the year or during the winter that the existing factories were unable to dispose of the quantities they produced, and at this moment these factories are closing down and the men are being disemployed.</P>

      <P>I say that farmers who have a different outlook to the Deputies who have spoken, four out of every five of them, have been using the home product.  Five out of every five will use it as a result of this tariff.  They will be placed in no worse position than the British farmer.  A duty has been imposed in Britain on the importation of these manures, so that vis-a-vis his English competitor, <Col N="479" /> the Irish farmer will be in no worse position.  As a result of this tariff 1,000 men, as Deputy Corry stated, are going to be secured a livelihood in this country.  In view of the fact that prices are going to be fixed by competition, and that the existing factories are quite competent to supply the entire requirements of the country, and also that the farmers are in no worse position than their competitors in Britain and Northern Ireland, it seems to me that there can be no reasonable objection to the tariff.</P>

If that policy is adopted, if we allow into this country everything which we can get at a cheaper price than that at which it can be produced at home, you can shut down every factory, cut down every hedge and level out every fence, and concentrate on the production of live cattle, which is the one commodity in which we can compete with other countries.  We can do that and keep a couple of hundred thousand people in this country.  We would then have the type of country that the Deputy is endeavouring to create here.</P>

Are they quite satisfied that foreign manufacturers, even manufacturers of manures, will still be reasonable and have consideration for the Irish users? Is it not the case that in England there is a proposal by leading politicians to manipulate prices so that profits may be increased?  Will that not apply to the manure industry if we are left to the mercy of foreign manufacturers? Are they quite sure that when the <Col N="480" /> manure factories in Wicklow and other towns disappear that the farmer will be all right?  It is absolute nonsense. Those who pretend to be farmers should have some consideration.</P>

      <P>There was a time when we could buy fertilisers at £2 17s. 0d. a ton.  What would we pay if there were no competition, if the 32,000 tons were not coming in?  What were we paying before fertilisers were imported and compare that with what we paid after they were allowed in.  It is up to the Minister to give us definite information on these matters.  What was the position when manufacturers combined themselves into a ring and what was the jump in price as soon as the ring was perfected?  Fortunately the North African fertilisers, not to talk of the Belgian or the Dutch, were imported. The North African is a high-grade phosphate.  The Minister should give us some indication of what the prices are likely to be when competition is excluded.  People got three times as much sulphate of ammonia last year as during the year before and that was because of the war between the two sulphate companies. It cost this year £6 a ton.</P>
      <P>I believe this proposal will have the effect of choking off all competition. We will shut out the 32,000 tons of fertilisers that we have been importing.  All the people interested in this country are going in procescessions to the Minister anxious to get a job done, and the Minister believes them, regardless of who has to do the paying.  The Minister talks about £250,000 in this connection.  If the competition is ruled out I believe that it will mean an extra cost of £200,000 or £300,000 on the farmers.  I suggest he should take off this tariff.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by a responsible leader of the Opposition that it is intended to challenge a division.  There are eighteen resolutions and fifteen amendments, and it is a matter of mathematical calculation to see whether they can all be dealt with under an hour.  It is quite possible questions will have to be asked for the purpose of eliciting information.</P>

      <P>If the Government are moving the amendments formally and the Resolutions formally, assuming you are finished with No. 7, surely it will not take ten minutes to finish off the Resolutions and the amendments in that way?

      <P>There is no danger unless a division is challenged before 10.30 on a Resolution other than the last.  Is not that the position?  There is no danger, unless before 10.25 such a division is challenged.  I suggest the Chair should start now to put all the amendments, and if any Deputy wants a division let it be taken on a particular Resolution, on the understanding that whatever happens we can go on with the Resolutions.  If no division is challenged we can go on to 11 o'clock, if that is considered advisable.</P>

    <P>(1)  That there shall be charged, levied, and paid on every of the articles mentioned in the Schedule to this Resolution imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 12th day of May, 1932, a customs duty at the rate stated in the third column of the said Schedule opposite the mention of the article in the said second column.</P>
    <P>(2)  That wherever it is stated in the fifth column of the Schedule to this Resolution that the provisions of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, apply in respect of any duty mentioned in that Schedule, the provisions of the said Section 8 shall apply to that duty with the substitution of the expression &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; for the expression &ldquo;Great Britain and Ireland&rdquo; and as though the articles liable to that duty were included in the Second Schedule to the said Finance Act, 1919, in the list of goods to which two-thirds of the full rate is made applicable as a preferential rate.</P>
    <P>(3)  That, subject to the provisions of the foregoing paragraph of this Resolution, the provisions (if any) set forth in the fifth column of the Schedule to this Resolution opposite the mention in the second column of the said Schedule of any article shall apply and have effect in relation to the duty mentioned in this Resolution in respect of such article.</P>
    <P>(4)  That, whenever it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that the duty mentioned <Col N="489" /> in this Resolution in respect of any article has been duly paid in respect of such article and that such article has not been used in Saorstát Eireann otherwise than for a purpose of manufacture, a drawback equal to the amount of the duty so paid shall be allowed on such article or on any goods in the manufacture or preparation of which such article is shown to have been used if such article or such goods (as the case may be) is or are exported as merchandise, or shipped for use as stores, or deposited in a bonded warehouse for shipment as stores.</P>
    <P>(5)  That Section 6 of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1879, shall not apply to any article liable to a duty mentioned in this Resolution.</P>
    <P>(6)  That any article liable to a duty mentioned in this Resolution which is re-imported into Saorstát Eireann after exportation therefrom shall be exempt from such duty if it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners either:</P>
    <P>(a)  that such article had not been imported prior to its exportation, or</P>
    <P>(b)  that such article had been first imported prior to the 12th day of may, 1932, or</P>
    <P>(c)  that such article had been first imported on or after the 12th day of May, 1932, and that all duties of customs to which it was then liable had been duly paid <Col N="490" /> and either no drawback of duty had been allowed on exportation or all drawback so allowed had been repaid to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>(7)  That articles which have been imported or exported by way of transit only shall not be deemed to have been imported or exported for the purposes of the next preceeding paragraph of this Resolution.</P>
    <P>(8)  That the value of any article for the purposes of this Resolution shall be taken to be the price which an importer would give for the article if the article were delivered, freight and insurance paid, in bond, at the place of importation, and duty shall be paid on that value as fixed by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>(9)  If any person does any act (whether of commission or omission) which is a contravention of any condition prescribed by the Revenue Commissioners under a provision contained in the fifth column of the Schedule to this Resolution, he shall be guilty of an offence under the Customs Act and shall for each such offence incur a penalty of fifty pounds, and any article liable to duty in respect of which such offence is committed shall be forfeited.</P>
