    <Speaker pid="NeilBlanel" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether it has been brought to his notice that complaints have been made in Donegal that traders and retailers have in some cases increased the price of Saorstát manufactured articles&mdash;such as maize or Indian meal&mdash;by the whole or part of the duties imposed on the corresponding imported article and, if so, what steps he proposes to take against profiteering of this kind and to prevent the increase of prices where there is no reason for such increases except the existence of a protected market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received complaints that merchants in certain centres in Co. Donegal increased their prices for maize products following the imposition of the tariff. There is no justification for any such increase.  Enquiries which were addressed by my Department to maize millers in Co. Donegal reveal that no increase in the wholesale price of these products had taken place.  As I have intimated to the Dáil, legislation will be introduced at an early date which will, I hope, enable me to deal effectively with complaints of the kind to which the Deputy refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has enquired from the millers whether the price of maize meal has been increased. Has he enquired from the railway companies whether freight charges from where the meal is now produced to where it is being sold is greater or less than they were when factors were getting it from Derry or other centres in the Six Counties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but in my opinion the freight charges should be less in the particular centres in respect to which complaints were received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not astonish the Minister to know that there are many places where a short haul is much more expensive than a long haul, because the railway companies will make concessions to big millers and give cheap rates that they will not give <Col N="1979" /> to small millers or shopkeepers? Would he not enquire whether the meal is not costing the shopkeeper more since this tariff was put on?  There is nothing made on meal.  If the price has been raised, I am sure it is because the sellers had to pay more in freight or purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The enquiries conducted by my Department have satisfied me that the increase in prices which took place in a few centres, in respect to which complaints were made in County Donegal, were not justified by any increase of prices to the merchants.  I will have the matter of freight charges to which the Deputy refers examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilBlanel" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the mills in question have not increased the carriage rate on maize meal to the different merchants, but notwithstanding that the price of the meal has been increased in some cases by 2/- per cwt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the supplementary question, I want to ask the Minister if the price-fixing legislation which he proposes to introduce gives him power to impose penalties or even jail on railway companies for increasing freights on short hauls out of proportion to what they charge for long hauls?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the point made by the Deputy, I wish to state that, in the case of Donegal, in respect of complaints of an increase in the prices of maize products, there is no justification whatever for the increases. I hope when legislation is introduced we will be able to deal with the merchants concerned if they are still offending in that matter in the way the Deputy indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>My point has apparently been misunderstood.  On the <Col N="1980" /> question introduced relative to this matter of maize meal in Donegal, I want to know will the price-fixing legislation which the Minister proposes to introduce give him power to impose penalties on railway companies generally, or haulage companies generally, if they increase the price for short hauls out of proportion to the freights they receive for long hauls?  Do I understand the Minister to say that that power will be taken?</P>

      <P>Until I am criticised by you, A Chinn Comhairle, I am in order in asking for information arising out of an answer to a question, or possibly a change in the chairmanship is going to be proposed. A question was raised with regard to charges for short hauls as against the charges for long hauls.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce indicated that in his opinion the charges for short hauls have been increased over the proportion for long hauls.  I want to know will he take power to prevent the carrying companies making extraordinary charges for short hauls as compared with long hauls?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Customs Duties (Horse-drawn Vehicles) (Provisional Imposition) Order, 1932, which was made on the 5th day of May, 1932, by the Executive Council under Section 1 of the Customs Duties (Provisional Imposition) Act, 1931 (No. 38 of 1931), and a copy of which was laid on the table of Dáil Eireann on the 11th day of May, 1932, be approved.</P>
      <P>It gives me very great pleasure to move this motion not merely because the Order referred to gave to this industry protection which was long overdue, but also because, despite a considerable amount of criticism, the protection afforded has already produced results in excess of my own anticipations.  In consequence of the duties which we have imposed upon the imported bodies of motor cars, all car-manufacturing companies with a trade of any size in this country have made arrangements which will come into operation in the near future for assembling their bodies here.  I hope in some cases that the assembling of the chassis will also be carried out here.  We are proposing in the Financial Resolution on the Paper to modify the duty upon the chassis in the manner which I pointed out to the Dáil last week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>This Resolution is submitted under special procedure.  The Minister did not say anything in support of it.  I think it would be reasonable that the Minister should say something in defence of the Resolution and not submit it barely to the House without argument of any kind.  Applications were made to the former Government in connection with these horse-drawn vehicles, as in connection with other things.  Suggestions were made that a tax should be imposed on horse-drawn vehicles.  Amongst other reasons for declining to take action was the reason that we have here a Customs land frontier which must be crossed very frequently by horse-drawn vehicles.  A certain number of roads were approved for use by motor vehicles.  The majority of the roads are, however, unapproved roads and, in the past, vehicles not carrying dutiable articles could proceed along any of these unapproved roads.  Consequently, the farming community were not disturbed in their ordinary work by the existence of the Customs <Col N="1984" /> frontier.  No matter what concessions are given, I have no idea as to how this matter can work out.  There is going to be a very considerable amount of trouble and annoyance caused the people who have to cross the Border frequently in the course of their avocations. That is a very definite argument against the imposition of a duty on these vehicles.  It would be possible, on the other hand, to give concessions on such a wide scale that no difficulty might be raised.  It would, however, be difficult to give these concessions without making it very easily possible for large numbers of the dutiable vehicles to be brought across the frontier without payment of duty. That would have a very bad effect in many directions if it were allowed to happen.</P>
      <P>I think it is necessary that there should be regulations that will make it not easy to import vehicles without paying the duty.  Trouble will be raised.  Consequently, it seems to me some case is required to be made for the imposition of this duty.  It is imposed separately.  There is, perhaps, some idea of the number of people employed or who might be employed, and there is the question as to what effect, if any, it will have on costs.  Is it equally aimed at every sort of vehicle, or is it only intended to be ultimately charged on one sort of vehicle when we get the Finance Bill? It has happened more than once that a resolution was drawn in wider terms than it was actually intended to cover, and that exceptions of a great many sorts were made in the subsequent Bill.  I do submit to the House that the matter is not of such trivial importance that we ought have nothing more in defence of the resolution than the terms of it.  Without wanting to pursue cross-examination of the Minister, some more information should be offered to the House.</P>

      <P>This is one of the tariffs of which I am in favour, and one of the tariffs for which a good case can be made.  I would appeal to the Minister that he ought to make a case for it, and a case can be made for it. The Minister himself has made a case <Col N="1985" /> in this House for this tariff on more than one occasion.  If the Minister makes a case&mdash;and he can make a case for it&mdash;he will probably get the House to agree to it.  It is not treating the House fairly merely to introduce a tariff without giving any reason as to why it is imposed or without stating what benefits will flow from it.  I know that a good case can be made for this tariff, and the Minister, when in opposition, did make a good case for it.  I would suggest that, in fairness to the House and to the tariff itself, the Minister should make a case for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to explain to Deputies Morrissey and Blythe that I have no objection to making a case for this tariff, but I object strongly to undergoing a process of cross-examination, such a process of cross-examination as we have had in relation to other resolutions in the past few days.  It is unreasonable and unfair that I should be asked to submit to it.  So far as the points raised, I propose to answer them and to give the reason which actuated the Executive Council in coming to a decision to make the order.  In the case of horse-drawn vehicles a duty was imposed.  An industry had existed here which was highly efficient and which had a reputation throughout the whole world and which at one time sent its products to all countries in the world.  That industry in the past few years disappeared or was disappearing mainly because horse-drawn discarded vehicles were imported secondhand from England.  These discarded vehicles were being imported in large quantities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason why the duty was imposed by Provisional Order rather than by a Budget Resolution was that statements had appeared in newspapers to the effect that following a discussion between myself and the representatives of the Coach-Builders' Association it was the intention of the Government to impose this duty.  These statements resulted in a considerable speeding up of imports of secondhand vehicles with the result that the market was being flooded to such an extent <Col N="1986" /> that even the imposition of the tariff would not have benefited the industry for a considerable time in consequence of the supplies available in the country.  The coachbuilders went to the Tariff Commission with an application for a duty on horse-drawn vehicles as well as for a duty on motor and omnibus bodies.  The Deputies who have read the report of the Tariff Commission are aware that even though the majority of the Tariff Commission recommended that a duty should not be imposed, there was no opposition whatsoever to the application. The ability of the industry here to supply the requirements of the country in this class of cars and carts at prices lower than that at which new cars and carts could be brought from abroad was amply demonstrated.</P>
    <P>This duty is one which is going not merely to revive the industry but to revive the type of industry which we are most anxious to foster, that is, the handicraft industry which is operated in the rural areas; and although the demand for these horse-drawn vehicles is declining there is still a substantial market for them in this country.  For a long time to come there can be considerable employment given to those engaged.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blythe raised the point as to the difficulties that have been experienced on the Border or the land frontier consequent on these and other duties.  Under Section 5 of the order the duty does not apply to articles which are re-imported into Saorstát Eireann after exportation therefrom previous to the date of the order. That is to say that the article had not been imported previous to its exportation or that the article had been first imported prior to the date of the order, or that the article had been first imported on or after the 16th day of May, 1932, and the duty chargeable on this order had been duly paid.</P>
    <P>The Customs authorities are endeavouring to administer this and other duties along the Border in such a manner as to give the least possible inconvenience.  But no matter what we will do we will always come up against the fact that the Border itself <Col N="1987" /> is a curse.  The only way to remove the inconvenience is to remove the Border itself.  We are quite willing to consider that at any time.  It applies also to a large extent to certain Border towns which are undoubtedly badly hit by the duties we have imposed, where considerable hardship and dislocation would be caused by these duties.  There is only one solution that we can conceive and that is that we include these towns in our territory.  We are quite willing to enter into arrangements to that end. But so long as the Border remains and so long as it is the policy of the Government here to assist industry by tariffs these inconveniences will arise. But the Revenue Commissioners will do everything possible to make the inconveniences and difficulties rest as lightly as possible on the people concerned.  But they will remain there and there is no means of getting over them.</P>
    <P>I do not think there can be any considerable opposition to this Order &mdash;that is the Order relating to horse-drawn vehicles.  In the past the matter was discussed in the Dáil here. Perhaps it is not fair to say it was. A resolution following the reports of the Tariff Commission was tabled and proposed but it was not discussed. Deputies who were members of the late Dáil will remember that the late Government said nothing about the tariff on these vehicles.  We have been criticised for moving a Resolution without stating a case for it.  The late Government rejected the tariff without stating a case for its rejection.  Consequently the criticism which has been voiced in the last few minutes reacts upon those who uttered it, if they remember their own actions in the past. As I said before this duty should have been imposed long ago.  When the Free State Government came into existence it established a Fiscal Committee to determine its fiscal policy. The members of that Committee were free trade in outlook and they produced a free trade report.  But they made one exception.  They did say that the duties upon coach work generally could be modified so as to <Col N="1988" /> give that industry protection.  That action was not taken.</P>
    <P>The coachbuilders went to the Tariff Commission with an application.  The Tariff Commission took four years to consider it and by a majority report rejected the application.  Now the industry is getting the protection it asked for.  Considerable damage has been done.  The industry has declined substantially within the last few years.  Quite a number of skilled workers left this country for England, America and elsewhere but there are still some here.  As the members of the Tariff Commission indicated in their Report, when they were engaged in the inspection of coach-building factories in England they constantly came into contact with Irish skilled workers who were formerly employed in the industry here but who were forced to emigrate in consequence of the decline of the industry.  We hope that in the course of time large numbers of these workers will come back to their native country.</P>

      <P>The question I asked at the beginning still remains unanswered.  I would like to know what was the evidence on which the Minister was able to satisfy the Executive Council that the immediate imposition of a duty on horse-drawn vehicles was necessary in order to prevent an expected dumping of these vehicles.  I should have imagined that we would have got by way of reply a statement setting forth the imports of vehicles of the type to be taxed under this Order&mdash;imports for, say, six months prior to the imposition of the Order with a segregation of these imports so as to indicate the figures month by month in order to show whether or not there was an appreciable increase.  Are there such figures available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessary that there should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There should surely be some figures to show that the imposition of the duty was necessary in order to prevent an expected dumping of these vehicles.  That is a point that has not been met at all.  The Minister's <Col N="1989" /> objection to answering questions in the House is quite contrary to the ordinary procedure of the Dáil when in Committee.  Usually in Committee the procedure is such that one is not confined to the general type of speech customarily made on the Second or the Fifth Stages.  The debate on the Committee Stage as a rule gets more intimate, and Deputies are allowed to cover a very wide field.  At times the discussion assumes the more rapid form of cross-examination as the Minister called it.  Until the procedure is changed I assume that we have the right to indulge in what has been described by the Minister as cross-examination.</P>
      <P>The whole case made by the Minister in answer to certain questions takes the form of a reference to the Report of the Tariff Commission.  It has been pointed out that the customs duty now being imposed is to be applied to wheeled vehicles which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, are designed and primarily intended to be drawn by an animal or two or more animals and for the carriage of persons or goods or both persons and goods.  There is no question of secondhand vehicles there. What was the application originally made?  It related entirely to second-hand articles&mdash;used articles.  Paragraph 109 of the Tariff Commission Report, under the heading &ldquo;Vehicles for animal traction,&rdquo; after paying a tribute to the efficiency of the industry in the Free State, says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The application for a tariff on horse-drawn vehicles was stated to have been made not because the applicants were unable to compete with foreign competitors in the construction of new vehicles but in order that the importations of old governess cars and traps, which have been discarded by their owners in Great Britain, might be stopped.  The applicants stated that they are getting little or no work in the construction of new vehicles of this description and they asserted that it was imperative for the maintenance of efficiency in this section of the industry that the importations should be discontinued.  They also stated <Col N="1990" /> that many of those who now purchase secondhand vehicles would invest in new ones if a duty was imposed.</P>
    <P>The Commission reported:</P>
    <P>We are of opinion that the applicants are unduly sanguine in anticipating that a tariff would stimulate to any appreciable extent the demand for new governess cars and traps in this country because it seems to us that in a large number of cases those who buy the old imported vehicles are only just induced to do so by the very low prices at which they are offered.  These marginal purchasers will not be prepared to pay the higher prices required to secure new vehicles.</P>
    <P>Then they continue&mdash;and I think this is very relevant to the present imposition:</P>
    <P>The evidence which we obtained indicated that practically no new commercial horse-drawn vehicles are being imported and that, indeed, very few of them are being made either here or in England.</P>
    <P>Continuing further the Report states:</P>
    <P>The difficulties of the Saorstát coachbuilders are really due to the fact that the use of horse-drawn vehicles for commercial or private purposes has declined and is steadily declining.  Such work as is still available for the home coachbuilders in this branch of their industry is confined to the construction of farm carts, bread and laundry vans and a small number of governess cars and traps.  We do not consider that an appreciable increase in this work would result from the granting, in whole or in part, of concessions asked for in the application.</P>
    <P>There is one more reference in paragraph 133:</P>
    <P>The imposition of a tariff on horse-drawn vehicles would deprive many people, mostly of the small farmer class, of the opportunity of providing themselves with a form of private transport.  As we have already mentioned, the imported secondhand traps and governess cars are being purchased in most cases <Col N="1991" /> by persons who can just afford to do so at the low prices at which the vehicles are offered and these persons would scarcely be in a position to pay the extra prices necessary to secure new traps and cars built in the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>We get to this extraordinary position, that the original application was for a duty against imported secondhand vehicles, with special emphasis on imported secondhand traps and governess cars.  That was refused on what seemed to me to be very good grounds. Now we have an imposition on all wheeled vehicles, whether new or old. We get that under the plea that the imposition was necessary in order to prevent expected dumping.  We get no information as to where the dumping was apprehended&mdash;what country it was to come from.</P>
    <P>We have the statement made in the Tariff Commission Report that no new commercial horse-drawn vehicles are being imported and that, indeed, very few of them are being made either here or in England.  It is necessary to know where the dumping was expected to come from, and what articles would be dumped&mdash;secondhand or new. It is necessary to know whether they were horse-drawn vehicles, governess cars, pony traps and so on.</P>
    <P>There is another small point to which I would like to make reference. In paragraph 5 of the Order we are told:</P>
    <P>Any article liable to the duty imposed by this Order which is re-imported into Saorstát Eireann after exportation therefrom shall be exempt from the said duty if it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners either (a) that the article had not been imported previous to its exportation, or (b) that the article had been first imported prior to the 6th day of May, 1932, or (c) that the article had been first imported on or after the 6th day of May, 1932, and the duty imposed by this Order had been duly paid thereon.</P>
    <P>How can you re-import if you do not previously import?</P>
    <Col N="1992" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The evidence of dumping was submitted by me to the Executive Council and was accepted and an Order was made.  The evidence of dumping related mainly to second-hand cars.  As the Deputy stated, there is practically no importation of new cars of this description.  I think it is obvious to anybody who is aware of the circumstances that the various statements which appeared in the Press at that time regarding the intentions of the Executive Council were bound to lead to a considerable increase in the imports of these articles.  In consequence, we took action and stopped it.  As to what the Deputy said, I think that is the only point left to be answered.</P>
      <P>As far as the extract that was read from the Report of the Tariff Commission is concerned, I think there is a lot of nonsense in it.  When they say that the market for these cars in this country is of no magnitude and is likely to disappear in the near future, I think they are completely wrong.  There is a very considerable market for horse-drawn cars of one kind or another, and that market is likely, in the circumstances of this country, to persist here long after it has disappeared in other countries, and probably as long as many members of this Dáil are likely to be here.  Consequently, those skilled workers who have been all their lives in this industry and who have been losing their employment in consequence of these importations in recent years will again be secured in employment as long as they are likely to require it. I am satisfied that considerable benefit will be conferred upon the towns in which these industries exist as a result of the imposition of this duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must again comment on what the Minister has said. It seems to me that he has entirely taken away any shadow of legality for this Order.  I have to read the Preamble again.  &ldquo;Whereas it is enacted by Section 1&rdquo;&mdash;of a particular Act&mdash;&ldquo;that whenever the Executive Council is satisfied, on the report of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that the immediate imposition <Col N="1993" /> of a customs duty on any particular description of goods is necessary to prevent an expected dumping of goods of that description&rdquo;&mdash;that is the first part&mdash;&ldquo;arising out of financial or other events in other countries and occurring in circumstances which would occasion industrial injury...&rdquo; Leaving aside that dumping, if proved, would cause industrial injury here, there are two items that have got to be attended to, and legislation as legislation has got to be attended to.  Let me now take the summing up as given in the second Preamble: &ldquo;And whereas the Executive Council is satisfied, on the report of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that the immediate imposition of a customs duty on the articles mentioned&rdquo;&mdash;the articles mentioned are not second-hand; they are all articles, second-hand included&mdash;&ldquo;is necessary to prevent an expected dumping of those articles arising out of financial or other events.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What the Minister told us was that his report to the Executive Council had reference to second-hand articles, and that the dumping that is expected did not arise &ldquo;out of financial or other events in other countries&rdquo; but arose out of the indiscretion of the Executive Council in this country in letting their intentions about tariffs be known.  I do not see how this can be brought under the Order at all.  The imposition of a customs duty on the articles mentioned might justify&mdash;we will leave out the second part&mdash;an Order on second-hand goods of a particular type.  The Minister told us that the Executive Council accepted his report, and that his report had relation to these second-hand articles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can be corrected, but I understood the Minister to say that.  If that is what the Minister said, then I think the only customs duty warranted by that report would be a customs duty on second-hand goods in such categories as are called wheeled vehicles.  But the other thing surely goes to the root of the whole matter, that dumping was not such as arose from financial or other <Col N="1994" /> events in other countries, but was because&mdash;it was said yesterday on the Budget debate&mdash;the Executive Council simply had made it well known that the imposition of tariff duties was going to proceed apace.  Therefore, they are afraid of the consequences of their own indiscreet action or their own indiscretions prior to action.  I think it may arise at a later stage, even if this Order is passed, that a matter such as this may be tested in the Courts, that is to say, whether the Order, framed as it is, is, on the evidence that the Minister himself has stated, a sound Order.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy thinks that the legality of the Order can be questioned let him question it.  There are two points that I want to make clear.  One is that it is the Executive Council not the Deputy that has got to be satisfied; secondly, that the evidence of dumping which was available or at least the evidence of the possibility of dumping which was available related to all classes of coach-building work.  There was sufficient evidence available to satisfy the Executive Council that the Order should be made.  This Resolution is now submitted to the Dáil and the Dáil is asked to approve of the Order.</P>

      <P>I would like to know if the Minister took any steps to satisfy himself as to what the effects of this tariff will be on the agricultural community.  Is he aware that the largest user of the type of vehicle he proposes to tariff is the small farmer, and that he finds it not only difficult but almost impossible to provide himself at the present time with one of those light vehicles?  I am afraid that he will find it impossible to provide himself with any such vehicle in the very near future, especially when the effects of this tariff begin to operate. I think the Minister ought to consider seriously the burden that this tariff will place on the largest and possibly the poorest section of the community. The Minister evidently intends to leave nothing to these unfortunate people except the method of conveyance <Col N="1995" /> usually referred to as &ldquo;shank's mare.&rdquo;</P>

Will the invoiced price of the vehicle be taken as the value?  In the case of second-hand vehicles there is sometimes a dispute as to whether the invoice is a correct statement of the price paid.  Further, I would like to point out to the Minister that vehicles sometimes come into this country as gifts.  A man in England may discard a certain type of vehicle and send it as a gift to a friend in the Free State. I am anxious to know if such a gift would be subject to the tariff, and how the value of the article would be assessed in that case?</P>

The construction of ordinary farm carts is scarcely coach-building and, as far as I know, they can be made here perfectly well, and I do not know that this tariff will have any great effect.  It certainly will simplify procedure at the Border very much if ordinary unwheeled farm carts are entirely exempt from duty, so that no formalities of any sort would have to be complied with by those who have, for the purpose of getting to <Col N="1996" /> their own land, or to neighbouring towns, to cross and recross the Border.</P>

      <P>This is the Resolution which increases the duty on bodies of motor vehicles.  As I said originally, the imposition of this duty has brought results in a shorter period of time, and to a much greater extent than even I hoped when it was decided on.  Every motor manufacturer whose cars sell in any quantity in this country has made, or is making, arrangements to have the bodies assembled here, with one or two exceptions, and I have no doubt that these one or two firms which have not yet made arrangements will proceed to do so in the near future. In the case of some of the firms, arrangements are in contemplation to include not merely the assembling of the bodies but the chassis, and it is anticipated that very considerably increased employment will be given in centres in which the existing works are or in which new works will be established, and that as a result of the assembling of the bodies here, and the decision of the Executive Council to remit entirely the duty chargeable <Col N="1998" /> on the parts of bodies, motor cars will be cheaper when these Irish bodies are available than they are at present or have been in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Order was imposed for similar reasons as the Order in respect of horse-drawn vehicles.  In consequence of events, considerable importations of cars were anticipated and the figures which were available showed that, in fact, some increase had taken place. The Executive Council was satisfied on my report, that the Order should be made, and the Order was made.  The Dáil is now asked to approve of it with the modifications set out in the Resolution. These modifications relate to the following Resolution on the paper, and it would be, I think, much more convenient for the Dáil, if both were discussed together.  Number 4 on the paper is the Resolution designed to remit in part the duty chargeable on the chassis of a private car when imported as part of a completed car before 7th August next.  The decision to make that remission was arrived at when I was satisfied that all those concerned in the importation of motor cars here were going to co-operate fully with the Government in having a body building industry established.  I am not sure to what extent the remission is necessary.  In the case of some makes of cars, there is reason to hope that the Irish built bodies will be available before the date mentioned in this Resolution. However, we have decided upon it, and I have received from the firms engaged in the importation of motor cars a specific guarantee that they will not, during the period of the remission, import a larger number of cars than were imported by them in the same months last year.  The second part of the Resolution relates to the remission of duties heretofore chargeable on parts of bodies.  These parts were always subject, since the establishment of the Free State, to a duty of thirty-three and one-third per cent., with a two-thirds preferential rate. We are remitting that duty entirely, so that unassembled parts required in the construction of the body will come in here, free of duty, and it is in consequence of the fact that the assembly of the body should not cost any more <Col N="1999" /> in this country than in any other country, that we expect a reduction in the price of motor cars to take place.</P>
    <P>The main opposition to the application by the coach-builders was based on the impossibility of manufacturing in this country the steel stampings out of which these motor car bodies are built. In certain types of cars, for which there is a very large sale, the bodies are now constructed entirely of steel, and huge stamping plants are required to manufacture the parts.  It is not intended that we should have these parts manufactured here.  They will be imported free of duty, and assembled here, and by far the greater part of the labour involved in the making of a motor car body is involved in the assembly, and not in the making of the parts.  That labour will be engaged here rather than abroad.</P>
    <P>In respect of omnibuses and commercial cars of all descriptions, Deputies who have read the Tariff Commission's report, even though they recommended against the application, are aware that there was no opposition to the application, and that the Irish firms engaged in this industry were competent to supply better bodies for commercial cars and omnibuses than could be imported, at a price not exceeding that at which imported bodies were available, and it was anticipated, and admitted, that following a development of the industry, after the imposition of the tariff, prices here would tend downwards, so that we would be able to get these bodies at prices lower than we got them heretofore.  The competency of the industry to supply all our requirements in bodies of commercial cars and omnibuses has never been questioned.  Even the Society of Irish Motor Traders did not oppose the application for the duty in respect of this class of bodies.</P>
    <P>The third part of the Resolution relates to the change in the law which it was desired to effect, and which would have been made, irrespective of whether the duty was imposed or not.  It facilitates a person who comes into this country with the intention <Col N="2000" /> of residing here permanently, to import a motor car, previously used by him, free of duty.  I move the Resolution approving of the Variation Order, with the modifications suggested, and the Financial Resolution giving this remission in respect of the duty on the chassis.  The Financial Resolution is:</P>
    <P>(1)  That the duty imposed by Section 11 of the Finance Act, 1928 (No. 11 of 1928), as amended by subsequent enactments, shall be charged, levied, and paid on the following articles at the rate of an amount equal to fifteen per cent. of the value of the article in lieu of the rate mentioned in the said Section 11, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>On every motor car chassis which is imported for sale by a trader in motor cars on or after the 6th day of May, 1932, and before the 7th day of August, 1932, and is so imported as part of a complete motor car which is, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, at importation a new motor car constructed, designed, and intended for the carriage of persons otherwise than for reward.</P>
    <P>(2)  That the provisions of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall apply to the duty mentioned in the foregoing paragraph of this Resolution with the substitution of the expression &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; for the expression &ldquo;Great Britain and Ireland&rdquo; and as though the articles mentioned in that paragraph were included in the Second Schedule to that Act in the list of goods to which two-thirds of the full rate is made applicable as a preferential rate.</P>
    <P>(3)  That the duty imposed by Section 11 of the Finance Act, 1928 (No. 11 of 1928), as amended by subsequent enactments shall not be charged or levied on any of the following articles imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 6th day of May, 1932, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>Component parts and accessories of motor car bodies which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, do not constitute at importation an assembly or partial <Col N="2001" /> assembly of such parts or accessories.</P>
    <P>(4)  That whenever the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied in respect of a motor car which is being imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 6th day of May, 1932, and is in their opinion constructed and designed for the carriage of persons, that</P>
    <P>(a)  the importer of such motor car resides or intends to reside permanently in Saorstát Eireann, and</P>
    <P>(b)  such motor car had been previously used (otherwise than for the carriage of persons for reward) by the importer or by his family or household, and</P>
    <P>(c)  such motor car is being imported for the use (otherwise than for the carriage of persons for reward) in Saorstát Eireann by the importer or by his family or household,</P>
    <P>the Revenue Commissioners may, subject to compliance with such conditions as they may think fit to impose, permit such motor car to be imported without payment of the duty imposed by Section 11 of the Finance Act, 1928 (No. 11 of 1928), as amended by subsequent enactments, including amendments made under the Customs Duties (Provisional Imposition) Act, 1931 (No. 38 of 1931), in relation to the rates at which such duty is chargeable.</P>
    <P>(5)  That any duty which has been paid before the passing of this Resolution and is by virtue of this Resolution not chargeable shall be repaid.</P>
    <P>(6)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult at short notice like this to deal adequately with the resolution, and I am not going to pay much attention to the precise figures of the duties chargeable under the Resolution put before us.  I simply want to give a statement of the case as it was made in the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, when the application previously came before it, and to give, very <Col N="2002" /> briefly, what the position was, as they viewed it, and to base on that, inquiries for information hereafter, as to the respects in which the situation has changed in such a way as to warrant the imposition of these new duties.  The Commission more or less divided out their findings on bodies of motor vehicles into three sections.  In the first category they placed bus bodies, and in the second, bodies for private motor cars, and in the third category they made three divisions in respect of commercial vehicle bodies. They divided these into bodies made, more or less, to order, and of a special pattern, bodies that are made of standard type, of the closed standard type, and, thirdly, the open type of fitting, the open truck or lorry body.</P>
      <P>I have not yet considered these Orders, but I am assuming that all of these come within the scope of the duties&mdash;bus bodies, bodies for private cars, and all commercial vehicle bodies.  With regard to bus bodies, the situation is much as the Minister has stated, that by reason of the effective use of the powers given under the Road (Motor Vehicles) Act, the situation had come to the point that very few buses were being imported here, and that was stated in the Report. There was a further statement in the Report that a tendency which had shown itself was likely to develop, the tendency being that the big firms who were going to engage in motor transport of the bus type were likely to manufacture the bodies for these buses and not rely upon imported articles, as was previously done, and that that tendency would have been accelerated by the amalgamation of certain groups of companies even though there had been no element of coercion put upon them through the interpretation of the powers given under the Road (Motor Vehicles) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation therefore is, that as far as bus bodies are concerned, Irish firms were getting almost the entire work to be had on this type of manufacture. The manufacture was going out of the hands of ordinary private firms and getting more or less into the hands of the two or three big transport companies in the State, and that <Col N="2003" /> was a very desirable tendency.  In fact, it was stated several times by representatives of some of these outside firms who gave evidence that in the end they did not regard contracting for bus bodies as a very lucrative side of the business; that, in fact, they had to cut prices, and found that the cutting was so severe that in the end they had to get themselves into what amounted to a ring to decide upon the price which they should offer, and to stick to that price.  By reason of that, of course, the inevitable development took place that the big companies decided that they would build for themselves, and that is what they are doing.</P>
    <P>The only effect that this tariff can have on bus bodies is not to give more employment, but to put a weapon into the hands of the workers in the three big companies mentioned, either to get a greater return by reason of the tariff in the way of a demand for increased wages, or else to get that in another form by reason of decreased output when they are at work.  The only possible use there was of the free market or of the freedom of importation of bus bodies was that if and when workers did proceed to operate again they were in a closed market and there was always there the fact that when they pushed prices above a certain point the importation would again come in and you would have economic considerations applying once more.  So far as getting extra employment or benefit to the country is concerned, it was not there.  Obviously the Order is useless or nearly so.  As far as bodies built to a person's own design for commercial vehicles are concerned, the Irish firms were getting as much of that as there was in the country.  Whether they were efficient or not and up to the requirements of the people who gave the orders, I cannot say.  There was not a sufficient number of these orders being placed to allow any great conclusions to be drawn on the matter. The imposition of this tariff will not help the industry or workers in any regard in respect to this type of body.</P>
    <P>Similarly with regard to the open <Col N="2004" /> body truck or lorry, there was pretty good evidence that the Irish firms were able to supply the demand that there was in the country, and that the only thing which, apparently, was lacking was sound business push in the way of advertising what they could do, because it was clearly demonstrated before the Commission that where any of these firms had pushed themselves and made known what they could do, they got orders almost immediately.  Evidence was given by one firm, in particular, that they had abandoned the practice of getting open bodies anywhere except in this country.  I think these people even said that they had, by advertising for the manufacture of these bodies, increased the sales for them.  The only thing that was at the back of any lack of manufacturing in that item was, therefore, the lack of business push in the sense of advertising on the part of the people constructing them.</P>
    <P>There were two points upon which the majority of the Commission were quite definite in their report.  One was with regard to the provision of the standard closed body for commercial vehicles and the other with regard to the private car bodies.  The Commission were definitely of opinion that the Irish manufacturers could not produce at anything like the same price, if quality were taken into consideration, as those which could be brought in from outside, and they gave very excellent reasons for the belief that they asserted.  They did state, I think, that the ordinary output of even the smaller firms in England that catered for the standard closed body for vans amounted from 5,000 to 7,000 per annum, and that that seemed to be the smallest economic unit of manufacture possible.  When related to the needs of this country that one fact itself established that if these bodies were going to be made here, they were going to be made at an increased cost eventually to the purchaser, or else there was going to be some modification in the standard type which was not going to produce as good an article or an article that would wear as well.</P>
    <P>The same thing very nearly was <Col N="2005" /> said with regard to the bodies for private motor cars.  Most of these are standardised amongst the different makes.  The element of mass production entered into it more than anything else probably.  With regard to the saloon body for the private motor car, it is not a question of having the production of 5,000 to 7,000 in the year, but something which would amount to either double or treble that.  Unless there is going to be a disposition in the country to restrict the types of motor bodies, I do not think there is very much hope that the purchaser, hereafter, of a motor car is going to have, apart from the same variety of type, the same quality at anything like the same price as he had with the other.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, that was investigated to the point that about five years ago when, tentatively, a suggestion, I will not say an offer, was made to one firm as to whether it would not pay them to set up an assembling factory in this country if they got the entire monopoly of the business, and the answer was that it would not pay them.  If that be the position, what is the likelihood of increased charges if we are going to have the same choice as before and going to have all these companies coming in with assembling plants, which will cost a certain amount to put up in this country, and going to produce these so-called standardised bodies in this country?  It is going to mean a very big increase in the cost of the finished motor car here.  It is going to be more so in present circumstances than even when the Tariff Commission reported, because in these days it was not just quite clear whether or not the public fancy was going to turn away from the fabric body or to remain with it.  But the tendency does seem definitely to have gone away from the fabric body, and unless we are going to return to that in this country, and that will make the final cost still more heavy and expensive, there is no great possibility of having any assembling, unless it is just the last remnant of assemblage, done in this country.</P>
    <P>On that point one must turn to the <Col N="2006" /> other consideration of the employment to be given.  I have not the exact details of the calculation at the moment, but a calculation has been made.  If you take the elements of the work that go into the production of a motor car, the chassis and body, and even divide the body work, taking it as a separate item, amongst the proportion of the items afterwards assembled, I do not think that as much as 20 per cent. of the work goes into assembly.  And that is the extreme limit of what can be got here, and it will be got, as I say, under conditions of extreme expense and possibly hardship to the community.  Even if we are going to get a good amount of assembling done with increased expenditure to persons who buy, it is going to have the inevitable result that the price will rise in the country, that there will be a slackening off in the demand at the increased prices, that the slackening off in the demand will react on the previously increased prices leading to a still further increase of price.  Eventually we will get the price up to a point that even a tariff like this, which is meant to be crushing, will not have the desired effect, and despite the attempt made by your crushing import to get assembly in the country it may be more profitable for people still to import the finished car from outside.</P>
    <P>I am not speaking with any degree of accuracy on these Orders because I have not had time to relate one to the other.  It is also very difficult, seeing that we got this last financial Resolution as usual only in our hands this morning to make the relation.  This point with regard to the amount of cost can be very much more easily challenged at a later stage when it will be possible to take the report of the Commission in relation to the Orders, and to get at the items of prices and the percentage of work and so on.  Also we may be able to get some better information as to the possibility of even an assembly business being started in the country.  I again call attention to the Order and to the peculiar phrase in paragraph 5 re importation of a thing which had not been imported previous to its exportation. <Col N="2007" /> I would like again to have an answer to the question how you can re-import a thing which had not previously been imported.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last point raised by the Deputy I will not offer an opinion.  On the main case he made I have this to say that I am really astonished that a person who held the position of Minister for Industry and Commerce in this country for ten years should have such very little knowledge of one industry that is or should be one of the most important in the country.  I understand now why it was that when I came to the Dáil after the Tariff Commission Report was published with a resolution asking the Dáil to disagree with the Tariff Commission's Report, why, after having made a case for the resolution, the Minister as he then was, sat silent, and got the Dáil to vote down the resolution without offering any explanation for his action.  It is quite obvious now that it was because he had no case to make against the motion, if the only case that he could make against the tariff is the one he has voiced.  First of all, so far as the importation of omnibuses is concerned he is wrong in saying that there is no importation here.  Secondly, so far as commercial cars are concerned the Deputy is wrong in saying there is no importation of them&mdash;there is, as anybody who studies the trade and shipping statistics will find out for himself. Thirdly, as to the open truck, it is true that the completed open truck is not imported in quantities, but the only work which the importers do not do is to put the wooden box in at the back.  It comes in with the hood and cab and driver's seat and everything as part of the chassis.  This must stop. The work can and will be done here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the standard closed van is concerned it is quite true the Tariff Commission said this cannot be made at a competitive price here. The Tariff Commission were wrong. The Deputy will remember that when the Tariff Report was published one coachbuilder challenged him and the Tariff Commission and the Department <Col N="2008" /> of Industry and Commerce to submit him to the test in his own works under the supervision of officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce, and he would build one of these vans.  &ldquo;I shall build one of these vans, and complete it out of parts entirely in my own works, and you can take into account the cost of parts and the labour and allocate a certain portion of my overhead charges, and I will build that van at a price that will enable me to sell it at a reasonable profit and at the same price as the imported van is produced.  So that mass production methods can be solved.&rdquo;  The challenge was not accepted.  I have no doubt that the coachbuilders here are in a position to produce that class of body at a price that would enable them to sell at the catalogued price which the importers are offering here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>When the Minister spoke of the chassis, does he include the wings and the dashboard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the chassis includes the mud guards, in accordance with a definition adopted here.  As far as private cars are concerned there are several points on which the Deputy was wrong.  The first is as regards the labour costs in the assemblage of parts.  I refer him to Paragraph 16 of the Minority Report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>It is important to note that in some instances the value of labour in assembling of standard parts as compared with the value of labour in making those parts, is as four to one; in one case at least, the value of labour in assemblage runs to 90.5 per cent. of the total labour costs on the body of the vehicle.  In only one case of the many examples supplied to the Commission does the value of labour in the assemblage of the body of the motor car fall below 50 per cent. of the total labour costs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy doubts whether it is possible to get produced here, under the duty, bodies with the same quality, and at the price at which they can now be imported.  He is wrong, and I think that fact will be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the members of <Col N="2009" /> the Dáil before long.  There is no country in the world, to my knowledge, in which the motor body assembling industry does not exist except this.  We are now going to get it here, and the Irish coachbuilders and their skilled workers are as competent to do that class of work as the workers of any other country.</P>
    <P>It is true certain motor manufacturers have popularised the all-steel body and the manufacture of parts for all-steel bodies is not possible here, but it is equally true that the assembling of these parts is frequently done by those manufacturers in different works from those in which they are manufactured.  If the parts can be transported from the factory in which they are made to a factory in another part of the country in which they are assembled across the water, they can also be transported across the Irish Sea and assembled here and this is what we propose to do and manufacturers are making the necessary arrangements to do the work.  The cost of assemblage here should not be higher than anywhere else, and the fact that the duty will have been remitted upon the parts and that bodies assembled here will pay no duty whatever will enable them to be sold cheaper in competition with the imported bodies.  I am quite satisfied that if there is a single tariff which the Government has imposed which justified itself to the full in the shortest possible space of time this is that one.  Within three months we shall have reached a position in which no new motor car will be offered for sale in this country except with an Irish built body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say that within three months it will be possible to get a car assembled here at the same price that that car was imported?  If so, is he prepared to introduce a clause into the Finance Bill that will guarantee, provided we pass this Resolution, that such will be the case, in other words that he will see that what he has stated here will be carried out finally?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain with regard to the new paragraph <Col N="2010" /> 4 that is added, what is the object of excluding cars which are imported for the carriage of passengers otherwise than for reward? Apparently the idea is that the car must not be sold to a hirer.  I do not know how that could be guaranteed. I do not know how that could ever be arranged.  The importer can only get an assurance from the purchaser that he is not going to use the car for hire and if he were to get such an assurance, it would be probably worthless. Then again, a car may not be a week sold until it is resold.  I would like to know what is the idea behind this paragraph or am I right in assuming that it is intended that such cars as are brought under the special privilege cannot be used for hireage purposes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one other question that I should like to ask with regard to Imperial preference.  Up to the present, when it was proved that the complete car was manufactured within the British Commonwealth to the extent of 25 per cent., it became the subject of the privileges of Imperial preference.  Now there is going to be separate valuation for the car and chassis.  Will the Minister say, in estimating whether the car is entitled to the Imperial preference duty, that it will be the complete car that will be considered in future, as it has been in the past, or will the body now be valued separately from the chassis? <Col N="2011" /> Must the chassis be in itself the product of at least 25 per cent. of British Commonwealth labour and similarly must the body have the same proportion of British Commonwealth labour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Revenue Commissioners will administer the duty so as to regard the body and the chassis as two separate articles.  To get the preferential rate 25 per cent. would have to apply to the chassis and the body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing that this concession that has been given will operate only for a short period, I would ask the Minister to consult with the Revenue Commissioners with a view to the avoidance of that, because I think it would necessitate two separate invoices.  That would obviously be particularly troublesome to importers of American cars, because these things cannot be fixed up by a concessionaire in this country without consultation with the manufacturers, and by the time he had consulted with the manufacturers and arranged the routine of these separate invoices the period of the concession would have elapsed.  I would ask the Minister particularly to try to arrange that that would not be necessary.</P>

      <P>Section 2 of the Constitution Act, which Section 2 of this Bill proposes to repeal, is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The said Constitution shall be construed with reference to the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland set forth in the Second Schedule hereto annexed (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Scheduled Treaty&rdquo;) which are hereby given the force of law, and if any provision of the said Constitution or of any amendment thereof or of any law made thereunder is in any respect repugnant to any of the provisions of the Scheduled Treaty it shall, to the extent only of such repugnancy, be absolutely void and inoperative and the Parliament and the Executive Council of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) shall <Col N="2013" /> respectively pass such further legislation and do all such other things as may be necessary to implement the Scheduled Treaty.</P>
    <P>It is proposed under Section 2 of the Bill which we are discussing to repeal that section.  Before I go on with my amendment I want to call attention to all that that implies. Section 2 of the Constituent Act does a variety of things.  First of all it gives the force of law to the Scheduled Treaty and having done that, it says that the Constitution which is annexed to this particular piece of legislation shall be construed with reference to the Scheduled Treaty.  Thirdly, it says that if there is any provision either of the Constitution or any amendment thereof or of any law made thereunder that is repugnant to the Scheduled Treaty, it shall to the extent only of such repugnancy be void and inoperative. Then it says, fourthly, that it shall be the duty of the Parliament and the Executive Council to pass this further legislation and do all such other things as may be necessary to implement the Scheduled Treaty. The measure we have before us proposes to take away everything that is done by that section.  If, therefore, the section is passed as it stands, the only section which gave the force of law to the Scheduled Treaty will have disappeared.  Secondly, the only piece of legislation which said that the Constitution would have to be construed in reference to the Treaty will have disappeared and disappeared in its entirety.  Thirdly, the only piece of legislation that we have which called attention to the possibility of repugnancy as between the amendment of the Constitution or any law passed under it, and the Treaty will have disappeared.  And lastly, the only piece of legislation which imposes on the Parliament and the Executive of the Irish Free State in the new circumstances the duty of passing such further legislation and doing all such further things &ldquo;as may be necessary to implement the Scheduled Treaty,&rdquo; will have entirely disappeared.</P>
    <P>I propose to restrict the full force of the repeal of that section by adding <Col N="2014" /> to Section 2 of this Bill which we are discussing the words: &ldquo;so far as it has application to the amendment of the Constitution by the deletion of Article 17 thereof.&rdquo;  If those words were added the section would read:</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) Act, 1922 (No. 1 of 1922), is hereby repealed so far as it has application to the amendment of the Constitution by the deletion of Article 17 thereof.</P>
    <P>If that were accepted and passed the situation would then be that, in so far as anything in the Treaty gave to anything in the Constitution the force of law, or that anything in the Constitution gave to anything in the Treaty the force of law in relation to the single item only of the Oath, then the repeal could take place, but in so far as the repeal of Section 2 operated outside the single matter of the obligation to take the Oath, then the effect of the repeal would be stopped.</P>
    <P>I want to keep Section 2 of the Constitution Act for a variety of reasons. I want to keep it because it is the only thing which gives the force of law to the Treaty.  And in that connection, I want to refer to Article 18 of the Treaty itself.  It says: &ldquo;This instrument shall be submitted forthwith by His Majesty's Government for the approval of Parliament and by the Irish signatories to a meeting summoned for the purpose of the members elected to sit in the House of Commons of Southern Ireland, and if approved shall be ratified by the necessary legislation.&rdquo; The last phrase is important. I do not know where the necessary legislation exists in this State by an Act of the Parliament of the State if it is not Section 2 of the Constitution Act.  And if Section 2 of the Constitution Act is repealed as far as giving the force of law to the Treaty, I do not know how far it can be argued that Article 18 of the Treaty has been carried out.  Article 18 of the Treaty clearly demands, in the last words, that the Treaty if approved of&mdash; and it was approved of&mdash;should be ratified by the necessary legislation; and I should like to have information on <Col N="2015" /> the point as to where is the necessary ratifying legislation required by Article 18 of the Treaty, if the repeal of Sec tion 2 of the Constitution Act is carried out as effectively as is proposed in the original measure.  That is the first thing.</P>
    <P>The second thing is this: When the President was moving the second reading of this Bill, he introduced his arguments in this way:</P>
    <P>I move:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Constitution (Removal of Oath) Bill, 1932, be now read a second time.&rdquo;  Before the last election there was widely published throughout the area of the Free State a manifesto to the electors, in which the Fianna Fáil Party put forward in very explicit terms, the items of the programme which, if elected in a majority, they would endeavour to put into operation.</P>
    <P>The first statement there is that the Fianna Fáil Party had put forward a programme in very explicit terms; and the man who formulated that policy gave us a quotation showing what were the explicit terms.  The next sentence in his speech is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The first item on that programme was as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;To remove the Article of the Constitution which makes the signing of the Oath of Allegiance obligatory on members entering the Dáil.&rdquo;  The following note was added:&mdash;&ldquo;This Article is not required by the Treaty.  It stands in the way of national unity and of willing obedience to law. Government by coercion is the result.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And then the person who formulated that policy, and stated that it had been expressed in very explicit terms, gave us, presumably, the terms in which that policy had been formulated.  He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>This Bill, the Second Reading of which I am proposing to the House, is intended to give effect to that first item on the programme.</P>
    <P>And then he continued, and it is worth while nothing what the continuation was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2016" /> The programme as a whole might be divided roughly into two parts, the part which had relation to international matters, the external relations of the State, and the part that had reference directly to domestic matters.  In order that there might not be in the minds of the electors any misunderstanding as to the extent of the mandate we were seeking, the following paragraph was put into the manifesto:&mdash;&ldquo;We pledge ourselves that if elected in a majority we shall not, in the field of international relations, exceed the mandate here asked for without again consulting the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are two pledges there.  They say that if elected they will not exceed the mandate asked for.  And the statement of the President who, as I say, is the man who formulated this policy, is that a manifesto had been put forward indicating the mandate which the Fianna Fáil Party looked to get. It was framed in very explicit terms, and it was that they were to remove the Article of the Constitution which makes the signing of the Oath of Allegiance obligatory on members entering the Dáil.  Where are the explicit terms relating to anything more than the removal of Article 17 of the Constitution?  The President himself stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>To remove the Article of the Constitution which makes the signing of the Oath of Allegiance obligatory on members entering the Dáil.</P>
    <P>That was followed by the pledge:&mdash;</P>
    <P>We pledge ourselves that if elected in a majority we shall not in the field of international relations exceed the mandate here asked for without again consulting the people.</P>
    <P>Article 17 was the Article aimed at by that specific pledge, and they stated that that mandate would not be exceeded without a further expression of opinion from the people.  And yet we are asked to pass a Bill which contains Section 2.  Section 2 of the Bill repeals Section 2 of the Constitution Act, and Section 2 of the Constitution Act gives the force of law to the Treaty, makes the Treaty override the Constitution, <Col N="2017" /> and carries out Article 18 of the Treaty, and requires that in case of repugnancy the Executive Council shall take immediate steps to repair the damage that has been done.  Relate that only to the mandate which was asked for and which the President stated in the most explicit terms, and where does the President derive his mandate for doing anything more than removing the Article of the Constitution which makes the signing of the Oath of Allegiance obligatory on members entering the Dáil?</P>
    <P>I move my amendment as very much the second or even the third best thing. I prefer not to interfere with the Oath in any way whatever.  I prefer to abide by the plain meaning of Article 4 of the Treaty, the non-mandatory character of which has not yet been argued, the mandatory character of which has not been controverted in any way.  I prefer to abide by the pledges given by the setting of the signatures to that Treaty, by approval of that Treaty by the Dáil which considered it, and by the passing of the legislation which afterwards took place in accordance with Article 18.  I moved, as the second best thing, in doing that, that we would keep in the Constitution the exact formula in the Treaty and that was defeated.  I now move forward to the third best thing&mdash;that if there is going to be any interference with the Treaty as a document, if there is going to be any interference with the position which the President found, the Treaty ratified by necessary legislation, that piece of legislation making the Treaty a superior document to the Constitution and leaving the Constitution necessarily to be read in subordination to the Treaty&mdash;I prefer to leave that as it is&mdash;but if it is to be changed, I want to have the change confined to the narrowest possible point and brought as near as possible to the extension of the mandate which the President said he got from the people of this country.</P>
    <P>In other words, if there is going to be any interference with the Treaty as a document having legal force in this country, it should only be for the purpose of this Act in relation to the deletion of Article 17 of the Constitution. I have heard no reason, so far, <Col N="2018" /> as to why a person who said he got a mandate only for the removal of an Article of the Constitution and who said afterwards that he had pledged himself not to exceed that mandate without again consulting the people, should endeavour to interfere with the whole Treaty document even though he may use the phrase that he is only taking it away from a particular sphere.  He has not explained, when it is taken away from that sphere, where it remains.  He has not explained in his legislation the conscience which it can be definitely argued lies behind the removal of the Treaty from the Constitution and from law in this country in a Bill which is described in the Long Title as &ldquo;an Act to remove the obligation now imposed by law on members of the Oireachtas and Ministers who are not members of the Executive Council to take an Oath, and for that purpose to amend the Constitution and also the Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) Act, 1922.  I argue &mdash;I have had no demonstration to the contrary&mdash;that when people, describing themselves as setting out to remove an obligation now imposed by law, bring into that piece of legislation an amendment of the constituent Act of this State and describe it as being necessary for the purpose of removing an obligation imposed by law, they definitely argue by that that the Treaty imposes an obligation to take an Oath &mdash;a contention which they have never upheld before, but which they admit by implication is there.</P>
    <P>I could make very damaging statements against this amendment of mine.  I am prepared to have it argued that to a certain extent it is not a wise amendment, because if the Treaty is to be broken in one part, it does not to any great degree satisfy the other party to the contract that you only break it in one part instead of being prepared to wipe it out altogether. I do not see how it is going to satisfy the honour of honourable people if you, when you set out to break the thing, restrict the breach of it to what you want immediately, and do not bring into your scope what you feel you will require eventually when <Col N="2019" /> you come to ask the people for a further mandate.</P>
    <P>I expressed myself as only satisfied with this amendment as the third best thing.  The preferable thing was to keep the Treaty and our obligations under it.  The second preferable thing was, if there was doubt as to what a phrase in the Treaty meant, to let it be incorporated in the municipal law and let us have the advantage of a trial before a favourable tribunal as to what that phrase meant.  When these two things are taken away, I say it is going to be a test of the bona fides of the people who move this measure to see if they accept the limitation of the removal of the Treaty from the municipal law only to the extent required to enable them to do freely this particular breach of honour&mdash;the thing particularised in relation to the Oath of Allegiance.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the analogy with other legislation which was said to be planned in relation to the Privy Council is relevant on this amendment or whether it would be better spoken of on the general section.  Is that relevant to this discussion, A Chinn Comhairle?</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the amendment. It is intended to make appear that there are in our proposals the implications which Deputy McGilligan would like to have it thought were in them.  The difference between our attitude and the attitude of the Deputies opposite is that we say that what we are doing we are entitled to do under the Treaty itself.  So far from the position being what Deputy McGilligan would like to represent it as being&mdash;that it has not been proven that the taking of the Oath is not man datory&mdash;I contend that what has not been proven is that it is mandatory. I have given in full on more than one occasion during these debates the reasoning by which, to my mind, it is evident the taking of the Oath is not <Col N="2020" /> obligatory unless we, by our domestic legislation, choose to make it obligatory. It can only be obligatory if you contend that Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Britain itself could not remove their Parliamentary oaths if they chose to remove them.  Does Deputy McGilligan hold that we cannot do what Canada can do, what Britain can do, what South Africa can do, and what any one of the other States of the British Commonwealth can do, if they have a mind, with regard to the obligations or tests imposed upon those entering their Parliaments?  If he does not hold that, are we supposed to occupy some position of inferiority? The question is: Are we on a level with those countries or are we not? If we are on a level with them, as I contend we are, then the constitutional status of Canada or Australia will permit them to remove these oaths if they choose.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no use in arguing with Deputy O'Sullivan on this matter because he has probably given no attention to it.  His irrelevant question shows that.  By and under the terms of the Treaty, we have advanced to-day to the same constitutional status that Canada and Australia occupy.  We have either done that or we have not.  Which is it?  Are the people who told us that we have advanced going to deny it for a political purpose?  Was it a lie all the time?  It is either the truth or a lie.  If it is the truth we have the right to do exactly what we propose to do here, what they can do in Canada or Australia if for their own internal reasons they think it wise to do it.  We have either that status in full with all that it implies in Articles 1, 2, 3 and 4&mdash;but particularly in Articles 1 and 2&mdash;or we have not. We have co-equality or we have not. If we are co-equal we are doing what they can do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one will deny for a moment that, if they chose, Canada and Australia could do this.  We have advanced step by step.  That is the contention of those who took and supported the Treaty. <Col N="2021" /> It is lawful and constitutionally proper for us to do anything they can do.  Nothing in this Treaty restricts our status in that respect. Article 4 does not stand by itself. The words clearly indicate that it was never intended to stand by itself.  It does not.  Its whole force and the very form of the words indicate that it was meant to supplement an implication in Article 2 and to provide here a difference in the form of oath from that taken in Canada.  The more you study the question the more you are satisfied that that is so.  If Canada can remove the oath so can we.  That is our contention.  We want to remove it.  It is to our interests to remove it.  The people of the Twenty-Six Counties have stated that they want to remove it and we are giving effect to their will as we have a right to do.  We propose to do this within the terms of the mandate I read in this House which was asked from the people.  We are doing it without any violation whatever of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan points to my statement about removing Article 17. We are going to remove that Article from the Constitution.  That is the part that has immediate reference to this whole question.  We are taking the occasion to do another thing which is equally within our right, without in any way infringing the terms of the Treaty, and that is to put the Treaty where those who considered the whole question after the Treaty was brought over, wished to put it originally, namely, as any other treaty between two countries would be put, not in a position of dominance over domestic legislation, and not in a position where our domestic courts would have to take cognisance of it with regard to any other laws that might be passed and to that extent limiting the competency of the Oireachtas.  The Constitutional Committee and Sub-Committees considered the question.  There were men on the Committee who were thought good enough to be put into the highest legal positions in the State, and the attitude they took up is revealed clearly from the documents available and from the Constitution that was <Col N="2022" /> sent over.  Their attitude was that the proper position for a treaty was the position that it would occupy in other countries and between other States. What position do treaties usually occupy?  Are they made part of municipal law as a rule?  Not at all.  They are put into the proper domain, the international domain.  We propose to remove this from the domestic domain and to put it into its proper place in the international domain.  We are giving effect to something that the Committee at that time thought was right.  Perhaps at that time the status not having been recognised, and the co-equality not having been recognised to the extent that it is recognised to-day, they thought they could not do it.  We can do it.  I say it is the test whether we have the co-equality that we proclaim or not.  We shall know what result there will be when this is passed into law.  If there is any interference or protest we shall know whether we have, in fact, that co-equality which we are supposed to have.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to remove this Article which makes the taking of a Parliamentary Test Oath necessary by representatives of the people coming here.  But the secondary point is to put the Treaty in its proper place.  I have said that the first thing can be done without any violation of the Treaty, in virtue of the position which we are supposed to occupy constitutionally.  The other thing can also be done in virtue of the same status and rights.  It would not be right that a judge in this country should be put in a position in which he would have to veto domestic legislation.  That is not the place where the Treaty ought to be put.  Its proper domain is in the domain of international law.  Deputy McGilligan blandly tells us to get the advantage of a favourable court. What advantage would it be to us? Would not the very fact that it would be said to be a favourable court be sufficient to damn anything that would emerge from it, any favourable judgment that came from it?  At present, we are in this unfortunate position that as long as this question remains as it is, if we get a judgment <Col N="2023" /> from those courts in our favour, it will not be admitted by the opposite Party as of any real value and it will be said that it was a prejudiced and a biassed judgment.  If judgment was against us, by any chance, what would be the position?  Judges are not all geniuses and might easily be wrong in their views.  They might be wrong-minded.  There is no doubt about that.  Supposing, by chance or otherwise, there was a judge whose view was not the proper and the right view, who got some twist in his judgment with regard to the subject and that judgment was given against you where would you be?  If it was right it would be said to be biassed.  If it was wrong, it would not matter what you said; it would be met with &ldquo;Oh, even in your own courts judgment has been given against you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why should we allow ourselves to remain in such an altogether prejudicial position?  If we are not fools we will not remain in it, and we propose to do what is done in every country in the world with the exception of one country, where treaties like that are put into part of the fundamental law. I only know of that one exception. We did not do it in regard to other treaties.  If the claim that is made by Deputies on the opposite benches that this was a Treaty entered into between two sovereign parties, then they must agree to what we propose and they cannot complain that we are putting that Treaty into the proper place it ought to occupy, namely, removing it from the domain of municipal law and putting it into the international domain.</P>
    <P>Supposing that we were in the position in which we were going to admit that appeals to the Privy Council were right, would we be satisfied, for example, that there should be a case taken? I am not saying it is so, I am only using it to show what might happen. Supposing in a question like this that appeals to the Privy Council were admitted and that it was not maintained definitely that the Privy Council had no right to judge as a Supreme Court after our courts had <Col N="2024" /> given their judgment?  Suppose the position remained in which the Privy Council was the supreme authority, would we be satisfied, after the last election, that the final judgment on matters of the Treaty was to be left to a British court?  No, we would not. It is a matter for interpretation by an international court in the proper sense or between the parties concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Treaty is to be out of our domestic law in its proper place as a matter to be considered between the parties concerned.  Look at the position you would have been in if appeals to the Privy Council were to be considered or admitted.  Is it not clear to everybody who has got the interests of this country at heart that the freedom of this country, or of this part of the country, that we should insist that that Treaty be put into its proper place and that matters that are international matters be put into the international domain and removed altogether from the jurisdiction of our municipal or domestic courts? Now that is all that is proposed to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have shown by pointing out that it is a matter of status that we are not infringing the Treaty.  The other side are talking about honour and the rest of it, and they maintain without any proof whatever that we are breaking the Treaty.  That was the burthen of Deputy McGilligan's whole speech, that we were breaking the Treaty, that our honour was involved, and that we ought to do what decent people would do and all the rest of it.  But the Deputy has not shown where we in this Bill are breaking the Treaty. Those who will break that Treaty are those who will deny the advance that is contained in it, and that we are entitled to according to Article 2.  We <Col N="2025" /> are told that there are several things involved in the section of the Constitution Act that we are proposing to repeal.  I have pointed out why it is we do not want to have our domestic courts involved in interpreting this Treaty.  We do not want to have our courts deciding whether or not certain law which we may pass is or is not repugnant to it.  That is not a matter for our courts.</P>
    <P>The only point in Deputy McGilligan's speech worth paying any attention to is his question: &ldquo;Where does it get the force of law?&rdquo;  If you remove this particular section, where do you get the force of law?  What legislation gives the Articles of the Treaty the force of law at all if you remove this? That is the only point that I think is worth considering for a moment, and I will admit it is worth considering.  A great deal will depend upon the point of view from which you approach this Treaty whether it is or is not necessary. Deputy McGilligan refers us to Article 18 of the Treaty itself.  He points out that the last line of that Article states that the Treaty &ldquo;if approved shall be ratified by the necessary legislation.&rdquo;  The Article reads: &ldquo;This instrument shall be submitted forthwith by His Majesty's Government for the approval of Parliament and by the Irish signatories to a meeting summoned for the purpose of the members elected to sit in the House of Commons of Southern Ireland, and if approved shall be ratified by the necessary legislation.&rdquo;  What is meant there by necessary legislation? &ldquo;Ratified by the necessary legislation,&rdquo; what is that?  I have said everything depends upon the way you view this instrument.  I have my own view of it.  I am not going to say whether my view is fundamentally the right view or not.  I have tried to argue this as I might expect those on the opposite benches to argue it, because it is those on the opposite benches who stood for it and put it and tried to advance it so as to make the most out of it according to themselves at any rate.</P>
    <P>According to the mandate which we have got, I deem it my duty to try to do the utmost following along that line, <Col N="2026" /> which is the only line I am permitted to follow at the moment, and I have tried as far as it is possible for me to deal with it on the widest lines in accordance with the interpretation which they themselves chose to put upon it.  There are three ways of regarding this Treaty.  There is the view of it that it is an international instrument on all-fours with any other international document.  That is the basis that I tried to argue this case upon. But I am quite willing to admit that something may be said on that particular basis for the contention that this section of the Act is the particular section that gives the force of law to the Treaty.  That would be referred to as the ratifying legislation.  &ldquo;Shall be ratified by the necessary legislation.&rdquo; It is an extraordinary thing that there is no mention in the Act itself that it is the ratifying legislation called for in the Treaty, no mention whatever of it.</P>
    <P>There is on that basis a certain plausible case that can be made for the necessity of leaving something which will give the force of law using these words &ldquo;which would give or purport to give the force of law to the Articles of Agreement.&rdquo;  That is again on the ground that this is strictly in the full sense an international instrument.  But I would remind the House that the British have been always trying to deny that.  On every possible occasion they have striven to deny it.  The particular advantage that is to be gained for this country by holding it as such under present circumstances is not quite clear to me.</P>

That was what they said, and they said it was not of the type that was being covered by the particular agreement referred to.  They did not want it to be registered. At the time they objected to its being registered and regarded as a treaty in the full international sense.</P>

      <P>We will get them in a very short time, and I agree they should be got.  If the Deputy looks the matter up I think he will find that at the very start there was quibbling by the British in regard to the Articles of Agreement.  When the Treaty was being discussed in the British House of Commons the same quibbling took place.  Finally they regarded it as something <i>sui generis.</i>  The second view one could take of the Treaty is that whilst being an international document in a certain sense it is not so in the full international sense.  The third view of the Treaty is the one the British have all the time tried to force as their view.  Remember that we are in argument at the present time with the British, and there is no reason why, if they are putting up a case, we cannot argue it if necessary.  There is no reason why we cannot ask them: &ldquo;What is your view of it?&rdquo; and see what they are going to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the case the British have made up to the present?  They are claiming that we are breaking this agreement.  According to their own case, if you judge the matter upon that, the force of law is given by quite a <Col N="2029" /> different Act altogether from this Act. They would probably contend, if they were driven to it, that the legislation referred to here was not the legislation passed by Dáil Eireann, was not legislation by the only body that could at the time ratify it as a legal instrument. What they want to confine it to is their own legislation.  I would like to hear what the British have to say on that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will have a little patience I will deal with that matter presently.  As I said at the start, the only case in which I can understand anybody having an objection to removing Article 2 is where a person holds that the Treaty is a full international document.  I am going to come back to that.  We are arguing with the British at the present time.  It is the British who are putting up this claim.  They are putting it up now because it will suit their purpose to get it from a point of view which hitherto they have been very careful not to accept.</P>
      <P>There are three ways of regarding this Treaty and there is a difference of opinion about them.  There is the way of regarding it as an international instrument.  There is the way of regarding it as <i>sui generis,</i> a sort of document of a peculiar character that could not be classified as a full international instrument. Then there is the third way which is the way the British have been trying to get the world to believe, and that is to regard it as purely British domestic legislation.  It is not now that we looked at this for the first time.  If anybody cares to look at the Articles of Agreement he will observe they were very carefully drafted so as to be consistent with that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not see anything about concurrent legislation.  It is legislation open to be interpreted as you please, just the same as that other phrase that is left open: &ldquo;those who were elected to sit in the House of Commons of Southern Ireland.&rdquo;  They do not speak of a composite body of so many persons in order again that it might be ambiguous and be interpreted as each body might interpret it for its own political or other ends.  We are dealing with a document quite full of these ambiguities.  We are proposing to treat that document in the way that is right for us to treat it, with a full knowledge of the status that we are supposed to have at the moment. If we cannot do this thing, then that is absolute proof that we have not got any status.  If we are not prepared to assert our right to it, then we <Col N="2031" /> are not worthy of the right supposed to be in it.</P>
    <P>There are three ways of looking at the Treaty&mdash;that it is a Treaty in the full international sense, that it is a peculiar sort of agreement, unique in itself, and that it is a bit of purely domestic British legislation.  The British have, all the time, tried to regard it as such.  They try to have it the other way because it seems to suit their purpose, and because it is going to be regarded as a barrier to our advance. We are supposed to be held back from attaining to the status and the rights that Canada, Australia and New Zealand have.  Are we going to permit that?  Are we going to see where we stand?  We are going to do this and we have the right to do it.</P>
    <P>Let us come back to the point and ask ourselves if it is the Constitution Act that forms the legislation here which gave ratification to the Treaty. Is anybody going to tell us that if an instrument was ratified ten years ago, and has been acted upon since&mdash;if it was ratified by the necessary Act at the time&mdash;the removal from the Statute Book of some particular form of ratification is going to be regarded as a revocation or a breaking of the Treaty?  Nothing of the kind has been suggested.  It is a well-admitted principle, and I suggest to Deputy O'Sullivan, before he makes mistakes, he should have the authority looked up&mdash;it is a well-recognised rule, that the removal of specific ratification of that sort does not, in itself, invalidate the document or remove it from being a binding document in so far as the force of law is concerned.  It has the force of law in so far as we want it to have the force of law as a binding document between the two countries, not as an overriding law here, but as a law between two nations.</P>
    <P>
      <i>[An Leas-Cheann Comhairle took the Chair.]</i>
    </P>
    <P>We are doing nothing here to remove that.  The fact that we change that Article is not going to change it. Deputy McGilligan said on a previous <Col N="2032" /> occasion that we are constantly implementing treaties.  Yes, we have implemented them.  When we come to deal with Deputy Finlay's amendment later we will have an example of that implementation.  We have no objection to anything of that kind, but we have a very strong objection to the case we have here of a law overriding and vetoing the powers of this Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I say that the municipal courts are not the places to try out those issues between us and Britain.  That is not where they ought to be tried.  It is prejudicial to our interest that they should be tried here, because a successful verdict would not be of any value to us, whereas, on the other hand, a verdict against us would be almost fatal.  Consequently, I ask the House to reject this amendment.  Its only purpose is to try to put us in the position that we refuse to occupy, in the position in which we are confident, so to speak, our own courts would give judgment against us.  That is the clear implication of the amendment.  This is a precautionary measure simply in so far as the Oath itself is concerned.  It is a wise measure, but for entirely different reasons.  Apart from being a precautionary measure, in this case it is a wise measure, because it is clearly wrong that our domestic courts here should pass a veto on Acts of the legislature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have just listened to what, I think, was a Fifth Reading speech.  Certainly, if I may suggest it, the speech had precious little to do with the amendment before the House.  Most of the remarks of the President were relevant either to a Second Reading speech or to a Fifth Stage speech, but certainly they had got nothing whatsoever to do with the amendment now before the House.  I think the President proved quite clearly that his reason for asking the House to reject the amendment proposed by Deputy McGilligan is that he intends to go beyond the mandate that he explained to this House that he had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying <Col N="2033" /> that followed from the President's speech.  The President admitted that for the removal of the Oath&mdash;for which he did seek a mandate from the people&mdash;that this clause, to the extent in which it now stands in the Bill, was not necessary, and that it was for another reason altogether he was asking the House to reject this amendment. The amendment proposed by Deputy McGilligan would have kept this Bill within the four walls of the mandate that the President said he sought and got from the people, but the President would not accept it. Why?  There is no good in Deputies on the opposite benches or Deputies in any part of the House shutting their eyes to this: that the reason is because the President wants to go beyond that mandate.  This opens the way for future inroads on the Treaty.  Is not that the whole position?  Is not that really what the President wants?  Why else reject this particular amendment?</P>
      <P>The President confesses himself that, so far as the Oath is concerned, the amendment will give him precisely what he wants. Why, then, reject the amendment? Having tried to show that this Bill proposes to carry out the terms of the mandate that he holds he got from the country, he then went on to add: &ldquo;But we propose to do something else, to do something in addition to that.&rdquo; What does he propose to do?  He proposes to leave the way open so that when he is bursting an international treaty he will at least have the mere trappings of legality about it; and he thinks that he can break an international instrument and do so with impunity.  Perhaps so, but the one thing he likes to have at his back is some legalistic kind of cover for doing illegal acts.  He wants a kind of legal cover for himself.  What I mean is that for acts that are illegal and wrong in their essence he wants legal cover. That is why he wants to reject this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will have another opportunity of saying something about the general purposes of this Bill, but, not following the example of the President, I will now confine myself to this particular amendment.  Supposing his arguments <Col N="2034" /> were true, supposing that the status argument that he brings forward has any foundation for it, is there not one thing quite clear, that he brings that status argument to bear on clause 4 because he holds that we have advanced in status under the first clause of the Treaty?  If that is true, then his status argument must apply with a great deal more force to Articles 1, 2 and 3 than they apply to Article 4. They must apply, for instance, to the Article dealing with the relation to the Crown.  If the President's argument is true, there is quite as much dead timber, to use his own favourite phrase, about Article 2 of the Treaty, about the Article that settles our relation with the Crown, as there is about Article 4, which, from his point of view, is dead timber.  But what does the President want to do?  He wants the way open so that he thinks he can legally break this particular instrument&mdash;the Treaty.  He wants to argue in the coming period: &ldquo;We can do it legally now; we can remove the Crown, and in doing so we are not going outside the realm of the law; we are doing it legally; we are not acting in a revolutionary manner.&rdquo;&ldquo;We can deal with the Crown,&rdquo; because this, as he himself has made it quite clear, not to this House but to the people, is the next step.  I suppose he will tell us that as we had not a static position in 1921 or 1922, and as we have advanced so much, &ldquo;You can also remove the Crown and yet you are not breaking the Treaty.&rdquo;  That would be a stronger and certainly would be a more valid argument than the argument he put forward so far as the Oath is concerned.</P>
    <P>I was surprised that the President, the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, of the ultra nationalist Party in this House, did not come out before and base the Irish case on the fact that our status was merely dependent on an Act of Westminster.  He tries to get out of it and says that he will not do that.  That is only an argument <i>ad hominem</i> against the British, but for the sake of that argument <i>ad hominem</i> he is quite prepared to undermine our whole international <Col N="2035" /> status.  That is the patriotism that we may expect from the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>You seem to be very glad to get it out, somehow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because I know the extraordinary length to which the President will go.  He will sacrifice nationality, and everything else, if he can only say &ldquo;I was right.&rdquo;  What is this whole thing? Why is he doing this?  So that if he fails&mdash;it does not matter what happens the country if there are reprisals&mdash;he can say &ldquo;I was right and the Nation was wrong in accepting the Treaty.&rdquo; And now, for that particular reason, we have the Leader of this House, the leader of the extreme national section, self-styled, in this country, basing our whole position on an Act of the British Parliament and not on the Treaty.  That is a situation that this side of the House never accepted, during the ten years in which they were the Government of the country. It remains for that leader of the Irish people, that head of the Executive Council, to put forward that argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who have followed his extraordinary arguments, again and again, will certainly not be surprised at anything he has done, and I was only surprised, not that he thought that, but that he gave expression to it.  After all, I do suggest to those who do value the Treaty in any way whatever, that there is an important principle involved in this particular amendment. You cannot imagine you are pro-Treaty, and then be responsible for the rushing through this House of this Bill; you cannot be pro-Treaty and throw the responsibility on to somebody else.  The responsibility is on the shoulders of every person who votes for this Bill, and equally, the responsibility will be on those who vote against this amendment.  If they want to say that removing the Oath from this Constitution is not a breach of the Treaty, it is a matter we can discuss afterwards.  With that particular attitude we can deal on the next stage, but, at least, there is the <Col N="2036" /> opportunity here for confining the operation of this Bill to the mandate that it was alleged was got from the people.  There is the &ldquo;mandate.&rdquo; Why has he gone beyond that?  Because there is an intention to leave the way open to other, and even more serious, violations of the Treaty.  That is the only purpose of this section, and let the House be quite clear about it.</P>
    <P>We have talk about putting the Treaty in its proper place.  There are certain Articles in this Treaty, and it is quite clear that they must have an influence on our Constitution, or else they are inoperative.  No legal quibbling of any kind, and no legal argumentation will get over that fact. There are these Articles in the Treaty, and remember, they are the main Articles in the Treaty in many respects; they are the essence of the Treaty and they are the Articles&mdash; because the Treaty was an effort to find a way of co-operation between this country and Great Britain and the other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations&mdash;that determine that relation, and they are the essence of the Treaty.  Now, the effort is to be made to do away with these Articles, to break them, and this is simply opening the door to that particular goal. As I said, if the argument as to dead timber applied to Article 4 is valid, if the basing of the rejection of Article 4 on Article 12 is valid, then it applies still more to Article 2.</P>
    <P>The President can put forward as good, or better, a case for getting rid of the connection with the Crown as he can for the removal of the Oath, and still hold that it does not violate the Treaty.  Legality is preserved, and the whole Treaty is gone, in its essential Articles, that deal with the connection between the two countries, and yet, according to this new legal phraseology, this new legal light, the Treaty itself still stands.  That is the position we are in.  We are asking those who think that the Treaty is of importance, who think that an international document ought to be honoured&mdash;we have failed up to the present to persuade these people as to what is at stake, to persuade them of the importance of it from our own country's point of view&mdash;<Col N="2037" /> to agree that this third-best method, at all events, gives very little excuse to anybody who has any pretence to any reverence whatever for the Treaty for not voting for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment, in my opinion, is a most mischievous amendment and a most deplorable amendment, because it is calculated to cloud the minds of the people as to the real significance of Section 2 of this Bill. I have always believed, and I still believe, that President de Valera got a mandate in the last election to remove the obligation imposed by the Constitution on members of this Oireachtas to swear an oath of allegiance and I believe, and I was confirmed in that belief by the Attorney-General, when he spoke here, that President de Valera and the Fianna Fáil Government were entitled to do that by Section 1 and Section 4 of the Bill at present before us.  I pointed out, however, on the first day, and I am more convinced now than I was then, that Section 1 is being used as a bandage to blindfold the eyes of our people, while they are being led a great deal further than Section 1 ever would make this country go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2, into which our people are being led under the guise of a Bill simply to remove the Oath from the Constitution, in accordance with the mandate which President de Valera got, withdraws the force of law from the Treaty, and also definitely does away with our guarantee of good faith to the other high contracting parties to the Treaty: that if they, on the acceptance of the Treaty, accepted it in the spirit as well as in the letter, and packed up and cleared out, lock, stock and barrel, we did not expect them after seven centuries of bitter war between these two peoples to bury all suspicion and all apprehensions with regard to our good faith.  We demanded, as a result of the Treaty, that they should clear out, lock, stock and barrel, and leave this country to the Irish people, to be run for the Irish people by the Irish people, and they did it.  In accordance with the terms of their agreement, and we, on the other <Col N="2038" /> side, said, so far as I can see: &ldquo;As a guarantee to you, we are prepared to place in the Bill, which will implement our Constitution, a proviso that, if any Act of the Oireachtas is repugnant to the Treaty, or a breach of the Treaty, then by our own declaration we declare that Act to be void, because unless and until we are prepared to tear up all the Treaty, and revert to the status quo ante of 1921, we will not commit a breach of any Article, of any comma or any word, and if we inadvertently do it, we want to give a pledge here and now, that we do it by inadvertence, and will at the earliest possible opportunity honour our bond, and keep our word, or else say that all contractual agreements are at an end between us, and at an end, from both our points of view.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A strong case can be made for the position that the Treaty is an international document and should not be brought into the arena of municipal law.  It is not a proper instrument for the judges of our courts to be passing judgment on at all.  I have no desire to go back to the past, or to investigate the circumstances of the Treaty, or what led up to the Treaty.  There it is, and it was accepted by the Irish people, and we have to face the present time in the light of the Treaty. There is our undertaking, and there can be little doubt that in drawing the Constitution the British Government was consulted.  It was to be read in the light of the Treaty, and it was to contain, obviously, safeguards to reassure the English people, as they were entitled to be reassured, after a protracted period of strained relations, and, as far as I can see from this document, whether it is a normal or abnormal thing that the judges of this country should pass judgment upon an international instrument, unless they accepted the principle that if there was a difference of opinion as to whether legislation of this Oireachtas was a breach of the Treaty or not, and, if the Irish High Court considered it judicially, and gave a verdict that the legislation of this Oireachtas was not a breach of the Treaty, Great Britain was bound by that verdict.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2039" /> The President has asked, if we went to a court that understood our point of view, and that was admittedly sympathetic to our point of view, and got a verdict, what good would it do? The other party would take the view that it was the verdict of a prejudiced court and, therefore, they were not bound by it.  Would the Irish people take it as a judgment of a prejudiced court?  Have we such a contempt for our own judiciary that we do not believe, if we submit a legal problem to them, they will not consider it dispassionately and give a verdict, whether it be popular or not?  I believe not.  I believe if our judges were called upon to do that, they would do it as judges bound by a very solemn obligation to do their duty without any thought of popularity or public feeling.  If the other party, which I do not believe, poured scorn on that verdict, the Irish people would not pour scorn.  The Irish people would support the Irish Government in sustaining the verdict of our judiciary in going forward to implement the people's will in accordance with the Treaty as declared by our judiciary, and I have very little doubt that if any external Power, or any Power joined with us in the Commonwealth of Nations, sought to coerce our people and to throw scorn upon what was an accepted means of arbitration between our Government and the British Government, then the Irish people would not be behindhand in supporting the Irish Government to the fullest possible extent to honour a verdict that the Irish Government had secured in the way they announced they were going to look for it.</P>
    <P>The second argument the President put forward is that Section 2 does no more than relegate the Treaty to the sphere to which it ought to belong. He emphasised, and rightly emphasised, that Section 1 is not a breach of the Treaty.  Why on earth does he proceed to deal with a very complicated and delicate constitutional question in the same Bill in which he deals with the abolition of the obligation on Deputies to take the Oath of Allegiance?  If one is not a <Col N="2040" /> breach of the Treaty, what connection is there between the two things, and why drag them in together?  Does he not rob every member of this Oireachtas of his calmness of judgment and absence of passion in examining the other question on its merits?  There may be a very good case for altering the status of the Treaty in connection with the Constitution, but it is one which ought to be considered calmly, without any national feeling of violence or anything else, and without any feeling engendered by what a large number of Deputies feel is a bitter injustice on Deputies?  Deputies on the Government Benches, if we believe them, and I believe them, feel that they were brought into this House, labouring, from the very first day they were in it down to date, under a bitter sense of injustice.  It is to redress that injustice that we are asked to pass this Bill, to remove that obligation which they think is an obligation of perjury on them.  Is that the atmosphere to consider a complicated constitutional adjustment? Is that the atmosphere in which to invite the opinion of the country on this most delicate and difficult question?  I cannot imagine that it is.</P>
    <P>Why I describe this amendment as so mischievous, irresponsible and silly is that it is going to confuse the whole issue in the country.  It lays the Opposition open to the suggestion that they accept the principle that if you only knock a little chip off the Treaty it does not matter, but be careful you do not knock a pretty big lump off it. If you knock one portion off the Treaty, then you ought to renounce the whole document.  Unless you are prepared to do that, you should not touch a letter or comma in the Treaty. Here you have an amendment standing in the name of the ex-Minister for External Affairs suggesting that we should cling to the Treaty, but that we should pare off whatever little bits we do not like.  That is the meaning of the amendment.  I have no doubt that the Deputy has the pious intention of voting for his amendment, and then voting against the Bill as he himself has amended it, but I cannot admire <Col N="2041" /> the logic of that procedure. Either he believes in the Treaty, as I do, or he does not.  If he does, then that amendment helps him in no way. It is confusing the issue in the country, and, even now, I only wish Deputy McGilligan would withdraw the amendment and let the country know what the true significance of Section 2 is.</P>
    <P>I want to say that I consider the action of the Leader of the Opposition in allowing Sections 2 and 3 to pass through Committee by agreement without giving the House ample opportunity of debating them has done incalculable harm, because the vast majority of the people do not know what Section 2 is.  All they know is that there is a Bill to remove from the Constitution the obligation to take the Oath, and the vast majority of the people approved that course.  And, approving that course, they were vouchsafed no opportunity by the Leader of the Opposition of being informed as to the nature of Section 2 or Section 3.  The result is that the people have been given no opportunity of shouldering the full responsibility that they are going to be asked to shoulder if the Bill passes through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I saw where a member of the Labour Party referred to that very question down the country and I heard the comment made upon his speech.  He reiterated a feeling that many people who are anxious to see the Fianna Fáil Government go ahead and thrive and prosper felt, and that was, that at the beginning of their economic and political policy they were going to do something for which the people would call them strictly to account; and they say this, that they were going to lead the people into legislation that the people do not understand and that the people never bargained for.  I say that the Leader of the Opposition has a grave responsibility upon him for not insisting upon the Government giving the House an opportunity of discussing that section fully in Committee and when it was standing alone and could be discussed upon its merits, divorced from the other part of the Bill.  It does not belong to the Bill; it ought not to be in the Bill; and it would not <Col N="2042" /> survive debate in this House if it were debated upon its merits, without Section 1 beside it.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the attitude of mind that regards it as a horrible crime that a situation might arise in which the legislation of this Oireachtas should prove to be at variance with the Treaty is all wrong.  So long as Section 2 of the Constitution Act (No. 1), 1922, stands, that is our pledge of good faith, and if, in passing this Bill, which I believe the vast majority of the people want, we inadvertently do something which is not in accordance with the Treaty, there is nothing dishonourable in that.  At the present moment, the French and Swiss nations are at variance about something being done by Switzerland which France alleges is a breach of the treaty obligations between these two countries. The appropriate tribunal, no doubt, will be approached and the matter will be put to arbitration, and if it be that Switzerland has gone beyond what she was entitled to do in the light of her contractual obligations, I do not think any national dishonour will accrue to Switzerland if she mends her policy and alters it in accordance with her treaty obligations, or else denounces the treaty.  Here in this House, if we were dealing with Sections 1 and 4 alone, even though we differ with the other high contracting party as to our obligation under the Treaty, I do not think we would be putting the honour of the nation in jeopardy or peril.  The Tribunal is there, and if anyone feels that we have gone beyond the limits which we ourselves had set in the Treaty and in the Constitution Act, there is nothing dishonourable, in the face of such a verdict being handed down, in our mending our hand and in President de Valera going back to the people and saying: &ldquo;I cannot do what you gave me a mandate to do, unless you give me a further mandate to declare a republic and tear up the Treaty.&rdquo;  If he did that, no one could suggest that he had done anything which would tarnish the honour of the nation in the slightest degree.</P>
    <P>I regret that by introducing <Col N="2043" /> Section 2 and 3 into this Bill President de Valera has done something which I cannot help but describe as deception of his own people, deception of the Irish people.  The Irish people do not know at this hour the implications of Section 2 and 3.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  To my mind, Section 2 pledges our honour to the other high contracting party that we would not pass legislation or amend the Constitution of this country in any way which would be repugnant to the Treaty or, if we inadvertently did so, then, so far as that legislation was repugnant to the Treaty it would be null and void.  I say that that was our pledge of good faith in exchange for their clearing out, lock, stock, and barrel, as I said a few moments ago. The repeal of Section 2 also withdraws the force of law from the Treaty in this country.  I say that if President de Valera announced during the recent election campaign that he proposed in this Dáil to take power to withdraw the force of law from the Treaty&mdash;I do not say that he should announce that he was going to pass legislation, but that he was going to take power to pass legislation repugnant to the Treaty&mdash;I do not believe he would have got a mandate to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that it would be appropriate on this occasion for me to venture further with the President than to say that the words of Section 2 of the Constitution Act of 1922 set out what that Act proposed to do.  These words, so far as I am aware, are pretty clear.  The section says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The said Constitution shall be construed with reference to the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland set forth in the Second Schedule hereto annexed (hereinafter referred to as <Col N="2044" />&ldquo;the Scheduled Treaty&rdquo;) which are hereby given the force of law...</P>
    <P>Now, unless the meaning of the English language has changed since I learned it, if you repeal an Act of Parliament which gives the force of law to a document set out in a Schedule you withdraw the force of law from the document set out in the Schedule.  The section goes on to say</P>
    <P>and if any provision of the said Constitution or of any amendment thereof or of any law made thereunder is in any respect repugnant to any of the provisions of the Scheduled Treaty, it shall, to the extent only of such repugnancy, be absolutely void and inoperative and the Parliament and the Executive Council of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) shall respectively pass such further legislation and do all such other things as may be necessary to implement the Scheduled Treaty.</P>
    <P>I said that if President de Valera had told the people that he sought their mandate, not only to remove an injustice from the elected representatives of the people, but also to withdraw the force of law from the Treaty, and to take powers to pass legislation so as to amend the Constitution in a manner repugnant to the Treaty, I do not believe that President de Valera would have got the mandate he did.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to say categorically he would not.  I believe he would not have got it.  I believe that the President has repeatedly said that he knows the people in this country are not yet prepared to follow him into a republic out of the Commonwealth of Nations.  I agree with him.  I should be long sorry to see them come to the resolution that they should take that course of bitter individual nationalism when all the advantages of freedom are to be had in association with other independent nations.  But that is beside the issue. The issue is that if President de Valera sought a mandate for a Bill containing Section 2 alone, is there any member of the House who believes he <Col N="2045" /> would have got the mandate he got? I say he would not.  I believe he would not, and I say this, well knowing the President's astuteness as a politician, if he thought he would have got a bigger majority he would have put that programme before the people.  I say now that so fundamentally different are Sections 1 and 2 that they should never have been brought together in the same Bill.  The two things cannot be dispassionately considered when brought together in one Bill.  I say the President should have introduced a Bill containing Sections 1 and 4, abolishing the Oath, and no more, in accordance with his mandate.  He would then be free, if he thought that the national status of this country required it, to prepare a Bill defining the national status of this country as it has at present developed, and then he might have laid that Bill before this House for full and patient consideration.  If he wanted to fight a general election on the declaration of the existing status of this country he could have gone to the people and fought it on that.  If he did so, I doubt very much he would have got the verdict that he got in the last general election.</P>
      <P>It is because that aspect of the situation is being confused by this irresponsible and silly amendment that I have described it as I do.  Such amendments serve no purpose.  They do not improve the Bill in the slightest.  They simply appear for the purpose of trying to push the President into a difficult position, which is a very worthless and silly purpose.  It is none of our business to press the President into a difficult position when engaged in international negotiations.</P>

      <P>But our duty is to let him know, and let him know in an unquestionable manner, what we believe the people want, and anyone who fails in that duty now will have to answer for it to the people when he meets them again.  There are many things that many of us may not agree with in the Fianna Fáil policy.  Some of us believe that for the welfare of the country <Col N="2046" /> Fianna Fáil should have its chance.  I was prepared to go a long way to help them in so far as in me lay to have their chance to put their policy into operation and to do their best for the country, but I am not prepared to betray the solemn undertaking that I gave to my constituents, and that was that I would not support President de Valera if his policy was calculated to lead us into actual or economic war with any other nation in the world or amongst ourselves.</P>
      <P>If Section 2 is passed, withdrawing the force of law from the Treaty and taking power to pass legislation repugnant to it, I believe that President de Valera will have led this country into grave danger of an economic war with nations that otherwise would be friendly and favourable to this country.  I am quite satisfied that there is no danger of actual war, but the ordinary consequences of grave diplomatic difference between two countries will follow.  Whether with France, America, Great Britain or any other country, if you flagrantly, in their mind, depart from a solemn undertaking, inevitably consequences will ensue.  I am satisfied that in Section 1&mdash;and Section 1 of the Bill is the only effective part of the Bill&mdash; President de Valera is doing nothing calculated to provoke strained relations between Great Britain and this country.  I am equally satisfied that in Section 2, which is as different from Section 1 as chalk is from cheese, President de Valera is doing something which will bring this country into the gravest possible danger of strained relations with Great Britain, that will have economic repercussions upon this country, that will jeopardise the whole plan of social reform and the economic policy of the Fianna Fáil Government.  I will not be a party to something which puts the future of the country in jeopardy, and I will not be a party to an amendment drawn up to embarrass President de Valera and calculated only to bamboozle and blindfold the people of the country as to the exact nature of what they are being led into under Section 2 of this Bill by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>I wish to assure Deputy Dillon that we do not consider it a small thing to knock a chip off the Treaty.  We consider that the Treaty should stand, stand in its entirety, stand as a whole.  We stand behind the Treaty as a whole, and we stand by every single line of it.  We do not condone, and never will condone, knocking off a chip or paring a bit off the Treaty.  We stand against this Bill.  We stand against the whole of it.  We stand against Section 1, Section 2 and Section 3.  We stand against Section 1, because Section 1 is a clear violation of the Treaty, a violation of that clear statement in the Treaty that the Oath to be taken shall be in the particular form therein set out.  Nothing can be plainer, nothing can be clearer, nothing can be more specific than that.  I know that sometimes the minds of certain individuals may be brought by very hard labour to think what they want to think, but I cannot understand how anybody can bring his mind, no matter what tortuous path he may have taught his mind to tread, to believe that you can go straight in the teeth of a specific Article of the Treaty and say that you are not breaking the Treaty.  The Article is there perfectly plain, and to violate that Article is to violate the Treaty.  There could be nothing plainer than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>President de Valera talked, as he has been talking before, about the power to remove the Oath and the growth of our status.  We have power to remove the Oath.  We have power to smash the Treaty.  We have that; no one has ever denied it, We can do it.  You are within the legal competence of this country in breaking the Treaty, as you are now breaking it by this Bill.  No one has ever denied it.  You can do it, but to have the power is one thing and to exercise the power rightly is another thing.  To have the power to act does not justify you in acting immorally or acting wrongly, nor does it justify you in breaking your pledged word.  President de Valera's type of mind seems to be this: he has the type of mind that believes that if he has power he <Col N="2048" /> can exercise that power for any purpose, right or wrong, moral or immoral. He cannot.  We have got power under our present position to remove the Oath; but you cannot do that, you cannot remove the Oath without violating the national conscience and attacking and disgracing national honour.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is supposed to have reference to the Oath, because it is stated here in the Bill:</P>
      <P>An Act to remove the obligation now imposed by law on members of the Oireachtas and Ministers who are not members of the Executive Council to take an Oath and for that purpose to amend the Constitution and also the Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) Act, 1922.</P>
      <P>So, according to the Title of the Bill, Section 2 of the Bill is put in here in order that the taking of the Oath within the Constitution may be effectively done away with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly Section 1 specifically sets out one <Col N="2049" /> purpose, the deletion of Article 17, and then Section 2 is by way of an amendment of the Constitution of the Irish Free State Act, 1922.  Then to that section there is an amendment to add the words: &ldquo;So far as it has application to the amendment of the Constitution by the deletion of Article 17 thereof.&rdquo;  That does not discuss whether we have power or have not power to remove the Oath out of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>The effect of the section as it stands is to invalidate the entire Treaty.  About that it seems to me there can be no question.  It is stated, as clearly as it could be stated in the Treaty, that the Treaty, if approved, shall be ratified by the necessary legislation.  If it were not ratified by the necessary legislation then it ceased to be binding.  I quoted here, on the Second Reading, very learned authorities on the well-established principle of law, that if you repeal a Statute you are exactly in the same position as if that Statute had never been passed.  If you repeal now this legislation which ratifies the Treaty you are exactly in the same position as if that Statute had never been passed. You are in the position that the Treaty is not ratified by appropriate legislation. <Col N="2050" /> You are taking away that legislation, and you have then nothing in this country which gives to the Treaty the force of law.  That is the position into which you are coming.  Suppose your deliberate object is to repudiate the Treaty, suppose you had no other object except to repudiate the Treaty, what course would you take?  What is the appropriate way of repudiating the Treaty?  What is the first and most necessary step to repudiate the whole Treaty?  To repeal this one Statute, No. 1 of 1922.  Repeal that, and what more do you want?  What other step is requisite?  That is the Statute which ratifies the Treaty; that is the Statute which gives it the force of law; and there is no other step necessary for you, nor indeed do I know what other step you could take, to repudiate the Treaty except the repeal of that section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be ratified by the legislation of both parties. The parties there came to an agreement.  That agreement was not valid until not merely the contracting parties but the Parliaments behind them had ratified it, and had passed the necessary legislation.  And that is the legislation which you at the present moment are taking away. And, as I say, the step and the only step which it is necessary for you to take to repudiate that Treaty is to repeal that section, which by Section 2 of this Bill now before the House you are seeking to do.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan's amendment says: &ldquo;Do not do that.  It is true you are breaking the Treaty in one respect, but do not break it completely, do not fling it to the winds, it is bad, it is terrible, it is wrong to break the Treaty, but it is worse to tear up the whole document and say that the Treaty has no binding force in this country.&rdquo;  And what is the reason against this amendment?  What is the objection?  President de Valera talked about the judges.  He said that it might come before the judges, and that they were wrong-minded judges or judges who would not take a proper view of things.  I suppose everybody is wrong-minded who does not completely agree with what that very learned and well-trained lawyer, President de Valera, thinks.  I suppose nobody takes a proper point of view unless he takes President de Valera's point of view.  I suppose that that is so.  But what is the necessity of the attack upon the Irish Bench made by the President?  What is the reason of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>As a personal matter, I did not pass any reflection whatever <Col N="2052" /> on the Irish Bench.  What I was talking about was whether as a matter of general principle a treaty should or should not be made part of a domestic law; and I say that as a matter of principle it is not right that an arrangement between States should be decided by domestic judges, inasmuch as it can never be decided fully.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  But the President seems to forget that neither before wrong-minded judges nor right-minded judges unless the amendment is passed, can the question of the Oath ever be brought. That is what the amendment means.  That is just the one thing that the amendment does and nothing else.  If you pass this Bill as it stands, then the validity of this Statute cannot be tested in the Courts. The one argument that you had put forward in any way relevant to this Bill under Section 2 was this: that it might be tested in the Courts.  That is what I understood the President was putting forward, and that the Courts might take a wrong view.  If I am not mistaken that is the view that the Attorney-General put forward the other day-that the Courts might take a wrong view, and that was the only argument relevant to the Oath question under which Section 2 comes in at all.  If this amendment were accepted you would not have broken or torn up the whole Treaty.  You would have broken the Treaty in one very important matter, you would have violated the Treaty, but you would not have torn it up and put it into the scrap heap.  And that is what the amendment means.  It means that and nothing else.  We are standing, <Col N="2053" /> as I say, for the whole Treaty. We do not condone and will not condone&mdash;as far as we can we will oppose to the end&mdash;any alteration of the Treaty except by the consent of the two high contracting parties.  A contract is a contract, a bargain is a bargain, a man's honour is a man's honour, a nation's honour is a nation's honour.  And the man who violates his word or the nation that breaks a clear contract are alike&mdash;disgraced. And we oppose and we will continue to oppose to the very end a national disgrace.  I am utterly opposed to the whole Bill.  I am more opposed to Section 2 than even to any other part of the Bill.  I do not say with this amendment that Section 2 will be a passable section.  I would vote for an amendment against Section 2, and I put it forward for the consideration of Deputies, that Section 2 even as amended will still be left as a disgrace to this country but it will be less disgraceful amended than unamended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Attorney-General (Mr. C. Maguire)</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess that I have a certain amount of difficulty in dealing with the legal aspect of this question, a difficulty which does not arise from the question involved, but a difficulty in attempting to advance an argument in the atmosphere which has grown up in this House.  It seems to me that the Deputies who have spoken have treated this question as if they were lawyers arguing before a competent tribunal.  We have a number of amateur constitutional lawyers on the opposite benches who are prepared to lay down the law upon any subject, municipal law, international law or any other kind of law.  We have Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Fitzgerald who apparently fancy they know everything that is to be known about the status and rights of this country and the exact implications of the Treaty.  They are to be the guides for everybody in the interpretation of these documents.  We have in the person of Deputy Dillon a very young lawyer who on the Second Reading delivered himself of the speech, without waiting to listen to the arguments, to which he apparently finds himself tied now.  I can only state that it <Col N="2054" /> would seem to me that this is not the proper place for one to enter into elaborate arguments as to why this particular section should stand.  As the President said, I find this difficulty, that if we had to argue this matter before an international tribunal with the British arguing against us as to whether this was a breach of the Treaty or not they would not advance the arguments advanced here.  I am satisfied that Deputies know that and that Deputy Fitzgerald knows that. As I said on the First Reading, they are not treating the country or the Government properly.  They are involving this question in an atmosphere in which it should not be involved. We should have been allowed to deal with this question as one between us and England and not one between the two political Parties in this House. I can only say with regard to Section 2 that I have formed my own opinion that its removal does not in any way violate the Treaty.  I am supported in that view by the opinion of every single lawyer that I have consulted&mdash; and I consulted a large number of them.  Deputy Dillon, fresh from the country, without any training beyond the fact that he has just been called to the Bar, professes to have the sole understanding of the exact position as to the removal of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald poses as an international lawyer.  I would like to ask in the first instance how comes it that Section 2 is in the Constitution at all?  Where is the Article in the Treaty that obliges the Dáil to insert or retain that section in the Constitution? Is there a single Article in the Treaty which calls for the insertion of that over-riding provision in the Constituent Act?  All we have listened to goes on the basis that in this Article, as Deputy Dillon put it, there is an obligation of honour which is being broken by the removal of this section from the Constituent Act.  So far as I can see, the application of the Treaty as an international document stands in exactly the same position when this section is removed from the Constituent Act as when it was there.  All that is being done, as the President over and over again <Col N="2055" /> stated, is to remove from the courts the right to interpret the Treaty in the light of this over-riding provision. There were a lot of suggestions that the courts might bring in a wrong verdict on an important question of this kind.  Is it not monstrously unfair to the courts to have such a question as this&mdash;a question of status&mdash;thrashed out in a domestic forum?  Is there any parallel to it in any of the other Dominions?  Is there any parallel to it in any of the other States forming the British Commonwealth of Nations?  Why are we to have such an overriding provision in this Constitution of ours?  I suggest that this argument has gone along wholly wrong lines, and that the removal of this section in no way alters the position as between the two countries, and that the suggestion that we are tearing up the Treaty and violating the Treaty is absolute nonsense.  I believe it is nonsense to the knowledge of a number of people putting forward that argument here.  I repeat that I had the views of eminent constitutional lawyers before this section was put in.  I challenge Deputies who criticise us&mdash;particularly Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Fitzgerald&mdash;to say if the legislation which they proposed to introduce in connection with the Privy Council would not have to contain the same section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hayes may have misunderstood what I said.  I have not said that I am aware of what the advice of the ex-Attorney-General was.  All I say is that if a Bill reaches the Cabinet with such a section, I presume such advice has been given.  That is all I say.  The reasons which would inspire the removal of the section in order to enable the appeal to the Privy Council to be removed would be, I suggest, exactly the same reasons which have been advanced here in support of the Bill to remove Article 17.  I do not know whether it is necessary to go into all the pernickety details raised by <Col N="2057" /> Deputy McGilligan.  Passing away from the repugnancy question and answering the Deputy as to where the force of law is got for the Articles of Agreement, I say again that the Provisional Parliament which framed this Constitution was constituted under the terms of the Provisional Act.  The first section of the Provisional Act gives the force of law to the Treaty.  The fact that it gave the force of law to the Treaty is repeated in various places. It is repeated in an agreement which we will consider on Deputy Finlay's amendment.  The very position that was necessary to have this Constitution framed depended upon the force of law being given to these Articles. These words &ldquo;in so far as necessary to give the force of law,&rdquo; to my mind, are mere surplusage.  The force of law is not being taken away by anything we are doing here so far as the force of law is required.  If you go back and depend on a British statute the cry will go up that you are making a case which is inconsistent with the case made here.</P>
      <P>Again, I say when these people ask us to argue the legal case out in detail here, we must consider that we are being listened to across the water just as we are being listened to on the benches opposite.  I do say that the argument advanced here would not be advanced by Mr. Thomas or his advisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I go back to Section 2 for a moment. The only reason I can find why Section 2 should have been put into the Constitution in the way in which it is framed is that the framers of the Constitution considered it was not a Treaty.  That is the only thing which would necessitate its being put in the dominant overriding position in which it was put in the constituent Act.  If the document was a Treaty, carrying international obligations, what was the necessity for inserting it in the Constitution? There is no parallel to it that I know of.  In any case, as has been pointed out, even if at that date it had that overriding force and stereotyped our Constitution in a particular way at that time, surely it has been admitted, over and over again, that events have so changed that position that it is <Col N="2058" /> necessary, in order to make the law accord with the now admitted facts, that that section should be removed from the Constituent Act, and that, as the President said, the Treaty should be put in its proper place, or allowed to take its place as an international document, if it is an international document and if it is a Treaty.  It will surely have the same binding effect whether or not we take this ineffective and futile section out of the constituent Act.  We are merely removing it so that a very absurd position should not continue to obtain&mdash;that a matter which this House has decided should be referred to certain judges to pronounce as to whether the decision of the House is contrary to the provisions of an international document or not.  That is the sole purpose for which we are taking it out.  I do not agree for one moment that taking it out is in any way breaking any obligation created by the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty, or that it is sweeping away, or taking away, the force of law from anything that requires the force of law in these Articles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment to Section 2 of this Bill.  One wonders why the amendment would not be accepted. One wonders why the people who profess that all they want to do is to remove the obligation which rests upon members of the Oireachtas to take an oath would not accept this amendment.  The history of the amendment is interesting.  How do we come to move this amendment now? The Bill before us has as its Short Title &ldquo;The Constitution (Removal of Oath) Bill.&rdquo;  I commented here before on the fact that that is a dishonest, political title, intended, as Deputy Dillon said this evening, to deceive the House and to deceive the people.  The Long Title of the Bill is &ldquo;An Act to remove the obligation now imposed by law on members of the Oireachtas and Ministers who are not members of the Executive Council to take an oath, and for that purpose to amend the Constitution and also the Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) Act, 1922.&rdquo;  We were against the Bill, root and branch.  We voted against <Col N="2059" /> the Bill on Second Stage.  We voted against the operative sections in Committee. Now that the Bill is on Report, the best thing that can be done is to make it into a Bill which honestly and fairly, on its own face, is what it purports to be and is no more than it purports to be.  We want, by amending Section 2, to make the Bill a Bill to remove the Oath, and for that purpose to amend the Constitution and the Constitution Act.</P>
      <P>The amendment we are discussing proposes to add at the end of Section 2 of the Bill, which repeals Section 2 of the constituent Act, the words &ldquo;so far as it has application to the amendment of the Constitution by the deletion of Article 17 thereof.&rdquo;  Why would that amendment not be acceptable? Why cannot the Bill be made, so to speak, into an honest measure&mdash; into a measure which removes the Oath and which, by amending in a particular way Section 2 of the constituent Act, removes from the courts of this country&mdash;this is the Attorney-General's point&mdash;any power to decide whether what we are doing now is contrary to municipal law or not. Why would not Deputies opposite be honest and do that?  Why would they not make the Bill into a Removal of Oath Bill instead of being what it is, a Removal of Treaty Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Things have been said here this evening which may be slightly outside the scope of this amendment but I suggest that they are really all part of the one topic.  Deputy Dillon spoke of not interfering with the Executive Council when engaged in international negotiations.  The President spoke about being in argument with the British and the Attorney-General spoke about our treating this subject here as if it were being argued before an international tribunal.  He said that that was quite wrong.  I think he was right in saying it was quite wrong&mdash;if that was what was being done.  He said that the question whether this Bill, in any of its sections, was wrong should be left to the Government.  I agree that it should be left to the Government if the Government were going the right <Col N="2060" /> way about it.  Nobody should interfere with the Executive Council if the Executive Council were engaged in international negotiations.  The President wanted to know why we did not demonstrate that to delete this section from the constituent Act or to delete the Oath from the Constitution would be a breach of the Treaty.  I am not at all concerned to demonstrate that or to find arguments for anybody to use against the Government of this State if the Government of this State were entering upon this matter in the proper way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They ought not to be allowed to judge.  Surely the people elected here should be allowed to judge.  Surely the fact that the President has been put into office by a small majority vote of this House does not give him the right to break up our international relations, does not give him the right to proceed to do what he pleases with regard to the fundamental document on which this State rests?  That is the most extravagant claim which has ever been made from the seat the President now occupies or from a similar seat in any other Parliament.  The President owes his position not to a majority consisting solely of his own Party but to a majority resting upon the Labour Party and upon other Deputies, like Deputy Dillon, who made it quite clear that whatever his sympathy is with the economic policy of the Government he has no sympathy with its present political policy.  The President now claims that the Government should be the judges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can make myself quite clear.  I do not know what <Col N="2061" /> remark Deputy Cooney interjected, but I expect that is an advantage both to the Chair and myself.  What I say is that if the Government were engaged in international negotiations it would be the business of the Opposition here to be silent while they were so engaged, and if that were what the Government wanted.  It would be, further, the principal business of the Opposition and of any skilled persons in the Opposition to assist the Government to make their case in these international negotiations.  That, I am sure, would be the attitude of this Party.  If the Government were engaged in international negotiations they would have, as they chose and as they might deem most suitable or helpful to them, either silence or assistance, whether given privately or publicly.  That is my view of international negotiation.</P>
      <P>Surely the doctrine could never be held, and I wonder at the President preaching it, that the Opposition is to be silent while the government, instead of conducting negotiations about an international treaty, proceed to claim that they have the right to interpret the Treaty any way they please. Surely a Labour man who, as most Labour men generally have, has some experience of what happens in the case of disputes, realises the necessity for holding a conference in order to come to some agreement.  It is only a little over twelve months ago when a labour dispute arose and some Labour members interested in the dispute came to me and said that it was a matter that could be settled by conference and agreement.  It was ultimately so settled, and an agreement was arrived at that if differences of interpretation arose the parties would meet in order to compose those differences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is happening in this case is that a difference of interpretation has arisen in regard to a treaty, and this Government refuses to negotiate at all.  I do not see why the President should say that he is arguing with the British, because he does not seem to be arguing at all.  I think the President is correct in saying that some treaties, at any rate, need not necessarily be part of our municipal law.  The difficulty is that he is not treating this document <Col N="2062" /> as a treaty at all.  He is taking it out of international law.  As far as I can understand from the Attorney-General, although this is a question between two States, it is not being taken up in the manner in which questions between States are usually taken up.  This Government is going to take a particular line of its own, so that we are not going to have the Treaty in our municipal law and we are not going to negotiate with the other party at all.</P>
    <P>The refusal to accept this amendment makes one thing quite clear.  The fact that the Government will not accept it makes it obvious that their purpose is to smash the Treaty.  The fact is that they are an anti-State and an anti-Treaty Government, and they have been placed in power by people who have always professed the reverse of that policy&mdash;by people who are pro-Treaty. That is the position.  The sole aim and purpose of the rejection of this amendment is to enable the Government to be in the position to give some form of legality here to their purpose and intention, which is to break this Treaty and to be able to say to their extremist followers: &ldquo;Not only have we removed the Oath, but we have made the way plain and smooth for the removal of the Treaty.&rdquo; That is a procedure which is not treating the people or the House squarely. I merely want to deal with that particular point.</P>
    <P>The President stated that the Treaty should not be part of our municipal law; that treaties should be subject to agreement and should come before the international court.  There is no arrangement here for an international court&mdash;none whatever.  There is no talk of agreement here.  There can be no doubt that the purpose of this Bill goes much further than its Short Title indicates.  The Attorney-General devoted all his arguments to explaining that Section 2 of the Constitution Act is not necessary and ought to be repealed.  If it ought to be repealed. it ought to be repealed in a separate Act.  The Government should have proceeded by way, first of all, of saying: &ldquo;We will repeal Section 2 of the Constitution Act,&rdquo; and having done that they could introduce a series of constitutional <Col N="2063" /> amendments calling them, for example, Anti-Treaty Amendment Number 1; an Act to remove the Oath.  That is what they are doing here, and they will not accept the amendment because they do not want to accept a limitation upon their powers.  Having got people a certain distance, they want to force them the whole way.</P>
    <P>I was rather interested this evening in observing that we have had no contribution at all on this question from the Labour Party.  During the past ten years one frequently heard the protestations from the Labour Benches that they accepted no guilt for any kind of strife in this country; it was always somebody else's fault.  The members of the Labour Party have an opportunity here of making this Bill honest by restricting it in some way.  If they refuse to accept this particular opportunity they will not be able to play the Pontius Pilate any longer.  They will not be able to go to the country and to say to the people: &ldquo;It was not we who did it; it was de Valera.&rdquo;  They are going to do it themselves now.  The attitude of the Government in refusing this amendment makes it quite clear that the Bill aims at removing the Treaty, and the purport of all the arguments used to-day by the President, who referred to the Treaty and not to the amendment, proves that his Party are aiming to remove the Treaty entirely, not only from the Constitution, but from the realm of international documents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1927" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>Two arguments have been addressed to this House by the President of the Executive Council in support of Section 2 of the Bill before the House.  The first argument is based on the relation of Section 2 of the Constitution Act, 1922, to the question of the removal of the Oath.  If I may summarise the argument of the President with regard to Section 2 of the Constitution Act in that particular reference it is this: &ldquo;We do not want the question as to whether the Oath is mandatory or not decided by the judges in this country.  They may be wrong-headed.&rdquo;  I do not know the <Col N="2064" /> exact interpretation which the President puts upon the description &ldquo;wrong-headed,&rdquo; but apparently his view is that if the judges should take any other view than that expressed by him to this House they would be &ldquo;wrong-headed.&rdquo;  Other people may have quite different views on that matter. The second argument which he addressed to the House in support of the repeal of Section 2 of the Constitution Act is the argument, which clearly is not within the mandate which the President said he got from the electors of this country, namely, that it is necessary to remove the Treaty from the domain of municipal law.  A repeal to effect this purpose is clearly not within the ambit of this Bill and it should properly be brought into a separate Bill, as suggested here by Deputy Hayes; it could and should be brought in a Bill entitled &ldquo;An Act to remove the Treaty from the domain of municipal law.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the President went to the people of this country and if he explained to them the full implications of doing that, and if he were returned to power having asked the people for a mandate to that effect, he would be entitled to come before the House, ask us to give effect to that mandate and to repeal in full Section 2 of the Constitution Act, 1922.  What is the effect of Section 2 of the Constitution Act, 1922? On the Second Reading of this Bill I expressed my view of the effect of this section and I invited the legal advisers of the Government to controvert my legal propositions if they were in a position to do so.  No proper answer to my propositions has been given here either by the President or by the Attorney-General.  I suggest that neither on the Committee Stage nor on this, the Report Stage of the Bill, has the President or the Attorney-General put up any argument controverting the proposition; that Section 2 was in the first instance enacted by the Parliament of this country ratifying the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty of 1921; that, secondly, it gave to the Treaty the force of law here; and, thirdly, and perhaps most important of all, that it set for the country and for the <Col N="2065" /> Oireachtas a headline which was this: that it was a declaration on the part of the Oireachtas that in legislation we would not attempt to break or violate the Treaty entered into between this country and Great Britain on 6th December, 1921.</P>
    <P>What is the effect of this amendment? Deputy Dillon complains of the form of the particular amendment which has been introduced here by Deputy McGilligan.  Deputy McGilligan has explained that it is only the third-best thing that he could do in the situation, and I agree that it is only the third-best thing that could be done.  But it is this: Different views have been expressed in this House as to whether the Oath in the Treaty is mandatory or not.  I quote from the Attorney-General, Volume 41, No. 4, column 1010, where he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>First, on the question as to whether the Oath is obligatory or not, I admit that there are two views.  Any lawyer would be silly, on a difficult question which has been discussed over several years, to lay down positively that his own interpretation of certain things is absolutely the correct one.  I admit that there are two views.  I say that there are eminent lawyers, men whose eminence would be admitted by every Deputy on the opposite benches, if I mentioned their names, who do hold that the Oath is not obligatory.  They hold it for different reasons from the reasons that Deputy Finlay made such amusing play with and which were repeated by Deputy Wolfe and Deputy McGilligan.</P>
    <P>There you have the responsible legal adviser to the Government in this House saying that there are two quite genuine legal views as to whether the Oath is mandatory or not.  What is the effect of this amendment?  It is only the third-best thing we could do, but it is this: We want to put the Government in this position that at least they will say, not alone to the country but to the other contracting party to the Treaty, &ldquo;We are sincere about this question of the Oath.  We do not believe that this is a breach of <Col N="2066" /> the Treaty.  We are willing to negotiate and settle on the basis of the Oath alone.&rdquo;  If this amendment of Deputy McGilligan's were accepted it would have this effect, that it would limit any inroad on the Treaty to the immediate question which is before the House, that is as to the removal of the Oath.</P>
    <P>But the President of the Executive Council in refusing to accept his amendment goes a great deal further, and I am sure he can tell the people outside this House that he will go a great deal further than the removal of the Oath.  He wants to set the headline once and for all that this House should have no regard whatsoever in future legislation to the obligations of the Treaty of 1921.  For the purpose of avoiding the issues which are really involved in the repeal of Section 2, the President attempts to suggest that this Treaty or Articles of Agreement for a Treaty of 6th December, 1921, did not constitute a Treaty in the international sense. During the course of this House what has never defined to this House what is a treaty in the international sense.</P>
    <P>Neither the Attorney-General nor the President challenged in any way the definition of a treaty in the international sense which I gave on the Second Reading of this Bill here. That is, that it is a contract between two States not depending on its mere form, but depending on its substance, by which the two contracting States are bound.  I went further and said that the fact that one of the contracting States at the time the Treaty was entered into was not a recognised Government did not convert the document which they executed into anything but a treaty.  I said that you had here in 1921 functioning in this country a de facto Government which claimed international recognition, that they went forward and negotiated this Treaty, and a Treaty it became when approved by the peoples of both countries.  That has never been controverted.</P>
    <P>What does the President do to-day? He attempts to suggest that the sanction for this Treaty of 1921 comes not <Col N="2067" /> from any legislation passed by this Oireachtas but from the Statute of the British Parliament, the Act known as the Irish Free State Agreement Act, 1922.  That Act was passed in March, 1922.  What is the effect of that Act?  If the President would only look at that Act in conjunction with Article 17 of the Treaty he will see that the sole purpose of that Act was to enable the British Government in the first place to ratify the Treaty on behalf of the British people, and in the second place to enable the necessary transfer of functions to be made from the British Government to the Provisional Government which was set up here as a result of the Treaty.  If the President has any doubt as to my view that the only sanction for the Treaty in this country, the only ratification of the Treaty in this country is our own Constitution Act of 1922, let him look to the views of the judges of our own country.  These judges have not attempted to filch away our international status and our Treaty position in the manner attempted by the President here to-day. These same judges are the people whom the President has described as people who might give a wrong-headed opinion; but when they got an opportunity of interpreting our Treaty rights they were, unlike him, jealous to safeguard them.</P>
    <P>The position as decided here by the judges, to whom the President is afraid to leave the question as to whether the removal of the Oath is a breach of the Treaty or not, is this: They declared that the Treaty took effect from the 6th December, 1921, and that the British Parliament had no power whatsoever to legislate for this country as from the 6th December, 1921.  The only sanction which is given in this country for the Treaty is our own Act of 1922.  I will go further. Before the President and his Party came into this House this Oireachtas had declared its position with regard to the British Parliament and its power to legislate here subsequent to the 6th December, 1921.</P>
    <P>If the President will look at Section 40 of the Finance Act of 1926, <Col N="2068" /> passed by the Oireachtas, he will see that this House in that section recognised there was a doubt that this country would be bound by the British Finance Act of 1922, which was passed prior to the transfer of the functions of the Revenue Department to this Government. There was a declaration by the Oireachtas of this country's international status subsequent to the 6th December, 1921, and the President, in order to support his argument in respect of Section 2, falls back on a line of argument which, if it were accepted by the people, might have great reactions on them in the future with regard to our Treaty rights.  That argument is to the effect that the sanction of the Treaty comes from the British Act of 1922 and not from our own.  Perhaps the President is out to prove something which he has not mentioned at all.  Perhaps it is an attempt on his part to prove that the Irish people never ratified the Treaty.  If that is what he is out to prove, I can assure him that the Irish people ratified it in 1922.</P>
    <P>What did the Attorney-General tell Deputy Davin when he asked him a question?  He said that apparently Section 1 of the Constitution Act of 1922 gave the Treaty the force of law here. I will ask Deputy Davin to read this section, which is as follows:</P>
    <P>The Constitution set forth in the First Schedule hereto annexed shall be the Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann).</P>
    <P>What has that to do with the Treaty? It has nothing to do with the Treaty, and by no process of construction could it be held that that section gave the Treaty the force of law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Attorney-General if he has read the opinions of our own courts as to whether the Treaty was fully effective from the 6th December, 1921; if he has read the opinions expressed by our own judges that the British Parliament had no power to legislate for this country subsequent to the date of the Treaty, viz., the 6th December, 1921, and whether he is prepared to state to this House that he disregards the opinions of the judges expressed in the Supreme Court of this country that the Treaty took effect from the 6th December, 1921?  If he is prepared to state that he disregards these opinions, I would listen to his argument that the Treaty got sanction from an Act of the British Parliament, the Irish Free State Agreement Act, 1922, and not from our own statute of 1922?  If he is not prepared to state that&mdash;I feel sure that he will not state <Col N="2070" /> it&mdash;then I say that he has made no case whatever for his argument that the Treaty got sanction from an Act of the British Parliament and not from an Act of our own Parliament.  If the Attorney-General believed in the view which has been expressed by him, why has he not advised the Government that to achieve their avowed purpose, namely, to remove the Treaty from the domain of municipal law, it would be necessary to repeal Section 1 of the British statute&mdash;the Irish Free State Agreement Act, 1922?  What does ratification mean?  Surely it is common sense to say that ratification by parties to any document or contract means an act by both of them signifying their consent and approval of it.  Unless there is in the document or contract itself a provision that ratification is to be unilateral, and there is no provision in the Treaty of 1921 that it is to be ratified by one party and one party alone, the ordinary meaning of ratification, i.e., the expressing or signifying approval by both parties must apply to the Treaty.  It is idle to suggest that the sanction to this document of the 6th December, 1921, so far as this country is concerned, came from any act other than our own Constitution Act, 1922.  What case has been made to the country for doing away with the ratification of it, for doing away with the legal effect which is given to it, for cutting away once and for all the headline which we, as an honourable people, should set to ourselves, and that is that in passing legislation we would have regard to our Treaty obligations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section, if it is allowed to go through, is simply an inroad on the Treaty position generally.  What further does it do?  It is going to create a sense of insecurity in the country that nobody knows where legislation is going to lead them.  If the Government are sincere in their protestations that they are going to pass this Act first, and then negotiate with Great Britain&mdash;and may I say there have been no negotiations whatever up to this&mdash;is not their position ten times stronger by accepting this amendment, which at least will have <Col N="2071" /> the effect of saying: &ldquo;Well, there has been an argument in our own Parliament about whether the Oath is mandatory or not, but in any event we have taken good care to preserve the general Treaty position except in respect of this particular question upon which we are going to negotiate?&rdquo; They would be able to say that if they accepted this amendment.  They are not able to say that now because if they carry the section without amendment it is an express declaration on their part that, irrespective of the question of the Oath, for the future the Treaty is not going to be the headline for our legislation, but is to be disregarded in any legislation that we may want to enact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that Deputy Finlay has more clearly than anybody else shown that this amendment is a breach of the attitude which the Cumann na nGaedheal Party takes up.  It is a breach in this sense: they hold that Section 2 of the Constitution Act is fundamental to the situation, and that any interference with that is an interference with the implementing of the Treaty.  Deputy Finlay said that Section 2 ratified the Treaty, that it gives it the force of law and that it is a declaration that we will not violate it by legislation.  Then he turns around and he admits that his amendment&mdash;the amendment of his Party&mdash;is an inroad on the Treaty. It is only a small inroad, he says. Well either it is a breach or it is not a breach.  Either this section is essential or it is not essential.  If it is essential, any breach of it is a breach of the whole.  If it is not essential, then a mere minor breach does not matter, and it would have been a far better thing for the Cumann na nGaedheal Party to have been perfectly frank and to have taken up the attitude in public which they took up in private and have allowed the complete removal of this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>These arguments are getting more and more complicated because the position of the Government seems to be changing from day to day.  On the Friday, <Col N="2072" /> when the President made his long speech he asserted that he would never negotiate with the British Government except on the question of the reunion of this country.  On the following Tuesday he said that, as soon as this Bill was passed into law, he was prepared to hear what the British had to say to it.  We understand from the President and from the Attorney-General that they are in negotiation with the British Government.  The Attorney-General says very strongly that this is not the proper place to argue as to whether this section should or should not stand.  he suggests that we are doing grave national harm by making the points that we are making.  It seems to me that if any crime has been committed in this matter it has been the crime of the Government in introducing this Bill here.  The Government has undoubtedly authority from God and we owe it allegiance and submission.  It has brought this Bill in here to be discussed, and it is asking us to participate with itself in an act which is, we believe, directly contrary both to moral principles and to the well being of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They brought this Bill in for Deputies to discuss it but now they turn around and want to gag us.  They say that we are actually injuring them in their negotiations with Great Britain. If they are negotiating on some delicate point with Great Britain, then I quite agree that it may be necessary at times to have what is called secret diplomacy.  I think diplomacy is generally better without very much of the light of day on it.  If that is the position then they had no right whatever to introduce this Bill.  Why did they introduce it?  The President told us that in a Fianna Fáil manifesto they gave an undertaking to the people that they would remove the Oath, that the Oath was not mandatory and that they would not go beyond that point.  Deputy McGilligan in introducing his amendment referred to that attempt at justification on the part of the President for the introduction of this Bill, and pointed out incidentally that Section 18 of the Treaty requires, if approved, that it would be ratified <Col N="2073" /> by the necessary legislation.  He asked where the necessary legislation was once this had gone.  The President got up and he took a very advantageous point of view.  I knew a man one time who used to go about amongst people arguing religion.  He always asked what the other person was, and then proceeded to attempt to demolish his point, but he always refused to say what his own religion was.  The President, when he gets up and argues, tells us that the argument he is putting forward is the sort of argument that we on this side might make.  Then when we ask him what the position is he says that Deputy McGilligan would be quite right if this document is actually a Treaty, but he says there is another way of looking at it, of saying that this document is <i>sui generis.</i>  Then he says that the British have never admitted that it was a Treaty.  In the end he did not tell us what his point of view was.  In introducing this legislation here, what has he in his mind?  When he gets up to speak you would expect that he would get up to make known, by means of his voice, what his mind is thinking&mdash;of course we know that when he signs his name to a solemn document, he does not consider himself bound by it, but merely regards it as giving his autograph&mdash;but it may be that when he makes speeches here and in the country, he merely regards himself as giving a little recitation, and does not intend to be bound by them.  We have asked a certain question and he told us that there are three ways of looking at it&mdash;the Treaty, <i>sui generis,</i> or the British denying that it was a Treaty&mdash; and he sat down without telling us on what basis we were to discuss this matter.  He said the British always refused to admit that this was a Treaty, and he referred to the matter of the registration of the Treaty at Geneva.  In any discussion as to whether this was a Treaty or not, between us and the British, what was the outcome?  What was the outcome as to whether this was a Treaty to be ratified internationally in Geneva, or not?  The outcome was that it was ratified.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2074" /> The Attorney-General, time and again, seemed to suggest that there is threatening us all the time the British point of view that we inherited a static position.  If there was ever any attempt to argue that, on the British side, the British had to run away from it, and every development that has taken place in the last ten years has been a clear admission that no such situation existed.  We took this as a Treaty, and every act and every development that has happened since has been in accord with its being a Treaty, and in disaccord with any argument that it was not a Treaty. It has been registered in Geneva, and what the President wants now is, that, having by virtue of this Treaty, as a Treaty, won our side all through&mdash;and this Bill to my mind is essentially dishonest, and an attempt, if you like, at dishonesty on the part of the Irish people&mdash;having forced the British to agree on every occasion for the last ten years that this was a Treaty, we are now going to turn round and say: &ldquo;We were fooling you all the time. It was not a Treaty, and we are not going to be bound by anything that would bind us if it were a Treaty.&rdquo; That is the only way I can see it.</P>
    <P>This amendment, I admit, has no great appeal for me.  It is perfectly clear to every honest man that the Treaty did make the Oath mandatory, and if anybody has any doubt about that, the one person to convince him is the President.  He said here to-day, and he said on a previous occasion, that Article 4 does not make the Oath mandatory, because it was only introduced to provide for a variation of the Oath, as distinct from the Oath in Canada.  He knows perfectly well that in the Treaty discussions the whole argument was on Article 4, it being the identical Oath that is taken in Canada.  The delegates on behalf of the Irish people argued to have that Article omitted, and the British insisted on having it in.  The whole crux of the Treaty argument turned on that, but the British insisted that Article 4 should go in stating specifically that we in this Dáil should take the identical Oath taken in Canada, and President de Valera says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2075" />&ldquo;Of course, you see that it is quite clear it is not mandatory, because it was only put in to provide for a variation in the form of Oath.&rdquo;  He knows, and nobody knows better than he does, that that is absolutely contrary to truth.  He knows that the whole crisis in the Treaty negotiations was based entirely on that Article 4 providing for no variations in the Oath at all, but providing for one thing, that we should, by our Treaty obligations, be bound as a State to see that the members who came into the Dáil to legislate took an oath.</P>

      <P>The Attorney-General said something like this, that we were only able to pass the Constitution by virtue of the Treaty, and that is the answer to himself when he asks as to why this Treaty is incorporated in the Constitution.  It is the most appropriate place for it.  As this State came into existence by virtue of the Treaty, and within the limits and ambit of the Treaty, it was the most appropriate place for it.  In some cases, when a treaty is made between two countries, it may have relation to customs preference.  In that case, the provision of the treaty is incorporated in municipal law in the Finance Act, because that is the appropriate <Col N="2076" /> way, as the terms of the treaty relate to customs duties.  Our Treaty dealt with our status and our existence as an independent State, and our constitutional position, and I do not think it is even denied by the Government that the terms of the Treaty, whatever they may be, or however they are interpreted, are binding on us.</P>
      <P>The President said he thought that it would be a most disastrous thing that the judges should be put into the position of vetoing domestic law.  Of course, it would, I quite agree.  Judges will only be put into the position of vetoing domestic law when we, by our domestic law, attempt to break our international agreements.  International agreements are binding as municipal law.  If the Government want an instance of it, there is the Constitution of the United States, as I have said before, which prohibits the importation of alcoholic liquor.  If a policeman in New York arrests the captain of the &ldquo;Mauretania&rdquo; and brings him before the courts, is that captain going to be prosecuted, and the contents of his ship confiscated, according to the Constitution of America?  Of course not.  International law there is overriding municipal law, and here, also, international agreements are overriding municipal law, and rightly overriding municipal law.</P>
      <P>It has been proposed that it be taken out of the realm of municipal law, and relegated to where it belongs, to the realm of international law.  The Treaty imposed certain binding things upon us here.  How are they going to be made binding here?  Have we a special branch of international law binding on the people here?  Is there not necessarily some implementation, that when this State has entered into agreements with other countries that affect our internal affairs, and we have agreed to them internationally, as is done in thousands of treaties, they shall actually receive all the legal sanction internally that is necessary for their fulfilment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, to my mind, perfectly clear that this is a constituent Treaty.  Its fundamental purpose was to provide for the existence of the Irish Free <Col N="2077" /> State and the terms of its existence. Its existence is primarily directed by its fundamental law, which is its Constitution, and that Constitution should not, nor should any of our law, in any way contravene the terms of it.  So that it comes back to the question as to whether what is being proposed here is a violation of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied myself that the Oath is binding and that the President agrees with me.  He knows perfectly well that Article 4 has existed in the Treaty, having no relation whatever to any variation of the Oath.  He knows that if it were a fact that the taking of the Oath flowed solely from Articles 1 and 2, then there would have been no need whatever to argue that matter.  He was prepared to break with England and face the continuation of previous conditions rather than agree to Article 4 being there.  He now turns round and says that it did not matter twopence whether Article 4 was there or not, that it was only providing for a variation in the Oath; if it was not there at all there was going to be the Oath taken in Canada.  He was prepared to plunge the country into war, as he did on that very question of Article 4, and now he comes along and says that it does not matter twopence whether it is there or not, because if it were not there we would still have been bound in 1922 to take the Oath that is taken by Canada.</P>
    <P>I cannot see that either the Attorney-General or the President has made any case whatever against the amendment.  Even if this amendment were carried I am quite satisfied that we would still be breaking the Treaty, and that we would be still destined to national disaster, both from an economic point of view and the point of view of national honour.  If the President does believe what he has time and again assured the people, he will at least make it clear to the people and to the British that it is no dishonesty on his part, but only stupidity which is misleading him if he does not accept this amendment.  The amendment seeks merely, as has been pointed out by Deputy Finlay, to make the Bill conform with its title, which says that it is to remove the <Col N="2078" /> Oath from the Constitution.  He has assured us that the sole purpose of the removal of Section 2 of the Constitution Act is to prevent the question of the Oath coming before the courts.  Deputy McGilligan introduced an amendment which actually provides for what the President says he requires and, at the same time, limits it, because the President has not said, for instance, that he wants to have power here and now to remove the King from being a constituent part of the Oireachtas.  All that the amendment does is to exclude from the ambit of the Bill these other things which the President assures us he has no intention of doing until he goes before the people again.</P>
    <P>I should like to have heard either from the Attorney-General or the President some case made.  But the President, as I said earlier, only put up what he said were arguments that ought to be made on this side, and then told us about the things that the British Government might or might not do.  He did not tell us on what platform he was taking his stand.  The Attorney-General assured us that we ought to have a &ldquo;hush-hush&rdquo; policy, that we should not argue the case at all.  He expects us to sit down and be parties to passing an Act here which we believe means national dishonour and national disaster rather than to handicap the Government that ought to have negotiated with the British without any argument here, but wanted before negotiating definitely to break the Treaty so that he can go to the British with the accomplished fact, as so many people do, and say, &ldquo;I have done it now; I cannot go back on it; what else do you want?&rdquo;</P>

I think I would be expressing the view of the ordinary man in the street if I said that so far as the plain people of the country are concerned, as distinct from the dialecticians who find a way into this House, they would be very glad if this Bill were passed and removed from the realm of the caustic and recriminatory discussion which has surrounded its passage through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2079" /> One is glad to see that there has been a considerable improvement in the tone of the Cumann na nGaedheal utterances to-day.  On the last day the Bill was discussed we were told there were going to be economic and financial reprisals and all kinds of impending disaster.  To-day, I am glad to notice, there has been a good deal more moderation in the speeches, and Deputy Fitzgerald deserves to be congratulated on the rather moderate speech he delivered, as compared with the speech full of brimstone and fire he delivered on the Second Reading. In my view, both Deputy McGilligan's amendment and Deputy Finlay's amendment have been very astutely worded.  I imagine it is more to put the Labour Party in difficulties than to save the Treaty that these amendments have been introduced.  I want to assure Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Finlay that the Labour Party are going to be in no difficulty in repect of these amendments.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party will be in no difficulty in explaining their attitude towards this Bill.  They will be in no difficulty in explaining their action on the repugnancy section of the Constitution Act of 1922.  Having listened to a few of the speakers on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches saying that the Bill was a renunciation and a repudiation of the Treaty, we eventually came nearer the truth when Deputy Finlay said that the Bill opened a way for an inroad upon the Treaty.  I wonder who is expressing the Cumann na nGaedheal point of view.  Is it Deputy Finlay, who says that it opens a way for an inroad on the Treaty, or the other speakers who say that it is an attack on and a repudiation of the Treaty, putting the point of view of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party?  Deputy Finlay's speech, I think, answers effectively the allegations made by other Cumann na nGaedheal members, that the Bill is a repudiation of the Treaty. The Bill is no such thing as a repudiation of the Treaty.  Let me be quite definite in saying that the <Col N="2080" /> Labour Party do not in any way regard the passage of the Bill as a repudiation of the Treaty or an infraction of the Treaty.  Deputy Finlay said it was opening the way to inroads on the Treaty.  Perhaps it does.  But nobody questions the right of this country, if the country so wishes, to tear up the Treaty.  Even Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies admit that we have a perfect right to go out of the Commonwealth and repudiate the Treaty.  The question as to whether we will go out of the Commonwealth does not arise on this Bill.  Whether we will repudiate the Treaty by passing the Bill likewise does not arise.  These must be matters for the future, to be discussed and decided with advertence to the circumstances of the future.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan, who was a last-ditch supporter of the Treaty the last day, and would not touch anything that savoured even of breaking it to the slightest extent, has found it possible to march a certain distance now towards breaking the Treaty, because his own amendment, if carried, and related to a statement that the removal of the Oath breaks the Treaty, amounts to this: that Deputy McGilligan is perfectly prepared to give his hall-mark of approval at least to the breaking of portion of the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to Deputy McGilligan that if his amendment is carried it will be the first distinct declaration by this House that it regards the removal of the Oath as the breaking of the Treaty. The Government have not said that the removal of the oath is breaking the Treaty.  It is left for Deputy McGilligan to submit an amendment which, if carried, amounts to an inference that the Treaty is broken and that all he wanted was to limit the extent to which the Treaty was broken.  The viewpoint strongly suggested from the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches was that there should be negotiations opened up on this matter.  Perhaps in normal circumstances there might be negotiation, but one finds it difficult to understand the point of view of Deputy Hayes who now wants negotiations when during the past ten years the Party of which Deputy Hayes was a member had taken no steps to negotiate <Col N="2081" /> upon this important matter.  We heard a milk and water shilly-shally explanation as to why the Cumann na nGaedheal Party could not have opened negotiations.  If negotiation is the right policy now, it was no less the right policy in the last ten years, and if there were no negotiations in the past ten years responsibility rests with the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, who, we are told so frequently, were the greatest possible friends with the British Government.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's attitude in connection with the Oath is that it is useless and unnecessary and that Britain ought to have no right to insist upon 213 members of the Oireachtas here taking that Oath.  The Oath, and the question of whether there is not an Oath is a matter for the domestic legislation of this country.  It is not a matter that Britain ought to interfere in, and it is, I think, certainly not a matter to justify Britain using the big stick in the fashion that Mr. Thomas has wielded it in the last few months, and in particular there is no justification for the threatening manner in which he wielded it in the last week. I think Mr. Thomas's declaration last week has done a good deal to blow sky high the co-equality and free association talk we hear so much about from Deputies opposite.  Co-equality and free association is the basis of our relation with the other States of the Commonwealth, but Mr. Thomas has put the cat among the Cumann na nGaedheal pigeons when he says: &ldquo;Co-equality and free association, if I allow you to have them, and you will have just such a Constitution as I permit your State to have.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's attitude is that we have no use for this Oath.  As I said before, the Oath and the continuance of it is a fertile cause of discontent.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald made up for that and I suggest he was permitted very considerable latitude. Our view of the Oath is that it is a fertile cause of discontent and strife at home, and I think its removal will go a good way to establishing peaceful conditions in this country, and for that reason we are opposed to the Oath and are prepared to vote for this Bill in all its stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the repugnancy clause is raised and we are asked to believe that the removal of the repugnancy clause means that the whole Treaty would be invalidated; that it would be no longer a Treaty and would no longer have any value as a Treaty. But during the whole course of the world's history treaties have been negotiated between different nations. I wonder would Deputy McGilligan tell us in what cases these treaties governed the municipal law of the different nations who were parties to them.  Does he suggest, for instance, that the Treaty of Versailles governs the relations of Germany to France or of France to Germany?  The Treaty of Versailles and every other treaty has a certain standing and value, but it ought to have no value, and really in the world to-day it has no value, so far as governing municipal life or the law of a country is concerned. The Treaty will stand as an international document between the two nations.  There is no proposal in this Bill in any way to break any of the clauses of that Treaty which are mandatory as between the two nations.  The Treaty consists of articles, some of which may be said to be international articles governing our external relations with Britain and some of them certainly are domestic articles; and in the matter of domestic <Col N="2083" /> articles we have a perfect right to grow with these articles.  A nation has a perfect right to put a fair interpretation on the relationship of these domestic articles that concerns its general domestic life. There are other articles of an international character that bind the relationship of the two States.  There is no proposal in this Bill in any way to affect any one of the articles in the Treaty which can be described as international. The deletion of the repugnancy clause has this value to me, that it will put the Constitution in a position that the Constitution of this country should occupy, namely, that the Constitution should be the superior document.  Our domestic legislation ought not to be governed by the Treaty, which, because of its very character, could never adequately govern our domestic legislation.  The deletion of the repugnancy clause will make the Constitution the superior document, and I personally am standing for making the Constitution the superior document rather than making the superior document the Treaty, which, because of its character in the circumstances under which it was negotiated, is quite an unsuitable document for being made a superior document in the matter of our municipal legislation. What we advocate to-day, just the same as we advocated in 1922, is that the Constitution should be the superior document.  Ten years have passed and we are pleading to-day the very same point of view as we pleaded in 1922, namely, that the Constitution should be the superior document, and we believe that the deletion of the repugnancy clause will ensure that.</P>

      <P>I want to conclude by expressing the point of view of the Labour Party that the passage of this Bill and the deletion of the repugnancy clause is not an attack upon the Treaty; it is not an infraction of the Treaty, and in no sense justifies the dire forebodings of the Opposition Deputies.  The Labour Party takes the view that the issues which the Cumann na nGaedheal Party say are involved in this document are not involved in it. The speeches from the Opposition Benches are an attempt to play on the fears and the nerves of the people.  On a previous occasion we had the people threatened with economic and fiscal reprisals.</P>
      <P>I think the sooner this Bill is passed &mdash;the sooner the Oath is removed and the sooner the Constitution becomes the superior document of the country &mdash;the sooner we will have some kind of domestic peace.  We can certainly strengthen the constitutional position of the nation and this Legislature can get down to dealing with these economic problems which are of much more vital importance to the people than purely political questions of this character.  I want, therefore, to get rid of this Bill, to see it passed at the earliest possible moment so that the Legislature can devote its time to bread and butter questions instead of listening to the dialectics that come from the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1927" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 1, before Section 3 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2 hereof Article 10 of the Treaty of 1921 shall continue to have the force of law.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to preserve for a large number of civil servants certain rights which they acquired under the Treaty.</P>
      <P>Article 10 of the Treaty of 1921 provided: &ldquo;The Government of the Irish Free State agrees to pay fair compensation on terms not less favourable than those accorded by the Act of 1920 to judges, officials, members of police forces and other public servants who are discharged by it or who retire in consequence of the change of government effected in pursuance thereof.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Those rights were given by Article 10 of the Treaty to civil servants, but it was held in certain cases which came before the courts in this country that those rights were only enforceable or, in fact, justiciable at all in the courts or before any other tribunal by reason of the fact that Article 10 of the Treaty formed part of the municipal law of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
      <P>The effect of the repeal of Section 2 of the Constitution Act 1922 is to remove the legislative force given to the whole Treaty, and incidentally to Article 10 by the Act of 1922.  If Section 2 be repealed simpliciter as the various stages would show it will be, the effect is that Article 10 of the Treaty will no longer have the force of law or form part of the municipal law of the Saorstát.  The position then of a large body of civil servants would be this, that while certain rights were conferred upon them by Article 10 of the Treaty&mdash;the right to compensation on certain terms on their discharge, the right of certain terms of compensation on their retirement, and &mdash;perhaps the most important right in existing circumstances&mdash;the right to retire voluntarily on Article 10 terms if their further tenure &mdash;which word &ldquo;tenure&rdquo; includes their conditions of pay and emoluments&mdash;be in any way infringed.  Those rights could not be enforced by them or would not be justiciable by any court or tribunal if Article 10 of the Treaty had no longer the force of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the debate on the last amendment we heard that apparently divergent views prevailed on the Government Benches as to what enactment gave the force of law in this country to Article 10 of the Treaty, and constituted it part of the municipal law of the country.  I have said in my remarks on Deputy McGilligan's amendment that it is perfectly clear, to my mind, that the Act which gave legislative force to the Treaty, including Article 10, and which constituted it part of the municipal law, was Section 2 of the Constitution Act, 1922. The alternative suggestion made by <Col N="2089" /> the Attorney-General, and made also by the President of the Executive Council, was that legislative effect was given to the Treaty, including Article 10, by the Statute of the British Parliament, styled the Irish Free State Agreement Act of 1922.  To advance that view to the Dáil the Attorney-General has to disregard the expressed views of the Supreme Court in this country.  He has to disregard the views expressed by Judges of that Court and he has further to disregard what I suggest is the ordinary rule of interpretation, that you must read the Irish Free State Agreement Act of 1922 in conjunction with Articles 17 and 18 of the Treaty, that that Act constituted ratification by Britain of the Treaty on her part and gave her power to make the Provisional Orders stated in Article 17 of the Treaty, to transfer to the Provisional Government, which was in force in this country in the early part of 1922, the necessary machinery to enable it to carry on Government.  It is true that an additional Act was passed in the year 1929 called The Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Act, which was to give effect to an agreement which did not in any way set up as part of the municipal law here Article 10 of the Treaty. It was an agreement purely for the purpose of implementing and supplementing that Article.  If we look in the Schedule to the Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Act at the agreement set out therein, the very title of the agreement shows that it does not touch upon the question whether Article 10 of the Treaty has the effect of law here, or whether it forms part of the municipal law.  I suggest the very wording of that agreement gave the answer to any argument advanced either by the President or by the Attorney-General that the Treaty generally got the sanction of law from the Irish Free State Agreement Act, 1922.  This supplementary Treaty was executed both by England and by this country, and the title of it under their hand says: &ldquo;Agreement interpreting and supplementing Article 10 of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland to which the force of law was given by <Col N="2090" /> the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act of 1922.&rdquo;  If England were taking up the position that that was what gave the force of law to this, it was unnecessary under their own hands to add the following words: &ldquo;And by the Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) Act, 1922.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The very title of that agreement, executed by the representatives of the two countries, to my mind, shows clearly that certain legal advisers of both countries at that time, and the countries themselves, accepted that the ratification of the Treaty, so far as England was concerned, was effected by the Irish Free State Agreement Act of 1922, and so far as this country was concerned by the Constitution Act of 1922.  Such ratification forms the basis of that agreement, and it is recited that Article 10 of the Treaty has the force of law here by virtue of the Constitution Act, 1922. By virtue of that agreement certain statutory provisions were enacted to enable cases under Article 10 to be brought before a special tribunal.  But legal sanction for their being brought before any tribunal, or being enforced in any way, comes entirely from Article 10 of the Treaty having the effect of law, and being part of the municipal law of this country.  Once you do away with the force of law from Article 10, once you remove legislative sanction from it, then you do away once and for all with the foundation of this Act of 1929.  There is nothing in the Act of 1929 which says that Article 10 of the Treaty shall have the force of law.  The only provision in the Act dealing with it is that which states that &ldquo;the agreement set forth in the First Schedule to this Act, being an agreement interpreting and supplementing Article 10 of the Treaty is hereby confirmed and the Treaty shall have effect accordingly.&rdquo;  The actual sanction for the Treaty having the force of law is Section 2 of the Constitution Act, 1922.  If you remove the legislative sanction given by Section 2 then you have undoubtedly an implemented and supplementary Treaty which has the force of law by virtue of Section 2 of the Act, but the substratum <Col N="2091" /> or foundation for the supplementary agreement and for the Act of 1929 is gone.  The position is that the Articles under which these people get rights may remain a part of the Treaty, but those rights are not enforceable, not justiciable in our courts.  I am putting that forward as my view.  I do not know if a different view is held by the Attorney-General or by anyone opposite. If so, they are entitled to their view.</P>
    <P>What I say is that the position of the civil servants is such that they should certainly be left under no doubt as to their rights in the matter. They have perfectly clear legal rights at present, rights to go to court and have whatever protection is given them by Article 10 of the Treaty enforced. There should be no doubt whatever cast upon their right to go to the court or the special tribunal.  The amendment which I introduced here has simply the effect, as I suggest, of making it abundantly clear to the servants of the State that their position is in no way frittered away under the Treaty, that the rights given them under the Treaty shall remain.</P>
    <P>At this moment when, as indicated in other discussions, the Minister for Finance intends to make cuts in the salaries of civil servants, it is all the more necessary for the Government and for the House to make perfectly clear to those civil servants who have given loyal service since this country was taken over and who wish to continue in office until the natural expiration of their periods of office that their Treaty rights are preserved, that they will not have to go into court for an interpretation as to Article 10, that their rights have not been taken away and that they are not left in mid-air with no power or title to enforce their rights.</P>

      <P>I am not accepting the amendment.  I am advised that it is not at all necessary.  In fact, it is quite unnecessary.  The rights of civil servants, as a matter of law, would be determined by the Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Compensation Act, 1929.  The suggestion of Deputy Finlay that the removal of the Treaty <Col N="2092" /> from the domain of municipal law would interfere with the rights of the Civil Service is, to my mind, altogether unfounded so long as that Act is on the statute book.  He suggests that the substratum was taken away. Is he going to suggest that the substratum was taken away because of the repeal of the Act of 1920?  Is not that part of the substratum?</P>

      <P>At any rate are not the words set out definitely: &ldquo;The agreement set forth in the First Schedule to this Act being an agreement interpreting and supplementing Article 10 of the Treaty is hereby confirmed and the Treaty shall have effect accordingly&rdquo;?  Does the Deputy mean to say that the agreement incorporated in this statute can be completely wiped out?  I do not think he will get many lawyers to agree with him.  The advice I have got is altogether to the opposite effect.  I went to some care in connection with the matter, because it seemed to me that it was a case in which there might be need for municipal enactment.  The advice I have got from those who have examined the matter is that this is altogether unnecessary, that as a matter of law the rights of the persons concerned are safeguarded in this Act and that the amendment is altogether unnecessary. Our position with regard to this whole Bill is that we propose to put the Treaty, as a Treaty, in the position where treaties ought to be put.  That does not in any way take from the force of law that the Treaty has as an international instrument.  As regards municipal law, in the case of the Oath, regarded as a domestic matter, we have the right to amend without contravening the Treaty.  Here, as a matter of municipal law, the position is completely safeguarded by the Act in question.</P>

      <P>I am rather diffident about interfering in this discussion, but I think the House, in dealing <Col N="2093" /> with the rights of civil servants, should take care to act dispassionately and honestly and leave no doubt in the minds of the judiciary as to what the legislature intended.  We have had two speeches on this amendment&mdash; one by the President of the Executive Council, who is not a lawyer, and the other from Deputy Finlay, who is a lawyer.  The two opinions are definitely opposed.  In justice to the civil servants, who accepted salaries lower than they would otherwise get on the understanding that when they reached an age when they would no longer be able to serve they would receive a pension, the President should accept this amendment as giving added security to the servants of the State. The question should be above party politics.  The President bases his case on an Act passed in 1929.  That Act contained provisions protecting these people.  So far so good.  But where did the authority come from for the enactment of that Act?  It came from the Article in the Treaty specified by Deputy Finlay.  The courts, in interpreting that Act, must, as a matter of law, go back to what it was founded upon.  That is Article 10 of the Treaty.  That is my view.  It is absolutely dispassionate and it is logical, because this whole thing must be read as a code.  The judges will be coerced into reading the Treaty, and all the statutes that followed upon the Treaty, as a whole, if they are asked to adjudicate upon this question.  I would ask the President, in justice to these people, who accepted a minimum salary on the understanding that they would receive a pension in due course, to accept the amendment.  The amendment makes clear the position of the civil servants, and I think it should be accepted by the House.</P>

I presume that &ldquo;the very best legal advice&rdquo; is the advice of the Attorney-General.  It seems to me rather strange that the views of the Attorney-General are put forward not by the Attorney-General himself, but by the President of the <Col N="2094" /> Executive Council.  I am glad to see that the Attorney-General has now come into his place.  I would much prefer to hear the Attorney-General put forward his reasons in the House than that the President should get up and tell us that he was acting on the <i>ipse dixit</i> of an infallible Attorney-General. The President's point, so far as I can gather, is that, under Section 2 of the Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Compensation Act, 1929, this amendment is quite unnecessary. Section 2 is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Agreement set forth in the First Schedule to this Act, being an Agreement interpreting and supplementing Article 10 of the Treaty, is hereby confirmed, and the Treaty shall have effect accordingly.</P>
      <P>It is an agreement interpreting and supplementing the Article of the Treaty which you are completely wiping out. That is a Treaty which will have no force of law in the country once this Bill is passed.  The President said it has the force of an ordinary international agreement, but I want to know how an ordinary citizen of the State is going to enforce in any court an international agreement?  I would like to know how it is to be done?  If there is a breach of an international agreement that is a matter between nations.  It is not a matter which an individual can bring into court&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sure the Attorney-General or possibly the President will reply, and the President might allow me to argue my point without interruption.  If this Bill becomes law the Treaty has got no legal effect in this country, and in consequence any section or Act which interprets or which supplements a non-existing Article is ineffective, because the Treaty is gone and destroyed and you cannot supplement a thing which is gone.  That is the position in which the <Col N="2095" /> civil servants will find themselves.  The Treaty has no longer the force of law in this country if this Bill becomes an Act.  Because the Treaty will have ceased to be, because the whole Treaty will be repudiated and set aside by this Bill when it becomes law, any section or Act interpreting or supplementing it is non-effective.  I have already pointed out this aspect of the matter, and no attempt has been made to answer my argument that if this Bill passes the whole Treaty goes.  You cannot rely upon a section which interprets and supplements Article 10 when Article 10 itself is repealed.</P>

      <P>I fail to follow the line of reasoning adopted by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney. First of all, I would like to make this point.  Under the Free State Agreement Act, Section 1, the force of law was given to the Articles of Agreement.  The Provisional Government came into existence.  The Provisional Parliament sat as a Constituent Assembly.  What further Act was necessary in order to give the force of law to the Articles of Agreement here?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the line of argument now is that on the interpretation of Article 18 of the Treaty there is a requirement for legislation here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was not so politically minded as he now is I would make bold to say that he would not advance that argument in any competent court and that if he examined this argument as a lawyer purely and simply he would come to the conclusion that no such requirement is contained in Article 18. &ldquo;This instrument shall be submitted forthwith by His Majesty's Government for the approval of Parliament and by the Irish signatories to a meeting summoned for the purpose of the members elected to sit in the House of Commons <Col N="2096" /> of Southern Ireland and if approved shall be ratified by the necessary legislation.&rdquo; May I refer the Deputy to Article 11 of the Treaty which says: &ldquo;Until the expiration of one month from the passing of the Act of Parliament for the ratification of this instrument, the powers of the Parliament and the Government of the Irish Free State shall not be exercisable as respects Northern Ireland and the provisions of the Government of Northern Ireland Act, 1920&rdquo; and so on.  I need not repeat the whole of the Article.  There the ratification is by the Act of Parliament.  I suggest to the Deputy that it will be straining very far indeed the words of Article 18 to read into them that they make it necessary to have any Act of the Oireachtas giving the Treaty the force of law.  If these Articles of Agreement had not the force of law what was the basis of the Constituent Assembly?  Has that occurred to the Deputy to consider?  What was its basis?  How can one conceive that it would be necessary for a body brought into being and created under a certain agreement, the very existence of which depended on the terms of the agreement, to ratify the agreement <i>ex-post facto</i> in order to give it the validity of law?  It seems to be perfectly absurd.  Apart from that this particular amendment is quite unnecessary by reason of the provisions which I understand have been already referred to, that is the provisions of the Civil Service (Transferred Officers)  Compensation Act, 1929.  Deputy Finlay and Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney well know that Article 10 only gives to the transferred officers the right to fair compensation on terms not less favourable than those accorded by the Act of 1920. It only gives such compensation on the discharge by the Free State Government or by retirement in consequence of the change of Government.  That Article is obviously vague and really only lays down a loosely defined general principle.  The practical application of that Article to actual cases gave rise to numerous questions and disputes and some litigation.  After prolonged negotiations between the Free State Government, the British <Col N="2097" /> Government and the representatives of the transferred officers concerned, the draft of the Act was settled to the satisfaction of all three parties.  The agreement does not purport to confer a right to compensation.  It assumes that that right exists under Article 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>But the definition of such compensation and of such circumstances is uncertain and incomplete; in other words, it assumes that Article 10 is unworkable unless it is interpreted and supplemented.  There is nothing in the said agreement which is inconsistent with Article 10, but on the other hand, there is hardly anything in the said Agreement which is indisputably implicit in Article 10. The rights of the officers are accordingly enshrined in that Act and if it were necessary to give the force and effect of law to Article 10, I do not see how it can be argued that Section 2 does not give it the force and effect of law for the purpose of this Act. I fail to understand how it could be argued otherwise.  It may be suggested to me that relying on Section 1 of the Free State Agreement Act, as giving the force of law to the Treaty, only carries you a certain distance.  I do not agree that it is necessary to put the thing any further. But on that particular section I suggest to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney that if for a moment he will abandon his political attitude and look at it from the lawyer's point of view he will find it is carried over in Section 73 of the Constitution. Does he deny that?  If not, the force is gone from his whole case.</P>

      <P>We get ourselves into an interesting position in law as the evening wears on, and that position is contributed to particularly by the lawyer who asks everybody to deal with this matter not in a politically-minded fashion.  We had a description of that particular lawyer given by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce before that lawyer came into this House.  The present Minister asked us on one occasion, in reference to a case for the land annuities, to produce our legal authorities for the case we were making.  He added these comments: &ldquo;We would follow with interest the promotion of these people at the hands of Cumann na nGaedheal.&rdquo; Was he the lawyer who has been promoted? I wonder was it because he always judged everything in a purely legal fashion, or was it not because he rather inclined to look at legal matters occasionally from the political angle?</P>
      <P>We are told to take this matter purely in a legal fashion.  I want to take this in a legal fashion as it has been argued and compare it with the general arguments on the Oath.  On the Oath the general argument runs: &ldquo;Article 2 implies an Oath; Article 4 states the form.&rdquo; Once you wipe out Article 2, which implies the taking of an Oath, Article 4 does not matter. When you come to the civil servants the case changes.  A particular agreement gives them the rights to compensation. A second agreement interprets that.  Wipe out the agreement and you still have the interpretation. I wonder where is the logic or the law? Neither logic nor law, lest it be politically informed, could ever be brought to bear upon such an argument.</P>
      <P>We are told again by the President in a somewhat irrelevant way that in regard to this matter as in regard to the last amendment which we discussed his position is that the Treaty should not be part of the municipal law and should not over-ride the municipal law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2099" /> He has not yet explained, although asked a dozen times, why this Bill is drawn and phrased as it is.  We are told the object is to remove the obligation imposed by law on members of the Oireachtas to take an Oath.  We are told the Oath is not in the Treaty, and yet we are told that for the purpose of removing the obligation imposed by law it is necessary to remove the Treaty from the Constitution.  At least whether it is necessary or not it is being done and it is being done in that piece of legislation.  The two things are connected by the phrase &ldquo;and for that purpose.&rdquo;  For what purpose?  For the purpose of removing the obligation imposed by law upon people to take a certain Oath.  And yet we are told the Treaty does not impose the obligation, but all the same it is necessary for the purpose to remove the Treaty.  As I have said, if it is not necessary it is nevertheless being done.</P>

Taking the amendment, we have reached a peculiar position. We are told we have a foundation upon which to build an interpretation.  If you remove the foundation the interpretation stands.  I do not care whether that is so or not, but I may say that that is not what civil servants want.  The civil servants want security; they want the Treaty security.</P>

No civil servant would take office relying upon the interpretation the President would put upon anything. No civil servant would take office relying on a guarantee which would be subscribed to by that man's autograph. No civil servant would accept as secure anything on the oath of a man who <Col N="2100" /> would be prepared to swear that a certain phrase was a mere empty formula. We are told that the civil servants have got to accede to something founded on the Treaty.  What will be the position after the Treaty is removed?  We are told that the interpretation gives the civil servants all the security they want.  I am quite confident that that will not please them.  I am quite sure that that is not what the civil servants will agree to, and in the circumstances we are going to press this amendment.</P>

      <P>There is an old saying that doctors differ and patients die. <Col N="2103" /> and, to paraphrase it, one may say that lawyers differ and clients have the privilege of paying.  I suppose if one were to hand a brief to Deputy Finlay or to Deputy McGilligan in their legal capacity they could have made a very much stronger case against the point of view they expressed than in favour of that point of view.  I do not want to travel through the labyrinthine channels explored by Deputy Finlay and Deputy McGilligan, but I do want to say this: that the whole case made by both Deputies has been built up on the assumption that the Treaty is of no value whatever as between the two nations.  Their whole case is built on the assumption that the Treaty has been torn up and deposited in the waste-paper basket, and can now be forgotten as an instrument regulating the external affairs of both nations. That assumption is wholly fallacious, and is quite in accord with some of the arguments we heard on the repugnancy clause and with some of the arguments we had on the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real position of transferred officers is this: I say this as one who has had six years' association with the litigation which led up to the introduction of the Civil Service Transferred Officers Act, 1929, and the passage of the Act&mdash;that the rights of transferred officers are definitely enshrined in that Act, just in the same way as the rights of transferred municipal officers from Rathmines and Pembroke Urban Councils are enshrined in the Greater Dublin Act, and in the same way as the rights of railwaymen are enshrined in the Railway Amalgamation Act.  Their rights are there. There is a recognition of those rights in Articles 77 and 78 of the Constitution. Deputy Finlay, of course, knows perfectly well, if he would only admit it, that the rights of transferred officers as set out in the Transferred Officers (Compensation) Act, 1929, are safeguarded in a much more definite fashion by this legislation than they are safeguarded under the ordinary meaning, or even by the legal meaning of Article X of the Treaty.  We have had a definite <Col N="2104" /> assurance from the President that this is not an attempt to get behind the 1929 Act, and I think the civil servants of the country who want to continue to serve this State would very much prefer to have their rights recognised and guarded by an Act of this Legislature as it now stands than in the contentious way set out in the Treaty.  We have got a definite declaration that the rights are safeguarded in the 1929 Act.  There is no attempt whatever to interfere with whatever basis the 1929 Act has in relation to Article X of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>In any case, Deputy Finlay might have told us, assuming the passage of this Bill removes the force of law from Article X of the Treaty, that the legal people would agree that so long as Article X still had the force of law or was transferred into any subsequent legislation, that the repeal of Article X did not affect the importance or the value of that Article in any subsequent legislation into which the Article might have been embodied.  We have had a declaration from the President that the rights of transferred officers are in the 1929 Act.  I think they are adequately safeguarded in that Act, and the President has given us an assurance that he recognises that those rights are there.  I would like the President to say now definitely if he is not obstructed by the other side, that he has no intention whatever of interfering with the rights set out in that Act.</P>

      <P>I did not propose to say anything on this matter, but it strikes me as an ordinary citizen of this State that so far as civil servants are concerned before this Bill becomes law, the situation of civil servants after it has become an Act will resolve itself simply into this: In the first place, they are entitled under the courts of this country to contest any interference with the legislation that there is on the statute book of this country: they are entitled to contest any alteration of that in our courts, and they are safeguarded, and amply safeguarded, by the situation as it is in that respect. We have already this evening <Col N="2105" /> proposed to take out the operative Article in the Constitution, which enshrines that position for the civil servants, and assuming, for the moment, that all that has been said by the very learned Attorney-General, by Deputy Corry, by the President of the Executive Council, and by Deputy Norton is correct, the whole position and the whole strength of the civil servants as they stand when this Bill becomes law is enshrined in a simple Statute of this House which can be repealed with impunity by this House at any time or at any moment it so desires.  It can be either repealed or amended, according as this House desires, and there is no security whatever for the civil servants.  They are at the mercy of the Legislature, which in its direction can alter, amend or repeal that Act of Parliament.  That is certainly not their position at this moment.  They are at present safeguarded by the fact that the courts and judges of this country would pronounce as invalid any interference with their rights or privileges enshrined in Article 10, and no amount of legal casuistry can alter that fact.</P>

      <P>I did not care to intervene in this debate, particularly as it is amongst lawyers, but I think that Deputy Norton, as a layman like myself, has been too clever with regard to his quotation of Article 77 and Article 78.  If he looks at them, he will see that the first Article simply says: &ldquo;Every existing officer of the Provisional Government shall, etc., become an officer of the Irish Free State and shall hold office by a tenure corresponding to his previous tenure,&rdquo; and the next Article says that such existing officer shall be entitled to the benefit of Article 10 of the Treaty, but if Article 10 goes or is interfered with in any way or loses the force of law, both Article 77, and particularly Article 78, cease to have any meaning as far as my lay mind can interpret it.  Deputy Norton was therefore altogether wrong in saying that their position was preserved by that Article.</P>

      <P>I have no desire to be <Col N="2106" /> numbered with the lawyers in my intervention in this debate, either on this amendment or the last amendment. I resist the proposal in respect of which this amendment has been moved because I, in common with every other literate man in the country, can read the King's English, and the King's English said that the Constitution Act of 1922 gave force of law to the Treaty, and I say that President de Valera got no mandate to reverse that.  If he extracted Section 2 and Section 3, and went to the country on those sections alone, divorced completely from Section 1, which repeals the Oath, would President de Valera get a verdict from the country?  I say that I do not believe there is any appreciable percentage of members on the Government Benches who believe he would, and, therefore, while I disagree with the principle of moving amendments of the kind proposed from the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches, because I think it clouds the issue, I say that, in this amendment, there is a double duty to the nation, part of which is our duty to preserve the security of the civil servants who came over from the old Service, and who have discharged their duties with great credit and honour to this country, in the new circumstances.</P>
      <P>It is our duty to express emphatically that we bitterly resent any attempt to imperil their security.  They stood to the country when the country badly wanted them, and they have served this country very well.  It is our duty now to protect them in any way we can.  I still believe, however, that we might have done that quite as effectively, and in a way the people would understand more clearly, if we simply took up the position that we are absolutely opposed to Sections 2 and 3 of this Bill and determined to reject them, if we can, altogether, for the reason that they had no place in this Bill.  I certainly do not believe that President de Valera had ever any mandate to introduce them and to force them through this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We now find ourselves at the Final Stage of this Bill, and again I want to call attention to the phraseology of it.  The short title of the Bill is &ldquo;Constitution (Removal of Oath) Bill, 1932,&rdquo; and the long title <Col N="2111" /> of it is&mdash;again I want to stress the phraseology&mdash;&ldquo;An Act to remove the obligation now imposed by law on members of the Oireachtas and Ministers who are not members of the Executive Council to take an Oath, and for that purpose to amend the Constitution and also the Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) Act, 1922.&rdquo;  We had this Bill spoken to on Second Reading by the President in the form which I already quoted to-day: that Fianna Fáil had put forward a manifesto to the people of the country and put it forward, he said, in very explicit terms, stating the policy they would endeavour, if elected, to put into operation.  The quotation from the manifesto was, that the first item on that programme was to remove the Article of the Constitution which makes the signing of an Oath of Allegiance obligatory on members entering the Dáil.  He followed that up by stating that further on the manifesto said:</P>
      <P>We pledge ourselves that if elected in a majority we shall not in the field of international relations exceed the mandate here asked for without again consulting the people.</P>
      <P>Where are we in regard to this measure?  What is it it is held to put in, and what is it it is held to be removing? We started with the idea that the Oath was not mandatory, that the phrase &ldquo;to be taken&rdquo; did not imply an obligation, but gave people an option.  As the debate went on, and indeed as the correspondence with the British went on, we advanced to other arguments.  But we do find in the correspondence with the British that the first Note said that the position of the Government was as stated, that the Oath is not mandatory in the Treaty.  The first Note said, in addition to that:</P>
      <P>Besides the legal and constitutional consideration there is another and paramount consideration more than sufficient in itself to make the Government's decision final and irrevocable.... The abolition of the Oath was the principal and the dominating issue before the electors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2112" /> It continues:</P>
    <P>And even if the British Government held the view that the Oath is mandatory in the Treaty they must recognise that such a test and imposition on the conscience of the people is completely out of place in a political agreement between two countries.</P>
    <P>The first part of the argument was that the Oath was not mandatory, and the second part was, whether it is held to be mandatory or not, we have got to remove it.</P>
    <P>The second paragraph in the third Note of the series climbed down a little bit.  It says:</P>
    <P>Whether the Oath was or was not an integral part of the Treaty made ten years ago is not now the issue.  The real issue is that the Oath is an intolerable burden to the people of this State, and that they have declared in the most formal manner that they desire its instant removal.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 5 of that Note says:</P>
    <P>The competence of the Legislature of the Irish Free State to pass such a measure is not open to question and has been expressly recognised by the British Legislature itself.</P>
    <P>That is a point upon which we had very little if any argument.  It continues:</P>
    <P>It is the intention of my Government, therefore, to introduce immediately on the reassembly of Parliament a Bill for the removal of Article 17 of the Constitution, and for such consequential changes as may be required to make the removal effective.</P>
    <P>I read that because I want again to emphasise that the Bill is to remove an obligation imposed by law, and for that purpose to remove Section 2 of the Constitution Act.  That is what was described in the Note as the consequential changes that were required to make the removal effective. How can anybody faced with this phrase, and the particular collocation of clauses in that Bill, argue that the Oath is not in the Treaty, <Col N="2113" /> and that the removal of the Oath from the Constitution is not a breach of the Treaty?</P>
    <P>The argument changed as the days went on.  As far as the Attorney-General is concerned, all that his legal lore was able to bring to our assistance is the analogy with what he assumes was done with regard to the Privy Council.  As far as the President is concerned, we have mainly two arguments.  One is that if the Oath was ever made mandatory on us, it was made mandatory by Article 2 of the Treaty, and that Article 4 was only put in because the form of Oath is different from what it would have been if there had been reliance upon Article 2 alone. The second argument that the President got to is the one introduced tonight and, as usual, it has two legs. He said with regard to the removal of the Treaty from the Constitution that his purpose was to see that the Treaty would no longer have the force of law in this country, and, therefore, would not be justiciable by our judges.  When we came to discuss the last amendment, we were told by our Attorney-General, and his phrase was not denied by the President, but, in fact, was approved of by him, that the Treaty is law in this country because the Constitution Act passed by Great Britain in March, 1922, gripped by Article 73 of our Constitution and consequently now carried into this State is law, and is law which can be interpreted by judges.  Which is the argument upon which we are to stand?  Which is the argument upon which the case is to be presented to the British?</P>
    <P>May I take the first, the analogy of the Privy Council?  I do not at all object to what has happened in some respects.  Imitation is said to be the sincerest form of flattery, and when the Attorney-General of this separatist Government proceeds to follow in my footsteps I regard that as meaning a compliment, although I would not like to take it as such.  It is not necessary to steal my boots in order to walk in my footsteps.  If a man puts on my boots and they are too small for him his style is going to be cramped, and if <Col N="2114" /> he puts the boots on the wrong feet he is going to find that his constitutional gait is going to be nothing but an ungainly walk.  What has the Attorney-General done with regard to the Privy Council?  He has made, and stayed upon, a false analogy throughout.  I argued previously that the great distinction between the two cases was, that one was explicit and the other, if in the Treaty at all, was only implied. The President's argument against this was that to him the thing being explicit or implied was as the difference between Tweedledum and Tweedledee.</P>
    <P>The man who could describe his signature as an autograph will not see very many distinctions between things that are implied and things that are explicit, but when one comes to the consideration of a document of an international character these things count.  If the Privy Council were ever in our State under the Treaty it was only by constructional effort under Article 2.  Even if it were there, it was there with a very definite assurance that the Privy Council jurisdiction was being limited, and, as was said in the first case ever tried before the Privy Council by Lord Haldane, it was becoming more or less as the Dominions chose.  We raised that point.  When cases were brought before the Privy Council and leave to appeal was sought we did introduce legislation in this House, legislation which the Attorney-General of this State described as the backdoor method of getting rid of the Privy Council.  It is a pity he did not fortify himself with the legal opinions on the other side with regard to that. Lord Cave in the House of Lords said that it was a perfectly constitutional action we took in the case of Lynam v. Butler.  The records of the Imperial Conference reports are full of the statement. The same Lord Chancellor said to us in 1926 that we had discovered a most effective and ingenious method of removing the Privy Council, and, on a later occasion, when the Bray case came to the consideration of the House of Lords, another Lord Chancellor was found to say that our action in regard to this particular method of legislation was quite in accord with our constitutional rights. <Col N="2115" /> Has the Attorney-General got any statement of that type from any British lawyer in regard to what it is proposed to do on the Oath?  Although we had those statements we realised that that was not the best way of dealing with Privy Council matters. What did we do?  We did not proceed to get a half-hearted opinion passed by the Attorney-General of the State that there were two opinions about these matters and that we could take the one which pleased us.  We did not found on such half-hearted statements as that, draft legislation and pass it in the teeth of British opposition.  We negotiated during the years prior to 1926 and we got our effects in 1926. We negotiated prior to 1929, and in 1929 and 1930 and up to June of last year there were negotiations and parleys with the British in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>The Attorney-General makes the point to-day that we had presented to us a piece of legislation in regard to the Privy Council similar to what is now before this House in regard to the Oath.  I was not here to hear the phraseology he used, but I should like to hear what was the turn that was given to that.  We had a piece of legislation prepared by us which was quite constitutional, which was quite in accord with what had been done previously, an Act to enforce the judgments of the Supreme Court in this country, an Act which could have been declared to be constitutional founded upon statements like those of Lord Cave and Lord Sankey and which, if introduced into this House, would have effectively stopped the Privy Council from hearing any case.  We wanted to investigate what would happen if we went any further and we did find exactly what is in that Bill, and we concluded that if we brought in a piece of legislation of that sort, even though the cases are not on all fours, and even though the reading of the Privy Council into our Constitution and the Treaty was only by implication&mdash;we did make up our minds that if we introduced that piece of legislation the argument might be used that we were committing a breach of the <Col N="2116" /> Treaty, and we brought in no such piece of legislation.  We decided not to bring in any such piece of legislation, and we proceeded with our negotiations.</P>
    <P>As I said previously on the Second Stage, and I repeat it, if and when the President and his Attorney-General can get to the same point almost of unanimity with regard to the disappearance of the Oath from the Treaty or the Constitution as we had got with regard to the disappearance by consent of the Privy Council from our Constitution, then we will give him the full support not merely of the people who are here but of our followers throughout the country.</P>

      <P>No, the President would not accept that.  He thinks that the best thing to do is to go ahead and the difference between us is clear from that.  We want to keep the Treaty and to bring about any modifications that may have to be made in it by consent.  The President has no regard for the Treaty.  He is positively out to destroy the Treaty.  The Privy Council cannot be quoted as any analogy for what is happening here. If the Privy Council is to be quoted, it has to be quoted in regard to what can be done by the process of negotiation with regard to getting ambiguity removed.  It can be quoted as an example of how successfully negotiations can be carried on to a very far point indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President's second argument was that if the Oath was in the Treaty at all, it is implied in the status article, Article 2, and that Article 4 only gives the form.  A man, they say, cannot take a libel action against himself, which is a good thing. Otherwise the President might be forced to move in the courts against himself on a particular matter. Article 4 would not be there according to the President, only that if it were not there, Article 2 would have brought in not merely the Oath of Allegiance but the exact Oath of Allegiance which was in Canada.  That <Col N="2117" /> was the President's argument on a particular stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>He said on the 29th of April:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On December 3rd, 1921, when the Irish delegates who were sent to London came back to report, and when they brought the latest British proposals to us, I remember there were three or four Articles before they came to the Oath.  Then there was the Oath.  It was not this form of Oath at all; it was the direct form of Oath that you have in Canada and Australia.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And the President is going to argue at a later stage with the British that Article 2 gave you that Oath and that Article 4 was only necessary because the form was different to what they had in Canada.  He can be faced with his own argument, that the final proposals contained Article 2 but did not contain Article 4, exacting the Oath that the Canadian Parliament has to take.  What becomes of the argument that Article 4 is only necessary because the form of the Oath is different to what is being taken in Canada?</P>
    <P>To-night, as I say, we have got the last argument, the argument that it was necessary to remove the Treaty from being the law in this country, that Treaties are not generally made part of the municipal law, that it was necessary to put this Treaty in the position in which Treaties ordinarily are&mdash;something outside the ordinary law, something at any rate that the judges cannot hear and decide cases upon.  That may be the stuff to give to the Republican troops. But we have another argument. When the Civil Service question was being debated, and when something in the nature of a restorative had to be given to Deputy Norton, we had the statement that there is a provision in the British Act of March, 1922, and that that is gripped by Article 73 of the Constitution, is consequently the law here, and has not been repealed here.  That is the mush to give, not to the Republican troops, but to the Labour camp-followers. These are the two arguments.  On which does the President lean?  Is the Treaty part of the law in this <Col N="2118" /> country as having been gripped by Article 73 of the Constitution when it was passed by the British legislature? Or is the Treaty now repealed from having the force of law by dint of what we are doing here? They have taken, according to the Note, a final and irrevocable decision. And what is it based upon?  The President's opening statement on the second reading was that he proposed scrupulously to honour his pledge to remove the Article of the Constitution which makes the signing of the Oath obligatory on members entering the Dáil.  He continued:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We said in the Note that the Article that imposed the Oath, made the Oath obligatory on the members, was not required by the Treaty.  That statement was inserted after having given the matter the fullest attention and consideration and having consulted authorities whose views, on account of their eminence, we were bound to consider as worthy of acceptance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have not heard who these authorities were, but they are referred to again.  The President said at a later stage:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no doubt whatever. Every lawyer I have asked agrees upon that&mdash;that we have the right under the Treaty to pass this Bill and to make it law and to take away this restriction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Attorney-General is to be considered an authority whose view, on account of its eminence, is to be considered worthy of acceptance, or whether he is merely one of the other lawyers whom the President asked on the subject.  And what is the Attorney-General's opinion on the 29th April?  Speaking on the 29th April he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;First on the question as to whether the Oath is obligatory or not, I admit that there are two views.  Any lawyer would be silly on a difficult question which has been discussed over several years to lay down positively that his own interpretation of certain things is absolutely the correct one.  I admit that there are two views.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2119" /> Was that the type of advice that was given to the President by these men whose authority is of such eminence that we are bound to accept it, or was that the opinion given to him by every lawyer whom he asked?  Where does the Attorney-General stand vis-á-vis him in this?  At any rate, the Attorney-General does state openly in the House, with regard to the point as to whether the Oath is obligatory or not, that there are two views.  Further, he says that it would be silly to lay down positively that his own interpretation of certain things is absolutely the correct one.  Yet, that being the legal adviser of the Government, the Government decided to write a Note to the British to say that their decision to remove the Oath is final and irrevocable, and that there will be no negotiations about that point.  May I say to them that they are wise from one angle, that if they had to parade as their chief legal opinion, after having taken this final and irrevocable step, a man who says that it would be silly to say that his interpretation of a particular thing was correct, and a man who would also say that he had to admit that there were two views, I do not know where the negotiations would be likely to end.</P>
    <P>There are going to be no negotiations on this point.  That is one thing that is certain.  There are going to be no negotiations on this side of this measure becoming law.  The President is not going to get himself into handigrips with the British.  In fact, I doubt very much if the President on any occasion will get himself into handigrips with the British.  When the day comes that somebody has got to get into handigrips with the British that will be the President's day off, a day for his self-inflicted penance, to look into his own soul, a day upon which he will ponder what Lincoln or Wilson might have done in similar circumstances. The President will be an absentee again.  It is well, reasonable and good that he should be an absentee if negotiations have ever to be conducted. Look at the position in which the President stands in the eyes of any person who wants to make a Treaty, enter into an obligation or undertaking, <Col N="2120" /> or have an understanding on anything. He has told us that he signed the Oath.  It was an autograph.  He has told us, at any rate, that the Oath was nothing, it was a formula, it was empty.  About 400 years before Christ was born a pagan poet said very much the same thing.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My tongue is sworn,&rdquo; said Euripedes, &ldquo;but my sould is not sullied by any oath.&rdquo;  And a pagan audience laughed a serious play off the stage because of that very phrase.  It was regarded as such a remarkable phrase by a comic playwright that he afterwards took it up and it ran as a theme through several of his plays, and the Athenians of a later day, who still were pagan&mdash;it was before Christ was born&mdash;laughed it off the stage because they regarded is as ridiculous even in a comic play to introduce the phrase, &ldquo;My tongue has sworn, but my mind is still unsullied by any oath.&rdquo;  And schoolboys right down along the ages have chuckled over the folly of that statement. Who is the President to make any agreement with anybody?  Leave out anything in the way of the sanctity of an Oath in this matter. Merely put it on the basis of an ordinary contract, a thing that a man signs and agrees to do.  Who hereafter would ever, with any security, make a contract with the President of this State?  His tongue can swear but his soul will be unsullied by any oath.  His signature was an autograph in a newspaper.  Governments do not go in for autograph collecting. They go in for getting the signatures of honourable men to agreements which they want decently and honourably observed.  This country has had a peculiarly mournful but very interesting and very bright history. The darkest period we ever went through was the period of the Penal Laws, the period when there was sought to be forced on the people of this country when they were out to achieve property rights of any description such things as the Oath of Abjuration, or such things as the Sacramental Test; and men lost all their property rather than submit to that oath, or rather than submit to <Col N="2121" /> that test.  And we have been fools, we in this generation, looking back with respect to the men who behaved in that way when they decided to forego all their property rights rather than conform to something that did not please them.  It was left to somebody in this State to show us the folly of these men.  All they had to do was to say something, to sign something, and call it an autograph. All they had to do was to go and conform with all the mental reservations that even the Church people spoke of in these days, and there was no need for what was called perversion, there was no need for hardship on the Catholics of these days.  It was left to the person who now leads this State to show us how foolish these people were in these olden days and to show us an easy way out of the difficulties that were then around them.  It has still to be said that if he has shown us an easy way, it is not an honourable way of avoiding obligations that the people have taken upon themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the speech that we have just listened to is the last of the sort that we will have in this country.  There are two ways of looking at everything and two ways of looking at things that come up for consideration in this House regarding the relations between this country and Britain.  There is the Irish point of view and the British point of view. There are two ways in which the Opposition can act&mdash;as an Irish Opposition or as an adjunct to British Imperialism. I hope that the Opposition here to-night on all sides will not allow themselves to be carried away by the bitterness that has been attempted to be engendered, but will act as a real Irish Opposition, and that when a decision is taken on the question of international relations they will act as the Opposition would act in Germany, in France, or in any other country where, although they might differ regarding the actions of the Government at the time, at least, when it was a question between their country and some other country, they would throw their whole weight behind the Government.  This <Col N="2122" /> Bill had to go through in all its stages. It was a necessary evil, I suppose, after all these years, that we should have discussed it in detail, and that on the Committee Stage the Opposition should have endeavoured to get certain clauses deleted.  I deliberately took no part in the debate.  I kept out of the House most of the time, because when people say bitter things naturally one wants to say bitter things in return. On a question of international relations I think we should not do that, but should endeavour to do our best to extract the utmost for our country. This Bill was passed en bloc on the Second Reading and was passed section by section on the Committee Stage.  Every amendment moved by the Opposition was defeated by a majority vote.  This Bill is national policy.  It has been passed by a majority vote of the representatives of the Irish people who are entitled to come to this House.</P>
      <P>I hope that members of the Opposition will remember some of their phrases and some of their actions of the past.  They will remember the words, &ldquo;the will of the people,&rdquo; and they will remember what actions they felt themselves justified in taking in the name of &ldquo;the will of the people.&rdquo; Every line of this Bill has been passed by the votes of the majority of the representatives of the Irish people entitled to come here, and therefore should be treated by an Irish Opposition as national policy.  Every man jack of the Opposition should throw his weight behind the Government in seeing that this Bill goes through, even though they disagree with the way the Government has initiated it or with the arguments by which it was carried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To me the removal of this Oath means a great deal.  A number of Deputies on the opposite benches will know perfectly well that I did my utmost after the signing of the Treaty to get national unity by endeavouring to get the Oath omitted from the Constitution. They will remember that at the end of the civil war I did my utmost to secure national unity by getting the I.R.A. to agree that if the <Col N="2123" /> Oath was deleted from the Constitution and if the Dáil would say that all legal authority and all right to legislate came exclusively from the people they would accept majority rule.  I have always held that the civil war was a frightful thing, and I did everything in my power to prevent it.  In the last analysis I have held that those of us on both sides were not to blame but were the victims of British policy.  Many of the members opposite can vouch for the fact that I am not saying all this now in order to get any support for this Bill, because they will remember a document I sent to the members of the I.R.A. who were serving the Provisional Government on 3rd August, 1922.  I suppose the document could easily be changed, but I am going to read it in order to get back the spirit which has been lost to a large extent by the clashes that took place.  This is what I said to the I.R.A. who were serving in the forces of the Provisional Government on 3rd August, 1922:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Comrades,&mdash;It is a dark hour in our country's history when we of the I.R.A. are fighting each other and the enemy still unbeaten.  In July, 1921, we were the finest military organisation since the Fianna, proud of our cause, our dead heroes and living comrades, confident in the knowledge that our willing sufferings and deaths were bringing our country towards freedom in our generation. In July, 1922, we find ourselves, through the trickery of our common enemy, in two camps, using all our talents and energy in fighting, abusing, and even maligning each other.  We are the same men; the difference is, as an old priest said, that war with the foreigner brings to the fore all that is best and noblest in a nation, civil war all that is mean and base.</P>
    <P>Now, there is good and evil in all of us.  We must cultivate the good, destroy the evil, and rectify our mistakes. At present we are tempted to a dishonourable peace with England. It is not through lack of personal courage that some of our <Col N="2124" /> officers would accept the oath of allegiance, but because they are influenced by the fear of terrible sufferings for the country they love. That is our big National mistake, and the cause of the civil war.  We must put this mistake behind us and go forward.  The degradation and barrier to National Independence which would result from the taking of the Oath to England and acceptance of the Constitution must be avoided.  The sufferings and deaths of the past months will not have been in vain if the Provisional Government, and you who are with them, realise the mistake that was about to be made.</P>

      <P>Before it.  Unfortunately my words were not heeded then, and the civil war came and went.  I wish to repeat here that if the representatives of the Irish people have only learned the lessons the civil war should have taught us, then the sufferings and death of the civil war will not have been in vain.  Terence MacSweeney said a thing which is worth repeating:</P>
      <P>Our enemies are our brothers from whom we are estranged.  Here is the fundamental truth that explains and justifies our hope of reestablishing a real patriotism among all parties in Ireland and a final peace with our ancient enemy of England.</P>
      <P>We should remember what Pearse said:</P>
      <P>Any undertaking made in the name of Ireland, to accept in full satisfaction of Ireland's claim anything less than what the generations of Ireland have stood for is null and void, binding on Ireland neither by the law of God nor the law of Nations.</P>
      <P>Terence MacSweeney also said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We fight for Freedom ... we stifle for self-development individually and as a nation.  If we don't go forward, we must go down. <Col N="2125" /> It is a matter of life and death: it is our soul's salvation.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the members of the Opposition to go forward to-night as the people of the Twenty-six Counties through their representatives have decided to go forward.  By a majority of their representatives they have declared for this Bill, and those who fought so long and so hard for the will of the people to operate, I hope will be at least logical and consistent, and say now that this Bill has received the assent of the majority of the elected representatives, they will allow it to go through without further opposition.  I hope that when the Oath is gone we will go forward.  It is absolutely necessary to get rid of the Oath in order that all shades and sections of political opinion can come in here, and that all questions, social, national and economic should be decided by the representatives of the people without injustice and without violence.</P>

      <P>I recognise the restrictions of a final reading debate, and I shall detain the House only a few minutes.  I should not like this debate to come to an end without reminding the Government that there is a case against this Bill besides the case based on the Treaty.  I cannot expect them to pay much attention to an obscure individual like myself, but, in speaking both on the First Reading and on the Second Reading of this Bill, and in any speeches I have made in connection with it in my own constituency, I have not based myself on the Treaty.  I have not even based my opposition to the Bill on the relations between Ireland and Great Britain. My case has not been the same as Mr. Thomas's case, nor has it borne any resemblance to Mr. Thomas's case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I should like the Government to do&mdash;the speech I have just listened to impresses it more upon my mind than ever&mdash;is to try to forget the Treaty and the feelings arising out of the Treaty, and to look on this question like commonsense men, like business men, like men of goodwill.  These debates have now dragged on for a long time, and in a few weeks two or three representatives <Col N="2126" /> of the Government will be setting out for Ottawa.  Why would it not be the natural thing, the decent thing, the reasonable thing, and the friendly thing for them to make a communication now to the other members of the British Commonwealth that they wish to raise a question at Ottawa as to what, in future, shall be the form and the method in which we shall give expression to those obligations of loyalty and friendliness to the other members of that partnership which it is our duty to observe?</P>
    <P>I have pointed out in my previous speeches on this Bill that it is not necessary to consider exactly how we got into the partnership of the British Commonwealth.  Assuming we are there, why not behave with decency and friendliness to the other parties? What have we to lose by it?  Nobody objects on principle to the removal of the Oath if it can only be done in a decent kind of way.  The Government would have the support of everybody if they entered into negotiations about it at Ottawa, or if they had entered into negotiations with the British Government.  Nobody wants the Oath for its own sake.  Nobody attaches any special value to the Oath.  I put it to the Government that if they could succeed in getting the representatives of the various Dominions at Ottawa to agree to a common form, or to agree as to what would be the most acceptable expression of our obligations to the other partners, they would have no cause to worry about the Treaty.  There is very little doubt that the British Government would be perfectly willing to alter the Treaty in any way acceptable to the general body of opinion at the conference at Ottawa.  What is there against that natural and courteous manner of proceeding?  I suggest that there is nothing at all against it, except that we lash ourselves into fury with all sorts of bogeys and all sorts of catch-words.  Equality!  What is the necessity for all this pother about equality?  How does the question of equality arise?  If a number of friends are sitting round the dinner table, is it necessary for one who wants to assert his equality to put his boots up on the <Col N="2127" /> table?  Bad manners are not the proper way to assert equality.  Nobody has challenged our equality.  A conscience test!  How much is there in this talk about a conscience test? What exactly is a conscience test? Is it an invention of the brutal British?  Was the I.R.A. or the I.R.B. or the Republican oath a conscience test?  Let us suppose it was justifiable in these organisations to have a conscience test.  But we can point to others.  If a visitor goes to listen to a debate in the British House of Commons, he has&mdash;at least he had when I was there last time&mdash; to sign an undertaking not to make a disturbance.  Is that a conscience test?  When I was in a business partnership, I had to sign partnership articles and undertake to behave in a loyal and decent manner to my partner.  Was that a conscience test? Is every kind of contractual relation in life to be regarded as a conscience test?  What about people who go on a visit to America.  If you go into the great free Republic of the West, you have always to undergo a conscience test&mdash;even if you go only for a few days.  The President of the Executive Council must have submitted to that conscience test frequently.  Even the most logical and consistent man sitting on those benches&mdash;Deputy Breen&mdash;must have submitted to it.  A person entering the United States, even for a few days, must sign a declaration that he is not a polygamist, that he is not an anarchist, that he is not in favour of overthrowing organised government by force, that he is not in favour of killing any member of any organised Government in the world because of his official position.  Deputy Breen signed that.</P>

      <P>It was an empty formula.  In face of all these conscience tests cropping up at every turn in life, are we really justified in saying that there is something inherently unreasonable in requiring men who come here to legislate, men who come here to handle the lives and <Col N="2128" /> fortunes of their fellow-citizens, to make some declaration of loyalty to the institutions of the State?  Is it unreasonable that there should be a certain solemnity about our coming in here? That is on the internal side; and on the external side, bearing in mind our position in the British Commonwealth, is it unreasonable that we should make some kind of promise of loyalty to our obligations as partners in the Commonwealth? For my part, I have no wish to insist that there should be an oath or declaration of any kind, but I do say that if our fellow-partners in the Commonwealth wanted such a declaration that it is absurd to suggest that there is something tyrannical in having it.  Let the Government think about what would be decent and reasonable in the way of a declaration and let them try to arrange with the other members of the Commonwealth to have that introduced.</P>
      <P>There is a saying of Edmund Burke which all my life has been a source of consolation and hope to me. It is this: &ldquo;When the thing called a country is once formed in Ireland quite other things will be done than are done when the minds of men are turned to the interests of a Party and when they think those interests provided for by the destruction of everything else.&rdquo;  The thing called a country is not yet formed in Ireland and it cannot be formed until we bundle away into oblivion the ridiculous bogeys and catch-cries that do duty for political thought in this country.</P>

      <P>We need to mature and mellow our outlook and set our <Col N="2129" /> feet in the paths of kindliness and reason.  If only we would really put our minds and our hearts into the task of introducing into Ireland a little of the spirit of Saint Francis of Assisi, I think we would be astonished at the results.  I think there is no section of our people, not even the Orangemen of Belfast, whom I know well and whom I fought, and not the I.R.A. or Saor Eire or any other section of our people, who could not be welded into one group and brought into one family in Ireland if we would only allow counsels of reason to prevail, and if we would only change our political atmosphere and get rid of the division of political parties founded on nothing else but bitter memories of the Treaty and the Civil War.  It is because I believe that this Bill&mdash;whatever the President may say &mdash;has its origin in two hatreds&mdash;hatred of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and hatred of England&mdash;that I object to it.  It is because the procedure that the President of the Executive Council is taking for the removal of the Oath&mdash;is just the kind of brutal nationalism and egotism that is denounced this morning in the Encyclical of Pope Pius XI&mdash;that I deplore it so much.  I beg the Government, even at this late hour, to change their minds and to hold up this Bill until their representatives have been to Ottawa, and behave to our partners in the Commonwealth with ordinary loyalty and decency.</P>
      <P>The last speaker has urged that at this stage everyone should throw in his lot with the Government and support them in a national issue.  But this Bill is not yet law.  I do not know whether it is going to become law; personally, I hope it will not.  If an appeal to the Government to act reasonably fails, I would welcome an appeal to the country.  It cannot come too soon for me.  I do not believe that the country is behind the Government in this Bill.  I do not for a moment believe that.  I would welcome the giving of a chance to the people to reverse the decision they gave at the last election.  I would welcome an opportunity of appealing from Ireland drunk to Ireland sober.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech of the Minister for Defence was in tone reasonable, but I do not think it was at all so reasonable in substance.  He referred back to the document he issued in 1923.  But that document was in substance an invitation to those to whom it was addressed to tear up the Treaty.  I am afraid that the Minister for Defence is still of the same mind as he was in 1922 or 1923.  In so far as we are concerned, our view about the Treaty is entirely different from that of the Minister for Defence.  We do not think that the Treaty was a defeat, and we do not think that there was anything in the Treaty that we need to be ashamed of or sore over. The Treaty represented an extraordinary, and, I would venture to say, an unparalleled victory.  I do not think it ever before happened in any country in the world that a great military and naval power surrendered territory which it had held for centuries without having been beaten in the field.  And it is well to remember that it was not beaten; that, in fact&mdash; and it is no derogation of the heroism of the men engaged in the Volunteers, to say so&mdash;that from the military point of view what was done at that time against that power was absolutely negligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely in these circumstances the Treaty represents a great victory.  It was not that we surrendered independence, because we had not got independence. There was not a square yard of our soil that we securely held.  It was not that we surrendered a Republic, because except from a propagandist point of view there was no Republic.  There was no State here let alone a particular form of State.  We therefore surrendered nothing except a claim if you like or a propagandist position.  We gained everything material.  We gained control of our territory, this Free State territory. We gained control absolutely of our own affairs.  The Treaty is therefore for us a great charter of liberty.  It is quite different from any other Treaty of peace that a nation which liberated itself might have signed, because in other cases they had driven out the foreigner, either by their own <Col N="2131" /> arms or by the aid of their allies.  We had no allies to help us, and so far as we got rid of our enemies it was by the Treaty.  The winning of the Treaty therefore is something of which we have every reason to be proud.</P>
    <P>I believe this Treaty, unlike others, ought to be part of our municipal law. I have heard arguments against judges interpreting ordinary treaties as a part of the municipal law, but this is no ordinary Treaty.  This Treaty brought into being a State of which the people have control, a State which they never, as far as one could see, the people whom we were hoping to help us having been beaten in the Great War, could hope to establish; a State which there was not a shadow or prospect of establishing through any efforts of our own.  I would like to know, and it would have some influence on all our minds if we knew, what is the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash;if we had that stated explicitly&mdash;in regard to the Treaty.  The President declined, as far as I could see, to answer the question put to him as to where we are going.  If it is only the question of the Oath, and if the Fianna Fáil Party is willing to work the Treaty and to stand on the Treaty position&mdash;if the Oath were gone, if that is definitely their policy&mdash;then this whole legislation has a different aspect from what it had in the light of the President's answer, which was extremely dubious.</P>
    <P>If the Fianna Fáil Party are prepared to stand on the Treaty position and work the Treaty, there is no need at all for proceeding in this way in regard to the Oath.  A great deal of water has flown under the bridges since 1923.  Undoubtedly the position of public opinion in England, if no steps were taken to arouse enmity to us, is very different from what it was in 1921-22.  The British, through many generations of their history, had had their regiments of troops here and they had some sort of control of the country. Undoubtedly it was a very hard thing for them to give up all they had.  A proposal to change the Treaty immediately after the Treaty was signed would undoubtedly have met with <Col N="2132" /> resistance and possibly would have involved this country in another round. No proposal for a change of the Treaty would have been entertained.</P>
    <P>In minor respects we have seen the Treaty modified on more than one occasion, and if this Government were prepared to negotiate on this question of the Oath I have no doubt they could get very far with it.  They might succeed in getting an amendment of the Treaty removing the Oath.  I would not be surprised if they were able to get that provided their position was that they stood by the Treaty, and that they accept the place we have in the Commonwealth of Nations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Because we had no interest in it.  We thought that many of the things with which we were concerned when in office were of much greater importance than the Oath.  We regarded the Oath as of no importance. We thought the Privy Council, which had a very practical effect in our daily life and a very big influence on the jurisdiction of our courts, was a much more important thing to remove and that the Oath affected nobody.  If the Treaty is to be set aside, if the policy of Fianna Fáil is directed to tearing up the Treaty, and if the Oath is the first step, then the Minister for Defence has even gone back on the position that he occupied in 1922.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as we are concerned, we think, looking at the matter not merely from the point of view of the economic needs of the nation, but from the broader point of view, that the prospect of the restoration of national unity depends at the present juncture on our maintaining our position in the British Commonwealth of Nations. If we get out of it, whether we deliberately go out and proceed to establish a twenty-six county Republic here, or whether we allow ourselves to get into such a relationship with the other members of the Commonwealth that we are eventually expelled, then in my opinion the country will be facing a very serious situation.  If we have a twenty-six county Republic established there is no prospect that at any time we will <Col N="2133" /> have a reunion.  One cannot see a prospect of anything like that coming about immediately.  On the other hand, I deny the statement by the Minister for Finance that there is some sort of a Republican spirit in the North of Ireland to-day to which a Republican policy would appeal. I think there is nothing doing in that respect, nor will there be for some considerable time ahead.</P>
    <P>If we maintain our position in the British Commonwealth, there is a hope that at some time ahead, in the next generation say, we may have a national reunion, whereas if we get into the position of having this truncated twenty-six county Republic, whether we deliberately go out for that or blunder into a position where we get ourselves expelled from the Association of which we are now a member, then there is no prospect at all at any time of national reunion. The people of the two parts will be legally made foreigners to each other; they will have to turn their backs on each other and will be forced further from each other day by day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not desirous of preventing the motion being taken. As a matter of fact, we thought we would have the whole day to deal with this, but other business intervened. I am not trying to talk the matter out.  The President wants the Bill and we will not prevent him getting a vote this evening.  I think the suggestion that the Minister for Defence made, that we should accept this policy as a wise policy simply because there is a majority, is not one that should be adopted.  The suggestion that we should adopt it because there is a majority for the Bill in the House is something that should not be accepted.  We think this is an unwise policy.  If the Government is going only for the removal <Col N="2134" /> of the Oath, then quite unnecessary friction has been caused and unnecessary damage has been done that could easily have been avoided.  The Bill is an unwise Bill.  If the policy of the Government is to tear up the Treaty and to establish a twenty-six county Republic, then we think that is even more unwise.  The fact that there is a majority in the House does not impose any obligation on us to say that the policy is a wise policy or to refrain from objecting to it.</P>
      <P>There is no question of a war being on between the British and ourselves. If there was a British invasion of this country, there would be a position created that no matter what we thought about the steps that brought about that invasion, we would have to be on the side of the Government. But there is no war, there is no quarrel, and the British are not interfering with us.  Probably our position would be entirely different if the British began to interpret the Treaty in our way and interfered.</P>
      <P>We have a new position being created.  There was an accepted view and an accepted interpretation of the Treaty.  Any changes required from time to time were a matter of negotiation.  The Government, from the outside point of view, has now suddenly decided to put its own interpretation on the Treaty, and they are doing so without consultation with the other side.  That may provoke a quarrel.  If it is going to, or if there is a danger, our duty is to do all we can to urge the Government to stop and to rouse the people through the country to exercise their influence on the Government.  We recognise no obligation in the circumstances that exist to refrain from criticism of the Government's policy in this respect, or criticism of their proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no obligation at all on us from a national point of view to fall in behind the Government.  There is not even at issue a question of any importance for this country.  The matter is a triviality and from absolutely every point of view we must persist in trying to rouse public opinion against this proceeding. <Col N="2135" /> You cannot get a clear vote on a thing like this.  All sorts of things are mixed up with it.  While from one point of view you can claim, if you like, that there was a mandate, on the other hand it is perfectly clear that this whole thing was quite a minor thing in the election.  There was no commanding mandate, and if there was any mandate, it was a permissive mandate rather than a mandate that would oblige the Government to go ahead on this particular line.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Deputy to cease making these interruptions. I want to ask the President is it fair, on a matter of such grave import as the Bill we are discussing, to closure debate?  There are numbers of Deputies in the House waiting to make their views vocal on this Bill &mdash;their own views and the views of their constituents.  I happen to be one of them.

      <P>I am asking the President would he not give a little extra time for the discussion on the Final Stage of this Bill?

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>With the time at my disposal I think it is hardly worth starting to meet the arguments put forward. Apparently Deputy Anthony wants us to tear up a domestic Treaty. There has been an arrangement entered into by which we were to conclude on this Bill at 10.30.  So far as I am concerned I do not care if the House sits on until midnight or even until 5 o'clock in the morning, but in view of the fact that an arrangement has been come to there is the question whether other members of the House would be prepared to sit after the hour agreed on?  The usual arrangement was made, and we were told that we could take the Final Stage of this Bill at 10.30 to-night.  Deputy Anthony knows, as well as any other member of the House, how these arrangements are come to.  We are not closuring discussion. There is a great deal of other public work to be done.  Are we to have these debates going on day after day and week after week without anything new emerging from them&mdash; nothing new except what has been gone over a dozen times already?  Now the whole issue, so far as this debate is concerned, seems to me to be this: Are we or are we not doing something which is in contravention of the Treaty?  I hold that we are not.  I hold that the action that we are proposing here, action which I hope the House will take, is absolutely in accord with the mandate which we have asked from the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>That is questionable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is divided into two portions.  There is the major portion concerned with the deletion of Article 17, the removal of the Oath; <Col N="2137" /> and there is the section which deals with Section 2 of the Constitution Act. The deletion of Section 2 of the Constitution Act is necessary in order to fully safeguard this position because again I hold that the interpretation of an international document is not a matter for domestic courts.  So far as I can I want to remove any possibility of that matter being tried before our own courts because in principle they are not the places to try those issues. Therefore the second section of the Bill is necessary as a precautionary measure, apart altogether from any other principle as to the position that an international document ought to occupy with respect to municipal law. We would have had to put it in there as a precautionary measure in any case.</P>
      <P>But we have another reason for putting it in, a reason which would justify a special Act for it, namely, the putting of the Treaty in what I call the proper position which the Treaty ought to occupy, if it is, in fact, an international instrument.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Deputy the reason why, as a precautionary measure, that would have to be done, in any case, and I say that, over and above that reason, there is the other reason which would, apart altogether from the Oath, justify this being put into a separate Act.  I might have been tempted to bring in a separate Act, if it were not necessary as a precautionary measure.  It is suggested that if we brought this question before the people they would not have given us a mandate.  None of the Deputies have suggested the form in which we would have asked the people. What would we have asked the people for a mandate to do?</P>

      <P>There is no question involved other than the question as to whether, in fact, this is a truth or a falsehood.  At the Imperial Conference in 1926 the statement was made with regard to their position and mutual relations.  &ldquo;Their position and mutual relation may be readily defined.  They are autonomous communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to the Crown, and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo;  What does that mean?  It means that we are entitled here in this part of Ireland, to do anything that Canada, Australia or New Zealand could do. If, for one moment, the imposition of an oath upon the members of the Parliaments of these countries was to be a matter of domestic contention, and to cause domestic strife, is there any Deputy here who would say that the Parliaments of these countries could not remove that oath?  Of course they could.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe anything of the kind.  There are two questions involved here, and surely the Deputy ought to have intelligence enough to see the difference between them.  The difference is the relation between States as States.  That is one question, and we are not proposing to interfere with that.  The other question involved is what are to be the domestic obligations of the representatives of the people in a particular State, to the head of the State, if you like?  Are these not two separate questions?  Of course they are, but apparently some of the Deputies who have been talking cannot realise the difference between the two.  They are falling into the same mistake into which some of the British publicists have fallen.  They talk about our Act here as if it were <Col N="2139" /> an act of severance.  It is not, and no sensible person would suggest it is. What are to be the obligations of the individual representatives of the people with respect to the Parliament <Col N="2140" /> here, and with respect, if you like, to the head of the State, is a domestic matter for us.  That is the position.</P>
