      <P>The Deputy, presumably, has in mind a promise made prior to the General Election to use at least £2,000,000 of the Land Purchase Annuities for the direct benefit of the agricultural industry.  I propose to indicate the Government's intentions with regard to the annuities during the debate on Deputy Cosgrave's motion to-morrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. John Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if, in view of the poor inshore fishing this year in Kerry and the consequent inability of fishermen to meet the current instalments on their loans, he will have inquiry made with a view to staying pending proceedings for recovery of such instalments until such time as the fishermen are able to meet their liabilities, and whether he will take into consideration the fact that the trawling operations of the Sea Fisheries Association have resulted in restricting the inshore fishermen's market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. S. O'Grady)</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be prepared to give sympathetic consideration to the circumstances of any individual case of inability to meet an instalment in consequence of poverty of the fishing. There are no grounds for the belief that the trawling operations of the Sea Fisheries Association have restricted the market for the inshore catch.  The contrary is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Association has, I understand, <Col N="1579" /> had the prevailing prices for mackerel, which is the main fishing in the county, under observation and was prepared to undertake an experiment in the freshing of this fish landed by its members at Dingle.  In view of the improvement in prices, however, this step became unnecessary.  The Association has also, I understand, been prepared to undertake the marketing of the catch of white fish by its members at the same port, but has at the request of these members deferred such action until January, when the landings are usually larger in quantity and better in quality.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if he is prepared to allocate a grant towards the construction of a boat slip at Rathcoursey, Co.

    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that safe anchorage for boats is available within  mile of the village of Rathcoursey, and that the construction of the slip or pier suggested would cost a sum out of proportion to any benefit to be derived from it.  I am unable, therefore, to recommend a grant towards the cost of the work.  I have not received any such recommendation from the Sea Fisheries Association as is mentioned.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has been made aware of the fact that the midday rail service between Clonakilty Junction and Clonakilty, running over the baronial guaranteed line of the Clonakilty Extension Railway, has been discontinued causing much inconvenience and delay to the traders, farmers and residents of Clonakilty in the delivery of Dublin and cross-Channel mails and traffic, and if, in the circumstances, he has taken any steps and, if so, what steps to have the service for which the ratepayers of that area are liable and are at present paying restored by the railway company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Great Southern Railways Company made an application in April last, under the provisions of the Railways (Miscellaneous) Act, 1932, for authority to withdraw the 2.15 p.m. passenger train from Clonakilty Junction to Clonakilty and the 1 p.m. mixed train in the opposite direction.  The company duly gave notice of their application in the Cork Press and also in the Dublin newspapers, and certain representations were made by West Cork Deputies but these representations did not relate to the withdrawal of the 2.15 p.m. train. In the circumstances an Order was <Col N="1581" /> made on the 7th October last, relieving the company from their obligation to run both of the trains referred to.  I may add that the baronial guarantee in respect of this line expired on the 28th August, 1921, since when the ratepayers have not been called upon to bear any liability in connection with this line.</P>

      <P>(b)  I am fully satisfied as to the experience and qualifications of the directors and officers in question.</P>

    <P>(c)  I understand that prior to the acquisition of the two companies by the Government, each company had an administration and technical staff, and was managed by a board of directors; that one member of each board acted as resident director, and that, <Col N="1585" /> in addition, one individual, who was a member of both boards, acted as managing director of the two companies. In this connection I may point out that the duties of the staff of the Dairy Disposal Company comprise much more than the commercial management of the two concerns originally acquired by the Government.</P>

      <P>The answers to the several parts of the question are as follows, viz.:&mdash;(1) Considerable damage was caused to a store at Carrowreagh, near Kilrush, the property of Mr. Daniel Ryan, by an explosion, at 7.45 p.m. on the 8th November, of a bomb placed therein, the door having been forced for that purpose; (2) the store was not, at the time of the explosion, under the actual immediate or physical protection of the Gárda Síochána.  It was protected in the sence that it was visited at irregular intervals by a police patrol; (3) a <Col N="1586" /> system of protection, during the night hours, by a party of police remaining on the spot had previously been in force but was altered about two months ago to a system of visiting patrols.  The alteration was made by direction of the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána during a visit of inspection; (4) no arrests have been made.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will print as a White Paper and circulate to members of the Dáil the report from an officer of the Gárda Síochána dated August 17th, 1932, and referring to a charge of assault upon members of the <Col N="1587" /> Gárda Síochána by Messrs.

    <Speaker pid="JamesGeoghehan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion, the Deputy is not entitled to ask to have this report printed and circulated.  To say that a truncated version of the report was given is not a fair suggestion. There was enough of the report given to answer a quite untrue suggestion, that the prosecution of the men, Ryan, Gilmore and Lowe, for attempted murder and conspiracy to murder was abandoned through political pressure. Enough of this report was read to make it perfectly clear that that prosecution was not proceeded with because the police advised against it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have got a very long answer completely dodging the point at issue.  If the Minister reads portion of a report, I submit that we are entitled to get the whole report to see if the portion he has read fairly carries out the meaning.  I submit to you, sir, as a point of privilege of the members of the House, that when a document is read by a Minister the House is entitled to see the whole document and be able to form its own judgment as to whether the extract which the Minister read fully carries out the real meaning of the report.</P>

Had the Deputy, when the quotation or the citation was made, demanded publication of the whole document, he would have been within his rights.

The terms of the new appointments will be made subject to one week's notice with a view to two years' engagement, but there is nothing binding, either on the applicant to remain or on the Department to keep them longer than one week.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil censures the Executive Council for its continued failure satisfactorily to adjust the differences between it and the British Government and condemns it for pursuing a policy which has caused grievous injury to the agricultural industry, serious damage to the export trade of the country, heavy losses to the community and gravely increased unemployment.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will have realised from a perusal of its terms, the motion which I have the honour to move asks the House to censure the Government for its failure to secure a satisfactory solution of its disputes and differences with the British Government and for its pursuit of and persistence in a policy which has brought material loss and spiritual degradation to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A vote of censure on the Government is a normal incident of Parliamentary procedure; the moving of such a vote is part of the routine duty of a Parliamentary opposition.  This motion of censure is, however, in no sense a formal one.  It is brought forward in this solemn hour of the State's misfortune in deepest earnestness and with full conviction that if the country is to be saved from appalling suffering and perhaps irreparable loss the people must be rid of the present Government. <Col N="1595" /> No Government ever had such opportunities for advancing the interests of their country as had the present Government.  No Government were so neglectful of their opportunities or wrought such havoc in such a short period of time as the present Government.</P>
    <P>At the last General Election the Party from which the Government is formed appealed to the people for a chance.  With a bare majority they were enabled to form a Government and were given the chance for which they craved.  Their supporters, with the election cries of peace, prosperity, work for all and the end of starvation still ringing in their ears, believed they saw their dreams realised and the promised land, flowing with milk and honey, spread before their delighted eyes.  The people and the representatives of the people who were in opposition to the newly-formed Government saw it enter on its career with feelings of apprehension, but with no feelings of ill-will.  The Eucharistic Congress was at hand.  The Ottawa Conference was shortly to be held.  True, the deep depression which for some time had settled on other parts of the world, but which had hitherto left us practically untouched, was moving towards us. But had not the new Government their plan?  Was there not a wizard at its head by whose wiles all dangers would be dissipated and all ills be cured?</P>
    <P>Swiftly came disappointment, disillusionment and, unfortunately, disgrace. The plan was mislaid, miscarried or never existed.  The magic arts were but the conjurer's bag of tricks, and the idol had feet of clay. The wonderful manifestation of a people's faith occasioned by the Eucharistic Congress and the diginity and solemnity of the social functions attendant on it were marred by the indiscretions of the Executive Council.  By their neglect of the ordinary canons of international decency and their obstinate insistence on unilateral interference with the Treaty, they involved themselves in vital disagreement with the British Government and, by breaking the pledged words of Griffith and <Col N="1596" /> Collins and of the Irish people, brought discredit on the honour and reputation of this State, subjected their representatives at Ottawa to public humiliation, and made it impossible for advantage to be taken of the unique and timely opportunity afforded by the Commonwealth Economic Conference.</P>
    <P>By their action in repudiating agreements honourably entered into by representatives of this country and of Great Britain and honourably acted on by both countries and by the Parliaments of both countries, they precipitated a dispute with Great Britain fraught with disastrous consequences to all sections of the people.  By their blundering incompetence in the handling of that dispute they not alone involved this country in a terrible economic war of attrition with a rich and powerful nation but they have, by their actions, precluded themselves from seeking or making an honourable settlement.  Through neglect, incapacity, lack of statesmanship, want of foresight, the Executive Council allowed themselves and permitted the country to slip into a wholly unnecessary and wretched struggle which, in order still further to mislead the country, they tried to dignify with the name of a &ldquo;war,&rdquo; while they were without a plan, without an intelligence staff, and without an adequate supply of war material.</P>
    <P>Since the inception of this war their handling of both the internal and external affairs of this country has been so reckless and irresponsible that the country is now facing political and economic disaster.  By their proceedings and procedure they have put us into bad relations with our neighbournation, destroyed the principal industry of the State, ruined the valuable and only market for our agricultural produce, prevented us from securing beneficial preferences and trade agreements with Great Britain, made this State, whose credit and reputation had heretofore been so high, the laughingstock of the nations, swelled the ranks of the unemployed, impoverished if they did not entirely ruin the farmers, and brought anxiety, suffering and loss to every section of the community. The tale is a sorrowful and sordid one. <Col N="1597" /> That this country, until recently the envy of larger and longer established States, could in the space of a few short months be brought to such a disastrous and deplorable condition is almost incredible.  That it has been brought to such a condition, even the Government themselves cannot fail to realise.  Such is the state of the country and its people now, such is the menacing prospect now before it, it is the duty of every Deputy, unless he is utterly callous to the sufferings of the people, to insist that this tragic state of affairs will be ended and the country spared from irreparable damage and disaster.</P>
    <P>An examination of the procedure and methods adopted by the Government in reference to the relations between this country and Great Britain discloses on the part of the Executive Council inefficiency, lack of preparation, want of any clear or wellthought-out plan, neglect of the accepted principles of international courtesy, and utter disregard for the real interests of this State.  In the case of disputes or serious differences of opinion between individuals or business firms ordinary courtesy demands and normal practice requires that they should communicate to each other the fact of and the nature of their disputes and differences and endeavour by personal contact or private correspondence to adjust their differences.  So, too, in international relations the ordinary decencies of international life demand that disputes or differences of opinion between States shall be communicated and conducted through the medium of a well-settled and wellregulated diplomatic procedure.</P>
    <P>But our Government, who pride themselves on and who take such care to advertise their good manners, their adherence to international standards and their respect for Christian principles, have violated them all most flagrantly, and instead of adopting the usual and normal international procedure, started last March in a moment of political exaltation to tell the world of their disputes and differences with the British Government and of how they proposed effectively to twist the lion's tail.  Instead of acting as other <Col N="1598" /> Governments would have acted, they initiated a new method of diplomacy. Instead of sending, as they ought to have sent, a courteous, even a firm dispatch, to the British Government informing them that they had, if they had, a reasoned legal case for the retention of the land annuities, summarising the considered views of the Executive Council and their recommendations as to the manner in which the questions at issue should be resolved, and indicating a desire for a just and amicable determination of the points in dispute, they broadcast their case and their plans.  They did not broadcast their designs to the Irish people, whose representatives they were.  They did not broadcast them to the Irish farmers whose industry was to be vitally affected, they did not broadcast them to the British Government who were to be the other party to the dispute. They broadcast them to the United States.</P>
    <P>Broadcasting is an expensive modern invention.  Somebody paid for the Message broadcast by the President of the Executive Council.  But the farmers, labourers and business people are still paying and have not yet paid in full for the folly of that transaction. Apart from the question of a breach of international good manners by that broadcast, they were guilty of an even more serious blunder.  The Executive Council gave the British Government three months' notice to prepare for the conflict which was so obligingly foreshadowed by them.  The British Government took notice of the information and employed the three months in making their preparations.  The members of the Executive Council employed this time in denouncing the Irish Opposition, piling on taxation, increasing the number of the unemployed, stifling industry under the pretence of saving it, watching with indifference an increase in the number of persons in receipt of home assistance, and counting the Land Commission annuity moneys which they would have available for spending when the British would come to their senses and apologise for having taken them for the last ten years.</P>
    <P>The British, although they received <Col N="1599" /> no official intimation of the Government's intentions of retaining the land annuities, were obliged to take notice of the publicly announced intentions of the Irish Government, and the matter then passed into the stage of inter-governmental despatches.  But the Government were not apparently yet accustomed to the practices of international intercourse and though they had placed the land annuities which they had collected to a Suspense Account they did not inform the other party to the dispute of that fact, but ungraciously allowed them to discover it through the extraordinary channel of a communication by a private Deputy of this House to a private Member of the British House of Commons.  The Irish people heard of this Suspense Account through an announcement made in the British House of Commons and have since been vouchsafed no further information in reference to it by the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>The subsequent stages of the matter are still fresh in people's minds and no detailed recapitulation of them is necessary.  Discussions took place between British and Irish Ministers and though we were told that these discussions failed by reason of an inability to agree on the personnel of an Arbitration Board which would determine the legal question of the destination of the annuities, the people were left in a state of bewilderment as to what really was the point at issue between the Governments.  They did not know, and from the confused utterances of Fianna Fáil spokesmen they were unable to ascertain, whether the Government were standing on their supposed legal claim and were insisting on retaining the annuities until the British proved their legal claim to them, or whether the discussions were in the nature of negotiations for a friendly settlement irrespective of strict legal technicalities.  In any event the Irish people found themselves plunged into an &ldquo;economic war&rdquo; for the ostensible reason that, though both parties to the dispute agreed in principle to arbitration, and to be bound by the results of arbitration, a form of arbitral tribunal, or rather the personnel of <Col N="1600" /> such a tribunal, could not be agreed upon.  As commonsense people in this country were unable to see in such a failure any justification for the Government's action in allowing such a dreadful calamity to overtake this country some steps had to be taken to avert the country's anger.  False analogies were made to the Feetham Commission, in an endeavour to mislead the people into believing that the British Government were putting forward a claim to nominate the chairman and, indeed, to pack the tribunal.  We refused, and still refuse, to believe that that problem was insoluble.  We were convinced, and now are still more firmly convinced, that a way out could have been, and ought to have been, found, and that the insistence of the Government on their claims in this respect was wholly unjustified, and certainly was not a matter of such weighty principle as necessitated the Irish farmer and the Irish people in general paying such a heavy price as they have paid and are still paying because of it.</P>
    <P>The endeavour to distort the facts as to the real cause of the economic war having failed, an endeavour was made by Fianna Fáil to work up in the country a jingo feeling, a spurious war spirit.  We refused, and the country, approving our refusal, also refused to have any act or part in any political trick, designed to convert a sordid and unedifying dispute between two Governments into a war between two peoples.  This country should not have been plunged into an economic war. It should never have been involved in an economic war with Great Britain, nor with any country whose trade with us was of such magnitude that interference with it would cause havoc to our commerce and our main industries, dislocate our trade and bring about widespread unemployment.  If, however, wiser counsel was of no avail, and the Government were determined to persist in their attitude and so cause the war, they ought not to have allowed that war to start in the month of July, or in any month prior to the period of the annual dispersal and disposal of our cattle.  We have ministerial authority for assuming that the Executive never, during the months <Col N="1601" /> from March to July, seriously considered the possibility of such a war coming upon them.  Indeed, had not Fianna Fáil, prior to the General Election, assured the farmers that their policy of retention of the annuities would not involve them in any serious dislocation of their business, and that Great Britain could not afford to do without the Irish cattle trade?  But the Dáil is entitled to know whether the Executive Council ever considered that they should have so arranged their plans as to insure against the possibility of such a war being started and carried on during such a critical period.  Even a casual consideration would have enabled them to see that dislocation of our cattle trade in the late winter months would have had a less serious effect on our economy than such dislocation would have during the months of Summer and Autumn.</P>
    <P>If the Government were determined to precipitate this war they should have, and could have, so handled the situation as to secure that the war could not have started during the vital months of Summer and Autumn. Those months could have been employed in a serious endeavour to find a solution, and, if the Executive Council were determined on war, in perfecting the country's preparations.  The annuities could even have been paid without prejudice and under protest.  We have lost much since the 15th July and we are further away than ever, not merely from victory but from even the hope of a satisfactory settlement.</P>
    <P>Finding themselves unexpectedly faced with the accomplished fact of an economic war, how did they seek to cope with the situation?  How did they seek to preserve the Irish people's interests? They used the only methods known to Fianna Fáil&mdash;retaliation, extravagant expenditure of money, misleading or false propaganda, and frantic denunciation of their critics.  They rushed through this House a measure conferring on the Executive such extraordinary powers of taxation as were never before conferred on a Government. They demanded those powers as an indispensable weapon with which to fight the British.  They cannot complain that they were denied <Col N="1602" /> any powers they sought.  The Irish taxpayer, the Irish consumer, the Irish trader, the Irish farmer, the Irish worker, the Irish unemployed, have all long since felt how that weapon has been turned against themselves.  The British Government, in order to recoup the moneys they were obliged to find at the expense of the British tax-payer, by reason of the witholding of the land annuities, imposed taxes on Irish products which, of course, the Irish producer had to pay.  The Irish Government retaliated by putting fresh taxation on the Irish producer and consumer. They sought for, and obtained, a vote from this House of a huge sum of money without disclosing how they proposed to raise it.  They affected satisfaction with the advent of the economic war which they told the people was a blessing in disguise, enabling them to rid themselves of their appalling dependence on one market and one industry.  Then they proceeded to subsidise, by means of bounties, exports to that much despised market.  It is not easy to determine whether the cattle bounty was a recognition by the Government of the importance of the hitherto despised cattle trade or whether the giving of the export bounty was merely an underhand method of paying the land annuities. They endeavoured to delude the people by assurances of alternative markets and of the injury which the economic war would do to England.  It was only after the British had taken the retaliatory steps, which it was obvious to any sane man they were bound to take, that we had the cynical and belated confession that no alternative markets were available or to be found.  Sometimes, they advised the farmer to sell his cattle and sometimes they advised him not to sell.  They held out vague hopes of a settlement, always a few weeks ahead.  Histrionics, posturing and posing took the place of constructive action, and denunciation of their enemies at home and abroad took the place of charity and goodwill.  After months of anxiety, suffering and loss, came the news that the Government had achieved a Conference with the British for the purposes of discussion and negotiation.  It seemed as if the <Col N="1603" /> Government had, at last, realised that their pride was a matter of only minor importance compared with the interests of the Irish people.  For months the Cumann na nGaedheal Party had persistently and consistently advocated a settlement of the outstanding disputes with the British by means of friendly negotiation based on changed conditions, inability to pay, and the publicly announced desire of British Ministers to deal with the Irish claims in no ungenerous spirit.  Speaking in Ballinamore on the 8th July last, before the economic war had started, Deputy Blythe recommended negotiations as the proper and only secure method of dealing with the disputes. On the 15th July, Deputy McGilligan, in a speech which Deputies will remember, indicated the way of negotiation as the safest as well as the most honourable way out of the morass.  Indeed, every Deputy of our Party urged the Government to adopt that way out, and preached it as the policy of this Party to the people.  Because of our advocacy of that policy, we were dubbed knaves and traitors by Government spokesmen and accused of playing England's game.  We could afford to ignore these manifestations of incompetence and hysteria, calm in our conviction that all decent people in this country realised that we have always kept faith with the Irish people, that our policy and our actions were always actuated solely in the interests of the Irish people, that we could afford to dispense with vituperation of the British because we had kept faith with them and they had kept faith with us and because we were Irish and were conscious of no inferiority.</P>
    <P>On every occasion we urged our policy of abandonment on legal claims and a settlement by friendly discussion and negotiation.  We took pains to make known as clearly and forcibly as possible our conviction that no hope lies along the lines of legal argument for the retention of the annuities or for remission of any part of the liability to pay them.  We made no secret of our want of confidence in arbitration as a method of settling the disputes. In our view, the soundness of <Col N="1604" /> the legal opinions which we had obtained when we were a Government remained entirely unimpaired, and we were convinced that arbitration proceedings could have but one result, a result adverse to the Government's claims.  We were not prepared to stake the State's chances on a single throw of the dice.  It was with feelings of satisfaction and hope that the country learned of the projected conference for the settlement of the disputes which was to be held in London on the 14th October.  Although the people generally regretted that such a step had been so long delayed, the Government delegation went to London backed by the wishes of the overwhelming mass of the people of this country that the negotiations should be pushed to a speedy and successful conclusion. The failure of those negotiations, or discussions, or whatever they were, came with unexpected and startling suddenness.  The reason for the failure soon became apparent.  The Government's demands from being untenable had become absurd.  Their idea of negotiations for a settlement corresponded to those of the litigant who, when approached to settle with his opponent, agreed to do so on the terms of being paid the full amount of his claim, with all his costs and with a written apology from his opponent for having defended the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. H. Flinn Mr. H. Flinn">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The President endeavoured to hide his ludicrous failure and the folly and futility of his fantastic demands by emotional references to Ireland's just claims and his own marvellous pride which refused to allow him to go cap in hand to the British. There is no room for, and no necessity to invoke, either individual pride or national arrogance in this period of the country's history.  As the result of the Government's policy, stark poverty and acute distress would now seem to be the only prospect for the people and for their children and, perhaps, for their children's children unless immediate and effective steps are taken to avert threatened calamity and disaster. The President has put it out of his own power to make an honourable <Col N="1605" /> settlement.  Worse still, the achievement of a favourable settlement by anybody else is being made daily more and more difficult.</P>
      <P>One would have thought that the Government would have been satisfied with having adopted one line of policy which, having an economic war for its consequence, brought havoc to our main industry and dislocated our trade and commerce.  Not content with the adoption of one ruinous line of policy, they must needs embark upon a second, involving further immediate and prospective damage to the business and industry of the country. Almost as the first important act of their official career, they announced their determination to take steps in reference to a vital provision in the Treaty which the other party to that instrument regarded as a fundamental breach of the Treaty.  Without any proper consultation with that other party, the Government introduced into, and passed through this House a measure designed to remove from the Constitution the clauses providing for the taking by Deputies of the Treaty oath.  We have already made our attitude on the proposals embodied in that Bill abundantly clear, and I need only now refer to the consequences which have followed from that provocative proceeding on the part of the Government, so far as the trade and industry of the country are concerned.  That action has cost, or is likely to cost, this country far more even than the amount involved in the land annuities dispute. But for it, there could have been gained for this country benefits of incalculable value, not merely to our agricultural industry but to our people as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ottawa Conference has been held and our delegates to that Conference have returned empty-handed. The golden opportunities presented by that Conference have been wasted because of the Government's persistence in their fruitless pursuit of a political will-o'-the-wisp.  In the full glare of the limelight that played upon Ottawa, in the presence of the representatives of the other member-nations of the British Commonwealth, and in face of all the world, the British Government refused to enter into any trade agreements <Col N="1606" /> with the Irish Government.  The Ottawa Conference was unique.  It presented the chance, not merely of an individual's lifetime, but of a nation's lifetime.  The failure of the Government to secure for the people of this country the benefits which were ready to their hand was not merely deplorable, but was criminal.  Let us be just to the delegates.  They were given an impossible task.  Over the long-distance telephone sounded the crack of the whip and the words of the master calling them to heel.  It is permissible to ask the question which many people have asked&mdash;why did the personnel of the delegation to the Ottawa Conference not include the Minister for External Affairs?  Workers, farmers, manufacturers and industrialists rightly regard economic affairs as of much more vital importance than political concerns.  Whether the business experts went to Ottawa and the political experts went to Geneva does not matter now, but we may be permitted the observation that Ottawa was of the first importance and of the gravest moment, even if Geneva were the more spectacular.</P>
    <P>The Government professed to realise the importance of the Ottawa Conference. The conditions operating internally and externally must have been perfectly well-known to them.  The staff and ward-robe arrangements for the delegation to Ottawa were not only complete but elaborate.  We have no information as to the preparations made, but whatever they had in hand, one thing they could not ignore. Abundant supplies of livestock and livestock produce were here&mdash;in the possession of our citizens.  They had been the equivalent of cash&mdash;they represented solvency or insolvency, according as they were sold well in the best market or discounted by reason of Government policy or the failure of the Government to secure their free entry into the one and only international fair capable of cashing the sum total of the supplies of our home fairs and markets.</P>
    <P>We have no information as to whether, as I have already said, it was the business experts who went to <Col N="1607" /> Ottawa and the political experts who stayed at home, but we are entitled to know what recommendations, if any, were submitted by the Ottawa delegation to the Executive Council, six members of which were available at home. In all those weeks of conference, were there no approaches to the solution of the dispute between the Governments, assuming for the moment that the disputes involved the different interpretation of the Treaty on the oath question and the legal aspect of the question of retention of land annuities and other moneys?</P>
    <P>At this moment no country, large or small, in any part of the world, is indifferent to the all-importance of trade, and it is not to be wondered at.  It is the only solution of the greatest of all modern problems, the problem of unemployment. It is possible that our delegation never paused during their deliberations to invite the British delegates to consider what had brought all their Ministers to Ottawa &ldquo;to explore the means by which they may promote the prosperity of peoples.&rdquo;  Each of the nations present there had one object in mind&mdash;the prosperity of the people they represented.  However they might desire the general application to the other States members and to mankind of that laudable formula&mdash; the fundamental national objective was its individual application.</P>
    <P>The Irish Free State and Great Britain had much more to gain from a settlement and much more to lose from failure than any other of the States represented.  The country must refuse to believe that no formula was supplied by either side.  Was there a suggestion from the British?  Was any such suggestion or proposal considered by and forwarded to the Executive Council, and, if so, what were the observations or decision of the Executive Council?  Was there a proposal from the Irish delegation?  What were its terms?  And what were the observations of the British delegation&mdash;or its decision as to the terms so proposed? The country is entitled to demand and receive an answer to these questions.</P>
    <P>The Executive Council must strictly <Col N="1608" /> account for their actions, which have resulted in the throwing away of an unique and entirely favourable opportunity of countering the effects of world depression in our own agricultural and commercial industry.  The Imperial Conference of 1930 was so impressed with the necessity of reorganising the economic forces of the British Commonwealth of Nations that provisional arrangements were made for holding a special economic conference. At the time, we were not so vitally interested.  Our exports had been, with some exceptions, less affected by the fall in commodity prices than most other international products. It was, however, obvious that the fall in prices, the reduction in volume of trade, the disturbance occasioned by financial crashes, and the growth of unemployment in practically all countries, could not all take place and leave us our markets and our prices unaffected. No single country has been sufficiently well equipped politically and economically to be able to formulate and carry into effect a policy designed to meet and beat the harmful effect of industrial depression.  High and extended tariffs, increase in expenditure by the central authority, with a corresponding heavier taxation, have had the inexorable effect in other countries that we have experienced here&mdash;a sharp rise in the number of unemployed and greater insecurity for those still fortunate enough to be in employment.</P>
    <P>The different members of the British Commonwealth of Nations had tried their own various devices, political and otherwise, to rehabilitate their internal economy, without the desired results. The Imperial Conference of 1930 marked an appreciation of the size of the problem and of the failure of members of the Commonwealth individually to effect an improvement in trade and commerce in the area of their own jurisdiction and the necessity of coordinated efforts of all the State members to make a combined attempt to improve their economic conditions.</P>
    <P>The policy actuating the resultant Conference of 1932 was a bold policy, as it was bound to involve advantages and preferences, concessions and <Col N="1609" /> limitations.  We had much to gain from its advantages, many benefits from its preferences.  The conception of the Conference was an extension of trade, with a corresponding increase in employment.  Our trade position was stronger in relation to Great Britain than any other Dominion. Had Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa relatively equivalent imports from Great Britain, the advantages and preferences they would be entitled to claim, and would have been bound to secure in view of the importance of their market to British exporters, would have been such as to cause any concessions or limitations which they could have been pressed to grant to appear trivial in comparison.</P>
    <P>So far as our trade with Great Britain was concerned, its maintenance depended exclusively upon the prices we obtained for what we had to sell, the higher the price and the greater the volume, the better and the more extensive our purchase.  Consequently we were in a position to have made a much more favourable bargain than was actually made by any other Dominion.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to realise that such a chance was deliberately thrown away, and that the material advancement of this country was callously subordinated to the pursuit of political futilities. And yet such is the reality.  We are now worse off than we were last February.  Not alone are we enduring the effects of a senseless economic war, not alone have we failed to secure the preferences which we were justified in expecting, but we have lost the preferences we had, and practically all our main industrial exports are subjected to an additional import tax of ten per cent.  We are economically outcast, and other countries less favourably situated than this country are eagerly seeking to take and are taking advantage of our folly.</P>
    <P>What has been the effect of these insane policies and actions on our people?  It needs no descriptive effort on my part to bring home to the people their effects on our agricultural industry and on our farmers.  Farmers in their own everyday life know and appreciate the significance of the <Col N="1610" /> present conflict.  Good-will in the British market is an essential, not only to the sale of our agricultural produce but to the normal trading relations which should subsist between neighbouring people.  The good-will which we had in the British market was of incontestable value to us.  Equally the good-will which the British had here was of incontestable value to them. Let us ensure the maintenance of that good-will, the loss of which would mean permanent injury to our trade.</P>
    <P>Whilst this fight is, so to speak, being fought around the hat-band of the farmer, we must remember that involved in it are also the shopkeepers, traders, manufacturers and business people in general and their employees. As a result of the contraction in the volume of our trade, the loss to transport consequent thereon, the fall in price of our exports, less money was in circulation.  Then followed a restriction in credit which was inevitably bound to accompany the disastrous policy of the Government.  The farmer being deprived of the opportunity of selling his produce is no longer in the position to meet his obligations to the shopkeeper or to pay for goods that he buys.  The shopkeeper in his turn therefore, despite all his desires to the contrary, and despite his realisation of community of interest, to put it no higher, that links up his fate with the farmer, despite his anxiety to lend a helping hand to his country neighbour, no longer finds himself in a position to give the necessary credit.  The policy of the Government, having brought about the ruin of the farmer, must inevitably lead to a contraction in business in the towns with loss to the shopkeeper, and the certainty of a reduction in the number of those employed in the distributing trade.</P>
    <P>And manufacturers are in no better position.  They depended on the prosperity of this State and have suffered by reason of the diminished purchasing power of the community, while at the same time bearing charges even heavier than those falling on them in more prosperous times. Factory output depends on sale. Accumulated stocks may be more valuable than bad debts, but their <Col N="1611" /> realisable value is what concerns the industrialist.</P>
    <P>What of the workers in our towns and cities?  Fianna Fáil advertisements before the Election promised explicitly and in great detail that in respect of &ldquo;a few industries&rdquo; 84,605 additional workers would be employed. Has that promise been realised even in the smallest measure?  So far from placing additional people in employment, has not the policy internal and external of Fianna Fáil increased unemployment and brought insecurity to thousands of men who a few months ago had every reason to believe that their jobs were sound and likely to continue?  There is no need to tell this House or the intelligent workers outside that industrial progress must go step by step with the prosperity of our farmers.  The blows aimed by this Government at the farming community have decreased purchasing power, and have inevitable reactions on employment in our towns and cities.  The huge increase in taxation has also played its part, and relief grants, so far from being a remedy, but aggravate the disease and give us a vicious circle of more money withdrawn from industry, more unemployed, more grants from rates and taxes and even higher imposts upon those who are still fortunate enough to have work and wage.</P>
    <P>There is general agreement that tariffs alone are not a solution for the problem of unemployment.  If they were, that problem would surely be non-existent in the United States of America and in post-war Europe. Here, a spate of customs duties, ignorantly and recklessly imposed, have not only failed to open up avenues of satisfactory employment, but have actually proved a menace to those who were at work in March last.</P>
    <P>On the cattle trade alone, the rail-roads&mdash;already hard hit&mdash;are losing from £12,000 to £14,000 per week.  The self-styled &ldquo;Railway Party&rdquo; has added to the insecurity of the employed railwaymen by a tariff on coal and grease.  Workers engaged in the transport and distributive trades have been hit&mdash;dockers, motor-mechanics, <Col N="1612" /> shop assistants and others employed at trade union rates and under reasonable, agreed conditions have found themselves suddenly thrown upon the labour market without any prospect of a job, while we have it on the authority of the Leader of the Labour Party&mdash;the Government's greatest ally and most trusted adviser&mdash;that &ldquo;the whole tendency of the new industrial development is towards low wages and bad conditions of labour.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The only remedies suggested are grants or a fundamental change in our whole economic system.  Grants, as I have said, are temporary, expensive, and in the long run increase unemployment. For a fundamental change in our economic and social system, even if such were practicable or desirable, neither Fianna Fáil nor Labour has a mandate from the people. The only real hope for our workers&mdash; and the phrase is a comprehensive one &mdash;is stability of political and economic conditions, the development of our agricultural industry, the maintenance of friendly relations with Great Britain and the intelligent and prudent use of the complete fiscal powers which we enjoy under the Treaty.</P>
    <P>So much for the past and the present. The past is gone&mdash;whatever advantages it may have left to us&mdash;whatever disadvantages we may have to endure. The future is still before us.  How is it possible to conserve the nation's wealth&mdash;to expand its potentialities&mdash; to utilise the resources of the State by profitably employing our people in the development of our main and secondary industries?  Agriculture must be our major concern.  On its prosperity depends the success of our secondary industries, the creation and expansion of which need not and ought not proceed to the prejudice of agriculture. The preservation of that industry is as important as the political preservation of the State.  Government policy is directed towards conserving for the home market some ten million pounds worth of foods and feeding stuffs.  Let us ignore for the moment criticisms of that policy&mdash;taking into consideration only the purpose it is intended to serve.  The underlying theory appears to be that by this means we would <Col N="1613" /> enter into possession of a ten million order for agricultural produce, thereby adding to the farmer's receipts, increasing the number of persons employed and strengthening our cash position and contributing to our economic independence.  We had, up to a short time ago, an external trade of three times the value of these imports.  We are not so wealthy as to be indifferent to £10,000,000 of trade. If that be admitted&mdash;how do we regard trade to the value of £30,000,000?  It is three times as important.  The most advanced theorist on the Government Front Bench will not deny that it is possible to formulate fiscal proposals theoretically to save the £10,000,000, and at the same time to adopt a sound policy which will secure external protection for our agricultural exports. What are the objections or obstacles towards entering into arrangements for securing those preferences and advantages for our agriculturists? One outstanding object appears to be that the Executive Council of this State has an objection to the British as such; that they believe the sole object of British policy is to injure Ireland, and that they are convinced that any arrangements made between the two countries would be to the advantage of Great Britain and to the detriment of this State.  What is the objection or obstacle on the part of the British Government?  British Ministers have stated that they are not disposed to make agreements with a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations which breaks agreements already made.</P>
    <P>This Dáil must consider the implications of that pronouncement.  I find it difficult to discover a basis for external relations which does not involve adherence to and acceptance of treaties or agreements made.  The interpretation of a bilateral agreement or treaty is a matter for both the parties and not for one alone.  It by no means follows from this principle that treaties or agreements are for all time.  There is only one satisfactory way in which they may be altered, amended or rectified, and that is by conference, consultation and agreement. The existing disputes and <Col N="1614" /> differences between the Irish and British Governments are all of them capable of adjustment and ought to be adjusted and settled by that method without further delay.  When they have been resolved we will be in a position to obtain the advantages accorded the other State-members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and in addition to gain such further advantages as our very special circumstances require.  The flow of trade between Great Britain and the Irish Free State is greater than that of the other Dominions.  Its maintenance depends upon the sale of our exports at a price which will enable us to continue our production.  Present prices would not enable us to continue our trade with Great Britain any more than present taxes and rates would enable us to continue employment and trade here.  A complete resolving of all the matters in dispute should take place.  We can then devote ourselves amicably to those problems which, however severe in these difficult times, cannot be solved while we have an economic war and uncertainty on our external front.</P>
    <P>I have indicated only some aspects of the sufferings and material loss which have been caused to the people of this State by the mistaken policies of the Government.  The picture is incomplete.  Great as are the material losses, the spiritual losses are far more terrible.  In conditions as they now exist, discontent and unrest have developed with alarming rapidity; political passions have been aroused to a degree hitherto unknown even in this country; implacable hatreds between fellow-countrymen are a commonplace; the vices of avarice, greed and envy are widespread; the loosening of morals which invariably accompanies all periods of strife is apparent; class hatred is being stirred up; the very fundamental principles of Christian Charity are in danger of being forgotten; and religion itself is being menaced by the stealthy but steady progress of the forces of social and moral disintegration.  Is it not time to end all that?  Is it not time to forget the past and to keep our eyes firmly on a brighter future and to bend <Col N="1615" /> our united energies towards its achievement?</P>

      <P>The statement which Deputy Cosgrave has just read has covered a very wide field indeed.  Not alone has he succeeded in dragging in social functions which were held in connection with the Eucharistic Congress but he has in his concluding remarks gone back on the old clarion call which served him so ineffectively in the last General Election&mdash;the cry of morality, the safety of religion and the safety of civilisation in this country.  But let us remember that this speech, which has already gone across the wires to the British Press, is not going to be hailed there so much for the hope it holds out that such a strong statesman is going to save the Irish people from dreadful disaster, dreadful ruin, &mdash;social, political, moral and economic&mdash;but that there is a statesman here who is not afraid or ashamed to get up, when a life and death struggle is being carried on between this State and Great Britain, to tell us that the Government in power who are responsible for seeing the people safely through the struggle, are insane, are dishonourable, are incapable of fulfilling their duty, that they have completely abandoned whatever interest they had in their own people and have simply reached a stage when their only purpose in life seems to be to create worse confusion so that they themselves might escape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the position?  What assistance has Deputy Cosgrave and his colleagues given to this Government to enable it to reach a fair and honest settlement?  In connection with that, let me call the attention of the House to the fact that Deputy Cosgrave himself in his concluding remarks emphasised the necessity and the importance of negotiations, of an understanding and of an agreement in which there would be a complete resolving of all our difficulties.  What is the policy of Deputy Cosgrave in regard to that matter?  Is it support of the existing Government in standing for our full claim?  Let it be remembered before this economic struggle was entered upon that we <Col N="1616" /> stated our policy to the people.  We were elected to carry out that policy and we are going to carry out that policy.  If we fail Deputy Cosgrave and his friends will have ample opportunities of showing the Irish people how they can do better for them and of doing better if the Irish people give them a renewal of their confidence.  At the present time I would suggest that the speech that has just been delivered is not going to help us in this struggle.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the facts.  The facts are that during the last week or two the British Tory Government has suddenly inflicted the present embargo on the Irish cattle trade.  They deny that it is a measure of protection for their own farmers.  They want to pretend to the Irish people, as well as to some of their own people, that in fact it is not retaliation, that it is an effort to raise further money to endeavour to recoup themselves for the moneys we are withholding.  At any rate their whole policy is an admission that they have failed utterly to raise the money that we are now withholding.  Their 20 per cent. tariff has only succeeded in raising something like £500,000.  As against that we are holding an annual sum of some £5,000,000.  It is suggested that in order to reach a settlement with Great Britain we should first have handed over these sums of money and then postpone a settlement until such time as we could have reached an understanding as to the form of court or tribunal which would resolve our difficulties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave has stated that the agreements that were entered into were entered into by the representatives of the Parliaments of both countries, but we deny that that statement is a fact.  When we stand for our rights in this matter and insist upon our rights as a duly mandated Government to reopen this whole question, chiefly on the ground that it has never been sanctioned by the Legislature.  I submit that it is mere rhetoric, a mere waste of time to pretend that there is something dishonourable and disgraceful about it.  If Deputy Cosgrave and his friends had an ounce or a shred of patriotism they would have followed the line that some of them <Col N="1617" /> at least gave us an indication they were going to follow&mdash;that if there was going to be an international settlement of war debts and war reparations we were not going to be left out in the cold, that we were going to look for our rights in the full international sense, that we were going to claim that the matter would be dealt with in an international manner, not that we were going to take up the attitude that we were a mere province, and that we had no rights.  It was not the attitude that we were going to make our claim on account of agricultural depression, that we realise we have no legal case whatever, that we are going to abandon it and to swallow everything we said, to say that the lawyers who gave us their opinion on the matter did not know what they were talking about and that we are going to go hat in hand and ask them for a small remission. Do the Irish farmers require merely a small remission in the matter?  Are they content to accept Deputy Cosgrave's policy that he is going to accept some settlement on a basis that is going to mean a small remission or a small reduction in these payments and at the same time that a sum not of three millions in respect of the annuities, but a total of five millions is going to be dragged from the Irish people irrespective of whether we have depression here or not?</P>
    <P>One would imagine that the country was in a dreadful condition, the country which was in such a splendid condition, if we are to believe the statements of Deputy Cosgrave, when he was in charge of the Government here. He says that our national credit stood high.  Has that altered?  He referred to our unemployment figures and said that the general level of prosperity, the general standard of living was higher than that of other countries. Has that altered?  Not at all.  The national credit is as high as ever it was. As regards unemployment, if we take into consideration the fact that under the present Minister for Industry and Commerce there has been a large increase in registration of unemployed persons, that west of the Shannon, where you had no registration under <Col N="1618" /> the last régime, more persons registered as unemployed than you had in the whole of the Free State under the previous administration, and if you add to that the extraordinary increase in population which is taking place in these districts I think you will have to admit that the figure of 80,000 does not mean that worse conditions prevail now in regard to unemployment than heretofore.  It merely means that large numbers of persons, farmers' sons and so on, have now registered. We have now, at any rate, a definite criterion.  We have a definite figure. We are not running away from that figure.  We admit that is the figure and we are taking steps to remedy the unemployment that it indicates.</P>
    <P>When we were endeavouring to settle during the months of August and September the dispute with Great Britain, and when it was essential that whatever our opponents believed they should at least stand behind us in an endeavour to settle the question, you had one Party being quoted in the &ldquo;Daily Mail&rdquo; saying &ldquo;Do not let Mr. Cosgrave down,&rdquo; and you had another Party going round the country telling the farmers not to pay the annuities as they were already being collected by the tariffs.  They were not collected, as the recent actions of Mr. Thomas have shown, and they will not be collected now either.  It may be that our cattle will be kept out altogether. That may be the result, but no sensible person believes that the British Government can ever hope to collect the sums which we now hold in respect of the annuities and other payments.  At the same time these people were encouraging the British to stand firm against our claims and the other Party were trying to create the greatest possible trouble for us, trying to create obstacles in the way of the running of the local administration, aye, and creating a Body, the White Army&mdash;John Bull's White Hopes&mdash;so that our delegates in Ottawa could be told when they were trying to effect a settlement that oh, they did not know what they were talking about&mdash;that they, the British delegates, knew that in a month or two they would have civil war in Ireland.  How was it possible <Col N="1619" /> for any group of plenipotentiaries or delegates to make a settlement in those circumstances?</P>

      <P>Now this Government, whether it is right or wrong, represents the Irish people at the moment, and when Deputy Cosgrave or anybody else quotes patriotism or even theology I say it is their first duty as Irishmen to support the existing Government. Until such time as it is clear that the existing Government had failed in what they are attempting, I submit it is their duty to support them. During all these months what is the position?  We were told the Irish farmer is not getting the bounties.  Why, during the period since Fianna Fáil came into office, sums amounting to some £3,000,000 have gone into the hands of the agricultural community.  The people who told us that the farmers are paying double, conveniently forgot that under this Government there has been inaugurated a scheme of relief works, a scheme of public works, a scheme of housing, an addition to the old-age pensions, an increase in the agricultural grant, a scheme of loans for heifers, and that there has been an amount allocated for subsidies for export trade during the current year of something like one million and a half.  On the whole a sum amounting to £3,000,000 has been paid to the agricultural community in one shape or another.  Therefore, the present Government has paid out money, has endeavoured to keep trade and industry in the position they should be, and I submit that there is more money in circulation, that there is more comfort in the homes of the poor, that there is more hope and more security and more feeling that no matter what happens things are not going to drift, that there is a Government in power which is going to take resolute steps, at any rate, to improve the condition of the poor people, whom we heard very little of during the past ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave lashes himself into a fury of rhetoric as to the breaches of international diplomacy that have <Col N="1620" /> taken place.  What about the breaches of trust to the Irish people that took place when secret agreements were made handing over those vast sums of money to Great Britain?  Look at the English Press and see that constitutional English lawyers of eminence believe that the Government that negotiated these agreements and that carried them through were guilty of grave irregularities in not bringing them before the Legislatures, and if Deputy Cosgrave, who now sermonises us about breaches of international diplomacy, had told the Irish people what he was doing at that time, if he had informed the Irish people that the whole question of our future financial relations was being gone into, and that he was not going to come to any agreement or make any final settlement binding on the Irish people until the whole thing was made public, the present situation would not have arisen. But those people who are responsible primarily for the present situation, who have weakened the hands of the present Government in coming to a satisfactory solution, would be the first &mdash;the first, moryah&mdash;to come along and claim the benefits if this Government is successful.  Those people who have tried to weaken the case of the Irish people in every possible way during the past six months, are preaching around the country and putting down Motions in the Dáil, that the farmer should not pay his annuities&mdash;they who have done nothing to help the Irish people in maintaining their rights, who have done nothing to tell the British Government: &ldquo;No matter how we may disagree with the present Government, at any rate, we do not agree with you.&rdquo;  Read the English papers and hear the chuckles of their Dublin correspondents when the 40 per cent. tariff was put on recently.  &ldquo;Be assured,&rdquo; said the Dublin correspondents, &ldquo;that no matter what happens Deputy Cosgrave's Party, at any rate, are not going to find fault with the British Government.&rdquo;  They are not going to find fault with them.  They are going about the country telling the people that the British Government have a perfect right to do what they are doing.  Even if they go further and <Col N="1621" /> put a complete embargo on cattle, presumably then they will be more delighted. They will be more satisfied. What is the reason for that?  Is it real patriotism?  I submit it is purely a Party action.  It is purely an attempt to get Party advantage out of the present situation.  If we know the temper of the Irish people, if we appreciate their traditions and the way they look upon these things&mdash;and I think we can sum up the present situation as well as our opponents&mdash;that is not the frame of mind in which the Irish people, when they come to vote, will look upon it.  They will look upon it as a gratuitous going out of their way on the part of the Opposition to help our opponents across the water.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the fact that there is hardship in the country, and that there is this formidable list of unemployed registered.  We are aware that many of the farmers are unable to meet their obligations, but we propose, in addition to the steps we have already taken, which I claim have put at least £3,000,000 additional into circulation amongst the agricultural community since we came into office as compared with previously, to take further steps if necessary.  It is not to-day nor yesterday that members of this side of the House realised that this was a situation which was likely to arise, if not within a year or two, within a comparatively short period of years.  We saw competitors from Siberia, from the Argentine, and from all over the world, driving our products out of the British market.  We saw that the Irish farmer was getting a price for his products out of which it was utterly impossible for him to meet his ordinary costs and expenses.  We resolved, and we put it to the people very strongly in the recent election, that, if we are going to get away from the state of affairs that is threatening other countries&mdash;that left them face to face with revolution, face to face with a complete abyss, not knowing where they stood and having no plans to meet the situation&mdash; it was not when the disaster had come to us that we should make plans to meet the future.  We told the people it was our plan and our policy to produce all our requirements in our own <Col N="1622" /> country.  We told them that we realised a complete change in our country could not be made overnight, but that while it was being made we were taking steps to alleviate the situation, &mdash;even if this particular crisis had never arisen&mdash;and endeavour to relieve matters for those in the livestock trade and other trades, while we were going on to an economy that meant more people on our land, meant a system of husbandry which would give higher labour content; that, instead of turning out cattle over hundreds of thousands of acres of this country, giving employment to nobody, not even producing their own milk, their own potatoes or their own butter, in an agricultural country, we would employ some of those thousands who were walking around the streets and whom the community would have to support in any case.  We saw that it would be better to devise some scheme, and that is the scheme we are proceeding with, and by means of which, if God gives us strength, we hope to help our people both through the world crisis and the particular crisis that is upon them at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, I think the House is labouring under a great disadvantage in not discussing this question to-day, with a White Paper before it, unlike what has been issued a few weeks ago.  I would like to know exactly what occurred when members of our Government went across to England to negotiate the settlement of this unfortunate dispute. So far as the White Paper is concerned, it is merely a restatement of the case which we have been listening to since this question arose first.  There is no evidence to show that those who undertook to negotiate got down to brass tacks, in other words, there was no form of negotiation whatever.  To place the situation in its true perspective before the House, it is necessary for us to go back to the general election, and to see exactly on what programme the present Government was elected to office.  The first plank of their programme&mdash;I can be corrected by the Government if I mistake their case&mdash;when they went before the electors was the removal of the <Col N="1623" /> Oath.  That was held out to be the one thing of paramount importance when they got into office.  We were told that the reason it was so important was because there would be no peace in this country until that objectionable Oath was removed from the Constitution; that it debarred a certain section of the community from taking their place in this House.  That Oath has been removed so far as this House is concerned.  I shed no tears on its removal.  As it was so aptly described by the present President of the State, it was, at best, an &ldquo;empty formula,&rdquo; and so far as my conscience is concerned, in signing that declaration, I never read allegiance to any one except the people of this country no matter what that Oath contained. But there are people, or we were told that there were people, with such tender consciences in the country that they would not come in to do the business of the State unless this Oath was removed.  As I said before, it has been removed, and it was the most important point stressed at the general election by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was the second plank on their programme?  The second plank was the witholding of the land annuities and their annual payments from Britain on the grounds that these payments were not legally due; that they had advice from eminent lawyers that there were just and legal grounds for withholding those payments from Great Britain.  I would not like to make an estimate as to how many people voted for the Fianna Fáil Party on those grounds, but I would venture to state that, fifty per cent. of their votes were got at the last election in the belief that those annuities would not have to be paid either to Ireland or Britain.  But we leave the question of to whom they are to be paid on one side.  Undoubtedly, the electors were led to believe that they were not payable to Great Britain, and consequently, there would be a saving of up to three million pounds on the annuities and about two million made up under other heads.  Now, that was plank No. 2 on the Fianna Fáil platform <Col N="1624" /> when they went to the electors last.  I will return to the Oath in a moment.</P>
    <P>Plank No. 3 was a complete, I might say revolutionary, change in the whole economic system of the country.  I think these are the three main planks which brought Fianna Fáil to be head of the State, and on these three items we are going to discuss this motion of censure to-day.  Getting back to Plank No. 2&mdash;the annuity question&mdash; we had from the Fianna Fáil Government a statement that seven of the most eminent lawyers in the State advised them that the annuities should not be paid to England; that they had sound legal opinion backing their case not to pay them to England.  Against that we had seven equally eminent lawyers on the Cumann na nGaedheal side, who said these annuities were bound to be paid to England, and that the law was the other way.  So far as the ordinary man in the street is concerned, the lawyers fought a drawn battle on this question whether the annuities were legally due or not. Where are we then?  Where are the negotiations?  How is the man in the street to know whether these annuities are payable or not?  It reminds me of a view of the law expressed by one of the immortals who said &ldquo;the law is a h'ass.&rdquo;  Dickens, to my thinking, has very properly summed up the legal aspect of this annuity dispute.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the economic change, and we cannot deal with it without reference to the annuity question.  Years before Fianna Fáil became the Government of the country, in fact, years before they came into this House, they told the people they were going to industrialise this State, and that agriculture was finished.  They did not tell that in so many words to the electors at the last election.  They certainly did not tell them that when they switched over that the value of agricultural produce was going to fall by forty or fifty per cent., and what is more if they had told the electors what was going to be the net result of the switch over in their economic policy, I doubt very much if they would occupy the Government Benches to-day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1625" /> In viewing this economic change, I cannot help thinking that Mr. Thomas was led into a trap on this question of the annuities.  He did for the President of the State what he could not do for himself.  He succeeded in putting on twenty or twenty-five per cent. tariffs on produce going to the British market thereby falling into the trap deliberately designed by the President of the Executive Council, so that he could make the change without going to the people for approval.  We come back again to the importance of the third question.  Is it not strange that the question of the Oath, which was the question of first importance to the Fianna Fáil Party, should be left over and that that section of the community which would not come into the House because of the Oath are to be left outside for eighteen months more; that there are three by-elections to be fought in this State, and that these people who, we were told, were asking that this Oath be removed in order that they might get representation in this House, are still debarred by the Oath from seeking such representation. In other words, they are waiting eighteen months before the Oath can be removed.  Why?  Because they are afraid to abolish the Seanad.  Why did not the President take his courage in both hands, and, when the Seanad refused to pass the Oath, bring in a measure to abolish the Seanad?  Why did he think it more necessary that the people should be brought to a state of poverty by a precipitate change in the economic policy than that the objectionable. Oath should be removed forthwith?  No attempt was made to remove the Seanad for the simple reason that there are too many Labour members in it.  The Labour Party have their weekly meetings with the Government, and they say to the Government: &ldquo;If you remove the Seanad we will withdraw the support of our men in the Dáil that keeps you in power.&rdquo;  In other words, the Labour Party has become a Party that puts place before principle.</P>
    <P>When this change in the economic policy of the Government was under discussion in this House, we had Ministers foolish enough to say that <Col N="1626" /> when the change took place the people would have beef four times a day; they would have a daily orgy of beef eating which would be the envy of a cannibal chief.  But when the Government made the change they found out quickly their mistake and it became necessary to try and patch up their blunder. Then they came along with bounties. To whom are the bounties being paid? Who are getting the bounties on the live stock and live stock products? They are certainly not going to the farmers.  I spent two or three hours, a week ago, assisting in trying to devise a plan by which the bounty on pigs would come back to the raisers of pigs in my county.  I was in conference with the most intelligent farmers of the county and, after three hours' discussion, we discovered it was impossible. We found that it was beyond our power to secure a shilling of the bounties for the farmers for whom they were presumably intended.  Why cannot the Government devise a scheme, if they are anxious to help the export trade, by which the bounty can be paid direct to the farmers?  If the Government does not do something like that I say to them that when they come before the country at the next general election, whenever that is to be held, they will find themselves in very great difficulties.</P>
    <P>As this debate is to close to-night, and as I am sure there are a great many other Deputies bursting for an opportunity of speaking, particularly the Labour Deputies, I shall not detain the House further.  I should like that Deputy Davin and his leader, Deputy Norton, should have full time to take part in this debate.  I suppose most of them are now in consultation with their friends in another place and that when they are fully briefed we can hear the whole story.  I consider it unfortunate that this motion was brought on so soon.  It would have been better to allow the people to have a little more experience of the economic change in the country, but as it has come on I support it, and I think condemnation is due to the Government for the policy they have adopted. I intend therefore to vote for this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy who has just sat down touched on many points of interest.  I know there is a view prevalent in the country such as that to which he has just given expression. But, unfortunately, those who have a sense of responsibility&mdash;and I know Deputy O'Hanlon has such a sense of responsibility&mdash;know that the country is faced with a very painful dilemma.  It is only by political experience that democratic countries like this can advance.  For ten years there was no normal change of Government&mdash; the Fianna Fáil Party for ten years deprived the country of any opportunity of normal change of Government &mdash;and it was only natural that the country would, in the circumstances, be deprived of the experience that comes from such a normal change.  The country was without that experience which every democratically-ruled country has of such a change of Government, and, as a result, bitter experience may now be in store for the people of the country. I would impress upon Deputies that the effect of that experience may be such that the country may not be able to survive it in our generation. Though it may be desirable, from the point of view of political education and experience, such as that to which Deputy O'Hanlon has referred, it is questionable whether it can be achieved without, in fact, inflicting irreparable loss on the people.  Neither can we accept the easy course outlined by the Minister for Education, namely, wait until they fail and then others can have their chance.  There may, if this policy for which the Government stand, is allowed to continue, be very slight opportunity for any constructive party or body of men, willing to adopt a sane policy in this country and entrusted with the conduct of government, to adopt such a change of policy.  There are many aspects of the Government policy which we have grave reason to condemn.  Some of these aspects are even more serious in what they portend for the nation than that which forms the subject of discussion here to-day.  In fact, this dispute, as used by the Fianna Fáil Party, in their heroic efforts to kill the cattle trade, as the last speaker pointed out, has also obscured many other dangers, <Col N="1628" /> especially, for the time being, from the people of the country.  But I think we can look upon that aspect of their policy now under discussion, as part and parcel of the policy the Government is pursuing, and that it is a policy which is driving a large number of the people of this country to desperation. The leader of the Opposition, in his opening statement, did not at all exaggerate, when he painted in sober colours, the passions that are being let loose and that are being stimulated here at the present time; the efforts that are being made, not unsuccessfully, to appeal to greed, envy and avarice, and the efforts which are being made to set up a class war.  I am quite willing to believe that there are many people who seriously and sincerely think that out of a mess and chaos of that kind something better will come for this country; that there are people who have such belief in the constructive efficacy of their own particular nostrums, and the great creative power for which they stand, as to think that when they have brought the present system to ruin, to destruction, as is their declared policy, they will be able to put something better in its place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has the country got, faced as it is with this threatened destruction? Mainly certain things enumerated by the Minister for Education.  Relief work.  That, at the very best, is merely a palliation and has the disadvantage that it can only be carried out on anything like a large scale by eating into the capital that the country requires for proper development.  Loans for heifers!  In the present situation of the cattle trade!  It was announced by the Minister for Education this afternoon that one of the great schemes they have for coming to the help of the people is loans for heifers; and that from a Government who have always made it clear that they are out for the destruction of the whole cattle trade! That is one of the palliatives they now offer the unfortunate farmers.  Then we have the subsidies.  Who has gained by the subsidies?  How are they helping the export cattle trade?  There are complaints every day that very little assistance is given <Col N="1629" /> in that respect to the farming community.  Then, with that childish belief in figures that characterises apparently every member of the Government, that belief as my colleague, Deputy McGilligan once put it, that they are doing sums on a black-board, it is said that Mr. Thomas only raised £500,000.  But that £500,000 does not represent what the farmer has lost. What the farmer lost was a great deal more than £500,000.  If anything like the £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 due in respect of land annuities is exacted in the way of collecting tariffs when our goods arrive at English ports, that would only represent a small portion of what the farming community in this country loses, and continues to lose, as a result of the policy of the Government. They have lost, to a large extent, the sale value of most of their cattle.  Their losses are represented not merely by the cattle that have been exported and on which duty has been paid, but more particularly by the cattle that have not been sold owing to the fall in price, and that it will now be very difficult to sell owing to the increase in duties, referred to by the Minister for Education as an embargo on our cattle trade.  These are some of the losses.  I doubt if they have the mathematical exactitude that appeals, apparently, to the members of the Front Bench.  They are quite satisfied if they can get their officers to turn out columns of figures as to people in employment.</P>
    <P>As to the failure at Ottawa: That may have been due to the personnel of the delegation that was sent to Ottawa.  We do not know.  Nobody can tell what occurred there.  We are asked to believe that while they were there, in close touch, apparently, if we can judge by the newspapers, with the British statesmen, they never broached a settlement of the question; that no effort was made to understand each other's point of view.  Either that was done or it was not.  I am not speaking now of formal negotiations. I am speaking of what may be much more useful&mdash;informal talks.  If informal talks, and advances to an understanding, at least, of the position of the two main parties in this dispute did not take place, there was a shameful <Col N="1630" /> neglect of their opportunities on the part of the delegation.  They ought, at least, to know on each side where they stood.  If they knew on each side where they stood, why was there the farce of the negotiations that took place in London the other day?  What is the excuse for them?  What was the excuse for the belief, sedulously spread through the country, the belief that also prevailed on the other side, that there was a possibility of accommodation? The delegation had met at Ottawa the members of the British delegation.  They must have known what the British position was and the British must have known what the position of our Government was. Under the circumstances, if nothing was done in the way of an approach to an accommodation, what else was it but a farce to stage these negotiations in London?  Was nothing done? The House, in this most vital matter, is in complete ignorance of what occurred there, whether an advance was made or not.  As I say, if an advance was not made, or, at least, if there was not an understanding of the position, it was a shameful neglect of their opportunities on the part of the delegation sent to Ottawa.</P>
    <P>One thing is quite obvious from this White Paper.  From the way in which our case has been handled it is quite obvious that we will get no settlement of this matter in dispute between the two nations as long as we have the present Government in power.  You cannot have a settlement negotiated or carried through by a Government whose avowed policy is a policy of ill-will. From the start the head of the Executive Council, and the Executive Council, in so far as they have collective responsibility, have not advanced an inch towards settlement of the question&mdash;a difficult question perhaps and one requiring negotiation in a proper spirit.  They have indeed added to the difficulties with every step they have taken.  If there had been no advance made in conversation at Ottawa or Geneva, what led the President, the members of the Government, and the other parties to the negotiations to think that there was any chance of accommodation?  We see from this <Col N="1631" /> White Paper that, in comparison with the last time on which they met the members of the British Government, they are much further away from a settlement now.  And that is negotiating !  Of course it is quite true, as Deputy O'Hanlon pointed out, that there was no attempt to negotiate.  There was no consideration on the part of the Government for Irish interests and for the economic interests in this country that were being threatened and ruined by the policy they had been pursuing in political matters for the last six or seven months.  They wanted a burst-up with England.  If you read their speeches, are they not speeches animated with hostility to the people with whom they profess themselves anxious to enter into negotiations? They profess friendly feelings.  Have they ever shown any such friendly feelings in practice?  If two nations regard each other with feelings of hostility of that kind trouble is bound to result.  Anybody who has the slightest experience of international affairs knows perfectly well that even with two nations animated with good feelings towards each other misunderstandings may happen.  But when you have got a Government that still insists upon looking upon the other party to these negotiations as a hereditary enemy, you simply cannot expect a settlement; trouble is inevitable.</P>
    <P>An effort is made to stimulate that hostility and to whip it up in this country.  Has not every effort been made to make the spirit of the Irish people, which the Minister for Education boasts of knowing, explosive?  They promised the people that they would open up these things&mdash;we are told. See the way they have done it&mdash;no approach to a settlement or any effort to make a settlement.  It was a settlement that the Irish people wanted; it was not dialectics or law.  It was not in order that the President could show what a great &ldquo;arguefier&rdquo; he was.  It is quite obvious, as I say, that a settlement, as an ordinary man understands a settlement, was not wanted.  And, remember, that when I speak of a settlement, there are no grounds whatsoever <Col N="1632" /> for supposing, as the Minister for Education supposes, that such a settlement would merely mean a small concession. On what does he base that?  Is it on the information that was brought back to him from Ottawa or Geneva?  Why does he say, before any attempt was made to enter into negotiations, to enter into bargains, that the result of those bargains must be merely a small concession?  On what ground did he base that&mdash;on the ground of the information that he got from his colleagues from Ottawa?  Again, we are completely in the dark.</P>
    <P>This whole question, as they must know perfectly well, has cut across every other piece of policy in this country.  You try to start your industries here.  You try to help to them by tariffs.  What good are the tariffs when you have killed the purchasing power of the market?  The Government has a policy of building up by tariffs&mdash;they may be wrong in that policy, but, anyhow, it is a policy that a person can understand.  They have put it forward as their policy to build up the resources and industries of this country by means of tariffs and to reserve the home market for the home manufacturer&mdash;and this is the home market they give him!  How can the country purchase from the towns and, as the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, what chance is there of the towns being able to purchase from the country?  The shopkeeper is bound to meet his creditors and he is unable to get the money which is due to him in the country and he is faced in many instances with bankruptcy.  How can he keep on his business in the present situation?  How can he keep on the employment he gives?  You have neither a market in the country for the towns nor in the towns for the country.</P>
    <P>This situation has been brought about by the Government's two diametrically opposed policies, one cutting right across the other.  I shall not go into the question of the legality of these payments.  Our view in the matter is quite clearly known, apart altogether from any agreements &mdash;and I thought that, by this time, the so-called secrecy, the allegation of secrecy, about these agreements had <Col N="1633" /> been exploded, and sufficiently exploded, but, apparently, any libel, if it is libellous enough, can be repeated <i>ad lib.</i>  Apart altogether from any agreements, the money was due to be paid ultimately by the tenant purchaser to the people who gave the money.  The channel may have been different.  If the British Government had never come in, our Government would have been liable for the payment of that money.  We would have to collect it and pay it over to the bondholders.  The agreements may have changed the channel; they may have made other differences advantageous to this country but that is practically all that they did.  However, into the legal aspect of that question, I am not going.  But one thing is clear and that is, that, even if they are due, nobody can deny the extreme advantage it would be if we could honourably get out of having to meet these obligations at the present time&mdash;if we could get somebody else to take on these obligations.</P>
    <P>Has there been any advance or any attempt at an advance in that direction in these recent negotiations, as revealed by the statement of the President some weeks ago, or as revealed in the very meagre White Paper that is presented to us as summing up the pith of these negotiations?  That was the question in which the people of Ireland were interested and vitally interested; namely, can accommodation be reached on the subject of these payments? That, apparently, was not raised&mdash;it was not even seen, so far away were the two sides in the so-called negotiations.  It was not even seen by the parties and they did not even hint at it.  They kept all the time to the legalities.  What you had, therefore, was not negotiation but you had the Irish representatives putting their case as if they were before a court&mdash; and they were not before a court.  The only thing they argued was the legal aspect of the case.  That was the only thing that was argued, so far as we can judge, by the delegation in London. When you put up a legal case, it is met in the same fashion, and one legal aspect was put up stiff against the other and there could be no accommodation. <Col N="1634" /> On that question, there was one answer to all the claims made &mdash;either the moneys were or were not due&mdash;but no accommodation was possible. The question of accommodation was not raised then&mdash;and that is negotiation !  There was simply an opportunity once more for the members of the Irish delegation to show their ability in argument, though there was no court there and though it was a number of statesmen and politicians on both sides who had met to see whether they could reach accommodation.  Our delegates behaved at best as if we were before a court, arguing merely a legal case.</P>
    <P>There are references in the President's statement here to Shylock and so on.  What opportunity did he give to the other side except to put forward their case in the strongest fashion? Did he ask them for reconsideration of the amount?  He did not.  He did nothing except state the legal case once more.  He referred, I think in the very same sentence in his statement in this House in which he referred to the British playing the part of Shylock, to the fact that Great Britain herself was pleading for reconsideration of her debts, but he then adds that England did not pretend that they were not due.  That is the whole difference.  He limited the discussion to the question as to whether they were or were not due.  The other countries that plead for a remission of all or portion of their debts do not plead that they were not due.  They would have ensured their case not being even considered had they done so.  They do not deny the legality of the debts, but they say &ldquo;We want reconsideration on the basis of ability to pay.&rdquo;  But we could not do that!</P>
    <P>England could do it and all the great Powers of Europe could do it, but we are too proud!  We would not ask that &mdash;it is impossible to think that this great, proud nation would demean itself to do what, according to the President himself, practically every nation in Europe has been doing.  We could not do it.  We must have the strict legal claim.  I wonder if in reality the Government or the supporters of the Government <Col N="1635" /> believe in the strength of that legal claim?  If and when the President is able to carry out another portion of his declared policy&mdash;the setting up of a Republic in this country&mdash;he will have an opportunity, possibly, of having that decided in a court of international law.  I would advise him not to take the opinion of that court.  I would advise him, in the interests of this particular claim and in the interest of what this country can get out of this particular claim, not to appear before an international court.  I so advise him, not because the people in that court are not eminent lawyers&mdash;they are&mdash;but because I do not think we would have even a prima facie case to argue before them.</P>
    <P>Then, he wants to correct a misdescription in the incorrectness of &mdash;the exact word is hard to use or to describe&mdash;Mr. Thomas's references to his consistency.  I understand that the word used was &ldquo;consistency&rdquo; and not &ldquo;inconsistency&rdquo; in upholding the Republican idea&mdash;in some of the papers, anyway, it is &ldquo;consistency&rdquo; but it does not matter.  The question is what is to be our position in the British Commonwealth.  Was it not clear from the speeches of the very people with whom he was going to negotiate that that was the fundamental question behind it all?</P>
    <P>Examine the very terms of reference that were given by the President:&mdash; To see how far an accommodation could be reached in regard to the future financial relations&mdash;between what?  Between the Irish Free State and Great Britain&mdash;not the Irish Republic.  Surely that particular thing was bound to crop up if the negotiations went any distance. Was that the reason the negotiations were never entered into?  Was that the reason there was no negotiation and no discussion which might mean a new settlement of these particular matters?  If we could, for instance, get a settlement in our favour &mdash;say a remission of a large portion of these debts or an undertaking from Great Britain to meet these debts&mdash; that would mean a new arrangement between the two countries.  Were they <Col N="1636" /> in a position to carry out that agreement, or were they willing to carry it out?  Were they not debarred by their very attitude towards the Commonwealth of Nations from any possibility of carrying it out or even entering into negotiations about it?  They could not make an agreement striking off a large percentage of these debts.  The Republican attitude that was outlined, the view of the President on that particular matter, debarred them from anything of the sort.  The people in the country should realise that.</P>
    <P>There were no negotiations in London because there could not be any negotiations that would be in any way beneficial to the people of this country.  The fundamental stand of the President made that impossible.  His attitude towards the Commonwealth was very helpful!  &ldquo;As long as I am in it, I am in it.&rdquo;  That is clear!  That clears up the whole atmosphere!  In regard to other matters he said: &ldquo;Now I am out, now I am in&rdquo;&mdash;also very helpful!  If agreements were to be made, that was not the attitude to adopt.  It was quite obvious from statements made by men on the other side in public that agreements could only be made on the basis of our place in the British Commonwealth of Nations.  Let Deputies on the other side or Deputies amongst the Labour Party ask themselves: Could there have been any negotiations in the circumstances? That is the policy that is being backed up by seven trusty men who got into the Dáil, and incidentally into power, by being pro-Treaty. They know that the whole difficulty is due to the obstinacy of the President in not facing up to the issue.  Instead we had the farce&mdash;not the comedy, because comedy can be dignified&mdash;played out to the end.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance goes over with his scales and the question of the gold ounces is raised.  There is a claim for what we lost by England going off the gold standard.  People in this country complain that we lost a good deal more by going on the gold standard. Why was there not a claim made in that respect?  You need not drop the <Col N="1637" /> other claim: you can make both.  It is quite in keeping with the policy of the Executive to make a claim for both.  What was achieved as a result of the proceedings in London?  There was a momentary throwing of dust in the eyes of the Irish people.  &ldquo;He is gone over for a settlement,&rdquo;&ldquo;There will be a settlement,&rdquo;&ldquo;It will not be a perfect settlement; it will not be exactly everything we desire and people will be dissatisfied, but there will be a settlement this time&rdquo;&mdash;inspired remarks of that kind were going around the country.  We did not get even an approach to a settlement. There was simply an effort to blind the people.  The idea, apparently, was to tide over an extra week or two in the hope, as far as the disappointment of the people was concerned, they would get accustomed to it.</P>
    <P>What was the result?  The President returned and there was nothing done. We were told that the fault was altogether on the other side.  There was the degrading assumption that it was because there was a certain type of Government in England that there was no settlement.  It is hard to be amazed at anything the President does.  We were not even amazed when he based the freedom of this country on an English statute during the debate on the Oath Bill.  I confess I was a little surprised when he came here a few weeks ago and stressed that under the National Government in England there was no chance of a decent settlement, no chance of justice.  In other words, he told the Irish people: &ldquo;Wait until there is another Government in power in England and then we will have a chance.&rdquo;  I wonder is that an inspiration from the Labour Party?  Do they think there will be any change?  Who was the Foreign Minister who refused to sign the Optional Clause without reservations?  Was he a member of what the Minister for Education calls the Tory Government?  No. he was one of the colleagues of Deputy Davin.</P>

      <P>Not now.  Is Deputy Davin satisfied with the reactions of this policy on the railway position?  No doubt he thinks it will help them greatly.  What is the Deputy's attitude with reference to the interference with the cattle trade? However, that will not prevent him walking in to the support of a Party that has repudiated the Treaty, destroyed the Treaty, that has brought about the complete opposite to employment in this country.  It is useless to expect anything to come from a Government that stands for these things and that has done these things.  This is the occasion to deal with our cattle trade!  The object, we are told, is to kill the cattle trade.  We all had the pleasure of listening the other night to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The Minister was extremely eloquent&mdash;perhaps a little indiscreet, but at the same time eloquent.  We had from him a paen of victory over the destruction of the cattle trade. <Col N="1639" /> What is the position?  If the Minister or members of his Party go down the country they will find that the people there were being lulled into a sense of security&mdash;it is almost incredible, but it is the fact&mdash;that the English people could not do without our cattle.  &ldquo;John Bull would have to tighten his belt; they would starve him out, and he would have to give in&rdquo;!  That is what the people were told, and that is what a large number of them believed.  They believed that without our trade that country could not carry on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same Party comes now and tells us that instead of that being so, the English people are really anxious to keep out our cattle, and are only utilising this dispute as an excuse for doing so.  Apparently, so far from being dependent on our cattle, they are willing to utilise this dispute to keep them out and are anxious to do it.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce asked us to read the &ldquo;Daily Mail&rdquo;&mdash;I thought his organ was the &ldquo;Daily Express&rdquo;&mdash;which day after day has complaints from the English cattle trade against our cattle trade, complaints that Irish cattle are being dumped, and asking to be saved from the Irish cattle trade.  Of course the Irish Government must come to the assistance of the English cattle trade. That is the only way to read their present policy.  The unfortunate dupes down the country were told that the English would be obliged to give in, that they could not do without our cattle.  That is the constructive policy and the international policy of this Government!  The Governments, of course, never expected any trouble! They never do until the thing happens, and the people were led to believe that there would be no trouble.  They were told by members of the Government, over the removal of the Oath, that no one in England cared two pence about it.  I think the phrase used by a very high personage on the opposite benches was that they did not care a <i>thraneen</i> about it.  Yet we have the present situation.  We have the unfortunate reactions of that whole Oath situation, of this way of conducting business, on the main industry of the <Col N="1640" /> country.  And the Government is satisfied, and is prepared to fight it until this country is reduced to a shambles. That is its policy, and behind that policy we are asked to rally, behind a policy that we think is disastrous for this country, behind a policy for which we think there is no excuse, behind a policy that can only have one result, as far as this country is concerned, and that is a disastrous one.  We are asked to rally the country behind that disastrous policy and to say that we shall not be guilty of the crowning sin of not trusting Fianna Fáil, and not giving Fianna Fáil a chance.  They got it.</P>
    <P>The leader of that Party must have something up his sleeve.  Otherwise, he could not have taken up such a stupid line.  &ldquo;He has a trick there.&rdquo;  There is only one sound trick. Let him give up the impossible position he has taken up&mdash;that is the only way to meet the situation.  The belief that this question can be solved by tricks is a mistake.  There are certain issues at stake, issues of grave importance to this country.  Our hold on the English market was of great importance. We are losing our hold and we gave an opportunity to those who are our rivals in that market, not merely by passing the Oath Bill through the Dáil, but by the way we handled the Oath question.  Naturally our rivals were keen to make the most of the opportunity and they did so. Now we find the English market flooded with cattle while we have our cattle still on our hands.  What position are we in now?  What position are the unfortunate people in who have cattle on their hands?  I remember that Deputy Gorey pointed out here, during a debate that took place, the unwisdom of the advice given from the Front Government Benches, telling the people to hold the cattle.  We gave a fillip to our rivals in the English market and we held our cattle.  If they were put on the English market now they would be a drug, so that the English Government may adopt the policy outlined by the Minister.  He says that they were anxious to keep out Irish cattle as they wanted to save their own cattle trade.  Instead of the <Col N="1641" /> destroyed cattle trade we have a wheat policy.  No one has explained how the cattle are to be got rid of, even with a successful wheat policy; no one has explained what market we have for these surplus cattle even if there is a wheat market here&mdash;the cattle necessary to consume the crops that must be sown in rotation after wheat.</P>
    <P>The issue before the people, and before members of the Dáil, should be perfectly clear.  I can well understand the belief that may have prevailed in some of the benches opposite that the Treaty did not give full freedom, that there was continuous interference in the policy of this country by the British Government.  I was in the last Government for a number of years and there was never the slightest interference as to how we were to conduct policy at home or abroad.  Surely the members of the Government now in power have the intelligence to know that there is no interference.  They would have proof if there was interference with our freedom.  Those of them who took part in International gatherings must surely know that there are few countries in Europe whose policy was not much more interfered with, and much more subject to outward dictation than our policy ever was at the hands of the British Government.  That these views could be held when the Party opposite was in Opposition is understandable, but that they could be held at the present moment by any one of intelligence in the Government and by any one who has records and files and who knows the relations between the two countries is absolutely incredible.  In the light of the new knowledge that they have acquired of the real freedom that this country enjoys and that no declaration of a republic can increase &mdash;but may diminish&mdash;I ask sane members on the opposite benches seriously to consider the issues involved.  There is no good telling us at the present moment that nothing can be gained in the English market.  Perhaps not&mdash;in a state of war&mdash;but in the normal state of affairs a great deal can be gained from normal relations and especially from preferential trade relations between <Col N="1642" /> the two countries.  That is what we vainly expected from the Ottawa delegation, but that was not accomplished. We ask the various members of the Labour Party and those who profess to have an interest in employment, and also those on the other benches who have an interest in the economic welfare of the country to have an end put to this.  We ask them to reconsider their position before it is too late and before the country becomes a mere funeral pyre for the satisfaction of the head of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Cleary Mr. Cleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very unreal debate, the most unreal debate I have heard for a long time.  The speeches from the Opposition members, Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Professor O'Sullivan and Deputy O'Hanlon had nothing of sincerity in them.  I am convinced, after listening to them, that nobody would be more seriously disappointed if this motion was carried than the Leader of the Opposition.  He does not mean that the House should pass the motion at all, but with a certain airing of his political views, and a certain cringing and pleading to the worst instincts of the people, he thought that the national outlook might be smashed and brought to a lower level than Deputy Cosgrave succeeded in bringing it to during his term of office. We were told by Deputy Cosgrave, or by members of his Party&mdash;and in particular by Deputy Hogan&mdash;that they were most anxious that the country should get at least two years of Fianna Fáil Government, that it needed two years of Fianna Fáil Government. If they were sincere about that, why the pretence of putting down a motion on which they want the Government to be defeated?  I think this motion is not meant to be serious.  Hence, the speeches that have been made in support of the motion cannot be taken on the merits, or in any sense as a contribution to the debate.  Of course Deputy Cosgrave complained that the negotiations have broken down.  They have broken down.  Every possible effort was made by the President&mdash;and he should know more about it than Deputy Cosgrave&mdash;so that the negotiations would succeed.  Deputy Cosgrave <Col N="1643" /> is now disappointed.  So am I disappointed that Deputy Cosgrave, after his ten years of office, and with his wide experience of negotiations did not point out how they could succeed. Deputy Cosgrave has a very wide experience of negotiations, and discussed very important matters with the British Government.  He approached them on a number of occasions.  Does the Deputy suggest that the manner of approach adopted by him should be adopted by President de Valera, and that not only the manner of approach but the agreement adopted by him should be adopted by President de Valera?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does he, when he finds fault with the President for broadcasting Ireland's claim in a frank and clear manner to the world, and not to the British alone, suggest that Ireland's claim should be kept secret and that the British should only be communicated with in a secret manner?  He said that there were well-defined general principles of diplomatic intercourse. What are the &ldquo;well-defined general principles of diplomatic intercourse&rdquo; that President de Valera has ignored?  Did Deputy Cosgrave, when he was in office adopt those &ldquo;well-defined general principles of diplomatic intercourse?&rdquo; Was the keeping secret for nine years of vital agreements&mdash;agreements signing away millions of money, the property of the Irish people&mdash;was that in accord with the &ldquo;well-defined general principles of diplomatic intercourse&rdquo; that, he complains, President de Valera ignored? Was it in accord with the &ldquo;well-defined general principles of diplomatic intercourse&rdquo; that Deputy Cosgrave and his Party dealt with the Boundary problem when it was being argued out with the British Government? Are those the principles that President de Valera should have adopted?  Does Deputy Cosgrave find fault with President de Valera because he did not follow the same course that the Deputy adopted in 1923, when he made a secret agreement with the British Government, or the same course that he adopted in connection with the Boundary fiasco, or the same <Col N="1644" /> course that he adopted in 1926, when he made a further secret agreement with the British Government?  If President de Valera had adopted that course and if he came back and, without stating the facts of the case, told the Dáil and the country that he had made a damn good bargain, would he be acting according to the &ldquo;well-defined general principles of diplomatic intercourse?&rdquo; If he did that, would Deputy Cosgrave be satisfied? What is his complaint?  In the very nature of things, the one thing for success in the relations between this country and Britain, the one thing for a successful agreement on behalf of the Irish people that President de Valera could not do was to follow the &ldquo;well-defined general principles of diplomatic intercourse&rdquo; which Deputy Cosgrave adopted when in office.  If President de Valera did that, we might have another fiasco similar to the Boundary fiasco; we might have another secret agreement as vital as the agreement of 1923 or as the agreement of 1926.  I think that the President is to be commended for not following Deputy Cosgrave's line of negotiation.</P>
    <P>I thought that the Deputy, as the result of his varied experience of negotiation, as the result of the numerous damn good bargains that he succeeded in making with Britain, would have told the President in plain language how he would approach this question.  I thought he would have pointed out plainly the mistakes he himself made when in office or, if he did not make mistakes, the wonderful success he had achieved in negotiation. I thought he would have told the President how he brought about these successes.  These would be practical suggestions for Deputy Cosgrave to make.  They would be helpful to the President, and would be appreciated by the country as a whole.  Instead of that, he comes forward with a political harangue.  We hear again that the Church is on the verge of ruin.  I thought that when he was in office he had throttled Communism for all time. I thought he had finished the job. He tells us that the spiritual losses cannot be imagined.  That is, I presume, <Col N="1645" /> because we have not made another secret agreement with the British, or brought back another damn good bargain of the type that he brought back.  He tells us that implacable hatreds are being raised up again in this country, that avarice and greed obtain in the country and that a loosening of morals is taking place; that class hatred is raising its ugly head and that Christian charity is diminishing.  No man preached more about these things than Deputy Cosgrave did when he was in office.  He should have found a way of combatting those evils and he should tell us about it.  As regards class hatreds and the creation of strife and bitterness, does the Deputy not realise that if there was one man more than another who threw in that red herring in the united ranks of the people, it was Deputy Blythe, when he went down to Clifden and gloated over the fact that his Party, or branches of his Party, were organising the A.C.A., and that when sufficiently organised they would make smithereens of the I.R.A.?  What about class hatred and the throwing in of red herrings amongst the Irish people?  Is Deputy Blythe not to be censured, or was it to Deputy Blythe's speech that Deputy Cosgrave referred to-day?  He should not find fault with President de Valera because of that. He should have a meeting of his own Party and give them a lecture and not talk here about Christian principles and the success&mdash;or lack of success, as he insinuated&mdash;of the Eucharistic Congress. He should have a meeting of his own Party and tell them what he told them before&mdash;that this country must honour its bond, must pay 20/- in the £1.  He should preach to-day that manly doctrine that he preached about eight months ago.  When he speaks to-day about an honourable agreement, honourably made with Britain and honourably kept, does he suggest that that honourable agreement, as he holds honourably made, should be still kept and, in his usual phrase, that 20/- in the £1 should continue to be paid by the Irish people? Are those the methods by which he suggests a settlement should be made with the British&mdash;the payment of the 20/- in the £1.</P>

      <P>This honourable agreement, honourably made, was dishonourably kept secret for about nine years.  The Deputy knew that he could not remain in power if that were not done.  I hope that this question of the payment of 20/- in the £1 and the keeping of agreements will be remembered by members of Deputy Cosgrave's Party when they get up to speak on this motion, because these matters were forgotten by the Deputy.  Deputy Cosgrave spoke about hypothetical, absurd and fantastic claims made by this Government against the British Government.  The British will be very grateful to the Deputy for that.  A good many of the British people, including some leading men in the legal world, were beginning to believe that there was something in the Irish claim. The British Government were not at all anxious that this claim should go before an Arbitration Board which would not have its hands tied in any way.  They did not want it to go before a clean court.  They were definitely coming to the conclusion that there was something in the claim.  They will be grateful to Deputy Cosgrave to learn that it is a hypothetical, fantastic and absurd claim.  That will help the British in some little way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy tells us, in the same breath, that this Government has failed lamentably in its economic as well as its political programme.  He tells us that they got a good chance. They got, according to the Deputy, every chance to make good and fulfil their promises.  What chance did they get from the Deputy's Party?  What chance did the President get on the very first occasion when he was crossing to London to meet the British?  On the previous day Deputy Cosgrave's friends in the Seanad turned down a Bill which passed through this House and which the Seanad itself had allowed to pass through the Seanad without challenging a division a few days before.  They threw out that Bill and thus sent an encouraging note to the British that President de Valera was not going to have his way in this <Col N="1647" /> State.  That is the grand chance the President got to make good.</P>
    <P>On every occasion when the President was either replying to a note from the British, or stating his case to the British, or preparing for negotiations on the case, or when anything was published or any case made to the British, Deputy Cosgrave made it his business to do as he did when he went to the Aberdeen Hall at the Gresham Hotel and condemned the case made by the Government, thus giving the British powder for their guns.  That is the grand chance President de Valera has got on every occasion.  When the Irish people were settling down to peace amongst themselves some rumour was started, fathered by the Cumann na nGaedheal people, and spread throughout the country showing that things were not well in the Free State.</P>
    <P>At one time, the rumour was that the civil servants were going to rebel. At another time, it was that the Army was going to rebel and at another time, it was the Gárda Síochána who were going into rebellion.  These rumours were published in papers with which Deputy Cosgrave has great influence. Only about a fortnight ago one of Deputy Cosgrave's newspapers stated that the Army were ordered to stand to arms; that something like rebellion was to happen in this country.  That was the sort of talk favoured by Cumann na nGaedheal agents.  At another time, the rumour spread was that Jacobs were closing down; once more it was that Guinness was leaving the country and, last week, there was talk that a carpet factory in Donegal was closed down.</P>
    <P>The Government had to come out on that occasion and to deny those false, disgraceful Cumann na nGaedheal rumours which are trying to break down the morale of the people.  That is the fine chance that Cumann na nGaedheal is giving this Government. Cumann na nGaedheal knows that it is not giving the Government a fair chance; they know that they do not want the Government to succeed; the only hope for Cumann na nGaedheal is that the Government will fail; that <Col N="1648" /> the British will break this Government and then Cumann na nGaedheal would have the chance of saying &ldquo;look at the mess you made by putting President de Valera into power.&rdquo;  Cumann na nGaedheal has no hope of coming into power.  Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies know that if this motion were carried the people who would suffer would be themselves.  They know very well that they do not want to be put into office.</P>

      <P>Cumann na nGaedheal does not want office.  What would they do for industry?  How would their policy save us from world depression? Deputy Hogan, the ex-Minister for Agriculture, said, five months before he went out of office that the world depression had not yet hit this country and that it would not hit it in full force until the spring of 1932.  And now we are told that this world depression is all the result and is all the fault of President de Valera being a proud man and because of his vanity.  We were told that that, coupled with the loosening of public morals, is responsible for the state of affairs in this country at present.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave complains that President de Valera has no ability and that his Ministers are all duds.  That is the position according to Deputies Cosgrave and O'Sullivan.  But Deputy O'Hanlon who is one of the shrewdest politicians in this House because he can always have a leg in each way, paid the President's Ministers the tribute that they succeeded in bluffing Mr. Thomas to such an extent that Mr. Thomas did exactly what they wanted him to do.  If that is the type of mind that governs Cumann na nGaedheal I think it is time for Cumann na nGaedheal to re-organise its ranks and to bring back Deputy O'Higgins.  They ought to try to infuse new blood and try and find a new policy for their departure from the twenty shilling in the pound policy and &ldquo;honour your bond.&rdquo; They should formulate some other policy instead of criticising the Government. If they put up that policy they will be treated by the Government in a decenter way than they deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1649" /> I might mention, while I am at it, one word about the farmers of this country.  When I mention the farmers I do not mean the farmers in certain parts of the midlands who attend a hunt meeting to-day in silk hats and come out to-morrow in corduroys to talk about the victims of President de Valera's Government.  I mean the working farmers, the men who work on the land, not the ranchers who run Deputy MacDermot's Party.  I do not mean the cattle men either.  I do not want to talk about them, because if any men have been made the victims of Deputy Cosgrave's régime it was the cattle men.  Deputy Cosgrave so directed policy for ten years that the only men who could live in this country were these men, but they had nothing to fall back upon but the success of the cattle trade.  As Deputy Hogan said here some years ago &ldquo;we can only be successful here while England is successful; we can only be prosperous here while England is prosperous, and if England totters, we totter too.&rdquo;  He said we would have to wait to get out of this depression until England became prosperous.  The only means we had in this country was a dependence on the cattle trade.  Everything else was killed by Deputy Cosgrave's régime.  Now the people who have the cattle to sell are in a desperate state too.  Deputy O'Hanlon talks about the bounty not reaching the farmers.  How much better prices would they get if Deputy Hogan were still Minister for Agriculture?</P>

      <P>Can they tell us that the British market would not be closed by a certain preference if Deputy Hogan were still in power?  If England would give that big concession what would he give in return for it?  If Britain put up a tariff against Irish cattle or Irish farm produce and built a market for her own products, what would Deputy Hogan's policy or Deputy Cosgrave's policy be?  Would you have them preaching the doctrine that ranching was the only hope for the country or would they be preaching the <Col N="1650" /> doctrine that the Saorstát should go back again to tillage?  That is the policy of the present Government. Deputy Cosgrave was not able to bring about industrial development here and he was not able to make farming a paying policy after ten years.  This Government while it was being stuck in the back for it by Deputy Cosgrave's agents has done very well.  I think when we regard the hard facts that this Government have run up against in the few months since they came into office it must be admitted that they have almost performed miracles.</P>

      <P>People now who go into industry are being given a chance of succeeding and the industrial development will guarantee success to our farming industry here.  These things may not please Deputy Gorey.  I remember when the Deputy was pressing here for a tariff on bacon.  Many members of the Cumann na nGaedheal have a hobby or every three or four of them have a hobby between them; they want their own particular industry to be protected.  Deputy Gorey wants protection for bacon; Deputy Bennett wants protection for the butter industry, and so on, but they want no other industry outside that protected.  They must look at things in a bigger, broader way than that and they must accept in toto the Government's policy of protecting Irish industries so as to give a livelihood to the people here at home.  They must take a stand against Britain that was not Deputy Cosgrave's stand when he was in power.  The people will win this struggle if they are prepared to back the Government.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cleary is a spirited orator, but I doubt if any member of this House has such a knack of making statements more widely divorced from fact.  I do not propose to go through all, or nearly all, of the statements that he made but I might mention a few of them. One is his statement that one of the characteristics of the present situation is a sense of security in the minds <Col N="1651" /> of investors.  I must say that that piece of information astonishes me and I am sorry that he offers no evidence in support of it.  Another was that the particular agricultural organisation with which I am connected consists of ranchers when, in fact, ninety per cent. of our members are small farmers.  Another was that the Seanad had chosen the occasion of a visit by President de Valera to London to pass a drastic amendment to the Oath Bill, when, in point of fact, the Opposition in the Seanad made an offer to postpone the question of the amendment of the Oath Bill in view of the negotiations and that offer was not accepted by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying why it should or should not have been accepted, but in view of the fact that they did not accept that offer, I think it is outrageously unjust and misleading to blame the Seanad on the grounds that they timed their amendment to conflict with the President's visit to London.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cleary further stated that the British had refused to go to a clean court of arbitration.  That again is a statement which seems to me utterly untrue, and again the Deputy did not attempt to support the statement by any shred of evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning from Deputy Cleary to the Minister for Education, the Minister, when referring to alleged advice given to the farmers of this country not to pay their annuities, waved a denunciatory hand in my direction and, therefore, I feel called upon to say that I never gave such advice.  Quite the contrary.  But I did say, and I have no hesitation in repeating it, that owing to the policy of the Government the vast majority of the farmers of this country will not be able to pay their annuities, and I think that future events will justify that statement.  I also stated that, in my opinion, it was grossly unjust of the Government to try to collect the annuities in view of the effects of their present policy towards the farmers, and I have no hesitation in saying that.  I did say, however, <Col N="1652" /> that the legal obligation of the farmer to pay was plain; and that for anyone who was able to pay to resist payment would mean that he was landing himself under unnecessary expenses. The Minister for Education seems to have entirely forgotten his sense of humour when he blamed Deputy Cosgrave in one breath for having put over a colossal fraud on the Irish people and in the next breath for not denouncing that fraud and helping them to upset it.  He complained that the Government had no choice between handling over this money to the British or retaining it, and that it was therefore entirely wrong to blame them for doing something brusque or dishonourable in retaining it.  He seems to have forgotten, however, that it was open to the Government to enter into negotiations with the British about the land annuities and the other matters concerned long before they fell due and that the Government did nothing of the kind.</P>
    <P>The only other remark I have to make about the speech of the Minister for Education is that he surprised me by apparently shutting his eyes to the degree of misery and poverty existing in this country at the present moment. He apparently enabled himself to do so by recounting all the various financial benefits that the Government had been conferring on the poorer members of the community.  I do not deny that the Government has been shovelling out money, but shovelling out money is not the way to bring prosperity to a nation, and it cannot take the place of profit-earning capacity, and the Government have done infinitely more harm by lessening the profit-earning capacity than they have done good by shovelling out money. I hope that, in the course of this debate, the Government will do something to clear up the fog that undoubtedly exists as to what their policy is. The misery which exists in this country is considerably heightened by the feeling that people do not know whether the Government know their own minds and that the people do not know what the Government are driving at. We hear of this economic war and of <Col N="1653" /> the fact that the Government are waging it on our behalf.  But who knows what kind of victory the Government want in this war?  Do they want to get back into the British market and into the British system, or do they want to get out of it?  The larger part of their propaganda seems to mean that they want to get out of it &mdash;that the British market is a dying economic unit and the sooner we cut adrift from it the better.  They do not seem to have turned their attention to the fact that the evidence that the British market is dying is the same evidence that every market in the world is dying.  What market in the world at the present moment has not enormously decreased in buying and trading power during the last few years?  Have they considered the desirability of cutting adrift from the world as a whole and sending Ireland out on a voyage into the ether?  Besides the doubt as to what kind of victory they are aiming at, there is a doubt as to their whole economic out-look&mdash;a doubt as to whether they are in favour of the system called capitalism or private property, or the system of State socialism.  There again the bulk of their propaganda would lead one to imagine that the aim was State socialism.  And, in particular, there is a doubt as to whether or not they approve of the extraordinarily ignorant, ill-informed and clap-trap kind of attacks on the banks of this country which are constantly being made by their less responsible supporters. To those who admit that the economic condition of the country at the present moment is deplorable, the entire Government case depends on the assumption that we are being bullied by the British Government and that the British Government is attempting to coerce us.  Has the British Government bullied or coerced us or attempted to do so since the Treaty, about any matter on which no agreement existed?  Did Great Britain retaliate for any of our tariffs?  She might have been entitled to do so without being a bully, but did she do it? Did she try to bully us into giving the Shannon enterprise to a British firm instead of to a German firm?  Did she <Col N="1654" /> interfere about such matters as the Union Jack, or God Save the King, or compulsory Irish?  If not, there is a presumption that she would not have intervened and would never intervene in any matter that did not involve a breach, or a supposed breach, of an international agreement.  If that presumption is justified, it is an abuse of language to complain of bullying and coercion, and the argument that if we are not obstinate on this occasion, we shall be subject to constant English interference about all sorts of things, is completely fallacious.  Our Government holds that the Agreements of 1923 and 1926 are invalid.  Suppose that is right; still it must be admitted that these agreements were believed to be valid and our Government brusquely repudiated them.</P>
    <P>Why did they adopt such a brusque manner of repudiating them?  I think the answer is the same as President de Valera gave a few days ago as the reason why Mr. Ryan made a speech in College Green saying that Cosgrave and Co. must not be allowed to make speeches.  The answer is that they want to be acclaimed as fools.  There is no nation in the world that would not have resented the sort of action our Government took.  We should have done it if we had been in the place of the British and to have done it is no proof of a bullying disposition. But, could we claim that these agreements are invalid?  I maintain we could not.  If these agreements had been made by a Government which was only momentarily in office, if they had placed on the country burdens that were entirely unexpected, if the Wyndham Land Act with its loan and its bonus had been forced on us instead of being universally welcomed and acclaimed, if the Legislature had refused in any degree to implement these Cosgrave agreements, if they had been repudiated by the country at the first available opportunity, then we might perhaps claim that they were invalid, but they were made by a Government which held office for ten years.  The financial obligations they placed on the country were not greater than had been expected at the time of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1655" /> The paying over of the land annuities in particular to the British Government for transmission to the stock-holders was not in any way a novelty.  Legislation to implement the agreements was passed by the Oireachtas and in the two general elections of 1927 the Government which made the agreements was again returned to power by the people of the country. In these circumstances I regard the attempt to repudiate the agreements on narrow technical grounds as indefensible. The President says that the only alternative was to go to the British Government with our hats in our hands.  Deputy Professor O'Sullivan has pointed out that if that metaphor would be applicable to a request by us for a revision of our financial arrangements with Great Britain, it would be equally applicable to a request by France, Italy or Great Britain for a revision of their financial arrangements with the United States. I do not know what country could afford to throw the first stone at us. We prefer, however, to follow the example of Bolshevik Russia, to denounce our own fellow-countrymen as traitors and to refuse to be bound by financial agreements entered into by a previous Government.  I confess I find this infinitely the more humiliating attitude of the two.  It is also an attitude which, in our case at any rate, is far and away the less sensible and practical.</P>
    <P>If our present Government would accept a Governor-General without insulting him, would recognise obligations of loyalty and friendship to its partners throughout the Commonwealth and would drop its programme of bluster, jingoism and the breaking of agreements, there can hardly be a doubt that a favourable financial revision could be obtained.  It is because the Government has chosen instead a path fatal alike to the honour and to the prosperity of this country that I have no hesitation in supporting the motion.  The Government's apologists say that our life-blood has been ebbing away owing to our habit of paying our debts and that we have not noticed it.  That is sheer nonsense. <Col N="1656" /> But their policy of repudiation is poisoning our life-blood and we do notice it.  And if, owing to overlapping and confusion as between the 1920 Home Rule Act and the Treaty there was a legal flaw in the British Government's claim to continue receiving the land annuities, those who discovered that flaw, and who, on account of it, have dishonoured engagements subsequently entered into on our behalf, may pride themselves on their ingenuity but they cannot escape the condemnation of history for the moral and material damage they have done to our people.</P>

      <P>I intervene in this debate merely for a few reasons. I have listened very carefully to the speeches made and I know the situation as it exists throughout the country.  I think that any person, knowing the country as it is to-day, is entitled to ask Deputies, whether they be on the Government Benches or on these benches, are they aware of what the situation is?  I think I am also entitled to ask them the question: Can any speech, any statement or any query that may be put to them change their minds or their Party affiliations? Remember this country of ours is much bigger than Parties or persons.  To-day it is faced with one of the gravest situations that it has ever been confronted with in its history.  That being the case I think that every man, nothwithstanding where he may have stood in 1920-21, 1922, 1916 or even 1914, should ask himself to-day what is the problem that confronts him and the problem that confronts the country.  If he asks himself that question I think he must come to one conclusion. That is, in a nutshell, that peace must be established between this country and Great Britain.  The markets must be restored to our farmers and a re-arrangement of our financial obligations must be entered into.</P>
      <P>The motion which we are discussing reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Dáil censures the Executive Council for its continued failure satisfactorily to adjust the differences between it and the British Government and condemns it for <Col N="1657" /> pursuing a policy which has caused grevious injury to the agricultural industry, serious damage to the export trade of the country, heavy losses to the community and gravely increased unemployment.</P>
    <P>In ten or twelve years of the history of the country, there was never a more serious motion put down for the consideration of the House.  Deputy Cosgrave made a speech in introducing that motion which I think in the mind of every right-thinking person must be received with approbation.  I am perfectly satisfied that if the Government had the courage just to face up to the responsibility that rests upon it things might be much different.  I want to assure the Government that it is no pleasure to me to censure them because I have always supported the proposition that the Government of this country, whoever they are, are the people of the country.  I for one at no time have censured the Government of the country because I feel that I am censuring the people when I am censuring the Government, and therefore it is only an extreme situation that would put me into the position of agreeing to a motion such as this.  I want to make myself perfectly clear on that, because as I say censure of the Government means censure of the people&mdash;censure of the people for being so foolish as to elect men who would create such a situation as we find ourselves in to-day.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Deputies of the House to apply the ordinary tenets of business transactions or the ordinary creed of business dealings to this problem, and to put the country above and beyond Parties and individuals, and urge if necessary that we should have a private session in the House so that we could arrive at a decision by which the country could be saved from the position that I believe and that I know it is going into.  At the last General Election we were told&mdash;I was listening to it in at least six places; I was listening to it in Carrick-on-Shannon; I was listening to it in Newtowncashel, and I heard it in many other places&mdash;that whether England liked it or not she would have to buy our cattle.  The <Col N="1658" /> story that was put forward was &ldquo;We shot them down in 1920-21 and yet they bought our cattle&rdquo;&mdash;that was a speech I was listening to&mdash;&ldquo;and surely we are not doing anything more to them now than we did in 1920-21, and yet they had to buy our cattle.&rdquo;  If anybody with any sense examined that argument they will see that it is bound to be wrong.  The Minister for Agriculture told us that he does not care whether Britain puts on 20, 40, or 100 per cent.&mdash;that this country is going to survive and that we do not care.  Would that mean, sir, that we would just get the bounty for selling them, or that we would have to give them something for taking them from us?</P>

      <P>I am afraid that neither the President nor the Minister for Defence nor the ex-Minister for Defence of 1922-23 has ever had an appreciation of the situation.  What is the appreciation of the situation at the moment?  What is the situation?  Have you ever had an examination of it? Where are you going?  What are your plans?  What do you intend to do? Who is the enemy?  What is your intention about him?  Can you beat him? What are his forces?  There are many questions.  Have you your scouts out? Do we have to take it that the Secret Service Vote that was passed here last week has something to do with that? What are you doing?  I am perfectly, satisfied that you have not applied even the ordinary military tactics.  Every statesman says that a military man is only an amadán in his own way.  You have not applied military tactics.  You do not know where you are going, you do not know what you are doing, nor do you know what the end is going to be.  Will we have a truce in a month? Will we have it in five months?  Will we have it in two years, and how many casualties are we going to have in between?  I am not at all satisfied that the Minister for Industry and Commerce knew the number of casualties he was going to have in this battle, nor am I satisfied that the Minister for Finance has fully appreciated the <Col N="1659" /> situation&mdash;that he can tell the number of casualties he is going to have in this economic battle&mdash;because I regret to say, and I regret it with all sincerity, that the military forces of the State are not operating instead of the statesmen or so-called politicians of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave, when he was speaking, told you that this Government had an opportunity to do something for this country that no other Government had, that is because of various circumstances, and that they have failed to do it.  There are Deputies who have spoken and said that we should still pay them a tribute of confidence. I submit, sir, that we cannot do that.  We are told that President de Valera has led the country in peace and in war.  I regret to say that on examination that statement does not hold water.  He has done neither one nor the other.  He has led it neither in peace nor in war, but he has done this &mdash;I do not know whether I should say it or not&mdash;he has brought us up to the shores of Lough Swilly and he has swamped us all there.  Mind you a great man led the Irish people here once.  He was all right, he was not a bad Irishman at all, but because he did not know what to do at the right time, our people got killed there on the shores of Lough Swilly.  However, that is a bit of history, I suppose.  We have to ask Deputies of this House to weigh up this situation and allow no prejudice, or Party tags even, to keep them from doing their duty to the people of Ireland, because as I have said before, the people of Ireland are above and beyond all Parties.  Now the situation is this, that we are to fight to the end&mdash;we are to fight to a finish. To finish where?  What are we to do? Does it mean that the Government are going to resist up to a point at which we will have to put up the white flag? Does it mean that we are going to go on with the arbitration that the Minister for Justice repudiated in Athlone?  The Minister for Justice, speaking in Athlone a short time ago, said that he was now opposed to arbitration.  Why?  Did it mean that he has lost faith in the legal advice <Col N="1660" /> which he tendered?  Does it mean that we have to go on like this for two years more?  If you were at the fair of Longford, or the fair of Athlone, or the fair of Fermoy, inside the last three weeks &mdash;I have been in all three fairs&mdash;and heard the people talking there, you would consider the situation and consider your position in a very definite manner.  The people are lulled into a sense of false security.  They are told to wait.  They are told that everything will be all right, that you have men at the head of the State you can trust. That is your supporters' cry to me when I meet them: &ldquo;Give them a chance.  Wait.  Everything will be all right.  They will settle next week.  I have heard on the most reliable information that the President is going back again, and that everything will be all right.&rdquo;  He went to London on 14th October, but had he had the courage on 14th October to effect a settlement&mdash;aye and even to make what Deputy Cleary describes not as a damn good bargain, but a damn bad bargain&mdash;and come back, the people would have hailed him as the greatest hero this country ever produced.  But he had not the courage to do it, because, remember this, it will take an Irishman to do that&mdash;to come back and say to the Irish people, &ldquo;That is the best I could do.  I could not do any better.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Collins and Griffith went over and made their bargain and came back to the Irish people and told them so. Yet in the Seanad we are being told by no less a person than the President that an advance had been made in that Treaty which it was not possible to imagine in 1922.  If Collins and Griffith happened to go over and make a bargain, and if they had to go back instead on that bargain, where were the people of this country?  But we had Irishmen that day at the head of the State, and we had Irishmen able to take responsibility for the things they had done, and to say &ldquo;we have done it, it is the best we could do, and if anybody else comes along and can do better let them take a chance.&rdquo; There are Irishmen to-day who can do it, and I appeal to the Deputies on that bench, and I appeal to the people <Col N="1661" /> of Ireland, to give Irishmen a chance to save our country and do the things which are necessary in our greatest hour of need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Chinn Comhairle, I listened with very considerable care to the speech made by Deputy Cosgrave in support of this motion. There was a certain phrase used in his speech which gave me the impression that at one stage Deputy Cosgrave was suffering from introspection.  Histrionics, and posing were other phrases used in Deputy Cosgrave's speech, and having listened to him at very considerable length, and having taken particular note of the vituperation and the extravagant language used, one could not help thinking but that particular phrase was perhaps more suited to the speech than in the sense in which he used it&mdash;that phrase as applied to his opponents.  It seems to me, listening to Deputy Cosgrave's speech, that he was like a person who was sent to a party to recite a piece of poetry, and when he got to the party he found, instead of there being a party, there was a wake, but still insisted on reciting his poetry, because the speech was thoroughly unreal, the language extremely extravagant, and running right through the whole speech one could discern no evidence of any statesmanship.  If any one lesson was to be drawn from the speech of Deputy Cosgrave, it was an advice to the Government to surrender, and to surrender at the earliest possible moment.  I will just quote a few phrases from the Deputy's speech.  He accused the Government, and I suppose, incidentally, the Labour Party, of having broken the word of Collins and Griffith and after Deputy Cosgrave made that speech he had Deputy MacDermot saying that the Government here was pursuing a jingoistic blustering policy&mdash;a policy of brusqueness, as the Deputy put it.  But even the Government that was guilty, according to Deputy MacDermot, of such a policy has not yet attempted, since they assumed office in February last, to break the Treaty in any one respect.  Nothing which has happened in this House, either by legislation passing through this House, or by any of the administrative or <Col N="1662" /> effective acts of the Government, has amounted, even in the smallest degree, to the slightest infraction of the Treaty.  What the Government has rightly said is that they are not always going to take the view that the British people take of the Treaty&mdash;there is an Irish view of the Treaty&mdash;and any executive act of the Government, or any administrative act of the Government, or any legislative act of this House, can in no way be constituted as an infraction of the Treaty.  But to say, as Deputy Cosgrave said, we broke the word of Collins and Griffith who he said regarded the Treaty as a stepping stone, is something I think which clearly does not fit the realities of the situation either in 1922 or in 1932. Then Deputy Cosgrave went on to say that the country should not have been plunged into an economic war.  The Deputy was quite careful not to say who plunged the country into the economic war.  Inferentially, I suppose, it was the Government he intended accusing of plunging the country into an economic war.  Then we get sagelike advice that we should not have started the war in July, we should have waited until the winter came and started it then.  As I listened for one hour to the Deputy's speech, I began to wonder, as the minutes petered out, when we are going to get any condemnation of the Party responsible for plunging the country into the economic war.  I wondered when we were going to be told why the war started in July, not in December.  Never once during his 60 minutes' speech did Deputy Cosgrave say one word in condemnation of the British Government, which while Notes were being exchanged on the best means of settling this dispute, precipitated the economic war by imposing a tariff on certain of our imports into the British market.  It was the act of Mr. Thomas, acting as the instrument of the Tory Government of Britain, that plunged this country into an economic war.  It is the very act of Mr. Thomas again, acting as an instrument of the Tory Government, that is keeping the country in a state of economic war.  And the action of the present British Government, with its dyed in the wool Toried complexion, is the action which that Government pursued in 1921, and for generations before <Col N="1663" /> in relation to this particular country.  Never once during Deputy Cosgrave's speech was there one single word of condemnation of the precipitate action of Mr. Thomas in imposing a tariff on our imports.  No.  All the vituperation, all the abuse, all the hard words, all the bitterness was kept by Deputy Cosgrave for his fellow-Irish-men. We are told that the Government here had repudiated an agreement to pay the land annuities and the other disputed payments.  We were told by Deputy Cosgrave in a speech made in Cork last Sunday and somewhat similar to the one delivered here to-day that the agreement to pay money was ratified by the Dáil.  Not one single member on the Cumann na nGaedheal benches, except by a process of guessing in the light of what was done afterwards, could possibly say, not even from the debates on the 26th July, 1922, which Deputy Cosgrave quoted, that the payment of the land annuities to Britain was in any way ratified by this House or ratified by the people of the country&mdash;if that is the debate that is relied upon for ratification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are there any Deputies on Cumann na nGaedheal Benches who still believe there was a definite ratification of the 1923 Agreement?  If there are, let us have evidence of it here to-day.  There has been no ratification by this House.  Not even the British people contend that it is obligatory upon us to pay the land annuities as a result of the alleged agreement which has not been ratified by the Parliament of the country.  Lord Hailsham, speaking yesterday in the House of Lords, as reported in the &ldquo;Manchester Guardian,&rdquo; said: &ldquo;The Government were asked to promise that before committing themselves to any proposals for the control of civil aviation they would submit full details for the approval of Parliament, that Ministers could not be bound not to enter into tentative agreements, although any agreements reached could not be binding until ratified by Parliament.&rdquo; So we have Lord Hailsham saying in the British House of Lords <Col N="1664" /> that while the Government by Ministers could enter into a tentative agreement that agreement could not be binding until it was ratified by Parliament. The very same position happened here.  Tentative agreements were entered into by Ministers representing a Cumann na nGaedheal Government, and those representing the British Government.  They were brought back here but never submitted for ratification, and no specific ratification took place from 1923 to 1932. Lord Hailsham gives us this view of the responsibility of Government in respect to the control of civil aviation. I wonder does he accept the same view of the Irish situation.  The circumstances here were precisely the same as described by him in his speech in the House of Lords.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave went on to tell us, in that blood-curdling fashion that characterises his statements, that there was a loosening of the moral fibre and that the country saw red ruin staring it in the face; that there were in existence in this country from the point of view of moral calibre people who were the worst in Europe.  Will the Deputy say where he got his authority for that statement?  Will he say, after consultation with any ecclesiastical authority in the country, that that is the position to-day?  I want to know upon what information he based that libel on the Irish people.  Has he forgotten so soon the magnificent and inspiring spectacle that took place in the Phoenix Park in June last?  Is that the kind of fervour and devotion that would characterise a nation where there was a loosening of the moral fibre and where a country was heading to spiritual degradation?  Everybody will recollect that during the progress of the Constitutional Amendment Bill through this House the same kind of thing was said&mdash;loosening of the moral fibre, spiritual degradation, Communism rampant all over the country.  One Deputy discovered 400 Communists in one parish although everyone knows that so far as the Communists, as a Party existed, they existed only in the unstable imagination of some people who wanted to talk of them.  A Communist in the last election could not muster <Col N="1665" /> more than 178 votes although he was a member of a certain union.  Then we are told that Communism is a menace to this country.  The same kind of thing was tried by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party to justify the abrogation of the constitutional guarantees of liberty that have been given to the people.  The same kind of extravagant thing was tried again by Deputy Cosgrave's Party to return them back to power at the last General Election.</P>
    <P>We are told now that the salvation of the country depends upon getting rid of the present Government.  Apparently some Deputies on the Opposition Benches are feeling the loneliness of their positon.  Presumably if we are to pass this motion we are to select some other Government than the present and, apparently, the Cumann na nGaedheal Party are active candidates for office. Before the Dáil takes action upon this motion one has to ask oneself what would be the consequence of passing this motion.  I do not give this Government the certificate that it writes for itself.  I say it could do better, in many more things than it is doing at present, and, I say, at this crisis, it should have taken bigger strides than it has taken and dealt with the situation in a bigger way. But in a choice between this Government, having regard to its social and economic policy, and the last Government and its social and economic policy, or want of such a policy, I have no hesitation in saying that the present Government is best in the interests of the plain people of this country.  For the last ten years we were told that the last Government was a wonderful Government, so wonderful that some members of that Government had begun to believe that they had the divine right to rule.  They believed that there was no possible alternative Government if they went out of office.  A change of Government did take place.  The transfer of the machinery of Government has taken place and none of the wild and desperate things prophesied at the last election followed.  The old constitutional growth has been strengthened by reason of the possible transference from one Government to another. <Col N="1666" /> None of those horrible dangers then forecasted by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party has proved to be true even in the slightest degree.  One would imagine that the Party which made such an attack upon the present Government would of itself be able to show a record such as they might well stand over.  But if we take their record under various headings and analyse it the story is a very different story to that which Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Professor O'Sullivan told us to-day.</P>
    <P>For the past ten years we had as the outstanding characteristic of the last Government their neglect of the industrial possibilities of the nation. For ten years it failed to deal with the industrial position while industry itself went to ruin and decay.  For ten years it toyed with the problem of industrial development.  During these ten years &mdash;1922-1932&mdash;more industries went out of existence in that period than during the worst days of the British Administration. Deputy McGilligan might, if he were here, furnish some enlightening information upon that point.  In the same period we know the Minister for Agriculture showed complete neglect of the agricultural possibilities of the nation.  The ex-Minister for Agriculture in the past ten years carried out a policy which he said here in the Dáil last week had no connection with wheat.  Indeed, relying upon grass, was the policy of the late Minister, and here in the House he engaged in a bout of political shadow boxing to try and show that the wheat policy of this Government is a disastrous policy.  He put up nine pins and knocked them down again. These were the tactics of Deputy Hogan in this House.  He contrasted wheat versus beet in the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Bill as if wheat versus beet was the real issue in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole policy of Deputy Hogan for the last ten years, and it was a policy to which he successfully converted his Government, <Col N="1667" /> was a policy of reliance upon grass as the chief source of livelihood for our people; to produce beef for the British market and keep on producing beef for that market, even if the circumstances are such that the bottom has fallen out of that market or that it cannot now absorb the beef which Deputy Hogan, as Minister for Agriculture, urged the country to keep on sending to that market.  In the realm of industrial development, and in the realm of agricultural development, the late Government have nothing to talk about.  They have neglected the possibilities in both these fields.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked to censure this Government so that Cumann na nGaedheal may come back to office to carry on for another ten years, perhaps in a more aggravated form, the neglect and the mismanagement which characterised their policy for the last ten years.  Deputy Cosgrave had his foot on the loud pedal of unemployment to-day. Unemployment was the keynote of the Deputy's speech.  His heart almost bled for the plight of the unemployed. I have no doubt that every other Deputy who speaks from the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches will shed the requisite amount of tears over the plight of the unemployed to-day.  When Deputy Cosgrave talked so learnedly about unemployment he might well have adverted to the census figures of 1926 so that we could have a proper picture of the unemployment problem. Everybody knows that under the census compiled by Deputy Cosgrave's Government, it was shown that there were 78,000 people registered as unemployed in 1926.  The extent of the figure was apparently so astonishing to the Cumann na nGaedheal Government of the day that it was only after considerable reluctance and considerable pressure they published the volume of statistics disclosing that extraordinary unemployment problem in 1926.  We had 78,000 unemployed people in 1926 in the heyday of the Cumann na nGaedheal alleged prosperity. Here to-day, in an economic war forced upon us by a Government which wants us to conform to its conception of what our constitutional, <Col N="1668" /> economic, and political growth must be, we have perhaps a greater unemployed problem than in 1926.  I doubt, however, that the unemployment problem to-day, if tested accurately, and if the evidence is sifted carefully, is anything worse than the unemployment problem which the last Government handed over to its successors when it went out of office in February last.</P>
    <P>We were told by Deputy Cosgrave in his speech at Cork on Sunday last that his Government was not a rich man's Government.  Deputy Cosgrave, apparently, does not like the appellation &ldquo;a rich man's Government.&rdquo;  We all know from the record of that Government during the last ten years that everything it did during its period of office indicated that it was the best exponent of the rich man's economics in this country.  We had the old age pensions reduced during its period of office and reduced at the same time as it was reducing the super-tax for the super-taxpayers and the income tax for the wealthy income taxpayers.  This is the Government we are to put back into office.  Deputy Mulcahy, during his period as Minister for Local Government, distinguished himself in that regard, and distinguished himself also by the low wage policy which was a feature of the Local Government Department under his administration.  Every possible effort that could be made was made by Deputy Mulcahy, as Minister for Local Government, to squeeze the workers down to the lowest possible level.  We saw that exemplified in the policy of his Department in enforcing low rates of wages for employees of local authorities and especially for those engaged on relief schemes.</P>
    <P>As if that Government's record in industrial development, agricultural development, unemployment, old age pensions and low wages was not enough to condemn them in the eyes of the working-class people, some members of that Government, not satisfied apparently with that humdrum list of reaction, tried to organise a private mutiny of their own in the Army.  We are told that this Government is heading for ruin and chaos.  It was not the fault of the members of the late Government that we had not <Col N="1669" /> ruin and chaos some years ago, because if the mischief-making propensities of these people could have had their full scope, the people in 1924 would have been confronted with a situation in the Army and in the country very much more serious even than the economic war in which the country is engaged to-day.</P>
    <P>In the other portion of Deputy Cosgrave's speech, the final act of solicitude for the poor was when he referred to the plight of the railways.  Deputy Cosgrave might well have consulted Deputy McGilligan before that paragraph went into the statement, because during the past ten years under the Cumann na nGaedheal administration close on 6,000 railwaymen lost their employment in the railway industry of this country, while Deputy Cosgrave's Government stood helplessly by failing to take steps to put the transport services of the country on such a basis as would provide staple employment for the railwaymen that Deputy Cosgrave is apparently concerned about to-day.  If there is that concern for the interest of the railwaymen to-day, one is entitled to ask why was there not the same concern when close on 6,000 railwaymen lost their employment during the past ten years.</P>
    <P>We are asked to pass this motion to censure the Executive Council for its continued failure satisfactorily to adjust the differences between it and the British Government, as if the responsibility for all the adjustment rested on this Government and not upon the British Government.  Lord Parmoor, who will not be accused of being a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, or of the Irish Labour Party, as he comes from very good old Conservative stock, in a letter written to the &ldquo;Manchester Guardian&rdquo; to-day, quoting Professor Keith in a previous letter to the same paper, says:</P>
    <P>Professor Keith points out that there is no binding agreement to accept a purely Imperial arbitration in the case of a dispute between any two members of the independent Commonwealth which in the aggregate constitute the British Empire.</P>
    <P>We have Lord Parmoor on the one hand, and Professor Keith, a very <Col N="1670" /> eminent constitutional authority, on the other hand, saying that there is no binding agreement to accept Imperial arbitration in the case of a dispute between two members of the Commonwealth. Yet the burden of Deputy Cosgrave's speech was &ldquo;Get your Imperial chairman as quick as you can or surrender as quick as you can.&rdquo; The rebuke from Lord Parmoor and Professor Keith to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, as exemplified by Deputy Cosgrave's statement to-day, will I hope not be lost on the Party.</P>
    <P>Lord Parmoor goes on:</P>
    <P>There is, in addition, a fundamental objection to the attitude of our Government.  When there is an arguable difference of opinion as to the obligations undertaken in a contract, it is on the parties seeking a redress to bring this difference for decision to some competent or agreed tribunal.  This principle is the more important when there is a great disparity of power, as is the case between this country and the Irish Free State.  It is certainly a curious anomaly that our Government, which is seeking to produce an international system of law and justice, as opposed to the discredited use of force, should impose crushing penalties before the rights of the two parties have been properly ascertained.</P>
    <P>We have there Lord Parmoor, a very particular friend of the present British Prime Minister, a confidant of his, an active political associate of his in recent years, saying that there is no obligation to bring this dispute to an Imperial arbitral tribunal and to accept its verdict and that it is grossly unfair and an anomaly for the British Government &ldquo;to impose crushing penalties before the rights of the two parties have been properly ascertained.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This Government, of course, can get peace to-morrow.  Every weak man can always make peace with the bully but it is on the bully's terms.  Peace can be got to-morrow if the Government is prepared to surrender.  Peace can be got if it takes Deputy Cosgrave's advice to surrender at the earliest possible moment, and, while we on these benches would welcome an <Col N="1671" /> honourable settlement and a peaceful settlement, so that the two nations so closely associated geographically and socially might be able to lead lives of concord and peace, one with the other, while we are prepared to stand for an honourable and for a peaceful settlement, and while we have done everything in our power to effect an honourable and peaceful settlement, we are not going to take Deputy Cosgrave's advice, to throw up our hands and surrender in this fight, in the discreditable defeatist spirit that Deputy Cosgrave commended to the House to-day.</P>
    <P>This motion that Deputy Cosgrave has submitted is a motion which is entirely unjustified by the circumstances surrounding this economic conflict.  It is entirely unjustified when it was the action of the British Government in imposing tariffs precipitately against our imports that was the cause of the economic war, and the extravagant statement read by the Deputy in support of the motion was completely divorced from the realities of the whole situation.  One cannot help thinking that the motion was political trimming and that the speech made in support of it was political shadow-boxing. The only purpose served by Deputy Cosgrave's speech will be to give renewed heart and renewed enthusiasm to the element within this country, and without this country, who are not standing for an honourable, peaceful settlement, but who want to beat this Government to its knees to-day just because it is an Irish Government acting in accordance with the will and authority of the people of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I always admire the glibness and eloquence with which Deputy Norton can make a speech, the appropriate adjectives he can apply to what has been said on the side with which he does not, for the moment, agree, and the way in which he can very successfully avoid any allusion to the exact and precise difficulties with which the country, including the people whom he particularly represents, are now at grips.  He tells us, for example, that the only thing contained in Deputy Cosgrave's speech <Col N="1672" /> was advice to surrender.  Let us be quite clear at the very beginning, if we can be clear at all in the cloud that the Government, and its Labour henchmen throughout the country, have created in this matter.  We have a Government in power, which is in power principally because it asked the people to give it a chance to govern, and which assured the people that, if it got that chance to govern, no evil results would take place either to our external trade or politics or to our internal order.  We all remember, and I will not inflict any pain on you, sir, by producing or quoting them, the advertisements which said that the Government had a plan and that the plan would put into work a specifically mentioned number of people.  It was, I think, as mentioned, over 80,000 people. Now, the Government is in power and has been in power for more than six months.  It has got its chance and if there is one thing clearer than another it is that it has not produced any plan, and, if Deputy Norton was in its confidence before the election or since the election, he has not vouchsafed to us on any occasion, nor has any Deputy on the Labour Benches vouchsafed to us, any indication of what that plan for solving unemployment is or of what the plan is for putting this country on a proper political basis, if there is something wrong with the political basis on which this State now rests. There was one plan, and that was to get Cumann na nGaedheal out of office. That has been extremely successful and Deputy Norton, in his speech, seems to be an echo from the past.  He finds it so difficult sitting where he sits to support another Government that, instead of telling us what is good about this Government, he tells us, and it is an old story, what was wrong with the last Government.  He does not tell us why he is supporting Fianna Fáil.  He does not tell us what Fianna Fáil is doing.  He tells us, and it must be a great consolation to the people in Kildare to know, that, in 1924, certain members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party nearly made a terrible mistake. It must be a great satisfaction to Deputy Norton's constituents in Kildare, who are getting bad prices and seeing bad prospects, to know that Deputy <Col N="1673" /> Norton, in a very melodramatic way, can tell us that chaos was nearly produced by somebody in 1924.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>And forgetting to add that with a Cumann na nGaedheal Government in office, chaos was not actually produced at all.  All that kind of thing is very far removed from reality and is very small comfort to the people facing these realities at the present moment.  We are said to be in an economic war with England and Deputy Norton asks us why we do not explain what mistakes the British Government has made.  The reason is quite clear.  There is a Government in this House responsible to this House, and it is to that Government that we must address ourselves.  We are now speaking in a fully sovereign Parliament of a fully established and properly recognised State, and we are not going to make any progress in this Parliament by abusing some Government that is not our own.  Deputy Norton, just as he is really out of date when he speaks of 1924, is also out of date when he tells us that there is a Tory Government in England.  It does not matter to us what kind of Government there is in England.  The position we are in is that we have a Government here which must deal with the British Government and the idea that our politics here should be based on any hope that a change of Government in England would be a help to us is a retrograde idea.  It is a step backwards and that kind of thing is only said by people who do not know or who pretend not to know that they are now speaking in a free Parliament.  But while we are talking about a war with England we have had statements made here about the rights of Government. They talk about their mandate, but Deputy Norton has completely omitted to state that, apart from war with England, we are also in the act of making a radical change in the whole economy of the country, and while all these things are going on a cloud is being raised all over the country to prevent the clear thinking and calm discussion of the present situation <Col N="1674" /> which are now more than ever necessary.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton, instead of telling us how this thing is going to end, has raised the usual cry that everybody who asks that it should end and that some intelligent step should be taken to end it is a friend of the British.  In other words, this allegation that everybody who gets up here is giving heart to the British&mdash;is that the phrase?&mdash; or is a friend of the British, does not recognise that the Irish people are free, and is not acting in the best interests of the people&mdash;all that kind of thing simply arises from a desire, a deliberate desire and a plan deliberately carried out, to prevent the people from getting any clear thinking or calm discussion about the muddle that has been made of their affairs by the combination of Fianna Fáil and Labour.  We were promised before the election that every kind of thing would be done for us.  There was one advertisement which said that more and more people could be employed and that there was no reason, I think it said, why it should ever stop and there was supposed to be a plan.  In fact, there was no plan.  As a matter of fact, I think Deputy Norton and Deputy Davin are now taking counsel with the President and some of his Ministers in order to formulate the plan that we were all told existed last February. The plan is only in process of being formulated now.  If I know anything about it, it consists of the very well-known, very old, sordid and futile process of dragging as many grants as possible from the Government for different constituencies, having in mind all the time the next election.  It is a very old scheme; there is nothing new in that.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Davin ought to sit tight.  I do not think he ought to interrupt.  He is the most&mdash; well, perhaps, I had better not say anything about him.  What I was about to say was that this Labour Party <Col N="1675" /> which is now spoken for by Deputy Norton is keeping in office a Government which have only one object and that is a political object.  That political object is to smash the basis upon which this State rests.  They have not an economic object and they have no economic plan.  They have no plan for doing anything but smashing the Treaty.  Deputy Norton and Deputy Davin are now engaged in trying to get some plan to enable the Government to do the things they promised to do.  That plan will consist of doling out money and in meeting the members of the Labour Party and of any other Party who may care to go into the scramble in order to get as much as possible for their various constituencies. As Deputy Cosgrave pointed out, that is no remedy.  Having no plans, they are going around the country beating the big jingo drum.  It is much easier to go down the country and say &ldquo;To hell with England&rdquo; than to sit down with British Ministers, engage with them on the level, come to a conclusion and then come home and stand over that conclusion.</P>

    <P>There is another aspect of the struggle upon which we would like to have some elucidation from the Government Benches.  I heard Senator Connolly, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, discussing this question on 4th August.  So far as I understood him, he said this quarrel with England was not unwelcome to him, he welcomed it because it gave the Fianna Fáil Party an opportunity of putting their economic policy more rapidly into execution.  If the Government welcomes this dispute with the British, how can they be expected to take any steps to end it?  Do they really want it ended at all?  If they welcome it and if they have an economic policy, then surely if it is a blessing in disguise there is no necessity for them to take any steps to end it?  It is not a blessing in disguise for the people who are suffering, and these people live not only in the country but also in the towns and more particularly in the City of Dublin.  The result of the Government's policy has been a continued increase of unemployment <Col N="1676" /> in this city, a continued increase of unemployment among people who had reasonably good jobs &mdash;fathers of families who had jobs at a family wage.  The only people put into employment, in the main, are girls at bad wages, as Deputy Norton himself told us last Wednesday evening.</P>
    <P>We are not going to get any nearer to a settlement by consistent misrepresentation of our opponents.  Deputy Norton summarised part of Deputy Cosgrave's speech by saying that Deputy Cosgrave's position was &ldquo;Get your Imperial Chairman.&rdquo;  As a matter of fact, Deputy Cosgrave and his Party have taken up the attitude that the legal aspect of this case is the aspect that is least likely to bring any fruit, any comfort or any improvement to the Irish people generally and to the farmers in particular.  The Government have a legal case and they have another case.  We would like to hear if they have abandoned the legal case and are going on the other case. To say that Deputy Cosgrave's position is that there ought to be a Tribunal with an Imperial Chairman is a gross and a wanton misrepresentation of what he did say.</P>
    <P>Let us assume we are in a war.  How is it going to end?  How does a war ever end?  We are not asking that this Government should surrender. On the contrary, we think that approached properly in this year of grace, 1932, and in this month and with all the things that have happened even since the Government took office, the Government have an excellent case to present to the British by way of negotiation.  We do not consider it politic or expedient that, with any kind of a Chairman or Tribunal, the question of whether we are going to make these payments for all time should be, so to speak, based upon the throw of the dice or subject to arbitration on legal grounds or to the decision of one man.  We think that is not a desirable or expedient course. We think, in view of all the circumstances that have appeared in the papers even within recent days and the likelihood of Great Britain escaping a great many of the payments she makes, in the light of all that is happening, <Col N="1677" /> there is a good case to be presented to the British on the basis that we are now unable to pay and that circumstances have changed for them as well as for us.  No matter how long this particular quarrel goes on, it surely must be settled in the end by conference.  What is preventing it from being settled?  What are the obstacles in the way?  In the first place, a great number of mistakes have been made already in the method of procedure.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that this Government should make clear their political position. The political position of the Labour Party has changed.  They used to be a pro-Treaty Party, but they are now supporting a Government, which, in its essence, is anti-Treaty.  If the members of this Government will take their courage in their hands and make clear their political position to the people here; if they will forget their own political past, cease to worry about their own place in history, take up an Irish attitude of negotiation and negotiate in an up-standing way with the British as Irishmen without any inferiority complex, without intruding into the negotiations all kinds of principles that have nothing to do with them, it seems to me quite possible that an agreement could be made.  What this Party does not understand, what I do not understand, is what end anybody sees to this thing.  We are told we must fight this struggle to the end.  To what end and with what loss?  Surely, if the Great War ended with a conference this particular struggle between the Irish and English Governments must and should end with a conference.</P>
    <P>If our Ministers would rid themselves of some of their own foolish political speeches, shake themselves free of some of their own political allies in this country, make clear their own political position, and go over to negotiate in a friendly way with the British they could come to a conclusion. Surely from the point of view of the Labour Party that is the way all disputes are finally concluded.  We are told that negotiations have already taken place.  But, what the President told us took place could hardly be described as negotiations.  They were rather discussions.  It was rather, on <Col N="1678" /> his own showing, as if he went to England and told the British what he wanted in great detail; and they told him they would not give it to him, and he came home.  That is not the meaning of negotiations.  Negotiations in any case mean not suffering from an inferiority complex.  They mean taking your courage in your hands.  They mean making agreements.  That involves &ldquo;give and take,&rdquo; and means standing for agreements.  For my part it seems to me, in all the circumstances, that that must be done.  If this Government is not prepared to do it, then somebody else should be allowed to try it, although the circumstances are now such that every day it gets more difficult for other people to make the agreement, which, in the end, must be made, and which we hope will be made.  The longer that agreement is delayed the worse it is for the workers, for the farmers and for the Irish people.</P>

      <P>No.  In the blood and sweat of this people who, for ten years have been sending out a yearly tribute of five and a quarter million pounds, sending out cattle, as a tribute from the young men and young women of this country to the Moloch on the other side of the water.  When we are endeavouring to end that tribute, endeavouring to keep in this country for the use of the people, the capital wealth that will enable us to build up our industries, reorganise our industries, stop the drain of emigration that has bled this nation white for the last three generations, and to enable us to provide for our young men and women who, henceforward must find their livelihood in this country, because they cannot find it anywhere else, in this solemn hour Deputy Cosgrave introduces a motion in these terms:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil censures the Executive Council for its continued failure satisfactorily to adjust the differences between it and the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great patriot once said, possibly the spirit of Chauvinism, &ldquo;My country, right or wrong&rdquo; but with Deputy Cosgrave it is the other country, right or wrong.  In this quarrel, from the very beginning, with Deputy Cosgrave and the members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, it has been &ldquo;For Great Britain, right or wrong,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Against Ireland, right or wrong.&rdquo; Are there not two parties to this quarrel; two parties to this dispute?  Were there not two parties to the recent negotiations?  Have there not been two parties to the recent interchange of letters?  If there has been failure to adjust the differences, at the very least, and doing justice to everyone&mdash; I am not, at any rate, attempting to pre-judge the case&mdash;surely in fairness to this Government, standing for its own people, Deputy Cosgrave should not have attempted to place the sole responsibility for failure upon the Irish side?  Negotiations broke down.  They broke down because of the refusal of the British Government to recognise what leading lawyers are <Col N="1680" /> already saying, that, so far as international law is concerned, and so far as municipal law of the Commonwealth is concerned in relation to the two Agreements of 1923 and 1926, we have a good case to argue.  But there is no censure in this motion and no word of reproof for the Government that refused even to consider whether we had a case on these grounds to argue or not.  It all comes back to this, that we alone are to be censured because we have failed &ldquo;satisfactorily to adjust the differences&rdquo; between the two Governments.</P>
    <P>What does it all mean?  Surely in a motion of this sort, one so long pondered over, so well considered, so carefully drafted as to be all embracing in the grounds which it gives for condemning the present Government we ought to know what the Opposition mean by the word &ldquo;satisfactorily.&rdquo;&ldquo;Satisfactorily&rdquo; to whom?  If there had been an adjustment of our differences who were to be satisfied?  The Irish people or the British people?  The Irish Government or the British Government?  Or is it, not that we have failed to secure a result, but that we have been remiss in the manner in which we attempted to secure it?  Possibly that may have been what Deputy Cosgrave had in mind&mdash;not that we have not secured a satisfactory settlement, that is a settlement which would be satisfactory to us, but that the manner in which we have sought that settlement has not been satisfactory to Deputy Cosgrave and to the members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  Is that the ground upon which we are to be censured?  Deputy Cosgrave did not specifically say that, but there were one or two significant remarks in his address which had that trend, in an address which, after he had read it, I felt like getting up and moving it should be printed and circulated at the expense of the society.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave did imply, in his address, that it was probably the manner in which we had gone about these negotiations that displeased him.  Of course, Deputy Cosgrave is a master of negotiation. The Deputy has his own peculiar methods of negotiation.  We remember <Col N="1681" /> how, in 1925, when a vital issue was being discussed between the then Government of the Free State&mdash;Deputy Cosgrave's administration&mdash;and the British Government, Deputy Cosgrave went over to London, just as President de Valera went over to London in October last.  Deputy Cosgrave afterwards came back from those negotiations and he told us of the magnificent settlement he had made.  He referred to it, I think, as a damn good bargain and said that all our liabilities had been wiped out by a great big nought.  Is the fault which Cumann na nGaedheal now find with President de Valera and his administration that when we went over to London last month we did not do as Deputy Cosgrave had done seven years previously and that President de Valera did not come back and tell the Irish people that he had made a damn good bargain, that all our liabilities under the 1923 and 1926 agreements had been wiped out and that instead of paying henceforward five and a quarter million pounds to the British, our payment would be represented by a great big nought?  Is it Deputy Cosgrave's charge also that President de Valera, not having followed the example of President Cosgrave, as he then was, and not having come back and made a statement in these terms to the Irish people, had not left some other of his Ministers behind him to make secretly, without the knowledge of the Irish people and in defiance of a considered Resolution adopted by this Dáil, another agreement which completely belied Deputy Cosgrave's previous declaration?  Is it because we have not done that that we have failed to satisfy Cumann na nGaedheal?</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave said that the ordinary thing to do was to endeavour, &ldquo;by private correspondence to adjust the differences.&rdquo;  That is a significant remark, because I can imagine Deputy Cosgrave sitting as President on these benches when an issue such as is at present under consideration arose and doing as he did in 1925 on the Boundary Agreement&mdash;telling the people, as he told them now, that he made a damn good bargain and leaving, say, Deputy Blythe as his Minister for Finance in London to wind up the minor details.  Then a little private <Col N="1682" /> correspondence might enter into the matter.  And I can imagine an English statesman writing to President Cosgrave complaining that his subordinates&mdash;his Ministers&mdash;whom he had left in Great Britain were not quite so easy to deal with as Deputy Cosgrave himself had been.  I could imagine him complaining more or less in these terms&mdash;that the British Ministers had found themselves unable to make any progress towards a final settlement with, say, Deputy Blythe, and that from what this particular member of the British Cabinet could gather it was because Deputy Blythe did not show the accommodating spirit&mdash;I am choosing my words very carefully and I am sure they are familiar to some Deputies on the opposite side&mdash;which was so happy a feature of the previous negotiations.</P>
    <P>That of course is what Deputy Cosgrave would mean by endeavouring by private correspondence to adjust their differences.  If he were sitting here I am quite certain that Deputy Cosgrave would immediately proceed to write a letter promising that Deputy Blythe would be more accommodating when he returned to London within a fortnight and signed a secret agreement like that of 1926.  Oh, yes, that is a satisfactory method.  That is the satisfactory way in which Cumann na nGaedheal demonstrates that if he were sitting on these benches, Deputy Cosgrave would settle this quarrel, &ldquo;by private correspon dence.&rdquo;  He would betray, in regard to the Irish land annuities, exactly the same accommodating spirit as he showed in 1925 when he was concluding not the Boundary Agreement but the Boundary betrayal.</P>
    <P>I said that Deputy Cosgrave was kind to his public.  I must say this for him that his public in his hour of difficulty are kind to Deputy Cosgrave also.  If Deputy Cosgrave let the Irish people down, there are certain organs of public opinion on the other side that will see that neither the British Government nor the British people will let Deputy Cosgrave down. He told us that scarcely had we gone over to London than the reason for the failure of the negotiations speedily became apparent.  Of course they did. <Col N="1683" /> The members who were there on the delegation had no doubts in their own minds as to what was going to happen on the morning of the 12th October when they read in certain influential journals statements in these terms:</P>
    <P>Conservatives are united in their demand that Mr. de Valera should be made pay in full.  It is pointed out that any compromise by the British Government will place Mr. Cosgrave, the former President of the Irish Free State Executive Council, in an impossible position, and also give Mr. de Valera electoral advantages in the Irish Free State enabling him to carry through his schemes.</P>
    <P>The date is the 12th October, 1932. Again on the 14th October, 1932, the <i>Daily Mail</i> came out with an editorial in which it said:</P>
    <P>To-day the negotiations are to begin in London between the British and the Free State Ministers on the subject of the Irish land annuities, the payment of which Mr. de Valera has suspended.  In this matter there is no question, and there can be no question, of the British Cabinet giving way.  Were such a mistake to be made an irretrievable blow would be dealt to the prestige of the National Government.  Any surrender would be used by Mr. de Valera, (according to those in the closest touch with him) to precipitate the secession of the Free State from the British Empire.</P>
    <P>I said it speedily became apparent why the negotiations failed.  The statement sent from Dublin by the political correspondent of the <i>Daily Mail</i> on the 12th October made it quite clear that &ldquo;any compromise by the British Government will place Mr. Cosgrave, the former President of the Irish Free State Executive Council, in an impossible position.&rdquo;  I said that Deputy Cosgrave was kind to his public and his public in Great Britain are going to be kind to Mr. Cosgrave so long as any hope lingers in the minds of the British public or in the hearts of the British statesmen, that an alternative Government is to be found on the present <Col N="1684" /> Opposition benches.  So long as they have any hope that Deputy Cosgrave or his colleagues will come back in power in this country, there is going to be no hope in, and no fruitful and successful negotiations with, British Ministers.</P>
    <P>There are the barriers to peace and there are the men and the Party who are continuing to prolong the economic war.  Every man who enlists his voice in support of the policy that they have adumbrated in this House is helping to prolong that war.  If there is any doubt of that one has only to read the comments which appeared in the <i>United Irishman</i> of the 29th October, 1932.  It is true that there are some responsible people in Britain who are able to weigh up the consequences of this dispute, not as it affects the Irish people, but as it affects the people of Great Britain. Men who realise that it would be a good thing not merely for themselves generally, not merely for this country, but from their point of view, speaking as Englishmen primarily, for Great Britain that this economic dispute should end, and that there should resume the free flow of trade and intercourse between us and the sister isle&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and when responsible Englishmen, looking at this quarrel and appreciating how deeply it <Col N="1685" /> affects the material interests and welfare of their own people, throw out a suggestion that it would be wise for Great Britain to &ldquo;withdraw her tariffs and leave Mr. de Valera the annuities,&rdquo; and go on to add that if this were done there seems to be no reason why economic peace should not now be reached without prejudice to the members of the other side, and continue: &ldquo;If Mr. Cosgrave should ever return to power the land annuities question could then be discussed as it cannot now, purely on the grounds of Ireland's inability to pay,&rdquo; we should welcome a solution on those lines.  But the <i>United Irishman</i> comes along and, to show clearly how it stands in relation to the suggestion that the tariffs should now be withdrawn, and that we should be allowed to retain the annuities, letting whoever likes when they succeed us reopen that question, says:</P>
      <P>If any British politician imagines that it is a feasible policy to let Mr. de Valera have the annuities, and then when Mr. de Valera has been relegated to the wilderness by the Irish people on other grounds later on to reopen the whole subject with any possible successor of Mr. de Valera's, then that British politician is making as big a mistake as he ever made in his life.  In this matter it is not open to England any more than to Ireland to have her cake and eat it at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not open to England to have her cake and to eat it too!  What did the exponent of the inner mind of Cumann na nGaedheal mean when he wrote that?  In this matter of the land annuities it is not open to England to eat her cake and have it too.  They say let President de Valera have the land annuities and&mdash;they then say&mdash; you cannot hope to have Deputy Cosgrave back.  Paraphrasing that it means that in order to have Deputy Cosgrave back you must insist on paying the land annuities now and you must continue the present economic dispute.  Then in order that the morale of the Irish people may be weakened and that we may help you to victory, we will come in and put down a resolution of censure as follows: &ldquo;That <Col N="1686" /> the Dáil censures the Executive Council for its continued failure satisfactorily to adjust the differences between it and the British Government.&rdquo; Every possible suggestion for procuring a settlement of these differences which would be acceptable to the Irish people will be met by the statement that &ldquo;the British Government cannot eat its cake and have it too.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What purpose did the Opposition hope to achieve when they put down that Resolution?  Was it with the idea of bringing peace any nearer?  And if so, what sort of peace was it they had in mind?  I listened to Deputy MacEoin speaking&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is what Deputy Cosgrave, the then President, said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law provides that these annuities are to be collected hence-forth <Col N="1689" /> by the Government of Saorstát Eireann&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is of the Dáil</P>
    <P>&mdash;and that the proper amounts should in due course be paid into either of the funds out of which dividends and sinking fund payments in connection with the various land stocks are paid.  These stocks will continue to be managed by the British Government, but it is part of the present arrangement for the adjustment of past land purchase transactions that we should pay over the annuities and leave it to the British Government to pay the interest to the stock-holders.</P>
    <P>Is that correct?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am accepting the Deputy's word for it that it is correct. But mark the statement: &ldquo;The law provides that these annuities were to be paid over.&rdquo;  What law?  What law provided that these annuities were to be paid over?  It certainly was not the Government of Ireland Act of 1920. And it certainly was not the Treaty that provided that these annuities should be paid over.  In fact, that statement was as false and as misleading as the statement which Deputy Cosgrave made when he returned from London in 1925 and said that he had settled all our financial obligations with Great Britain for a great big nought.  It was just as false and misleading, because the law provided not that they should be paid over, but that they should be retained here for the use and benefit of the Irish people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The President, in order to make it perfectly clear that not only were these moneys paid in accordance with the law but also in accordance with the agreement with the British, also made this statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The actual sum due to pay the annuities is much greater than the sum which comes in.  At the recent negotiations which took place in <Col N="1690" /> England we came to a provisional arrangement which binds us, or in which we accepted liability for the payment of a certain sum pending a settlement regarding the major question. That sum in all amounts to about £160,000 over and above the amount we will get in annuities.</P>
    <P>That statement was made to the Dáil in 1923.  The Dáil was told, therefore, that the annuities were to be paid over to the British for the stock-holders, and that that was the result of an agreement made with the British recently.</P>

Who, outside the eight members of the Executive Council on this side and the members of the British Cabinet on the other side, ever saw the agreement until the text of it was published this year, if it were not secret?  If it were not secret why did Deputy Blythe, when he was Minister for Finance, permit a letter to be written to the British Treasury stating that it would be &ldquo;politically inadvisable&rdquo; to publish this agreement?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand Deputy Dillon's attitude in the matter. He has a name that is honoured in Irish history.  I believe he is a good Nationalist, but is not one of the matters, which are vital to this quarrel, the question whether the Irish people and the Irish Legislature ever had the opportunity to ratify this agreement or not?  Would not our case be so much weaker if this agreement were in fact a published agreement and if the text of it were known to every man and woman in the country?  Have not the members of the Opposition who were responsible for that agreement and, again I say, are responsible for the present economic dispute because of that agreement, endeavoured to weaken the morale of our people and to sap their courage by saying it was not secret, that it was known to them, and that we are bound in honour, in justice and in equity by that agreement?  Is that not the whole point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am endeavouring to show that, as far as we were concerned, and as far as the Irish people, were concerned, the agreement was withheld from <Col N="1693" /> them.  They were denied all knowledge of it.  They were denied it not merely by the action of our own Executive Council, but with the acquiescence and consent of the British Government, who were the other parties to it. That is why I have endeavoured to show that the agreement was deliberately kept secret, and it was kept secret because in the words of the then Minister for Finance it was politically inadvisable to publish it.  Why was it politically inadvisable to publish it? Because if it had been published the Government that had entered into it would not have held their place for one six months.  The moment that the implications of the agreement became clear to the Irish people, the moment they realised that it was imposing on them a burden that would cripple this country economically for generations, they would have turned and would have rended those who were responsible for it.  Whatever else may arise out of this quarrel, whatever may be the issue of the dispute, there is one thing the people on the other side of the water may make up their minds about.  That is, that the intelligence and the commonsense of the Irish people will never allow them again to trust their destinies to a group of politicians who could defraud them as they did defraud them who signed that 1923 Agreement.</P>
    <P>It is not merely we who are complaining of the secrecy of it.  I would remind the House that members of the British Parliament complained of the secrecy also, that Lord Danesfort in 1926 referred to these agreements, and that he was denied all knowledge of the 1923 Agreement because the Executive Council of the Irish Free State would not permit the 1923 Agreement to be published.  If it was not secret, and if the last Government communicated it to this Dáil, why did they not permit its publication in 1926? Why, when Deputy Hogan as Minister for Agriculture wanted that agreement published&mdash;I will give the date, on the 6th January, 1925&mdash;when he asked the Minister for Finance to secure the consent of the British Government to the publication of that agreement, why did Deputy Blythe on 7th February, <Col N="1694" /> 1925, reply to Deputy Hogan, then Minister for Agriculture, and say that he considered it undesirable to publish the agreement, if this agreement were not a secret one?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Were there not other things in it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If this agreement were not secret, why was it considered undesirable to publish it?  Why did Deputy Hogan suggest that the consent of the British to its publication should be secured at all, if the Dáil had full knowledge of it?  That is the dilemma that Deputy Hogan is in.</P>
      <P>Why was this motion brought forward at all?  I gathered from Deputy MacEoin that it was because the Opposition are anxious to get peace.  He spoke in military parables to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and he asked us did we take the usual military precautions. Just examine this matter again in military terms.  Suppose this were not an economic war, but that we were engaged in physical warfare, with all the accoutrements of war, and there were two armies facing each other, and one company or two companies or one battalion or one regiment of one of the armies began to shout out, &ldquo;Oh, the commander is not taking steps to satisfactorily adjust our differences with the enemy.  We censure him because he has failed to satisfactorily adjust our differences with the enemy, and we must have peace.  We must have peace.&rdquo;  What sort of overtures do you think the enemy would make, and what frame of mind would he be in for receiving overtures from a commander who had such a disloyal and a mutinous section of the army behind him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the purpose of this Resolution? To make peace according to Deputy MacEoin&mdash;to make peace impossible, on the plain interpretation of it, and to encourage Britain to stand out in the hope that their allies in this country will unseat the present Government.  What sort of peace are the Opposition looking for?  You have not stated that.  Deputy Hayes, in a very astute speech, said that if we &ldquo;made clear a political position...&rdquo; What is the implication in that?  How much <Col N="1695" /> further does Deputy Hayes want the Government to go in clarifying its political position?  There is a strange unity of expression between Deputy Hayes and members of the British Cabinet.  They are all telling us that if we will loyally accept the British Commonwealth then money is no object.</P>
    <P>We can forsake the age-long aspirations of the people, we can break the pledges which were given to the electors, we can betray the dead, we can turn our backs on the whole course of Irish history, we can forsake the goal towards which the Irish people have been marching, and when we do that, money is no object.  We can get the same price for betraying the aspirations of the Irish people in 1932 as members of the Irish Parliament got for carrying the Union in 1800.  Of course money is no object when British politicians want to achieve their end.  I am not blaming the English politicians because they offer the bribe, but I am blaming Irishmen, who claim to represent Irish constituencies and to speak for the Irish people, for trying to coerce or to coax or cajole the Irish people into accepting that bribe.  &ldquo;What does it profit a man if he gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his own soul,&rdquo; and what would it profit the Irish people or the Irish nation if they were to accept Deputy Hayes' advice, if they were to accept a shameful peace, a shameful but only temporary peace, that would bring to us neither prosperity nor happiness, and would send this generation in shame down the paths of the ages as a generation which betrayed, when it might have realised, Irish aspirations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, I have listened with close attention to the Minister for Finance, a responsible Minister of this Government, and he ended his peroration by suggesting that a compromise in the economic dispute between this country and Great Britain is to be likened to the sale of this country by the corrupt members of a group in the Irish House of Commons at the beginning of the 19th century. That is an aspect of the present situation which is new to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1696" /> Now, sir, when this country and Great Britain first became involved in a difference as to the liability of this country for the land annuities, President de Valera made a very special appeal that, in so far as possible, those who could not see eye to eye with him should refrain from putting forward in public a view calculated to weaken his position.  I am aware that certain honourable public men felt that to accede to that request was not consistent with their duty.  I had a different view.  I felt that as Fianna Fáil was in office it was entitled to have its chance.  I felt that in offering to submit its case to arbitration the Fianna Fáil Government had adopted a course which was strictly in accordance with honour and prudence, and I felt that while that offer was made I should say nothing in public, even though I differ from President de Valera, calculated to make his position more difficult, or to make the possibility of friendly settlement more remote.</P>
    <P>I do not disguise the fact&mdash;and I wish the President were here that I might say it in his presence&mdash;that I went to him on more than one occasion, and spoke to him in private of the developments that I thought were taking place in the country, and of the course that events were taking, as far as I could see.  I do feel that the President's request was entitled to respect up to a point, but I think there comes a time when it is the duty of anybody who professes to represent a constituency or a section of the Irish people, to say frankly in public what he believes, if he believes that there is great danger ahead.  Now, I have listened to members of the Fianna Fáil Party speaking of the prospects, throughout this trouble.  I remember hearing the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance pour scorn on anybody who suggested that these problems were grave.  I remember the Minister for Defence solemnly getting up and saying that, using his best judgment, the only result he foresaw from this economic struggle was that the Irish people would grow so fat that we would have to put new doors in Irish houses in order to let them pass in and out. I must say I felt that that did not represent the true sense of responsibility <Col N="1697" /> of other members of the Cabinet.  I want to say now that we have reached a stage in this economic struggle when thought on the lines of Deputy Hayes' speech is better and more profitable than thought on the lines of the speech of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance could not understand my point of view when I reminded him that President de Valera had publicly decried the reading of confidential files.  My point of view on it is this, that, if the Minister for Finance thinks the Irish people should be placed in possession of information which is contained in Government files, he should go to the Executive Council and ask the Executive Council to recommend to this Dáil that those papers should be published in toto, because the quotation of short paragraphs from long documents inevitably results in a certain measure of misrepresentation, and at least it leaves the feeling behind it that only part of the truth has been told.  If any reference has to be made to a document of that character, and the truth has to be laid before the people&mdash;and that should be done if the Executive Council thinks it is necessary for the true presentation of the Irish case&mdash;the document should be published in full.  Unless they think that necessary, I suggest that the Minister for Finance would be better advised to fall in with the President's view, and eschew absolutely the practice of quoting from any document which the Executive Council is not prepared to publish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I just point out to Deputy Dillon that a large number of those documents will be available to the Dáil if the Opposition asks for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to pursue that matter further.  If it be deemed prudent that these papers should be published the responsibility is with the President of the Executive to lay them before the Irish people. If he believes it is not in the public interest or that these documents contain certain confidential things, which no responsible Government should publish, be they Fianna Fáil or Cumann na nGaedheal, it would be <Col N="1698" /> much better if the President's advice on this matter were followed.  However, that is a minor matter.  As I said the lines upon which we were going seems to be unprofitable, because as I said at a very much earlier stage, last June, it appears clear to every reasonably minded man that there is no real victory in any fight that is fought to a finish.  It does not in the least matter now which side wins this fight.  If it is a question of winning or losing and if England smashes President de Valera, then England and Ireland have lost this fight just as much as if President de Valera smashes England.  If England smashes President de Valera and wipes out his policy by economic pressure and bringing hardship to bear on the Irish people, no matter whether the people of this country thinks President de Valera was well advised or not, the people of this country will resent the fact that the British Government, by economic pressure, has smashed a man who is in the position of Irish leader. There is no use turning away from these facts.  This is a deep rooted instinct in the Irish people.  On the other hand, if President de Valera presses this thing through, and successfully gains his point by refusing to yield an inch and by being absolutely implacable and uncompromising, the net result of it will be that he will create in England and amongst the people of the country whom the Minister for Finance described as the &ldquo;sister island&rdquo; a bitterness and resentment and general feeling of dissatisfaction, which will injure us far more in the long run than the annuities could ever compensate us for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ask the House to throw their minds back to 1917, right in the middle of the Great War when things were desperately bitter, and feeling in England was at boiling point and the great thing was to capture Berlin and hang the Kaiser.  The Marquis of Lansdowne rose at that juncture and said: &ldquo;Look here, I believe this fight has assumed such proportions that if you capture Berlin, Vienna, Sofia and Constantinople, the price you will have paid for that capture will unfortunately be more than all that <Col N="1699" /> victory would be worth.  You may win the war but so surely as you win it you lose the peace.&rdquo;  The Marquis of Lansdowne was spat upon.  A word that is all too familiar in this House was hurled at him.  He was described as a traitor, a man who was letting down the boys in the trenches, a man who had not the spirit of the bulldog breed.  How many men and women in England to-day regret not having taken the advice of the Marquis of Lansdowne in 1917 instead of beating Germany and Austria down into the dirt, and beating them down with the self same language as is being used here now. I can well remember how we were told that they were swaggering bullies and that the instinct of the German people was not to yield an inch.  Now, I submit, the very self same thing is being done here.  We are told that we are face to face with swaggering bullies who want to trample us down and we have either to face them now or else lie down before them.  Surely that kind of thing is calculated to do nothing but harm to them and to us.  I am not concerned with what happened in the past, and what on earth does it matter.  What is the use of going into whether this was a secret agreement with England or not?  The Minister for Finance knows, and there is not a single man sitting on those benches who does not know, that the Cumann na nGaedheal Government never treacherously sold this country.</P>
    <P>I have been opposed to them all my life, and I have been opposed to the President and his Party when they were joined in Sinn Fein, but I know just as well as that Party knows that a leader on either side was never intentionally a traitor to his own country. You may take the view that these agreements were imprudent agreements and instead of being damn good bargains, they were damn bad bargains.  That is a matter of opinion. It is a perfectly legitimate view to take, and we will never quarrel violently about that.  But take the allegations and the suggestions that they were corrupt and fraudulent, and that there was a conspiracy with the <Col N="1700" /> British Government to defraud the Irish people; now the men who made those statements know quite well they are untrue, and I submit that the President of the Executive Council knows they are not true.  He may take the view, as I say, that they were bad or imprudent, but he knows that there was no fraud and no treachery whatever.  We have the Irish Government and the British Government face to face.  Both sides are adamant on the question of the constitution of the tribunal.  The Irish Government say they will not accept the principle that there must be an Imperial Court.  I want to remind this House that it is not the Fianna Fáil Party that advanced that theory.  That theory has been advanced and endorsed by the entire Oireachtas of this State when it was brought before it by Deputy McGilligan when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs, and he most expressly said that &ldquo;in many disputes I would welcome a Commonwealth tribunal, but we will never accept the principle that it is the right of any other member of the Commonwealth of Nations to insist on submitting every dispute to which we are a party to a Commonwealth court. On the contrary, we reserve the right to refer any dispute in which we are involved to an international court, if and when, we deem it desirable.&rdquo; That principle was endorsed by the whole Oireachtas, so that there is no question of this being some skeleton which the Fianna Fáil Party dug up. It is the avowed policy of the State. Now, we are face to face with that very thing.  We have one principle and Great Britain has another in respect to that matter.  The Fianna Fáil Government maintains that these agreements are technically invalid in the legal sense, quite apart from their equity altogether, and Great Britain maintains they are valid.</P>
    <P>Are we going to sit opposite one another for ever, with this blank assertion or can we see no hope of our respective positions being reconciled?  I see none.  But I see a way out.  If you cannot reconcile the preliminaries it is a very good thing, sometimes, to put the cart before the horse.  If you <Col N="1701" /> cannot settle the preliminary points, why not get down to the real and concrete issue, and that is as to the moneys that Britain alleges are due to her from this country?  Let us shelve the question of principle.  Let us not ask England to waive her principle nor we to waive ours, but let us ask ourselves this question: There are the land annuities and other sums&mdash;payments amounting to something like £5,000,000&mdash;cannot the question be approached in this way?  Let us forget for the moment the particular designations of this sum, and, let us say, there is a financial amount of about £5,000,000 that England thinks is due to her from the Free State.  Without going into the nature of these sums, may we not look at them after all as a money price, or part of a money price that was paid for the rectification of past injustice and something to smooth over the difficulties that lay in the way in 1921?  There are pensions and annuities which flow from a long system of injustice in the past.  There we have £5,000,000.  I ask the President of the Executive Council now, and by his answer I will be deeply and profoundly affected: &ldquo;Is the path open to settlement along the lines of saying that this money is due from one country to another; that it is money claimed by one country from another, that it is part of a general equitable settlement?  If an equitable proposal is made whereby we both undertake to assume a share of the burden which formed part of the settlement of seven centuries of strife, then probably we will listen with the intention of considering that proposal in an equitable and generous spirit.&rdquo;  If England says she will bear one proportion if we bear the other; if she says &ldquo;we will bear three-fifths if you will bear two-fifths&rdquo; or some proposal of that kind, I think the President ought to be in a position to say that we are prepared to leave the abstract question of principle aside, and rather than perpetuate an acrimonious war, we would be glad to leave aside this academic question of either an international or a national court.  By leaving these things on one side, to mellow for a little time, in due course <Col N="1702" /> it might be not impossible to discover that the principle we are contending for, and which Deputy McGilligan advocated at the Imperial Conference, and afterwards at Geneva, might be accepted by the entire Commonwealth. There is one way it never will be accepted, and that is if there is an attempt made by any one member of the Commonwealth to ram it down the throat of the other members of the Commonwealth.  If President de Valera thinks he can compel England to admit something by forcing it down her throat and down the throats of other members of the Commonwealth, then he is a much more foolish man than I took him to be.</P>
    <P>I think we have reached the stage at which we can ask the President another question.  I have always taken the view that Fianna Fáil was entitled to have its chance.  I am glad it has had its chance, and I think it is to the good of the country that it has had its chance.  I ask the President, now, if the time is not ripe to inform this country whether there is any prospect of a conclusive and final settlement of the relations between Great Britain and Ireland within the Commonwealth of Nations as we know it.  I think that until we know that fact there can be no real progress in this country. While I am quite clear that it is a good thing to give Fianna Fáil a chance to prove its policy before the country, I am not prepared to support the continuance of a policy which has, as its final aim, the removal of this country from the Commonwealth of Nations, whereof at present we are a free and independent member.  I do not think it is fair, or just, to the people in the name of prosecuting an economic war to defend a particular principle, deliberately to create a situation which, if continued, would make membership of the Commonwealth of Nations impossible.  I aim at political freedom.  I think every man and woman in this House wants political freedom and would not be content without political freedom.  There are some of us who believe that the securest political freedom this country can have, and the securest economic freedom are to be found within the Commonwealth of Nations, co-equal members <Col N="1703" /> with every other nation in the Commonwealth as independent and sovereign States.</P>
    <P>If I were to believe that the policy which President de Valera is prosecuting at the present moment is one with a deliberate intention of leading our people into a position where they would be forced to repudiate membership of the Commonwealth, then I would no longer be able to support President de Valera's policy or to suggest to the people that they should support it.  I am led to make that statement, because when a Minister of the Executive Council speaks in a debate of this character I am bound to assume he weighs his words, and that what he states he states with the most deliberate intention.  The Minister for Finance said here to-day&mdash; he was referring to Deputy Hayes's speech&mdash;when the suggestion was made that this should be settled by compromise&mdash;I do not profess to quote his exact words, but he said: &ldquo;We could get the price they got.  We could get the price that the corrupt members of the Union Parliament of 1800 got when they sold their country, by turning our backs upon the dead.&rdquo; Am I to understand from that that the policy of Fianna Fáil is that there should be no accommodation with the Commonwealth of Nations except on a basis of separation?  Am I to understand from that that there can be no compromise, no settlement by amicable agreement of this economic dispute, unless there be political considerations of status involved in this agreement? Am I to understand that, contrary to what President de Valera said, this dispute has ceased to be an economic dispute and that other considerations have arisen, or am I to understand that President de Valera is prepared to-morrow, if an equitable proposal that would make for the settlement of this economic difference is put up, to accept this proposal, to end this economic war, and to turn his face to the future for this country as a sovereign and independent State in the Commonwealth of Nations?</P>

      <P>Nobody asks, and nobody could ask, the President to set a limit to the march of this nation. Nobody could ask the President to pledge the action of the Irish people. It is neither in his power nor in the power of any other man to do that. What I am entitled to ask is, whither is he leading the Irish people?  Until he is in a position to state whither he is leading them, how can any man tell the people whether they are wise to follow or not?  How can any people know whether to follow or not if they do not know where they are being led? What I am asking the President is: Is a settlement of this difference possible on a purely financial and fiduciary basis; or is it true that this difference is being made the excuse for leading the Irish people whither they never authorised him to lead them?  If that be true, then I think the terms of this motion are justified. But if it be true that the President is prepared to make a just and equitable settlement of this difference that exists with England on the lines I suggested to him, or any other lines that will commend themselves to this House, then I think he is entitled to his chance to make that settlement. I think that anything we can do to help him to make that settlement should be done.  It is for him to answer, it is for him to make it clear. But I think the time has come now when the obligation rests upon the President to make it clear, and clear in an unequivocal way.  I want to know, and there are thousands of people who voted for Fianna Fáil who want to know, whither the President is leading them.  When he answers that question, then we will know whether to advise the people to follow, or whether to advise the people to call him to account and to pass a new judgement on what is a new policy, and a policy that he never put to the people before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance in the course of his speech and in his peroration would lead one to believe that this struggle with the British is one for the vindication of some treasured idea, or one for the pursuit of some old vendetta.  I understood <Col N="1705" /> that it was really a difference about money; that it was really a demand to end certain payments that have heretofore been made to the British; and to end these payments, not for the mere sake of grabbing the money, but for the sake of improving the economic state of the country.  If it is a business dispute, then I hold it ought to be looked upon in that way; that we ought not to have these attempts that are being made to stir up public anger and enthusiasm; that we need not have all these accusations of treachery thrown at everybody who criticises or opposes the Government; that, in fact, we need not have got to this particular pass.</P>
      <P>Now that the thing is on, I think there is nothing to be gained by any misrepresentation or by trying to raise the temperature of public opinion. There is no use in pretending that we are standing out against some sort of British aggression.  There is no use in the President doing what he did the other day at the Ard-Fheis, pretending that the British have seized upon an opportunity to fasten a quarrel upon us, or suggesting that possibly that is what happened, and that if we do not resist to the bitter end now we will be subjected to all sorts of unjustified demands to which we should have to yield.  It would be better to have it admitted that there has been no British aggression in this matter; that, whether we were right or wrong, the aggression came from our side; that we were the attackers in the matter; that we were the people who opened the quarrel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were agreements made in regard to these particular payments.  I will not follow the Minister for Finance into his discussion on what is in the Departmental files.  He has all the Departmental files and can make any use he thinks wise to make of them.  He can keep them secret, or he can publish them, or he can publish selections.  He has only just to consider, and I hope he is doing it, what is the best for the country.  The agreement about the land annuities was made and the substance of the agreement was disclosed very early after it was made.  The fact that it <Col N="1706" /> had been agreed that we should pay the land annuities was made known to the Dáil, and was known to the people; and the only reason there was not a great deal of discussion about it at the time was that everybody took it as a matter of course.  At that time the propaganda which we have experienced lately had not begun and the newspapers did not regard it as anything very new or sensational that an agreement had been made that the land annuities would be paid over to the appropriate fund.  These agreements were made and they were acted upon.  For instance, the money for the R.I.C. pensions was voted year after year in the Dáil and continued to be voted after the propaganda had started.  Not only were the agreements made known to the Dáil and acted upon, but other agreements were based on these.  The agreement of December, 1925, whereby our liability for portion of the British national debt was wiped out, as was stated by Deputy Cosgrave in the Dáil, was based on the previous agreements that the land annuities should be paid over and that the R.I.C. pensions should be paid.  He pointed out in his speech, I think on the Second Reading of the Bill confirming that agreement, that the plea he made to the British for the cancellation of their claim for National Debt was that we were already paying in land annuities, R.I.C. pensions, and other payments as much as we could afford, and the agreement amending the Treaty was based on the fact that these agreements were in existence and were being acted upon.</P>
    <P>It would have been quite legitimate for this country to ask for a review of these agreements or any of them. It would have been quite legitimate for the present or any Government to say that, in the circumstances that have now arisen, these agreements are too onerous; that the burdens they impose are greater than we can afford; and to ask that the whole matter be reopened.  The Government, however, did not do that.  They did what was equivalent to repudiating the agreements.  I think that, in the circumstances, it would not have been <Col N="1707" /> unreasonable for the British Government to have said: &ldquo;If you are going to repudiate the agreements already entered into and acted upon, then we are going to have no discussion; we will take our own measures.&rdquo;  If the British took up that attitude I think it would not have been stringent or drastic or unreasonable, but instead of doing so they said: &ldquo;We will arbitrate.&rdquo; That is a proof that there has been no British aggression at any stage in this matter.  It is a proof, if proof were needed, that there is a spirit of accommodation on the other side, and that if there were any serious attempt to reach an agreement, an agreement could be reached.</P>
    <P>We, on this side of the House, have always stood for having an international tribunal, but I would not ask for an international tribunal in this matter, because I believe that whatever legal case there is, and I think it is slender, we would be more likely to succeed in it before a Commonwealth tribunal than before an international court.  I am unable to understand, if the President wants any settlement, why he did not make an attempt to reach an agreement on the personnel of the court.  There is surely no national principle that precludes us from having the matter arbitrated by a Commonwealth tribunal, even although we are not prepared to agree that all disputes must be settled by a Commonwealth tribunal.  There is no reason why, in a particular instance, or in particular instances, if it suits us, or if it is the only way out, we should not try to have a Commonwealth tribunal.  There is no reason at all why the President should not have, on the offer that was made by Mr. Thomas, proposed that he should nominate his own representatives and that they and the British representatives should meet and make an attempt to get a chairman who would be agreeable to both.  That could have been done, because the British expressly announced that they were not standing on the Imperial Conference proposal.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance did not take those steps because, as I believe, he did not want arbitration, and I think <Col N="1708" /> there were good reasons for not wanting arbitration, because, even with the most favourable tribunal, it could only, I think, have ended in the one way. He could not expect, in all the circumstances of the origin of this dispute, that the British would take his point of view that, because there was not formal Parliamentary ratification of these agreements, they should be treated as mere scraps of paper.  There was a very obvious reason why they could not take his point of view because, if one Government can repudiate the agreements of its predecessor, there is no reason why the Government that might succeed it, could not repudiate its agreements.  There is no greater sanctity attaching to an agreement because it has formal Parliamentary ratification than because it has the signature of a Minister who has the confidence of the House and continues to retain the confidence of the House for years after the agreement is entered into.</P>
    <P>The British could see perfectly well that if they consented to the complete repudiation of this agreement which had been entered into by the then Government, and if a new agreement was made and ratified by the unanimous vote of this House, it would be quite possible for a party to arise in a year or two and say that no agreement which is not submitted to a referendum of the people is binding on the people, and, if you had an agreement ratified by a referendum of the people, it would be possible, in five or ten years, for a party to arise and say: &ldquo;There are so many voters on the register now who had nothing to say in the referendum, and they cannot be bound by something which they did not share in deciding.&rdquo;  It should be perfectly obvious to the President that he was doing his best to make it impossible for the British to reach any agreement when, instead of reopening agreements entered into, and acted upon, he simply brushed them aside as something which, because he came in representing another Party, he refused to recognise.</P>
    <P>I think, as I have said, that the determination of the President not to be <Col N="1709" /> trapped into any sort of arbitration is obvious because there were things in his speeches which made it perfectly clear that, even if the British had agreed to an international tribunal, we would not have got very far towards arbitration, and that he had prepared his line of retreat and would have broken on the terms of reference.  I think he was wise in all that, but it would be a good thing to get rid of the pretence, because I think that the one satisfactory method and the one safe method of settling the matter was by direct negotiation.  I am not going to answer the question of the Minister for Finance as to what we would regard as a satisfactory settlement.  That would depend on many things, but settlement by negotiation involves a compromise.  The Government cannot go into negotiations demanding, not merely all they have ever asked before, but something in addition, and hope to have a successful issue.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot hope by negotiations to get the full £5,000,000 and to go out of the Commonwealth with the blessing of the British Government and have the British Government employ their troops to coerce the Six Counties to join the Free State. He must expect something less than his full demand.  I do not know whether those would be his full demands &mdash;perhaps he would demand a large payment in respect of over-taxation in addition.  If this is to be settled by negotiation, there must be compromise. There must be some splitting of the difference and I think that, in order that there may be a satisfactory settlement, there must be a settlement of all the matters outstanding, not merely the financial matters but the constitutional matters that are outstanding, and that a good bargain cannot be made on one issue alone.  This is a question, as I have said, of money, or it was supposed to have begun as a question of money, and the Government should recognise that it would be quite possible to keep the whole £5,000,000 and leave the country much worse off than it was when the £5,000,000 were being paid or much worse off than it would be if the £5,000,000 continued to be paid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1710" /> No settlement of the financial issues, no settlement of this question of the £5,000,000, will be satisfactory unless it is a settlement that is satisfactory to both sides.  The Minister for Finance asked was the settlement to be satisfactory to us or was it to be satisfactory to Great Britain.  It must be satisfactory to both sides, because if it was one that pleased us and caused grave displeasure on the other side, then, there is no doubt that, in our trade relations with Great Britain, we would suffer disadvantages that would more than outweigh anything we might gain by pressing our fight too far, if we were able to press it too far, and there is no indication that, by continuing so long, we are going to be able to force the British people to a settlement.  There is no indication whatever that they are feeling this, or that they are facing starvation; no indication that they feel themselves shaken by the measures that we have taken here.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if one may judge from the Press, although feeling is hardening in Great Britain I have no doubt that if the Government were anxious now to make a settlement they could make a satisfactory settlement, because it is to the interests of the British people that there should be amity and goodwill between the Free State and Great Britain, that there should be normal trade relations, that the difficulties and the possibilities of difficulties that have been confronting them in regard to their relations with this State should disappear. I have no doubt that whatever hate may have arisen on the other side would be overcome, and that the solid interests of Great Britain would cause the British people to be prepared to negotiate a reasonable and satisfactory compromise.  What is wanted on this side is a disposition to make the best of the position, a disposition to realise that the full demands, the full claims that have been put forward, cannot be obtained, and that our representatives must sit down with the representatives of the British Government in a reasonable spirit, something very different from what <Col N="1711" /> was displayed during the last conversations in Great Britain, and arrive at a compromise.</P>
    <P>As some Deputies have already stated, the Ministers on the other side must have the courage to compromise, must have the courage to do whatever they think is best for the country in the circumstances, and they must not out of false pride continue a struggle which is bankrupting and impoverishing the people here.  They must not be afraid that somebody may come after them and do some mean trick of reading all their private documents and thereby try to villify and misrepresent them.  They should have the courage to do the things Governments have to do.  They should not regard themselves as leaders of some sort of forlorn hope, and they should have regard for the sufferings of the people. The Government have economic as well as other functions.  They should do the duty of a Government.  They should make the best settlement that can be made, and they should have the courage to stand over it and to face any of the jibes that, undoubtedly, idiots of various sorts will hurl at them simply because of the settlement they have made.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave's speech to-day had a certain purpose in it.  It was, of course, to paint a contrast between the state of this country when he was sitting on these benches and the state of the country to-day, when other people occupy them.  In one part of his speech he told us what a prosperous country we had; we were the envy of other peoples.  To-day, alas, within a period of six months&mdash;and it is very strange that it should have happened within a period of six months&mdash;we are in danger.  I think I could not do better than to quote the Deputy's words.  I have not got any official report yet, but this newspaper report is, I think, sufficiently accurate&mdash;a copy of the Deputy's speech was obviously given to the Press.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the result of the Government's policy stark poverty and acute distress would now seem to be the only prospect for the people and for <Col N="1712" /> their children, and perhaps for their children's children, unless immediate and effective steps are taken to avert threatened calamity and disaster.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Great as are the material losses, the spiritual losses are far more terrible.  In conditions as they now exist discontent and unrest have developed with alarming rapidity; political passions have been aroused to a degree hitherto unknown even in this country; implacable hatreds between fellow-countrymen are a commonplace; the vices of avarice, greed and envy are widespread; the loosening of morals which invariably accompanies all periods of strife is apparent; class hatred is being stirred up; the very fundamental principles of Christian charity are in danger of being forgotten; and religion itself is being menaced by the stealthy but steady progress of the forces of social and moral disintegration.</P>

      <P>That, in this paradise which we were supposed to have when the gentlemen opposite occupied these benches!</P>
      <P>And the new teachings of Communism which are accepted to a greater or lesser extent by these organisations have greatly increased the danger of the permanent perversion of the youth of the country.</P>
      <P>And that Communism, which we were told was so rife that it was necessary to take powers which no civilised Government that calls itself democratic had ever taken before, was able to put up only one candidate in the election and that candidate got a couple of hundred votes in the biggest industrial centre in the country.</P>
      <P>Murder, conspiracy and intimidation are being used against the people.</P>

      <P>It is very like something that the Deputy said to-day, but it is not to-day that that thing has happened.  The Deputy cannot have it both ways as he had in the past.  That speech is a two-faced speech and in the same way the Deputy was acting in a two-faced manner in the past.  At one time, when he wanted to tell of the prosperity this country had under his régime, it was a wonderful country, the envy of all other countries; but when he wanted to bring in the Public Safety Bill to deprive people of normal liberty, it was simply a country where murder was rife and where Communism was threatening to undermine the very foundations of society.</P>

What made us the envy of the world as regards prosperity in his time?  What was the prosperity they had in his time for over ten years, which they boasted was the longest time that any other Government had for carrying out its policy?  We had 250,000 of the flower of our people running away from this prosperity into the darkness of these uncivilised or depressed countries that he said envied us. Where was the other evidence of prosperity? Was it the 250,000 head of cattle fewer than we had at the beginning, or the 250,000 fewer acres of land in cultivation?  Where was the evidence of that prosperity?  Not merely was there not prosperity, but the Government at that time had not the foresight, which they accuse us of not having, to see that a period of depression was coming upon this country which it was wise to take measures in advance to meet.  The prosperity was simply the prosperity of the propagandists. It had no real existence, and the people themselves judged of that when they made up their minds that they were not going to have a continuation of that Government.</P>

      <P>The mover of the motion hopes that we have all short memories.  Let us go through this broadcast and see where it offends against good taste, and where there is a twisting of the lion's tail.  I have it here, and I can go through it paragraph by paragraph, and I defy any member of the House to show where there was anything that any country could take objection to.  It was given when we were not in office.  It was given on 4th March and was a repetition of the pledges and the policy we put before the Irish people and nothing more.  It opens with a greeting to friends in America whose aid had been of such assistance in the National struggle in the past, and who had been directly of assistance in the National struggle to put into office a Government that had for its purpose the working out of the National destiny in accordance with National traditions.  After the introductory greeting I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every friend of Ireland is, I am sure, overjoyed, as I am, at the thought of the re-union of the national forces here&mdash;particularly in this year of St. Patrick's Centenary, and of the <Col N="1716" /> Eucharistic Congress&mdash;the re-union of those forces so disastrously divided by the Treaty of 1921.  For ten years our nation has been struggling in agony in an attempt to free itself from the dilemma in which it was then placed with an oath of allegiance, hateful to all who prized independence, standing in the way of acceptance of the one rule of government by which discipline and ordered progress could be secured.</P>
    <P>Is that an objectionable passage?  Is it or is it not a fact that that Oath of Allegiance did stand in the way of national unity, and in the way of ordered conditions here and made it necessary for the previous Government &mdash;instead of getting goodwill and cooperation&mdash;to bring in the Public Safety Act to which I have just referred? The next paragraph says:</P>
    <P>This oath will now be removed and every section of our people will at last, without coercion of conscience, or sacrifice of principle, be able to send their representatives to the people's assembly where national policy and the direction of the national advance can then be authoritatively determined by majority vote.</P>
    <P>Is that the offending paragraph? Where is the outrage to international good manners in that paragraph or of diplomatic usage?  I said that the Oath would be removed and, speaking before action for the removal of the Oath, I said that in our opinion, according to the best advice we had got, it could be done and was within our competence and was not a violation of the Treaty.  I continued:</P>
    <P>Thus we shall have internal peace without coercive legislation, and with that peace the conditions which will make it possible to devote the energies of our people to the task of economic re-organisation and reconstruction, so that the resources of our country and the labour of our people may be rationally utilised to provide a decent standard of comfort for all our citizens, and our young manhood and womanhood be given the opportunity, heretofore denied to many of them, of earning a living in their own land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1717" /> What is wrong with that?  Why should a statement of that kind be regarded as opening a quarrel with any country?  It had reference to our own internal conditions and the policy which our Government, when it took office, would put before it.</P>
    <P>Parents in this country must no longer be doomed to rear their children for export.  To provide opportunities for work for our unemployed must then be our first task. Such opportunities can be created if we give to our own people the work which we are at present giving to strangers.  The goods that we unnecessarily import would give employment to more hands than we have at present unemployed.</P>
    <P>I do not see anything there that would offend any foreign country.</P>
    <P>The extent of our dependence upon foreign produce and manufactures will be appreciated when I point out that the three millions of us here in the Free State&mdash;in twenty-six of the thirty-two counties of our island&mdash; purchase more goods from Great Britain than any other country in the world.</P>
    <P>Is that the offending paragraph?</P>
    <P>It is hard to make people realise that to-day we, the people of the Free State, are Britain's best customers and that we buy from her more than the 300,000,000 of Indians. We buy from her £10 worth of goods for every £9 worth she buys from us.</P>
    <P>Why should the English or anybody else take offence at that?  It is a statement of fact.</P>
    <P>Within the last ten years we bought from foreign countries £120,000,000 worth of goods more than we sold.  This drain of our wealth is impoverishing us and we must stop it.  The drain of the millions of pounds which Mr. Cosgrave's Government has been sending to England yearly without justification must also stop.</P>
    <P>I think that possibly that is the offending paragraph.</P>
    <P>How many realise that the burden of our annual payments to Britain is relatively heavier on us than the <Col N="1718" /> burden of the War Reparation payments on Germany?  For every £100 the Germans raise for Governmental expenses, they have to find £20 for Reparation payments.  We have to find £24 for our payments to England. Some time ago, Mr. Stanley Baldwin, when British Prime Minister, admitted that no other country exported so much of its revenues as ours did and stated that Britain's capacity to bear financial burdens was 66 times as great as that of the Free State.  On that basis, our annual payments to England are heavier on us than a payment of £330,000,000 annually would be on Britain, and that is a sum ten times as great as Britain's annual debt payments to the United States.</P>
    <P>Perhaps that was the offending paragraph.</P>
    <P>I repeat&mdash;the burden of our annual payments to Britain is ten times that of the burden of Britain's annual debt payments to the United States. It is clear that we could not continue to bear such a burden and prosper. Our determination to keep here the land annuities at present being handed over to England is referred to, by those who wish to misrepresent the position, as &ldquo;repudiation.&rdquo;  It is nothing of the kind.</P>
    <P>I may say that I used these words deliberately, because when I had been in the United States previously there was a campaign to misrepresent our attitude.</P>
    <P>These moneys are not legally due to England.  As a measure of justice, these moneys were given to Ireland by the British Parliament on the dissolution of the Union partnership. On that dissolution, Britain retained for herself and the other peoples of the partnership everything that had been procured with moneys from the common purse into which Ireland was made to pay more than her just share.  Commissions of Inquiry set up by the British Parliament admitted this and estimates made by British officials of Ireland's over-payments amounted to three times the total amount of the advances for land purchase in Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1719" /> This is longer than I thought, but it is worth reading to show what this offending statement was that I broadcast&mdash;so offensive to Britain that it precluded any chance of reasonable negotiations and precluded any possibility of settlement.</P>
    <P>As a measure of justice, then, I say the annuities were given to the two Irish State Treasuries, North and South.  Those collected by the Northern Treasury are retained there. Those collected by the Free State have been wilfully handed over to Britain.  Mischief-makers wish to represent our efforts to secure fair play for the people of Ireland as a policy of antagonism to England.</P>
    <P>We have had remarks of a similar kind to-day.  We are to have a similar resolution to try to broadcast that same misrepresentation to-morrow.</P>
    <P>That is as false as the other misrepresentations I have referred to. My desire has always been to bring about the friendliest relations between Great Britain and Ireland, but I know that the only sure foundation for such relations and for a lasting peace is justice and the recognition of the right of our people to be free.  That is what I strove for from 1919 to 1921, when President of the Republic, and that is what I now intend to strive for.  I have no dislike of the English people.  I want to see the people of Ireland and the people of Britain as next door neighbours, living beside each other in peace and harmony, freely co-operating in matters of agreed common concern.  Both peoples will benefit.  Mutual understanding and the readiness to be fair, each to the other, is all that is required.  The political wrong that stands out from all others is the partition of our country.  It was enacted despite the protests of the overwhelming majority of our people.  The area cut off was not determined on any principle of right or justice.  It was gerrymandering pure and simple. The Unionists were given the largest area they had sufficient majority to hold.  Even Ulster itself was partitioned <Col N="1720" /> for that purpose.  Partition was not intended to solve the problem of minorities, for the Nationalist minority in the area cut off is relatively greater than the Unionist minority in the island as a whole.  If the relations between Ireland and Great Britain are to be placed on a foundation of really lasting peace, this wrong must be righted.  To the people of our race who are listening to me, I appeal to use their influence so that Ireland, this ancient land of their fathers, the land of Patrick, of Columbcille and Brigid, this land of Tone, and of Emmet&mdash;whose anniversary this is&mdash;may have her unity restored to her.</P>
    <P>That is the offending document.  I have read every particle of it.  I ask any Deputy who is prepared to judge fairly to say whether that document is any justification for the pretence that, by some blundering attitude of ours, we made negotiations and normal relations with the Government of Great Britain impossible.  I read the document out as a whole, both for the purpose I have indicated and to show that there is no change in our attitude now from our attitude when we came into office or the attitude we adopted in the General Election.  We went before the people.  We have not led the people astray.  We said to the people: &ldquo;We are going to remove the Oath if you put us into power.&rdquo;  We told them that we were going to remove the Oath for the reasons I gave in that broadcast speech&mdash;because it was necessary to remove it if we were going to have internal peace and to be rid of coercive measures and the misrepresentations of our country to which those who have to bring in coercive measures have to descend.  I told them that we were going to keep the Land Annuities, that they would not be paid to Britain until Britain made good her case to get them.  We were charged with calling this an &ldquo;economic war.&rdquo;  In the very speech in which the mover of the Resolution says we called it an &ldquo;economic war,&rdquo; he himself, right through, calls it an economic war.  Yet, that is the term that we are supposed to have coined to magnify the present situation.  It is said that if we were <Col N="1721" /> going into war we should have chosen our time.  Our time was determined by the time the former Government chose to go to the country.  They chose to go to the country at a certain time for their own purposes.  They went to the country and the country rejected them. We promised that we would not hand these moneys over.  When the first payment came along, we made good our pledge to the people by keeping it, and not handing the moneys over in June.  If the Deputy had so much foresight, he should have been able to foresee his own defeat.  If he were interested in the future of this country, he should have chosen to go at a time when we would not have our cattle&mdash;when our cattle would be sold.  Apparently, he had not that foresight.  We, however, had given our pledge to the people and we acted in accordance with our pledge.  We refused to pay over that money, believing that Britain was not entitled to it until she had made good her case to get it.</P>
    <P>The question of arbitration again of course has come up.  One does not want to be a political genius to know that in a matter of that kind if there is to be a settlement, it has to be got either by submitting the case to a third party to be decided by arbitration, or else it has to be decided by negotiations.  It was quite clear that these two courses were open and they were the two courses along which, if the money was not to be paid, and if we were not to continue the policy of our predecessors, a settlement would have to be reached.  The British Government put up a proposal of arbitration and we accepted it. They put up a proposal of arbitration with a condition.  They said it was a matter of principle with them that the tribunal should be a British Commonwealth tribunal of the character outlined in the Imperial Conference Report of 1930.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear to Deputies in the House what were the agreements that were arrived at in that Report.  One would imagine from the accusations and charges brought against us that there had been an agreement that whenever a dispute <Col N="1722" /> arose between two members of the British Commonwealth they would submit it to the arbitration of a court of the character outlined there. Nothing of the sort did happen.  No such agreement was made.  They were particularly careful to avoid any such agreement being arrived at.  The agreement in so far as it was an agreement was this: that if the two parties did agree, then that an <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal would be set up of a certain character. But it was to be a voluntary submission on both sides.  Neither party had a right to cite the other before the tribunal.  That was the idea.</P>
    <P>We did not violate any agreement come to by refusing to have our case submitted to such a tribunal.  If the British made it a matter of principle we might ask ourselves why? What right had they to make it a matter of principle?  It had not been accepted as a matter of principle at the Imperial Conference.  Then what right had the British Government to make it a matter of principle&mdash;a something that would be binding on themselves?  They had not any right. Then as they made it a matter of principle we could not accept it because it would be taken as a precedent, whenever in the future there would be a dispute, that such a dispute would have to be settled by such a tribunal. Our predecessors objected to and refused in certain cases to accept such a tribunal.  But now the things that they rejected we must take, and if we do not take the things they rejected then we are acting unpatriotically as if the same methods that operated in their case did not operate in ours and with greater force.</P>
    <P>The road to arbitration, therefore, was definitely closed, but not by us. We said: &ldquo;We are prepared to have this case tried before an international tribunal.  So long as there is no restriction whatsoever on the personnel, we are prepared to have it tried, but if you make it a matter of principle to restrict the personnel to citizens of the States of the British Empire, then we do not accept that principle and you are closing the door on the road to arbitration.&rdquo;  They have not receded a bit from that.  They have <Col N="1723" /> modified the agreement come to at the Imperial Conference.  It is they, if anybody, who are acting contrary to the spirit of the 1930 Conference. There it was enacted that a case could be brought before the tribunal, whether that case was justiciable or not. They were prepared to waive that, but they were not prepared to waive a departure from the position they took up that it was a matter of principle that disputes between two members of the British Commonwealth should be tried before a Commonwealth tribunal. That is the position with regard to arbitration.  It is known to the House. All that we claim is that it was not we banged and closed the door.  It was the British Government, and they did that at the earliest possible stage.</P>
    <P>We are accused that we did not at the very beginning send a nice polite Note to the British and say: &ldquo;We do not agree with you in this particular matter of the oath.  We are having the oath removed.  Will you allow us to do so?&rdquo; Our position was that the removal of the oath did not run across the Treaty; that it was a domestic matter, and that it was within our competence to remove that oath; that it did not run across the Treaty in any way whatever, and we proceeded accordingly.</P>
    <P>With regard to the land annuities our position was not new.  The British knew perfectly well, for we informed them in advance, that we would not pay these annuities when the payments were due.  There were negotiations, the result of which I have just told you as regards arbitration.  The other road was by arbitration and negotiation.</P>
    <P>What has the present Government done to make negotiations impossible? We take, I admit, a different view of our position from those on the opposite benches.  They have only one justification for their payment of these moneys for the past ten years and that was that they were legally due.  They stand by what they call a binding agreement and what the British call a binding agreement.  We do not agree they are binding agreements at all. We hold that that agreement of 1923, apart altogether from its provisional <Col N="1724" /> character, was not put before this House and did not receive the sanction of this House.</P>
    <P>With regard to the extent to which agreements between Executives are binding on a country, what is the usual practice?  There was a practice in Britain, as far as I understand, up to 1914.  It was a practice, in the case of Britain, that all such agreements as involved a charge on the public purse should be brought before the House of Commons, before the representatives of the British people, and ratified and sanctioned.  Since the War, the practice has been universally that treaties of an international character of any magnitude, not merely treaties involving payments of money but all treaties of magnitude, are brought forward for ratification.  We know that in other countries it is a part of the Constitution that such agreements should be formally ratified.  But, of course, the members of the opposite benches say: &ldquo;Oh, well, what is the difference? If agreements made by the Executives are not binding, then agreements made by the Parliaments will not be binding, and these agreements not being binding, agreements made by a referendum will not be binding and agreements made by a generation will not be binding because the next generation might repudiate them.&rdquo;  Surely, nobody is so foolish as to be impressed by anything of that sort.  The Executive, in matters of that sort, are merely the negotiating instruments of the Parliament. The Parliament does represent the country and a continuity, and there is all the difference in the world between a purely Executive agreement and an agreement sanctioned by Parliament. This particular agreement was not disclosed as an agreement to the Dáil at that time.  It was kept in the files and not disclosed to the Irish people for a period of nine years after-it was signed.  Are we unfair in saying that the Executive on the opposite benches were not frank?  I put it no further than that.  Is it unjust or unfair to say that they were not frank with the people or with the representatives of the people?  Why was it kept secret?  Why were its terms not <Col N="1725" /> divulged?  If there was nothing to hide, why was it not brought into the light of day?  I accuse them certainly of not being frank.  They probably had good motives for not revealing it as a whole and for not bringing it forward to be ratified as other agreements were ratified.  It was not ratified in this Parliament, nor was it ratified by the Parliament of Great Britain where also, as a whole, it was never brought forward or ratified until we learned from the dispatch of Mr. Thomas that it was going to be made the foundation of the British claim.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to you&mdash;I have pointed it out before&mdash;that the case that was made by the lawyers representing the former administration was based on a different principle altogether.  It was the principle that these land annuities were not a public debt, but were in the nature of a private debt&mdash;a position which no lawyer would attempt to defend before any court.  But that was not the position taken up by the British Government. They did not say: &ldquo;These are only debts due from the citizens of your country to the stockholders, whether citizens of your country or elsewhere.&rdquo;  They knew they could not stand upon that.  They said: &ldquo;Here is an agreement binding in honour and in law on your State&mdash;this agreement of 1923&mdash;and we claim that we get these annuities in accordance with that agreement.&rdquo;  We claim here that our people cannot be bound by such an arrangement come to between the Executives.  We claim that in accordance with the practice of the British Parliament itself, in accordance with the general practice of States, and in accordance with the resolution which was passed here in the Dáil itself, such arrangements cannot bind the people unless they are submitted to and ratified by the representatives of the people.  That resolution was passed, I would remind the Dáil, before the later agreement of 1926, which was called the Ultimate Financial Settlement, was signed.  This agreement also, I would point out, was kept from the Irish people without being revealed as a whole, although it was supposed to be the Ultimate Financial Settlement to which all <Col N="1726" /> people who had been reading about it and taking an interest in it were looking forward.  The 1923 agreement was kept secret for nine years and the 1926 agreement was kept secret for eight or nine months.  Here is the resolution which was passed by Dáil Eireann on February 26, 1926, in an amended form as proposed by Deputy Cosgrave, the then President:</P>
    <P>That the Dáil, recognising that Saorstát Eireann cannot be committed to or bound by any agreement with an external Government without the prior sanction and consent of the Dáil, has no desire to limit the Executive Council in the exercise of its functions or in the discharge of its duty to defend and promote the interests of the State and its people.</P>
    <P>What does that mean?  Its meaning is obvious.  It means that the Executive of the day are empowered to negotiate agreements, but that the country cannot be committed to or bound by any agreement with an external Government without the prior sanction and consent of the Dáil.  That is the principle which we are standing by. It was recognised by the Dáil in 1926 on the motion of Deputy Cosgrave himself.  We stand by that principle. We think it is a right principle, and that the Dáil were right in standing by that principle.  It is the only right principle, and I put this supposition to members of the House&mdash;suppose, just for a moment, that the thing was the other way about.  Suppose there had been a British Government that at that time, for one reason or another of its own, agreed that as a financial settlement they would pay £5,000,000, or sixty-six times five if it was to be proportionate, that is £330,000,000&mdash; suppose a sum of that magnitude was agreed to by the British Government of 1926, and that that Government agreed to a financial settlement by which Britain was to pay that sum to this country, and that that was entered into and was not ratified by the Parliament&mdash;not accepted, in other words, by the representatives of the British people.  And suppose that it had continued doing that for eight or ten years, and that somebody like Mr. Snowden or Mr. <Col N="1727" /> Thomas came along and said: &ldquo;We do not know of any such agreement; the Executive of the day, if they entered into such an agreement, had no power to bind our people to it; the fact that it has been made for a number of years, whether through misunderstanding or otherwise, does not deprive us of the right to discontinue the payments, and until our Parliament authorises us to pay them we will cease to pay them.&rdquo; Suppose that that happened.  Do you think that we would have any power to enforce any legal claim which we might think we had in these circumstances when they could point out to us what their practice was, and what the commonsense of the situation was&mdash; that it is only by the body of representatives of the people and not by the Executive in secret that the nation could be bound?  Is it not quite obvious to everybody that we would fail and that we would be in a hopeless position?  And I say that the British are in a hopeless position to-day.  They have no right legally, and what are they doing?  We are told that these measures which they are taking are not intended to be reprisals, and are not intended to be coercive&mdash;that it is an attempt simply to get these moneys back.</P>
    <P>Now, it is extraordinary, with all this goodwill which they say they have for us, that they should be treating us in a very different fashion to the way they are treating Russia.  Russia did not pay her debts to the British and repudiated the debts.  We deny that we have a debt.  Yet the British Government, which has placed a virtual embargo on our exports, has taken no similar action against Russia. Not merely that but they are seeking trade with Russia.  They are even giving Russia millions by way of credit to keep up that trade and yet their trade with this country was much greater than the trade with Russia. Have we not reason to think that there is something peculiar in the situation when we find that we are treated in this fashion and that another country is treated in quite a different fashion although even from the British point of view the offences would be in the same category? <Col N="1728" /> We deny they are in the same category, but let us even take the British position.  What is the reason?  Obviously, the reason is that they think that they can squeeze us.  I see no other.  They think that by squeezing us they would be able to get the Irish people to cease supporting the Government they have chosen and to put in a Government that would be more suitable to them&mdash;perhaps I might use the word &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; as the word &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; might be misunderstood&mdash;a Government more acceptable to them.  I say deliberately as far as I can see that the whole aim of British policy in this matter has been to try to apply pressure to drive the Irish people from behind the Government they deliberately chose and try to get restored here the Government that was working in such amity with England in the past.  I have no doubt whatever that if we were to continue making these payments we might also be able to purchase British goodwill.  We cannot continue making these payments and we shall not continue to make these payments, believing as we do that they are not due from us.</P>
    <P>We heard of the hardship that has been imposed by the British tariffs, but we heard very little of the hardship that was imposed in the past by these payments.  Let us see what they amounted to in relation to our agricultural trade with Great Britain.  Take our butter.  We got for our butter in Great Britain in 1931 just over £2,000,000.  The annuities alone amount to 143 per cent.&mdash;144 per cent. really&mdash; of that figure.  In other words, we were not merely giving them all our butter for nothing but if we increased the amount of butter sent to them by 44 per cent. we would be making a present of the whole amount to them&mdash; producing it and handing it over to Britain.  That would merely equal the present of £3,000,000 we were paying in land annuities alone.  If we were to count our payments at £5,000,000, as they were, then 239 per cent.&mdash;in fact, 240 per cent. is the nearer figure &mdash;of our butter would be sold before it would equal that payment of £5,000,000.  In other words nearly 2½ times&mdash;2 4-10 times&mdash;the amount of the <Col N="1729" /> butter we exported would be presented to them.</P>
    <P>The amount we were paying to Britain was the same as if we had made Britain a present of practically two and a half times the butter we were selling to them.  We did not hear Deputies on the opposite benches then telling us that the farmers were slaving, toiling and producing this butter and that we would have to sell two and a half times the amount we were exporting before it would equal the money we were giving over to Britain.</P>
    <P>We heard also about eggs.  Our exports of eggs were worth roughly last year £2,227,000.  We would have to sell 134.7 per cent. of that figure&mdash;that is we would have to sell 34 per cent. more&mdash;before it would equal the payment of £3,000,000.  If we take the figure as £5,000,000, we would have to produce and sell two and a quarter times the whole of the eggs we had, to equal that figure.  Then we come to the question of cattle.  We can take the tariff on cattle at present. I remember Deputy O'Sullivan speaking in Kildare and saying that there might be a tariff of £1 a head, £2 or £3 per head.  I pointed out at that time that £3 per head would not equal the amount that Britain was getting quietly by means of the land annuities.  The amount we paid in land annuities represented 23.7 per cent. of our total trade in cattle.  Our total payments of £5,000,000 would represent just the present tariff of 40 per cent. on cattle.  We were paying actually the equivalent of a tariff of 40 per cent.  Let them get every penny of that 40 per cent. tariff on our cattle and they will not be getting any more than we were paying them then.  We were giving them 40 per cent. of the total that we got from our cattle trade by these payments.  In the case of live pigs our payments of £5,000,000 would mean that we would not merely give them the number of pigs we were sending, but that we would have to increase that number by two and a quarter times and make them a present of the whole lot before it would equal the amount of the payments we <Col N="1730" /> were making them.  In the case of sheep, the payments would equal about four and a quarter times the value of our sheep trade.</P>
    <P>Why did Deputies on the opposite benches not come to the relief of the farmers then&mdash;these makers of great bargains, these people who want you to imagine that all you have got to do is to go to the British Government and say: &ldquo;We are being badly treated, will you not be good to us?&rdquo; and that there and then you will get a grand bargain? Why did not these people, who know so much about making good bargains, go to the British Government if bargains were so easily made?  Why did they not go to the British Government and say to them: &ldquo;We cannot continue to give you four and a half times as much as all our sheep exports are worth and hope to prosper; we cannot give you two and a quarter times all our exports of pigs are worth, make you a present of it every year, and hope to prosper&rdquo;? Under present conditions, with depressed prices, when every Government is asking to be relieved of inter-Governmental payments, which are admittedly the cause of depressed conditions, why did not these makers of good bargains&mdash;these wise statesmen who are looking into the future but who cannot see their own defeat though it is staring them in the face&mdash;why did they not go at that time and say to the British Government: &ldquo;This is unfair to our Government; we admit we made a bargain; we do not say we are not bound by it, but we ask you to relieve our people of what is an impossible burden for them to bear&rdquo;?  Now they think they can do it, and why?  Why do they think they could do it now when they could not do it then?  Something must have happened in the meantime.  I suggest it is the change of Government. I suggest that the only thing that has happened is that there has been a change of Government, that the Irish people have shown that they did not want the other Government, that was doing these things, to continue in office.  It is because of that fact that there is a new situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1731" /> What is our policy?  On every single occasion on which there was a suggestion of negotiation we have responded and said we were willing. Deputy Dillon put a question to me. When we get the British Government putting these questions, I shall answer them.  When some representative of the British Government makes a statement such as Deputy Dillon makes now, I am prepared to give an answer but I am not going to give an answer to some member of the House, who is going to put a question of that sort that is purely hypothetical and cannot influence the real situation one bit. It is for the British Government, if they want it, to put these questions. They know perfectly well from our attitude, from the beginning, that we wanted to have friendly relations between the two peoples, that the last thing we wanted was to stir up old hatreds.  We do not want to do that.</P>
    <P>We are quite as prepared to meet and discuss the case as we were in the past, but if there is to be a discussion of any value it must not be the type of discussion in which two parties settle down simply to argue their case. It is quite clear that if both sides are going to argue the merits of their case you must have some third party to decide.  That is quite the sort of thing you could do if you were going to have a third party, some tribunal, to give a decision, but that is not negotiation as I understand it.  We have not widened this question beyond the financial side of it.  I do not know what Deputy Blythe wants.  In the first part of his speech he seemed to state that we were somehow widening it out to circles beyond that of the financial relations between the countries, and at the end of his speech he said that we would have to widen it out.  Now which is it to be?</P>
    <P>As far as we are concerned our attitude has been made quite clear.  We are not deceiving the Irish people. We took office under a certain understanding, and we have been true and will be true to that understanding until we go before the Irish people again. When we go before the Irish people <Col N="1732" /> we will put forward the policy we think is best, at that particular time, for the country.  Until the Irish people are consulted, we have definite obligations and definite pledges to them, and we mean to be faithful to those pledges in so far as they are limiting us in any direction.  Where we have imposed limitations on ourselves we are going to be as faithful to those limitations as we were to the promises we made that we were going to advance in certain directions.  That is the only answer I can give to any Deputy who questions me on our present attitude&mdash; the only answer I am justified in giving, and the only answer that he is justified in asking.  Therefore, I say to Deputy Dillon two things.  With regard to the question he put me, I say that that is a question for some representative of the British Government to put, and if it is so put I will give the answer.  I see no purpose in answering it here and I have indicated why.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Blythe and &ldquo;where we are going,&rdquo; I have said definitely that where we gave pledges to our people we regard these as sacred promises; we mean to keep them both in the direction in which they limit us and in the direction in which we have pledged ourselves to advance.  I therefore say that this vote of censure which has been moved is unjustified.</P>

      <P>I have often not got that myself, but it does not matter, I will give it.  The position then is this, that we regard this vote of censure as altogether unjustified.  The speech of the mover depicts a condition which is not the real condition, both in the picture he gave of the condition of the country before and its condition now.  There is no way in which we can bring about negotiations; there is no way in which the present situation can be remedied except by recognition of the fact that if we want to maintain our right to these annuities <Col N="1733" /> we must proceed exactly as we have proceeded.  It is for us here to take note of what our internal resources are, and to get every element in the country, in so far as we can, determined that they will lose no opportunity of trying to recorder their economic life so as to meet the situation that would, in any case, have had to be faced.  It is quite obvious that that situation was there, and I therefore ask, with confidence, the members of the House to turn down this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>He has travelled over the whole ground.  Some of it had been already covered by Deputy Norton.  We were asked what the condition of affairs here was some twelve or thirteen months ago&mdash;what it was that led us to say that there was prosperity here in this country.  Perhaps the best description I can give in that direction is from a bulletin of the Swiss Bank Corporation on the world economic crisis.  This article calculates that twenty million workers are now suffering from enforced unemployment, whilst two or three years ago unemployment was practically unknown outside Great Britain.  Diagrams show that in the middle of 1930 only three countries could be regarded as prosperous, compared with ten countries a year earlier and twenty-seven countries ten years before.  The three countries classed as prosperous are Denmark, Ireland and Norway, with France in an intermediate condition below them, but in advance of the depressed countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other information is also available from the League of Nations in connection with that, but if Deputies or the President want to see exact particulars regarding the condition of affairs here during the last ten years he will find them in the statistical abstracts published here last year and the year before, showing 240,000 persons in <Col N="1734" /> insurable occupation ten years ago and last year 294,000 persons; showing also a marked reduction in the amount of unemployment insurance paid in the first three years, 1922 to 1925, in the following three years, and in the succeeding three years from that time; showing it is not by any means a simple extension of the number of persons in insurable occupations, or rather occupations in which they were insured and which they were enjoying up to that time, but that we actually made solvent the Unemployment Fund that was insolvent a few years ago. There are 50,000 persons more in employment in the short space of nine years.  No other country in the whole world can show such a remarkable advance in that connection, and Deputy Norton was speaking with his tongue in his cheek this afternoon when he was criticising the industrial activity of the Government in the last ten years.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt the little Vice-President.  The figure was 94,000, and it is now 12,000 in excess of that figure.  I did not interrupt the President but the moment you get in a point with those people you have interruptions.  The Vice-President should behave himself.  We are told now that this agreement signed in 1923 was not sanctioned by this House.  In the Appropriation Act of 1923 and in each subsequent Act and three times this year there is down in our statutory enactments that these sums are to be paid to Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When an agreement is made with another country either here or in Great Britain, and I believe the practice is the same in practically all the Dominions, no agreement is worth the paper it is written on respecting money <Col N="1735" /> unless the money is voted by Parliament, and it is well known by the Front Benches, and Deputy Davin knows it, that these moneys were brought up here and voted in this House.  It cannot be denied.  I have the Appropriation Act here.  I can show it and read out the figures, and read out to whom the money is to be paid.  It is to the British Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>My Government did more for this country than your Government could do if you were in office for one hundred years.  What was one of the promises Fianna Fáil made when looking for votes? &ldquo;Fianna Fáil stands for peace.&rdquo;  What does peace mean?  Are the farmers in this country at the present moment in peace?  We heard a few moments ago some of the mathematical rubbish which has resulted in putting those gentlemen over there on the front benches.  We have heard it would cost twice and a half the cost of butter to pay the land annuities and other payments to Great Britain; twice and a half the cost of the export of eggs to pay them, and it would cost forty per cent. on the cattle exports to pay them.  Does it not follow that the sum total of these has to be added in order to produce the money?  No, that is not told to the people; that is reserved.  People have an idea, from statements made here, that we have got to give butter for nothing, eggs for nothing and forty per cent. on our cattle for nothing. The fact of the matter is that the people now are taxed forty per cent. on their cattle, and they are taxed also in respect of other items, and the President who is a child, I am sure, about finance, whatever he may know about mathematics, knows full well that last year or the year before or any previous year (I think I am hitting my blows home) was not the time to go to the British Government to ask for a reconsideration of these payments. What is the history during the last eighteen months of Great Britain? Anybody who has studied the situation there, who has even read the newspapers, <Col N="1736" /> realises that some thirteen or fourteen months ago a serious financial and economic crisis faced the British people.  It meant a change of Government. Along with a change of Government it meant a Supplementary Budget.  It meant furthermore that they went off the gold standard, and I am sure by this time the Minister for Finance realises the significance of that departure.  That is the period we were invited to go over to negotiate on these matters.  We were in a far stronger financial position than Great Britain at that time, and nobody knows it better, however much they may deny it, than the three Ministers sitting on the far side.</P>
      <P>The position now is quite different. Cattle prices, sheep prices, pig prices, practically all the agricultural prices, have fallen and there is now an opportunity in view of all the circumstances of the case and from the different approaches made by the various Governments, not alone here but all over the world, in respect of debts and so on, to point out that the position here is such that agriculture, our main industry, is no longer equal to the burden of meeting those particular demands and to ask, as the British are now asking the Americans, as the French are putting it to the Americans, and as the Germans are supporting both of them to consider these matters on an international basis.  And further, there is no reason in the world, and there is every good reason, why we should not get from the British Government and the British Parliament those preferences and those advantages which have been given to other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations whose business, whose trade, and whose usefulness in respect of economics is by no means of the same standard as our own.  At this moment, they are considering in respect of lamb and mutton an economy on that particular product of agricultural produce, and they are prepared to go further even than preference to ensure that there will be a supply of mutton and lamb in future for the British market.  Why could we not get these advantages and these privileges in respect of our main product&mdash;cattle?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no use in making senseless interruptions like that, because we have it on the authority, even of the British Ministers, that if the approach is made on the basis of our incapacity to meet that particular burden, they are prepared to consider it.  Why not try them?  After all, what is going to be the future of Governments between countries if we do not adhere to, and accept agreements that have been made?  If they at any time had shown, in connection with these negotiations, a disposition not to listen to us, other than the international formula which I adverted to a while ago, that is, inability to pay, if they said whether you can pay or not we are going to tax you for that, then there would probably be some basis for the President's very senseless interruption.</P>
      <P>It so happened here this evening that we were spoken to at some length by the Minister for Education. Looking over the debates which took place on the Treaty I find he was one of the very few persons in the Dáil at that time, and they are not many on that side now who were in Parliament at that time, who pointed out that what economies we could effect, in respect of the new administration, would be practically swamped by the interest and the Sinking Fund on the National Debt.  And further, here is the publication by the Party to which the Deputy beyond belongs and the Ministers belonged some ten years ago, clause by clause, Document No. 2. What is the sum and substance of it? The financial clause reads &ldquo;that Ireland shall assume liability for such share of the present debt of Great Britain and Ireland,&rdquo; and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I will read it all if you like: &ldquo;that Ireland shall assume liability for such share of the present debt of Great Britain and Ireland and of the payment of war pensions as existing at this date as may be fair and equitable, having regard to any just claims on the part of Ireland by way of set-off or counter-claim, the amount of such sums being determined, <Col N="1738" /> in default of agreement, by the arbitration of one or more independent persons being citizens of Ireland or of a British Commonwealth.&rdquo;  And this note comes underneath.  &ldquo;Similar to the Treaty clause, with the important difference that Ireland (line 1) accepts liability for a capital sum, not an annual payment, like a tribute.&rdquo; Then it goes on to say that the arbitrator might be an Irish or a British citizen.  What was the other statement of the President?  During the period we were negotiating in respect of Article 5 he announced, if my recollection is correct, that we were to be liable for a sum of nineteen million pounds according to the accounts that had been submitted by the British Government before he left office.</P>

      <P>That misrepresentation has been repeated thousands of times, and each time I got an opportunity I have corrected it.

      <P>If there are any people left who believe in the Treaty policy ... they will be finally disillusioned when that other Commission provided for in the Treaty&mdash;the Financial Commission&mdash;is set up and comes to deliver its award.  As a warning in advance I inform all these that the demand of the British at the time of the negotiations was for a yearly sum of over £19,000,000</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputies want to get these things off I will send them to them.  Again the President says:</P>
      <P>Even the man with a stake in the country would not like the Treaty when they saw the amount of the national debt they would be saddled with.</P>
      <P>It was in relation to this, and in connection with all this, that we were negotiating, and got off, in 1925, with complete immunity from the national debt and were put into a position that no other country in Europe or America was in.  We were free as no other country was, without a penny piece of debt.  We have been advising the Government what to do for the last three months.  We have been advising, and even supporting them, and the President, notwithstanding the pronouncement of his own press, made the admission when crossing over to the Conference in London that the speech I made a day or two previously was a helpful speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just one or two other matters before I conclude.  On the 29th September, it was announced in the sporting pages of the <i>Irish Times</i>&mdash;I am sure Ministers opposite never read the sporting pages of the papers, they would do better if they did&mdash;that Mr. Leader sent eight yearlings to Newmarket in England to be sold.  He bought them at the Dublin Horse Show for 400 guineas, that is practically £50 a piece.  He received, as well as I remember, over 400 guineas for one and got £1,680 guineas for the other seven. That is to say he would have got 2,200 <Col N="1740" /> guineas for the eight.  There is a striking lesson.  They were tainted goods here.  The unpopularity of this conflict had prevented British buyers from coming here, but an Englishman bought them; they lost their taint, and that Englishman made a profit in selling them in Newmarket of the difference between 400 guineas and 2,200 guineas.</P>
