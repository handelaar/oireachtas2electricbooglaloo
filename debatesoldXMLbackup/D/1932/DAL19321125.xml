      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Dáil agree with the Committee in the Report of the Financial Resolutions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These Financial Resolutions have the general effect of confirming the duties imposed by the Agricultural Produce (Emergency) Provision of Duties Nos. 1, 2 and 3 Orders.  There are certain modifications, and there is general power to admit any of the articles free of duty on licence, except in the case of pigs' meat, in which case also a licence can be granted where the meat is intended for further manufacture. In the case of agricultural machinery, which also comes under the Emergency Order, the duty is reduced from 100 to 75 with 50 per cent. preferential rate.  In the case of sheep and live poultry it remains the same; also tinned meat.  In the case of eggs in shells the duty remains the same, except in the case of dry eggs, which is met here by regulating frozen albumen and frozen yolk of egg.  It is also made clear in these Resolutions that it does not apply to imported food stuffs that contain a certain proportion of the articles in paragraph (a). Animal fats are added.  In the case of vegetables there are changes in Emergency Order No. 3.  There was a duty of 1/8.  There is a classification of vegetables now and different duties apply to different classes. Rhubarb has been added to the list. In the case of cut flowers, the duty imposed last April&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard something about what the first Resolution effects but nothing as to the reason for it.  It is quite interesting to hear that this does something which is consequent upon the Emergency Duty Order passed earlier, and to be told that the animal fats scheme is completed now.  But why were the duties imposed in the first instance, and why is this about animal fats introduced now?  On the point as to having these things brought before us in this way and rushed in this manner, could we have some information now as to the pivotal dates which have got to be worked to?  What is the important stage of these things, and what is the date at which either that important stage or, say, the passage into law of the Bill must be achieved? When we have got some knowledge of that we can understand why these Resolutions are being taken to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy want to know the technical reason for bringing them in at this date, or whether they have to be sanctioned by a certain time?  Under the Emergency Powers that the Executive got these duties, as well as I remember, were to last for eight months without confirmation, if necessary.  The reason why they are brought in at this stage is to make them permanent duties before the coming Finance Bill is introduced.  The Finance Bill, I believe, is to be introduced in the near future, but I am not sure of the exact date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the question of its introduction the point that matters? Is not the real question its passage into law?  Could the Minister say what is the date that we are up against?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then why bring these in this morning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I can say is that the Department of Finance informed me that these Resolutions should be reported to-day.  I am not able to give the exact date when the <Col N="395" /> Bill must be through the House.  With regard to the other point as to why an emergency duty was put on these articles, the reason is because there was a considerable import of certain things.  In the case of pigs' meat, for instance, Deputies are aware that the duty was imposed about the 1st January, 1932.  The effect of that duty was to exclude, or cut down, imports to a great extent.  Under that particular duty bacon was allowed in free from Commonwealth countries.  Whereas the import in the first six months of 1931 was 253,000 cwts., that was reduced to 161,000 cwts. for the first six months of 1932.  The effect of the duty was to increase the imports from certain Commonwealth countries, such as Canada, and to cut out almost completely imports from Continental countries.  Since the imposition of the emergency duty against Commonwealth countries, as well as other countries, the import of bacon has practically ceased.</P>
      <P>In the case of sheep they were imported principally from Northern Ireland. At the time the tariff was put on large purchases were being made of breeding sheep in the Six County area for importation to the Free State. Since the tariff was imposed we have had applications for permission to import. It may be necessary to import certain breeding stock and we should have power to licence the import of sheep for that purpose.  The same thing would apply to live poultry.  It may also be necessary to import pedigree stock under that head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of eggs in shell, the imports reached in value £35,000 in 1928.  In 1931 the value was £6,500. As regards eggs not in shell the value of the imports varied from £37,000 to £48,000 over the last ten years.  For the first nine months of this year the imports were £22,600 in value, the same as for the corresponding period of 1931.  During the month of September, which is the only month for which we have accurate returns since this duty was imposed under the Emergency Powers Order, the import was 68 cwt. as compared with 813 cwt. for the corresponding month of last year.  The import of fats and so on <Col N="396" /> has been rather large.  Untreated animal fats are already dutiable under the bacon tariff and other meat tariffs that were imposed, but these are treated animal fats.  It is felt that it would be difficult to put a duty upon meat essences because that would influence the prices of certain medicinal preparations and certain articles which are used largely by the poor in the making of soup and so on.  Dripping, soup and so on which are treated can be very well done in this country.  As our export of animal fats is larger than our imports in any one year it is clear that there is a sufficiency of these goods and that they can be treated in this country.</P>
    <P>With regard to vegetables, the imports, exclusive of potatoes, onions and tomatoes, amount to between £7,000 and £9,000 annually.  That is to say, raw vegetables.  The value of imports of preserved vegetables varies from £8,000 to £25,000 annually. The imports of onions vary from £60,000 to £80,000.  We do not propose to place a tariff on onions because the price at which they can be produced by the home growers would be very much greater than that at which they would be imported. The imports of tomatoes vary from £99,000 to £120,000 annually.  I do not think there is anything else that I have to say.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another illuminating item in the rush that is now on.  Yesterday we had financial Resolutions before us.  It is obvious that there had to be secrecy about any financial Resolutions brought in, but when arrangements were made previously with regard to the business to be done this week, there was no question or no suggestion from the Government that there might be certain emergency things to be taken and that time would be required for <Col N="397" /> them.  The more the Government wants the ordinary time allowed for discussion on these matters to collapse the better prepared they ought to be with reasons for these matters.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I queried what were the reasons for these tariff Resolutions and I got a variety of inconsequential replies from the Minister for Finance. I asked the Minister for Agriculture to give us some indication for these and he said the Department of Finance told him it was necessary. That is all that he requires.  I did not know that orders were taken so subserviently from the Department as all that, but now it would seem that the Minister for Agriculture just gets his instructions to go into the Dáil and get these things through because the Department of Finance tells him to do so.  That might be his reason, but if so he might have kept it to himself and put up a better show here.  We are faced now with this procedure on resolutions brought in yesterday.  We are asked to take the Report Stage to-day.  There must be some terrible power in the Department of Finance when it compels the Minister to take these things through in this way. Previously the Wheat Bill was represented as one of special urgency and that its passage through the Dáil this week was necessary.  The only reason we are now told for throwing over this Bill is that the Department of Finance told the Minister that these Resolutions must be got through.  He did not stop to get the dates.  We might have got the dates yesterday so as to try to see what we are working on, and have the discussion at a later stage if it is thought necessary to have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then I say that if there had been even good preparation in getting the matter put before us in a cogent way, we should have understood both the scope of the duties and the necessity for having them through within a certain time.  In that case there might be some excuse, but the Minister merely stood up and did no more than read the Resolutions.  A question was put to him to explain what the Resolutions effected.  I asked what was the reason for whatever effect the <Col N="398" /> Resolutions had and I got a long statement about certain bacon from Canada and about certain pedigree poultry and pedigree sheep which had to be imported from Northern Ireland. Certainly that is so in the case of sheep, but I do not know about the poultry, but we are told that the continuance of their import is likely.</P>
    <P>Why this change, whatever the change may be?  The only thing I could gather from the Minister's attempted explanation was that if there be imports amounting to a considerable figure, then if you put up a sufficiently high tariff you can reduce that import or possibly stop it altogether.  Well we all knew that already.  But tariffs are not imposed on the basis of merely trying out the effect of that particular weapon.  That is not the object of tariffs.  I assume there is some better reason behind it than that, but that is the reason that the Minister has ventured on.  There used to be imports from certain countries.  The tariff was put on.  The imports dropped.  Canadian imports rose to a certain value, but they will be stopped or lessened at any rate unless they find their way into some other port.</P>
    <P>But why put on a tariff for the purpose of seeing what will be the result? That does not justify the use of a tariff and particularly it does not justify the Resolution as to pedigree sheep and pedigree poultry.  I do not see the relation.  The Minister says that these have been imported and will likely be imported for some time to come.  They will, he says, have to be imported under licence.  That is no justification for what it is proposed to do and what we are asked to do this morning.  There is only one item mentioned by the Minister that had any reason and that is the necessity for letting in a certain amount of untariffed material.  Amongst all the things we are tariffing we are exempting one thing.  We are not asked to put a tariff on onions coming into the country.  In the matter of onions we are not going to be left to the mercy of people who grow onions at home.  The reason the Minister gives <Col N="399" /> is that the price of our home-grown onions would be considerably in excess of the price at which onions can be imported into the country.  That is the only argument given for this mass of Resolutions with regard to tariffs.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting to have the onions analogy introduced into the Wheat Bill when we resume the debate on it.  The argument is that home-grown onions must, if the tariff is put on onions, be sold at a considerably greater price than that at which imported onions could be brought in without a tariff.  Now that argument will destroy most of the Wheat Bill.  I would like to know what would be the difference in price in the case of home-grown onions if the people were to be given subsidies and bounties on whatever acreage was put down under this particular vegetable.  There has been no reason given for these tariffs and there has been no clear explanation as to the effect of them or their particular relation with the Resolution brought in this morning.</P>
    <P>That is mainly the reason why I protest against these things being taken this morning at a time when the House was supposed to be devoting its energeies to the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Bill.  We were kept at that Bill all day on Wednesday and then we even utilised Private Members' time.  We were considering the same measure all day yesterday, from Question time to 10.30 p.m., and we were told that we were to take it into consideration again to-day.  It was pointed out to us that there were over 100 amendments to be considered. Then quite suddenly to-day these Financial Resolutions are shot at us. We are given absolutely no time to consider them, to grasp the relationship of the new Resolutions with the Resolutions previously passed.  We are given the minimum amount of time in which to get the effect of the Resolutions clearly in our minds.  No reason has been given in the statements made by any of the Ministers for bringing in these Resolutions to-day; there may be reasons, but we have not got them yet.</P>

      <P>The Second Reading of the Finance Bill will have to be taken next week; that is, if we are to sit four days next week, and that appears to be necessary.  If the Bill is to be read a First Time next Tuesday and circulated, I am sure Deputies opposite will say that the time given them for consideration of the measure is much too short, particularly if we are to take the Second Reading on Friday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Evidently it was known to the Department of Finance, but I only know of it now.  With regard to the reason for introducing these tariffs, the Deputy, of course, takes a different view to that adopted by the Government.  I gave my reason for not putting a tariff on onions.  Vegetable growers here say they can grow vegetables as cheaply as a foreigner, and my view is that if that can be done without inflicting a great hardship on the consumer, it should be done, and there is no necessity for putting on a tariff.  If there is no great reason for putting on a tariff, then no tariff should be imposed.  I do not see why we should give any reasons for putting on tariffs.  It is the natural thing to do&mdash;to confine the market to our own producers.  With regard to the question of sheep and Northern Ireland, I said that we were asked to allow sheep in on a permit. I pointed out that they were not pedigree sheep and that the importation would be in a commercial way.  It may be necessary to import a small number of pedigree sheep, not necessarily from Northern Ireland, but perhaps from some other country, and hence the reason for this licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="401" /> With regard to all this talk about an agreement being made, the Chief Whip of this Party came to me to know if we would postpone the Committee Stage of the Cereals Bill last week so as to give the Cumann na nGaedheal Party time to put in amendments.  I stated that if the Cumann na nGaedheal Party were prepared to facilitate us in respect of the remaining stages I would be agreeable to that course.  He said that they would be prepared.  After we had agreed to postpone the Committee Stage, Deputy McGilligan came along with 126 additional amendments.  If we had held to our original time table in regard to this Bill Deputy McGilligan would not have had an opportunity of putting in his amendments.</P>

      <P>The proper presentation of it, so far as I am concerned, is this: I agreed to give in on two occasions to the wishes of the opposite Party.  On one occasion I agreed that we would not take the Committee Stage last week, and on another that we would not sit on Tuesday.  On each occasion the promise was given that we would be facilitated.</P>

      <P>The Minister is not going to get away so easily with this. I do not care what the preliminaries were.  The agreement was based on this, that nothing would be introduced except First Readings during the three days on which the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Bill would be under discussion. I deny the Minister's statement with regard to the preliminaries. That agreement has been broken. Withdraw these Resolutions now and you will get your Committee Stage to-day.</P>

      <P>It would keep us later than 10.30 p.m. if we were to go through all of them.  Why are we asked to sit late?  Because the Minister for Agriculture came in to-day and in the most unabashed way that I ever saw, for one who pretended to be a Minister, stated that he did not know why certain Financial Resolutions had to be got through except that the Finance Department had told him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not that a good reason?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>A very good reason, if he wants to take everything lying down.  If the Finance Department told him that a certain absurd taxation was right, would he accept that?  If the Department of Agriculture told him that they did not know what millable wheat was and that a Bill founded upon it was absurd, would he take it from them?  The Bill is absurd on the point the Minister stated.  At any rate, we were asked to-day to take three Resolutions.  We asked what was the urgency for them. The Minister for Finance, whose Department bullied the Minister for Agriculture into coming in here to-day, had not even any enlightenment from his Department last night.  He had the whole evening, after he had been asked that question, to make it up and was not here to tell us to-day. All this was in breach of an agreement by the bringing in of these things.  Now the Minister for Industry and Commerce feels that if he is not allowed to ride roughshod over everybody something is wrong, and in the new situation he loses his temper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are giving an hour longer than the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The agreement had to do with getting the Committee Stage of this Bill through to-day on certain conditions laid down and the Government have broken those conditions. Then the Minister for Industry and Commerce loses his temper because he <Col N="408" /> is not able to do the little Napoleon here openly that he thinks he is.  You require something more than just an appreciation of yourself to do the Napoleon in this House&mdash;considerably more.  You have to be able to argue as to what an agreement was and where the breach is and not merely make statements with regard to it. The agreement was that the Committee Stage of this Bill would be got through to-day, provided there was nothing brought in except the First Reading of measures.  At the time that agreement was made either these Financial Resolutions were in prospect or they were not.  If they were, they should have been mentioned.  If they were not, then the neglect and inefficiency displayed this morning are all the clearer.  Did the Finance Department only begin to bully the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce yesterday, or did they not give orders about the bringing in of these things when Deputy Boland was speaking about the agreement? If there had been a definite intimation given that these things were required, or that something, which need not necessarily be mentioned because there had to be secrecy about these things, was required, a statement could have been made that an hour, or some time like that, was required for the passage of certain things.  That was not done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the Deputy there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking second-hand. The Minister was not there. He was probably admiring himself somewhere.  That was not mentioned. Then these Resolutions were taken. There was no statement given as to the necessity of getting them through other than what the Minister for Agriculture gave us.  It is a matter of amazement that any Minister would be uncouth enough to make such a foolish statement, that he was told by the Department of Finance that they had to be put through.  The Minister ought not merely to pass on orders that he gets from the Department.  He ought to test them out and make up his mind whether the orders are well-founded, <Col N="409" /> get the reasons for them, come along and display the reasons, and see whether the House agrees.  There is no information given, and no argument advanced, but just simply that we had to get them through because we were told they had to go through.  The date by which they had to go through was not even known until later in the discussion. Now the alternative is that we are not to deal with the amendments to-day unless we sit late.  We need not deal with them to-day.</P>
      <P>There is another way out of that difficulty. There is a later stage and they can be put down for that stage. Clearly, it can be done.  It is a thing that will have to be done.  When a Bill of this kind, which interferes seriously with business, is going to be rushed this way, the discussion will have to take place.  There is not much gained by all this.  There is no necessity to sit an hour later than 2 o'clock to-day.  The discussion will occur again and it will obviously mean a much longer Report Stage and a much longer Fifth Stage than otherwise would have been.  All this has occurred because there was not sufficient foresight to discover when the Resolutions had to be tabled in order to get them through by whatever is the pivotal date.  When people get into a mess like that, they certainly should not lose their tempers in it.  There is a way of graciously withdrawing from a bad position.  We have seen very little of the grace and a whole lot of the bad position.  Withdrawal is not going to be so easy, because it is not going to effect the purpose of getting this rush through.  Unless the Ministry show themselves disposed to have important measures of this type, which are supposed to be pivotal, discussed in the House, the people of the country will see that the measures have not been properly considered&mdash;that they have been as badly patched together as the whole programme for this week.  As to the introduction of these late ideas by way of Financial Resolutions, interfering with the programme already arranged, there is just as much foresight in the original programme as there is in these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should have thought the Minister <Col N="410" /> might have been in a mood&mdash;on the confession that was made as early as the sixth clause in this pivotal measure for the development of the new economy, that the point upon which the measure pivoted, millable wheat, had been abandoned&mdash;to have had some other scheme, and let the Financial Resolutions get full play, as they might have got then.  Instead of that, we are going blundering ahead with this Bill, when the whole basis has been kicked away by the Minister who introduced it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Doyle went away and came back shortly afterwards to say if we were taking nothing else but this Bill they would agree to give the Committee Stage by Friday.  I said&mdash;I am just giving my recollection of what I said&mdash;that there would be some Financial Resolutions dealing with a tariff already enforced. I said definitely that there would be no Second Reading but that there would be those Financial Resolutions. Deputy Doyle came back and said that provided there was nothing that would unduly delay the proceedings that was all right.  We agreed then not to sit on Tuesday.  This morning when I came in I went across to Deputy McGilligan and told him there were only five sitting days of the Dáil remaining in which this Finance Bill must be passed.  He was quite well aware of that fact when he said that the Minister knew nothing about it.  I take it for granted he listened to what I said.  He said it was our fault.  Whether it was our fault or not he knew that was the fact. I would not make an agreement with Deputy McGilligan because I know <Col N="411" /> he would not keep it.  The other people did.  Any time I made an agreement with Deputy Doyle or Deputy Hayes they tried to keep it.  On one occasion when dealing with the Estimates, I had made an agreement with Deputy Hayes just outside that we reach a certain stage, and Deputy McGilligan came along and said: &ldquo;That is too bad; I want to speak on this.  Anyway I will reserve it for the Appropriation Bill.&rdquo;  He walked straight in and upset the whole thing although he knew the agreement had been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to say that so far as the arrangements made for the week in connection with this Bill are concerned, what I understood from Deputy Boland, the Parliamentary Secretary, was that this Bill was to be taken on for the whole week, and that the Committee Stage was to be got through by 2 o'clock to-day.  The conditions, <Col N="412" /> I understood, were that no contentious Bill was to be introduced. Deputy Boland mentioned something about first readings, and I said the First Readings were to be accepted, but nothing more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest a way in which Deputy Boland can get out of these difficulties.  I know he is a busy man, but if on occasion he would approach those who represent the Independents, and communicate the matters to them, we would have that very desirable thing, an extra Imperial Chairman.  I must say the Chief Whip of the Government Party has got so busy now that he seldom, if ever, communicates with the Deputies on the Independent Benches.  I think it would be greatly to his own advantage if he did.</P>

    <P>The Dáil went into Committee.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendments in the name of Deputy Wolfe:</P>
    <P>177.  At the end of sub-section (3) (e), page 27, line 12, to add the words &ldquo;and the Court has recommended such cancellation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>178.  At the end of sub-section (3) (e), page 27, line 12, to add the words &ldquo;and the Court has certified that the offence is a serious one warranting cancellation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>179.  At the end of sub-section (3) (e), page 27, line 12, to add the words &ldquo;and the said conviction has not been appealed against, or, having been appealed against, has been confirmed on appeal.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>These three amendments have been put in.  Some of them are by way of being alternatives, but all apply to sub-section (3) (e) on page 27 of the section.  That is the section which deals with the appropriate Minister being enabled to alter or cancel a registration on various grounds that are stated.  I was pointing out last night that in the comparable section in an earlier part of the Bill relating to flour milling the words: &ldquo;he is satisfied,&rdquo; which make the Minister's decision the all-important one, are not made a necessary part of the conviction of an offence.  Whereas here we have the peculiar position in which the phrase with the overriding consideration with regard to any of these things is the expression of the Minister's satisfaction about certain things which he will determine or will say he is determining as matters of fact.  It is bad enough to have it that, ruled by the strict rules of evidence, a man may have his registration either altered or cancelled on being convicted of an offence under the Act&mdash;seeing that the offences are so numerous and seeing also that this alteration or cancellation might take place, if there had been a conviction, even though that conviction had been marked by the very slightest penalty which the court had prescribed&mdash;but it is worse to have it as it is here when the phrase &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo; governs the whole thing and when, consequently, the Minister's decision is the decision that is to rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is to amend that that Deputy Wolfe has moved that these matters must not merely come before a court but that the court, in addition, has either recommended the cancellation or has certified that the offence is a serious one warranting cancellation, and, thirdly, that the conviction has not been appealed against; in other words, that the offender has let it go by default or that, being appealed against, it has been confirmed on appeal.  The purpose of that third provision is, I suppose, that a person on being convicted and, recognising that the conviction might lead to the withdrawal, alteration or cancellation of his licence, would bring an appeal in order to get the importance of the matter declared and might urge against the confirmation on appeal by bringing in this as an additional point.  Amendment 179 of the three put down is the one that least appeals to me.  I would prefer to get this into the form in which the Control of Manufactures Act has it, that the registration may be cancelled or altered on conviction only if the conviction is for a serious offence under the Act, and cutting out these words &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo; because that <Col N="415" /> again will throw on the Minister the decision as to whether or not the offence for which the conviction had been secured was serious.  These words, I think, must go in any event.</P>
    <P>Supposing these words were out and this phrase could be got as near as possible to the phrase in the Control of Manufactures Act, namely, that registration could only be cancelled or altered if the conviction was for a serious offence under the Act, it would be in a better form.  The use of that particular phrase has not been moved but there has been moved instead that &ldquo;the court, having this matter brought before it, has recommended,&rdquo; and surely it is an advisable thing to have the plea made to the court whenever a conviction is being sought that one of the possible results of convicting for a small technical offence would inevitably be either alteration or cancellation of the licence?  A man should be entitled to ask the court to say whether in its judgment the cancellation should be recommended or not. If the court does not take the positive step of recommending the cancellation under the first of these amendments, then cancellation could not take place. The second one, which is slightly weaker, would be to have it in the form of the court certifying that the offence is serious and warranting cancellation, leaving the decision all the time to the appropriate Minister and having him act within these limitations that he should not act by way of trying to cancel or alter unless the court had recommended, or unless the court had certified that the offence was a serious one which warranted cancellation, and that, even after that, the Minister would be free to use his discretion in whatever way it suited him.</P>
    <P>The section, as it stands, is much worse than the one which deals with flour milling and considerably worse than the one in the Control of Manufactures Act.  It is completely inequitable that, simply because of a technical offence, of such a nature as that to which I referred yesterday&mdash;the failure to send in returns in the manner spoken of in Section 53, sub-section (3) &mdash;it should be open to the Minister, if he wished to get after particular <Col N="416" /> millers, to use the fact of conviction for that technical offence to alter or deprive the man of the registration he has got.  If there is to be any choice made as between these amendments I hope Deputy Wolfe will not try to insist on amendment 179 unless there is a junction of that with some one of the others.  Either amendment 178 or 177 would meet the purpose much better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to No. 179 the difficulty which I do not think Deputy McGilligan has seen is that, unless it is inserted, it takes away to some extent from an accused person the right of appeal, because a position might arise in which a man fined, and wrongly fined, in the District Court might appeal from the decision and, pending the appeal, the Minister would, if this Bill became law and if it passed both Houses&mdash;if it is then law which is, I submit, very doubtful&mdash;have the right of exercising his judicial function and, without giving the man an opportunity of pursuing his appeal, take away his licence.  That is what I object to.  I would like to point out to the Minister that he is up against another very serious difficulty in this case.  If this Bill or any other Bill is in contravention of the Constitution it is <i>ultra vires.</i>  If this Bill gives him a judicial function, as I suggest it does, he will some day find an enterprising litigant who will say that the Dáil has spent its week manufacturing waste paper.  It has been done before now and you will find on the Statute Book flagrant cases of breaches of the Constitution. They are there and it is open to anybody affected by them to move to have quashed a decision made <i>ultra vires.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The right of any subject under the Constitution is to go up and say &ldquo;This is a bad section made in excess of jurisdiction.&rdquo;  And if this section gives to the Minister a judicial function, which I respectfully submit it does, I think he will be up against a very grave difficulty by reason of which he will have, some day, to send his law officers down to the court to explain why it is not against the Constitution. The only thing in my amendment is to postpone execution, pending the hearing of the appeal, and, for that reason, <Col N="417" /> I suggest to the Minister that there can be no objection to it.  As regards the other amendments, they are alternatives, and I suggest that No. 177 will carry them out and will give an additional argument to the Minister in cases in which he might be impleaded by someone affected, when he will have to show that this entire section is not in contravention with the Constitution, because it gives him a judicial function which we have no right to give him or anybody else except the recognised courts of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I drew the attention of the Minister yesterday to an aspect of this situation, and that is that a great many citizens of this State do not want to be in the position of going hat in hand to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or to Deputy McGilligan, or whoever may be in the position of Minister, to ask for mercy.  Everyone should be in a position to go and demand justice.  Amendment 178 gives a defendant the right to make the case in court that whatever technical offence he has been charged with, it is not such a one as would warrant withdrawal of the licence.  If he loses on that contention, and if the court decides that he has been guilty of a serious breach of the law, the situation is entirely altered.  In justice, I think, from that point of view alone, we are entitled to press the Minister strongly to accept the amendment.  Everyone is entitled to that right and it will make the administration of the Act a great deal more difficult for the Minister if that right is not given.  So far as amendment 179 goes, if Deputy Wolfe says that the Minister would, in the interval between conviction and appeal, be entitled to withdraw a miller's licence, I would not dream of controverting what he said.  But I would be interested to hear what the Attorney-General has to say, if a person is convicted under the Act appeals, whether it would not be at the Minister's own peril if he withdrew a licence, and if he would not leave himself open to an action for damages in the event of the appeal court quashing the conviction. The Minister will readily discover <Col N="418" /> that by reference to his law officers.  On the other question I strongly press the Minister to reserve for every citizen the right to secure the protection of the court and to argue his case before a judge, and not at the bar of someone who constitutes prosecuting counsel and judge at the same time.  No such tribunal&mdash;and that is the tribunal that this Bill envisages &mdash;consisting of the Minister for Industry and Commerce acting as judge, although he has instituted the prosecution, would satisfy the ordinary sense of justice, and the Minister should give an opportunity of arguing before a court if it was a technical offence of which the person has been guilty or such a one as would warrant the Minister exercising the power to withdraw a licence.</P>

      <P>On the point mentioned by Deputy Wolfe, as to the possibility of some enterprising litigant appealing to the courts, that the section is extraconstitutional, I have only to say that enterprising litigants must have been conspicuous by their absence during the past eight or nine years, because that section is precisely similar to sections contained in every other Agricultural Produce Act introduced during that period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the general question I have to say that the Minister, advised by his Department, which is responsible for the administration of the Act, is much more competent to judge than any court, whether the circumstances which led to the conviction are sufficient to justify or to necessitate withdrawal of the licence. It is for the court to determine whether an offence under the Act has taken place.  I submit that the court has much less competence than the Minister to decide whether that offence is of such a nature, or the circumstances surrounding it are such that withdrawal of the licence should follow.  There is nothing done by this section which would necessitate any citizen looking for mercy where he would be entitled to demand justice. The Act was framed very largely for the protection of those who are <Col N="419" /> engaged, or who propose to engage, in any of the industries affected.  All the purposes of the Executive Council in relation to this Bill might conceivably be achieved by Finance Resolutions of one kind or another, but we decided to proceed by way of this Bill so as to give certain safeguards to the persons concerned and to de-limit their rights. Their rights are clearly safeguarded unless and until they are convicted of an offence under the Act.  If they are convicted it is a matter for consideration whether the licence should be withdrawn.  It is clearly inconceivable that a Minister responsible to the Dáil and to the public would withdraw a licence unless he felt certain that the circumstances were such that he would be able to defend his action in public subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Right through this Bill the powers of the Minister to determine what are offences, as well as the penalties for offences, are almost dictatorial.  The Minister has repeatedly quoted other Bills passed in this House within the last eight or ten years.  As another Deputy remarked it does not matter what this House passed eight or ten years ago, and if the Minister sees any objection to anything that was passed then he is not paying a great compliment to his own Party when it was in opposition. He stated that the Minister was much more competent than a court to determine what was the offence and what should be the penalty.  I deny that. That is one of the things we are anxious to safeguard against; that the Minister's competency is greater than the competency and the justice of the courts.  What we aim at, and what I tried to get during previous amendments, is a safeguard for those concerned in the Bill&mdash;the millers and the other people.  If there are to be penalties with, in some cases, imprisonment for grave offences, I want to secure that these persons will be taken to the courts and if convicted by the courts of an offence, the powers of the Minister in determining whether they are convicted of a technical offence or of a grave offence should be limited in some <Col N="420" /> manner.  Under a previous amendment I suggested that there should be a sub-section inserted providing that a person might be convicted of two offences before the Minister could take this grave course.  That amendment was defeated.  In this particular case I had a similar amendment down which I did not move, because I thought what I was aiming at would be better met by the amendment moved by Deputy Wolfe.  The Minister has not made in his defence of the original sub-section any greater claim than he made on the previous amendment that would change my mind as to the necessity for this amendment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wolfe said yesterday that as the section stood a man might have his registration interfered with and suffer major penalties, perhaps, for an offence that carried a sixpenny fine. That might happen and the man would have no redress under the section as it stands.  The Minister might do all the things that Section 59 says he may do if the man had been convicted of that offence carrying that small fine.  That is a power that no Minister or no Ministerial Department should have.  We here are not prepared to accept the dictum that a Minister has greater competence in determining penalties in this or any other Bill than the competence of the judges or justices of our courts.  That appears to be the dictum of the Minister, and if it is his dictum it is dangerous for this House to agree to it.  I hope that the Minister himself and the House will agree to one or other of the amendments in Deputy Wolfe's name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the answer he made to a previous question.  He said that once the defendant had been convicted of a breach or a technical breach of the regulations the Minister and the officials of his Department are better judges of the requisite penalty than the judge before whom the defendant appears.  Suppose the Minister knocks somebody down with his motor car to-morrow, and knocks, say, a button off the man's boot.  Suppose that the Minister is convicted of negligence in driving, will he refer <Col N="421" /> the question of damages to the injured person and let that person assess the damage?  The defendants in such cases will inevitably find phantom pains in their backs and neurasthenia and other mysterious diseases and that they cannot possibly go back to work for at least six months and that nothing less than £5,000 will compensate them for the damage they have suffered.  Is the claimant or the judge on the Bench the better judge in such a case?  Is it not the whole object of the defendant in such a case to see that it would not go to a judge on the Bench alone but that it be referred to a jury of twelve sensible men, who would laugh at the suggestion that the plaintiff should be allowed to assess the damages?  That is precisely what the Minister's argument amounts to. His claim is that once a miller is convicted of an offence, technical or otherwise, the offended party is much better able to decide the penalty than the judge on the Bench.  How can the Minister defend that?  I do not think that he can defend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that in this matter we are discussing questions closely related to the administration of the law and it seems to me that in discussing such a matter the Attorney-General at least should be present. Why is the Attorney-General not here this morning to defend the Government policy?  Is it because the Attorney-General, being an honoured member of the Bar and having some respect for the profession to which he belongs, feels that he could not stand up in this House and defend such a proposition? I think that that is the reason, and I doubt very much, if it went out from this House to-morrow, that the Attorney-General had stood up for this policy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that he would be widely briefed to defend persons who are sued for injuries resulting from negligence.  If the Attorney-General adopted the principle that once a defendant had been convicted of negligence the plaintiff should be allowed to assess the damages, I very much doubt whether he would get many briefs, and I suggest that the reason the Attorney-General is not here this <Col N="422" /> morning is because he knows that he could not defend the position of the Minister.  Furthermore, I suggest that whether Cumann na nGaedheal or anybody else ever advanced such theories in the past, the Minister ought not to advance them now, but rather, if such theories had been advanced in the past, that he should take the opportunity to scotch them now once and for all and mark the disapproval of this House of any attempt by any Minister to push the judges to one side and usurp the functions of the judiciary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's answer has raised a new series of points. He now brazenly says that he believes that he himself, and his Departmental officials&mdash;presumably he will pay the compliment similarly to the Minister for Agriculture and his Departmental officials&mdash;are more competent to decide whether a licence should be altered or withdrawn than any court.  That is so definitely his contention that it has got to be countered right away.  I think that it ought to be stated, as more nearly the general rule, that no Minister and the officials of his Department are better judges, generally speaking, of things in relation to offences under Acts and of the penalties that ought to flow by reason of convictions for offences under these Acts, than any judge.  It seems to me that even a judge of the District Court, who is used to taking evidence and to balancing fact or alleged fact as sworn to against another alleged fact as sworn to, and to making up his mind on the evidence put before him, amongst the welter of allegations&mdash;that he is a far better judge, generally having to make up his mind, as to where the truth lies&mdash;I make that reservation&mdash;than any Minister backed by any number of Departmental officials.  I hold that if we are going to get away from that point of view, it should only be after a good cause has been stated properly and has commended itself, after a reasonable discussion, to the two Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to take that phrase as used by the Minister in conjunction with another answer of his which he has given, not for the first time.  He said: &ldquo;It is inconceivable that a Minister, who has to defend himself in this House, <Col N="423" /> would do certain things.&rdquo;  My answer is what I have previously said that it ought to be impossible for these things to happen.  Let us look at some of the defences.  Let us look at the one given this morning&mdash;that the Department told him to do something.  Prior to this morning we would have thought it inconceivable that such a statement would have been made as a defence. Supposing the officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce bullied the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or the officials of the Department of Agriculture bullied the Minister for Agriculture, as they were both driven into this House under the lash this morning, on something which they had not had explained to them, is that to be considered a better judgment&mdash;the judgment the Minister is forced to stand over and which he states that he is forced to stand over&mdash;is that a better judgment than a court would give?  If the Minister did come in here and say in these circumstances that he was coerced by a court judgment, I think there would be much more sympathy felt for him under these circumstances than there was contempt for him under the circumstances outlined this morning.</P>
    <P>Let us add on to that the other sort of mental attitude that has been so clear right through the Bill.  How often have we heard the Minister say, when saying that it is inconceivable or just about to say that it is inconceivable, that a Minister would not do certain inconceivable things when he had to defend himself&mdash;either added to that phrase or as a preamble to it&mdash;that the Minister must have control or must have the last word, and that we cannot have people throwing a spanner into the delicately arranged mechanism that a Bill of this kind is?  In my opinion, the greatest spanner that was ever thrown in was the spanner thrown in in Section 6 when they declared that they could not get the explanation on which the whole Bill turns.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined here suspicions of quite a number of people, in fact a whole multitude of flour millers, flour importers, wheat importers, maize importers, <Col N="424" /> maize meal importers and distillers, and said that all&mdash; even named as such, except the last class referred to here&mdash;were enemies of the policy that is going to be carried out under this Bill. From that, of course, you have the Minister's point of view fairly well explained. He starts off with the view that a big section of the lay community is against this Bill and the policy enshrined in it, that most of the people who are to operate it are against it and that he is not going to have a spanner flung into the works, that he must have a straight run.  If there is a technical offence committed by one of these unfortunate people, then he can seize hold of that to oust somebody against whom his prejudice has been aroused by the feeling that he is against the whole business or that he has been actually doing something worse, that he has been acting in a way that in the Minister's view is tending to throw a spanner into the works. The Minister has even expressed disapproval of those who have ventured to criticise the scheme.  There will be a great many such people.</P>
    <P>Supposing an unfortunate maize miller whom the Minister for Agriculture has put on one of the advisory committees is going to speak out and tells him, as we understand from the Press a deputation already unanimously told him, that the business was unworkable.  Supposing he gets some maize miller that he has registered, on a deputation or on an advisory committee, telling him again that the scheme is unworkable and reminding him that he said it before.  What is the chance of mercy being shown to that miller afterwards if he fails to send in his return on the particular date and he is hauled before a court? The court says: &ldquo;We have got to find you guilty,&rdquo; and he is found guilty of a technical offence.  It is marked up against him and the Minister gets his chance against him.  The Minister says, of course, that it is inconceivable that he would act in that way.  The answer to that is that he should be fortified with a recommendation of the court that cancellation is a desirable thing or at least a declaration from <Col N="425" /> the court that the offence is serious and one that warrants cancellation.</P>
    <P>The Minister falls back on the usual defence of the previous Acts.  Deputy Dillon expressed his view of that last night in describing it as wrapping the Cumann na nGaedheal flag around him&mdash;the men who were erstwhile so independent.  There is another attitude of mind in it, the attitude of mind that can be best expressed by the phrase &ldquo;If Cumann na nGaedheal did this, what can you expect from poor fish like us?&rdquo;  I think it is more that inferiority complex that is urging to this than anything else.  But you do not get a good Bill by running through all the measures that Cumann na nGaedheal passed, particularly in the early stages, taking out the worst features of these Acts and packing them all together.  That would be getting something like the lowest common measure of what the Dáil has ever done and is not a desirable standard.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to make the counter, stressing it once more, that until we get at least all these measures explained, the effect of them, the withdrawal of the licences referred to, put in comparison with the effects of the cancellation or alteration of licences under this Bill, we do not know whether or not there is any equation between the circumstances or the measures.  It is no answer to the point made by Deputy Wolfe, on the possibility of this being unconstitutional to say that there must have been a dearth of enterprise amongst litigants in the past ten years. Deputy Wolfe's interjection to that was that there must have been.  A litigant becomes enterprising according to whether or not the deprivation put upon him is serious or slight. You may urge litigants or you may urge people who do not want to be litigious to move, to throw a spanner into the whole works of this measure, if you make such an unjust provision as this, entailing such serious consequences and putting the whole burden of the decision, not upon a Court where it should be, but upon <Col N="426" /> the Minister.  The Minister is always careful in these discussions to bring in his advisers.  They cannot be pleaded of course, afterwards.  There might have been unconstitutional things done in years past.  It is open to question whether these things were unconstitutional.  The fact that they have not been challenged in Court is no answer to the point whether they were unconstitutional or not.  It has not been pushed to that point but just a doubt raised.</P>
    <P>There is a greater danger of the point being challenged when it is raised in such a measure as this and when the effect of the withdrawal of a licence is going to be so serious to a man as this is.  I might, even if the other measures were brought forward again, prefer to amend them or move to amend them by taking out some of the provisions in them but I would have to relate the amendments which I proposed to the circumstances of the Bill, the penalties and other aspects of the measure.  In this section, far the most desirable thing is that paragraph (a) should be a matter of Court decision and paragraph (b), the one we are now discussing, should be completely a matter for the Court and the Court should limit or narrowly define the discretion the Minister has.  He should not be able to use the discretion he has whether or not to withdraw a licence, until the Court has recommended it or has guaranteed or certified that there has been a serious offence.  Then I think within these narrow limits he might operate his discretion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 183 and amendment 184:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (6) (b), line 39, to delete the words &ldquo;without notice&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;give notice of his intention to.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (6) (b), to delete all after the word &ldquo;them&rdquo; line 41, to the end of the paragraph and substitute the words &ldquo;and may thereafter, subject to the provisions of this section, cancel such registration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment 184 is consequential on 183.  Sub-section (6) (b) reads: &ldquo;If such person is registered in any register or registers kept by the Minister for Agriculture under this Part of this Act, that Minister may without notice cancel the registration of such person in such register or registers or any of them...&rdquo;  For the purpose of this Act registers are to be kept by wheat importers, wheat dealers, maize millers, maize importers or the manufacturers of compound feeding stuffs.  For a technical offence under this Act the Minister may not only remove an offender from the register of one particular trade, but he can remove him from the register of any other trade.  In amendment 183 I propose to delete the word &ldquo;without notice&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;give notice of his intention to.&rdquo;  Amendment 184 provides to delete all after the word &ldquo;them&rdquo; in line 41 and to substitute &ldquo;and may thereafter, subject to the provisions of this section, cancel such registration.&rdquo;  The amendment is a suggestion to limit the power of the Minister to extend, apparently to a much wider scope than that in which the offence was committed.  Before the <Col N="432" /> Minister should have power to remove a man from the register of maize millers the man should be convicted of an offence as a maize miller and not of an offence, say, as a wheat importer. If it is decided that his name is to be removed from the register of wheat dealers it should not be in the power of the Minister to remove his name from all the other registers; it should not be in the Minister's power to remove him from the register of wheat importers, maize millers, maize importers or manufacturers of feeding stuffs unless he has committed an offence as wheat importer, maize miller, maize importer or manufacturer of feeding stuffs.</P>

    <P>If such person is registered in any register or registers kept by the <Col N="433" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce under this Part of this Act, that Minister may without notice cancel the registration of such person in such register or registers or any of them and may thereafter refuse to register such person in any register kept by him under this Part of this Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are alternative ways of dealing with this obnoxious sub-section.  To me it does not seem a good answer to point out that the Deputy should have moved the deletion of (6).  There are alternatives. Deputy Dillon's idea was to weaken sub-section (6); Deputy Wolfe objects to the whole idea and he moves to take out sub-section (7).  There is a great deal to be said for taking out sub-section (7).  Some of these people are going to be registered in different registers.  Under Section 43 some of these registers are under the control of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but the registration with regard to flour and meal is under another section.  The Minister for Agriculture is going to have control over the registers dealing with wheat importers, wheat dealers, wheat growers, maize millers, maize importers and manufacturers of compound feeding stuffs. There is a general provision under Section 59 (3) that the registration may be altered or cancelled for various reasons.  The Government, however, have not been pleased enough with their powers under that and they go <Col N="434" /> and take powers to cancel registration on the vague grounds stated in sub-section (3) of Section 59.  Under Section 59 (3) the Minister may cancel the registration if the registration was procured through fraud or misrepresentation whether fraudulent or innocent or because the person registered has ceased to carry on the business.</P>
      <P>Let us take a concrete case.  Under an earlier section the same individual may get registered as a maize importer and he may get registered as a maize miller and also as a manufacturer of compound feeding-stuffs.  The Minister decides in his wisdom that the entry on the register of maize importers has been procured by misrepresentation. He therefore can wipe out that registration and, although he cannot say that the registration in the capacity of a maize miller or as a manufacturer of compound feeding-stuffs was also procured by misrepresentation or fraud, he can nevertheless proceed to wipe him off these two registers.  Apply that concrete case to (b).  A man gets registered in the three registers.  He ceases to be a maize importer and because he ceases to be a maize importer, under this section he can be wiped automatically, at the Minister's discretion, off the register of maize millers or off the register of manufacturers of compound feeding-stuffs.</P>
      <P>Supposing this person represents a company and that the company is running separate businesses, one as a maize miller and the second as a maize importer.  Suppose he is not able to meet his financial obligations as a maize miller and is adjudicated a bankrupt. Although the company is solvent so far as its other business is concerned, the Minister may nevertheless wipe it off the other register.  What is the sense in doing that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of the individual who obtains the three registrations and who fails to send in the proper returns in relation to his manufacture of compound feeding stuffs.  Because of his failure the Minister can wipe him off the register of maize millers and maize importers automatically, and &ldquo;thereafter may refuse to register such person <Col N="435" /> in any register kept by him.&rdquo;  Because a person fails in a very technical way or has been convicted of the offence of not sending in returns in the proper time as a manufacturer of compound feeding-stuffs, why should the penalty flow over to the person who has kept faith with the Ministry and who has been in time with his records, being registered in the other two capacities? There is no reason for the section. This is purely bureaucracy run mad.  It is again the idea that the Minister must have the last word.  He is afraid, apparently, that there will be spanners thrown into the works and, therefore, he must take all these powers, no matter how inequitably they may be used.</P>
    <P>The amendment moved by Deputy Dillon would be some improvement&mdash; and this is a Bill that could be improved in many ways&mdash;but to my mind the more radical amendment, which seeks to wipe out the sub-section, is the better one.  The Minister is not deprived of the powers he ordinarily should get.  If the person registered in the three registers is to be attacked in regard to each of the separate registrations it ought to be when he is proved guilty of fraud or misrepresentation <Col N="436" /> in regard to each, or has been adjudicated a bankrupt in regard to each, or has been convicted of an offence in regard to whatever one is to be attacked.  There is no reason why a penalty should flow over, particularly when the same individual is concerned.  And all this can be done for the most trivial offence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this amendment is preferable to Deputy Dillon's amendment.  There has been a good deal of discussion already about cancelling the registration.  This section proposes to penalise a person for an offence in respect of a particular register. A company carrying on several businesses might be penalised in respect of them all because of a very trivial offence on one registration. Except that it gives the Minister certain powers, there appears to me to be no object at all for sub-section (7).  It does not lend itself to the amendment very much.  I think its deletion is more essential than anything else.  This section gives extravagant powers to both Ministers, and I do not think the House should stand for giving such dictatorial powers to any Minister.</P>
      <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand part.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, certain amendments were put down but were not moved.  One was an amendment by Deputy Wolfe which suggested a change in sub-section (7) rather than the deletion of it.  That was to limit the discretion of the Minister with regard to the alteration or cancellation of registration in a register other than the main one&mdash;other than the one in relation to which an offence had been committed or about which a charge had been made and considered proven, that it had been procured by fraud or misrepresentation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea which, apparently, underlay the amendment was that the Minister might have this power to operate upon a person who was registered, say, in three registers, but only if the person had been convicted of anything arising under paragraph (e) of sub-section (3).  In other words, if you had the individual I spoke of previously carrying on three different types of business and, therefore, under this Act, obliged to register in three different registers, the Minister would not be allowed, on finding him guilty of something which enabled him to take one of these registers from him, to remove him from the other two excepting only it is a reason which causes removal from the main register&mdash;the register attacked&mdash;or that he had been convicted of an offence.  So that if this person who is on three registers was regarded by the Minister as, and therefore convicted of, having procured his entry on one register by mispresentation, the Minister could not proceed to operate against that individual's registration of any other business except in relation to an offence brought before a court and a conviction.  That, <Col N="439" /> of course, read in conjunction with the earlier amendments 176, 177, 178, 179, where removal from one register would only have been possible on a conviction obtained twice, or a conviction obtained, and the court having recommended a cancellation; or, on the other point set out in the two other amendments, would have been much more rigid and much more reasonable.  The other amendments down to sub-section (7) had intended to modify this in a variety of ways, some of which have been suggested for sub-section (6).  I suggest that the whole section is definitely spoiled and made permanently a bad one by reason of the fact that these amendments were not given consideration or were not accepted by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Section 59, as it now stands, has got to be looked upon as a whole.  The Minister takes power to himself to alter or cancel a registration if the person applies.  He refuses to change that. He refuses to have it so put that he must cancel the registration of a person who applies to have it cancelled. He, therefore, takes power to keep a person on the register who does not want to be on it, and being kept on the register means that a person is subject to penalties for not milling the proper quota, for not making returns in the proper form, or for not making them in the proper time, although he wants, and has expressed the desire, to get clean out of the business.  That is the first thing that comes out of the section.</P>
    <P>The second thing is that the Minister takes power to himself alone, and has refused amendments which in any way limit the power, to correct the register where it is misleading or erroneous. Suggestions have been made that the correction of an error should only be done after notice to the person who is alleged to have made an erroneous entry, and after his agreement had been obtained to the change.  Again that was refused.  Under the first sub-section the Minister takes power to keep on the register a man who does not want to be in the business and can keep him on during the currency of the licence.  We are told previously that <Col N="440" /> there is no time limit to be put on this licence, so that if a man goes into any of these businesses, like dealing with home-grown wheat, milling wheat, milling maize, or any of the other things, he can be kept at it at the Minister's desire, whether he wishes to continue or not.  The entry that he has made previously when going on&mdash;it might be a very important matter for him&mdash;may be changed by the Minister and there is no appeal from him.  If the entry is erroneous or misleading, the man is tied, on the impact on sub-section (1) of sub-section (2) as long as the Minister keeps him tied, to the register, and to entries which he may think a complete mis-description of himself and his premises.  The third thing gets to the point about the man who wants to stay on and whom the Minister wants to put off.</P>
    <P>Under a combination of sub-sections (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) the Minister can operate in this way.  The Minister arrogates to himself the ability to determine whether an entry has been secured by fraud or misrepresentation and, exercising that assumed judicial capacity, he can put a person off the register.  He can then do what looks innocuous as it appears in sub-section (3) (b), put any person off the register if he has ceased to carry on the business in respect of which he is registered.  He can do what appears innocuous in (c), and he can do what appears innocuous in (d); he can take a person off the register if that person has been adjudicated bankrupt.  These harmless items assume another complexion when we see how they are tied up in sub-sections (6) and (7).  Finally, he can take a person off the register if he is satisfied that the person registered has been convicted of an offence under the Act, no matter how slight, and no matter how small the penalty; whether, in fact, there has been a conviction or not if, on whatever evidence he requires to be brought before him, he feels he has enough to satisfy himself that there has been a conviction for an offence under the Act.  The courts, where you have people of a judicial capacity appointed, for that reason generally lay down regulations for themselves as to how evidence of convictions is to be brought before them.  In order to avoid any <Col N="441" /> error, there are rules laid down, which must be complied with, as to how notice of a conviction is to be given under the seal of certain people.  There are certain formalities to be attended to.  There is none of that here.  If the Minister is satisfied that there has been a conviction, apart from the other point, he has to make up his mind whether there ought to have been a conviction, or, if he is not going to pass any judgment on that, whether the offence committed is serious enough to warrant the withdrawal or alteration of the registration.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (4) sets out the machinery Before doing any of these things, there has to be notice given to the person about to be affected.  If the person likes to make representations, those representations must be considered. Finally, on an amendment which was moved, and which was not in the Bill originally, he may have an inquiry if he thinks fit, and he must, under the amendment moved, have it if the person demands it.  Even after the inquiry has been held, these facts are not going to be made known to the House.  They are all hidden away with the Minister and his Department and he operates upon information that the House will not have, presumably, information that will be refused to it, if he likes, on an occasion that it happens to become aware of, on the ground that it would not be in the public interest to reveal the evidence elicited at the inquiry.</P>
    <P>I spoke of the things that looked to be harmless in sub-section (3) (b) and (d).  Then we come to these two amazing paragraphs, (6) and (7).  Then we have the matter that I referred to before&mdash;the case of a person who is registered in three registers.  He has done that because he is obliged to do it under this Bill.  He happens to be in three separate businesses.  The State, by passing this Bill, now imposes on him the obligation that before he can conduct business in any of these three lines he has got to register.  It puts his head into a noose from which he may not be able to withdraw.  He sends in a description of his business and particulars he wants to have registered, and the Minister may <Col N="442" /> change these on the grounds that they are erroneous or misleading.  After all that, when he has got himself registered on the three registers, if he has ceased to carry on the business in which he is registered in one of them, the appropriate Minister may wipe him out of the other two.  Why should it not be that he will be taken off each register as he ceases to carry on the business for which he is registered in that register?</P>
    <P>The same considerations apply with regard to (d), although the point there is not so clear and will not so often arise.  You may have a company interested in three different types of business, with separate capital and separate commitments in each.  If it fails to meet its obligations in one, and remains financially sound in the other two, because it has gone bad in one type of business the Minister takes power to take it off all three registers. If a person, who is registered in three separate registers, is convicted of some slight technical offence in regard to one of them, the Minister takes power to remove him from the other two, although he may be able to get a certificate from the Minister that he has made returns in good time on the other two.  The Minister takes power further to refuse to register such person thereafter in any register that he keeps.  It is quite possible, if the present economic war develops, that a large number of persons who are registered in some of these registers will go bankrupt.  Quite a number of the population are getting that way at the moment.  Supposing then, because of a situation that the Government has brought about, people find their business collapsing around them, is the Minister going to be enabled to hold that against them thereafter, and refuse to enter them on any register when the situation has improved, and when the people again think fit to be enterprising and to put money into business?</P>
    <P>There is no justification for these absurdly large powers.  There is no reason in a Bill of this sort, which may take a man's livelihood from him. There is no reason why such matters as fraud and misrepresentation should <Col N="443" /> not be left to the only people fit to judge them&mdash;people with judicial capacity. There is no reason why, because a man ceases to carry on one of the businesses for which he has got registration, he should be put out of the other businesses in which he has secured his registration.  There is no reason whatever why it should be left to the Minister to decide whether in fact there has been a conviction for an offence, and&mdash;even if that technical point has been got over&mdash;whether the offence is substantial enough to justify his taking him off one register, which includes the right to take him off every register and the right to refuse to allow him to enter in any register thereafter.</P>
    <P>The section as drafted is one of the wildest in the Bill, and when one comes to consider some other points in it there will be some realisation of the strength of that statement.  It is one of the wildest sections in a completely wild Bill, right from the start.  There is no great substance in it; there is no great hope in it; there is a lot of imagination in it.  Even the attempt to work the Bill has now apparently broken down, because of what the Minister discovered and announced to this House as early as the sixth Section, that he saw no way of getting a definition to determine what is millable wheat and how it may be classified as against non-millable wheat.  I object to the whole section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the fact that it was necessary to introduce a section of this kind, imposing as it does such very drastic penalties, is a sign of the inherent weakness of the whole Bill.  The only justification I can see for the introduction of the drastic penalties imposed under this particular section is the fact that the Minister anticipates a certain amount of noncompliance with the terms of the Bill. I can quite understand that there would be a desire certainly on the part of many millers in the country to avoid, if possible, carrying out the provisions of this Bill, because, as business men, they must recognise that in many respects, it is almost impossible, and that certainly it is not calculated to help <Col N="444" /> either the business of milling in this country, or to help the class of people for whom the millers do business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I say that, because a man may lose his licence, even on a trivial technical point, under one register, it is not proper that his licence on the the other registers should be cancelled or withdrawn as well.  That seems to be an outrageous procedure, and whilst the Minister states that this section is to a certain extent based on sections in Acts passed by the previous Government, the circumstances under which these Acts were introduced are quite different to the circumstances relating to the introduction of this particular Bill, and the problem which the Eggs Act had to deal with is quite a different problem to the one which this Bill is dealing with.  I do not see that, in any event at the present time, the Minister would be at all justified in taking this section out of the Eggs Act&mdash;I am taking the Minister's word that such a section does exist in the Eggs Act&mdash; and putting it into a Bill of this kind dealing with a specified industry&mdash;an industry which the Minister himself admits is run at the present time on very efficient lines and which, if allowed to operate freely, would undoubtedly in time be more efficient still.  It appears to me that, in the Minister's own interest, he should relieve himself of the powers which he proposes to assume under this particular section.  I can visualise the amount of trouble and the amount of annoyance that will be caused to the Minister himself and to his officials in the carrying out of the provisions of this particular section.  I can easily visualise the case of a miller who is threatened with the withdrawal of his licence resorting to all sorts of political influences in order to secure that the Minister may allow him to continue his licence.  I can also visualise the case of the official who is acting under the authority of the Minister, and who will be responsible for reporting, I assume, to the Minister the circumstances which would justify him in either withdrawing or cancelling the licence or registration of a particular mill.  I can quite understand the position <Col N="445" /> that that official would be placed in.  I am not suggesting for a moment that the officials are not a perfectly honourable body of men&mdash;I know from my own experience of officials that they are.  But an official acting in the capacity imposed on him by this particular Bill, and particularly by this particular section of the Bill, and having perhaps to report to the Minister that in his opinion the registration should either be cancelled or withdrawn, or that the licence should be either cancelled or withdrawn, giving his reasons, the Minister can rest assured that all sorts of pressure and all sorts of influence will be brought to bear on that official to minimise his report as much as possible, and to refrain&mdash;if I might put it in that way&mdash;from carrying out his duties in the way in which the Minister, under this Bill, requires him to carry them out.</P>
    <P>In the first place, the official is placed in a rather peculiar position. I am quite satisfied that any official acting under the Minister will carry out his duties&mdash;will endeavour, at any rate, to carry out the duties in the way in which officials are carrying them <Col N="446" /> out at the present time.  The Minister himself will undoubtedly be bombarded by all sorts of people to secure the retention of the registration for a particular mill or for a particular miller. First of all, for the purpose of relieving the Minister himself of such pressure, and giving the millers and the people engaged in the milling business of this country to understand that this Bill when it does become law will be administered fairly, squarely and impartially, I think it should be left to a court to determine whether the circumstances which may arise in connection with the management of a particular mill justify him in the withdrawal or cancellation of registration. I am certain also, if the Minister would agree to leave it to the court to decide whether the circumstances justify the withdrawal or cancellation of a licence, that this Bill would be much more acceptable to the millers in the country, and that as a consequence of a gesture of this kind he would receive their co-operation in carrying out the other clauses of this Bill, drastic though they may be in many respects.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not give any explanation on Second Reading of what is the vital portion of the Bill, namely the standard price he fixes in the schedule. I think he said that whereas a couple of years ago 30/- was put forward as a reasonable price at which wheat could be sold and grown economically per barrel of 20 stones, he thought that, owing to changes that had taken place in the meanwhile, into which he did not go, that 25/-, or as the case may be, in certain seasons of the year, 23/-, would be sufficient.  He did not make any attempt, beyond a mere statement on his part, to explain why the cost of growing wheat had fallen so to speak from what was looked on then&mdash;I think it was in 1927&mdash;as a reasonable price of 30/- to 25/- or whether the overhead expenses of the farmer, cost of labour, and various other circumstances had fallen. The opportunity did not arise on the conclusion of the Second Stage because he did not reply.  There were a number of questions raised on the <Col N="449" /> Second Stage to which for obvious reasons he did not reply&mdash;because he moved the closure.  But a great deal of the practical working of this Bill will, of course, depend on the fair, reasonable accuracy of the amounts put down in the Second Schedule.  As to how the Government arrives at these particular figures, we have absolutely no information before us.</P>

    <P>(2)  Subject to the provisions of this section, the Minister may from time to time by order declare that, where in any specified cereal year a person disposes of home-grown millable wheat which is less in amount than the minimum amount fixed in relation to such year by such order, no wheat bounty shall be payable in respect of any such wheat, and whenever any order is made under this sub-section in relation to a cereal year and is in force, <Col N="454" /> the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say, where a person in such cereal year disposes of home-grown millable wheat which is less in amount than the minimum amount fixed by such order, no wheat bounty shall be paid in respect of any of such wheat.</P>

    <P>(a)  where a person in such cereal year disposes of home-grown millable wheat (in this sub-section referred to as the year's crop) which exceeds in quantity the maximum amount (in this sub-section referred to as the maximum) fixed by such order, wheat bounty, if payable to such person, shall be paid only on so much of the year's crop as does not exceed the maximum;</P>
    <P>(b)  where the year's crop is disposed of in two sale (wheat) seasons of such cereal year, the following provisions shall have effect in relation to the amount of the year's crop upon which wheat bounty, if payable to such person, is to be paid and the rate or rates thereof, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  if the amount of the year's crop disposed of in the earlier sale (wheat) season of such cereal year exceeds the maximum, wheat bounty, at the rate appropriate to such sale (wheat) season, shall be paid only on so much thereof as does not exceed the maximum, and no wheat bounty shall be paid on the remainder of the year's crop,</P>
    <P>(ii)  if the amount of the year's crop disposed of in such earlier <Col N="455" /> sale (wheat) season equals the maximum, wheat bounty, at the rate appropriate to such season, shall be paid only on that amount, and no wheat bounty shall be paid on the remainder of the year's crop,</P>
    <P>(iii)  if the amount of the year's crop disposed of in such earlier sale (wheat) season is less than the maximum, wheat bounty, at the rate appropriate to such sale (wheat) season, shall be paid on that amount, and wheat bounty, at the rate appropriate to the other sale (wheat) season of such cereal year, shall be paid only on so much of the year's crop disposed of in such earlier sale (wheat) season as, with the amount of the year's crop disposed of in such earlier sale (wheat) season, does not exceed the maximum;</P>
    <P>(c)  where the year's crop is disposed of in the three sale (wheat) seasons of such cereal year, the following provisions shall have effect in relation to the amount of the year's crop upon which wheat bounty, if payable to such person, is to be paid, and the rate or rates thereof, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  if the amount of the year's crop disposed of in the first sale (wheat) season of such cereal year exceeds the maximum, wheat bounty, at the rate appropriate to such first sale (wheat) season, shall be paid only on so much thereof as does not exceed the maximum, and no wheat bounty shall be paid on the remainder of the year's crop,</P>
    <P>(ii)  if the amount of the year's crop disposed of in such first sale (wheat) season equals the maximum, wheat bounty, at the rate appropriate to such first sale (wheat) season, shall be paid on that amount, and no wheat bounty shall be paid on the remainder of the year's crop,</P>

    <P>I.  wheat bounty, at the rate appropriate to such first sale (wheat) season, shall be paid on that amount, and</P>
    <P>II.  wheat bounty, at the rate appropriate to the second sale (wheat) season of such cereal year, shall be paid on so much of the year's crop disposed of in such second sale (wheat) season as, with the part of the year's crop disposed of in such first sale (wheat) season, does not exceed the maximum,</P>
    <P>III.  in case the amount of the year's crop disposed of in such first and second sale (wheat) seasons upon which bounty is payable under the preceding provisions of this sub-paragraph equals or exceeds the maximum, no wheat bounty shall be paid on the remainder of the year's crop,</P>
    <P>IV.  in case the amount of the year's crop disposed of in such first and second sale (wheat) seasons is less than the maximum, wheat bounty, at the rate appropriate to the third sale (wheat) season of such cereal year, shall be paid on so much of the year's crop disposed of in such third sale (wheat) season as, with the amounts disposed of in such first and second sale (wheat) seasons does not exceed the maximum.</P>

      <P>It seems to me to be a considerable improvement on any provision made outside the realms of the Shah of Persia.  (Sub-section (2) read). This is a sub-section following a pious sub-section (1) giving the right to go to court and the money will not be taken until the case is proved in court.  Sub-section (2) points out how he is to take his case to court, and the judge is promptly coerced to decide the case in his favour.  I think it is bad to supersede the courts of this country by turning the procedure into a joke, as I think happens.  To tell a man that if he wants to recover something he can go to court is a joke here.  What is the use of giving the right to take civil proceedings if the Minister may by statute pre-judge the issue?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and if it was discovered that he was not entitled to the bounty, it would be difficult for the <Col N="458" /> Minister to prove that he was entitled to the bounty for something which purported to be given for millable wheat. The section leaves the farming community, so to speak, suspended in the air.  They do not know where they are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish this matter to pass.  Am I exaggerating when I say that sub-section (1) is reduced to a farce by sub-section (2)?  It merely means not only will the Minister recover from the miller the amount overpaid, but he will also saddle him with costs.  There is no use in putting the miller to costs.  It would be better for the Minister to go and to grab the subsidy.  This section means that he is going to be brought to court and put to costs by simply producing his sign manual.  Neither judge nor jury can enquire.  Is that so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister for Industry and Commerce states, this is the usual form.  All the Minister does is to certify from the records.  A copy of the certificate is sent from the flour mill and from the persons claiming the bounty, and if they do not correspond the Minister's certificate is conclusive evidence.  It would be very difficult to have it otherwise.  It would mean that several people would have to come along as witnesses and that books and documents would have to be brought. I think this is a very simple matter.  It may not be very simple to the people opposite&mdash;they may find a difficulty to understand it&mdash;but if the certificates are sent up I think Deputy Dillon will understand the position.  If certificates are sent up from the miller, we expect to get a copy of these from the persons claiming the bounty.  If they do not correspond, the Minister certifies that they do not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The sub-section says merely that &ldquo;in any proceedings a certificate in writing signed by the Minister, stating that a person has obtained a payment... and that <Col N="459" /> such person was not entitled to such payment or to a specified part thereof, shall be conclusive evidence.&rdquo;  From that it is plain that no other evidence, documentary or otherwise, is introduced at all.  There is no crossexamination of the records, no review of the alleged facts.  The Minister can simply walk into the witness-box&mdash;in fact, he does not have to appear at all &mdash;and say that a certain document signed by himself, Exhibit A, shall be conclusive evidence of those matters as stated in his certificate, and that finishes the whole thing.  The judge is bound to find that what is contained in the Minister's allegation is, in fact, the fact.  Suppose, on the other hand, that sub-section (1) stands alone. Under that sub-section, if it is found that a person has obtained payment to which, or to part of which, he was not lawfully entitled, the Minister institutes civil proceedings to recover from the particular miller the amount in excess of what he is properly entitled to.  The Minister goes into court and sues that man, and it is for the miller to prove that he did not receive that payment or that excess payment and that the Minister is under a misapprehension.  But here, in sub-section (2), he has no such recourse at all.  The moment Exhibit A goes in, there is nothing further to be said.  I do not want the Minister to do anything until he has had an opportunity of consulting with the Attorney-General or his other legal advisers, but I would ask him to hold this over for the Report Stage until he has consulted with his legal advisers on the matter.</P>

      <P>Before leaving that section, I should like to know has the Minister examined the question of what is commonly known as Golden Meal, which is maize meal used for human consumption?  Does the Minister think it reasonable to say that no distributor of maize meal in this form can purchase it in large quantities?  He must pay the licensed price?  The ordinary practice is that this meal is bought in cwt. bags, that is, this meal called Golden Meal which is used for human consumption, and it is then packed in quarter stones and half stones for retail distribution.  Under this section I take it that the licensed miller must pack this meal in packages not exceeding one stone in weight, which will increase the cost enormously.  Will the Minister consider sub-head 3 of sub-section (a) of Section 77 and see if it would interfere with the administration of the Act to allow this Golden Meal to be sold <Col N="462" /> in sealed packages of more than a stone weight?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On that section it is permissible for the Minister to prescribe by statute that the maize miller cannot sell any maize meal mixture containing more than the prescribed percentage of moisture or more than the prescribed percentage of fibre.  If the Minister can do that kind of thing without interfering with the trade or without making the carrying on of the trade impossible, why cannot he take a step forward and say that no maize meal mixture can be sold from which the natural oil has been extracted? One of the most valuable kinds of maize meal is that from which the natural oil has not been extracted. The distributors of one particular brand of meal use that as an advertisement. I can quite see that a restriction of that kind might make it very difficult for the trader, but if it is feasible in the one case of the percentage of moisture or fibre, I think that it is far more important that there should be restriction in this matter of the extraction of the natural oils.  I suggest that if, after inquiring into it, the Minister is satisfied that the trade is able to carry on under the restrictions in the one case, it should be possible for them to carry on with this further and very important restriction.</P>

      <P>I desire to make what may be a despairing protest against the principle contained in this section, a principle introduced by Deputy McGilligan when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce and which permitted the Government to launch into every conceivable kind of business enterprise.  In that way he erected the extraordinary structure of the Electricity Supply Board which is neither a Government Department nor anything else, but which has a kind of suspended existence, a structure which involves the State in unlimited and strange liabilities and yet denies the State the necessary control which it should have over it.  Another similar structure was the Dairy Disposals Board, the finances <Col N="467" /> of which, as far as I have been able to find out, cannot be inquired into by this Dáil at all on the grounds of public policy.  I do not quite know what form the Minister for Industry and Commerce will follow when he proceeds to purchase plant, machinery and equipment or whether there will be another strange creature created&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I can well understand the Minister loudly lamenting that under this section he has no machinery to carry out the purpose or the underlying spirit of the Act, but does he propose to create another monster which will out Joseph Rank?  If I had to choose between a monopoly by Joseph Rank and a monopoly by an Irish Government I confess that I would prefer a monopoly by an Irish Government, but I think the principle is detestable.  I think the Minister agrees with that.  As far as I can see under Section 94 the Minister provides himself with powers for taking over as a monopoly the flour milling industry in this country.  Why?  He can purchase plant, machinery and equipment, in fact, do everything that a milling corporation would be able to do. Under this section the Minister may come in and say &ldquo;I have got to invent a Flour Milling Supply Board which will have seven directors who are responsible to me.&rdquo;  They are responsible to him so long as he wants them to be responsible to him, but when the Dáil wants to make them responsible to it they are not responsible.  Can he not create any kind of body he likes in order to facilitate him in carrying on the milling industry in this country?  He can do &ldquo;all such other acts and things that he may consider necessary for the carrying on of such business as a commercial undertaking.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Bounties will be payable to breeders as well as to others who export dead turkeys or other dead poultry, subject only to the condition that the poultry is exported in standard packages approved by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Packages considered to be standard are those (of which there should be a plentiful supply) constructed according to the specifications set out in the memorandum which has been freely circulated to the trade, and to box makers in this, as in previous years. Rigid adherence to the specifications will not be insisted on, and where cases generally approximating to the standard are used, there will, as a rule, be no delay in payment of claims for the appropriate bounty, i.e. 4d. per lb. for turkeys and 2d. per lb. for other poultry.  Where, however, poultry is exported in cases which though otherwise suitable vary from the specifications to any marked degree, claims for bounty will require to be supported by documentary evidence of the net weight of the consignment and payment of claims will thus, of necessity, be delayed.  In no circumstances will bounty be paid on poultry exported in hampers, tea chests, sacks, soap boxes, or other unsuitable receptacles, or through the <Col N="392" /> parcels post; and the bounty may be reduced or refused on any consignment reported to be improperly packed, as, for example, with straw or in dirty or second-hand cases.</P>
