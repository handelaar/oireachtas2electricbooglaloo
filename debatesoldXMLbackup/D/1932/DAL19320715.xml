      <P>I beg to move the motion which stands on the Order Paper and which provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the business of the Dáil at its sitting on Friday, July 15th, 1932, shall be proceeded with as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  In the case of the Emergency Imposition of Duties Bill, 1932&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  The Second Stage (<i>resumed</i>) of the Bill shall be the first Order <Col N="1091" /> of the day, and the proceedings on that stage, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1 p.m. on the said day by putting from the Chair forthwith the Question, that the Bill be now read a Second Time, and after the said hour no Question shall be put from the Chair on any amendment to the motion for Second Reading.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The Committee Stage of the Bill shall be proceeded with immediately upon the conclusion of the Second Stage, and the questions necessary to bring to a conclusion the proceedings in Committee on the Bill shall be put forthwith and successively, and shall be decided without amendment or debate.</P>
    <P>(iii)  The Fourth Stage of the Bill shall be proceeded with immediately upon the conclusion of the Committee Stage, and the Question necessary to bring to a conclusion the proceedings on the Fourth Stage shall be put forthwith and shall be decided without amendment or debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion that the Minister desires to move refers to three separate and distinct things.  Is there any precedent for a motion like that?</P>

      <P>In view of the consequences that might ensure from delay, I am of opinion that there is urgency in the matter.  I have been so assured by responsible Ministers and being so assured&mdash;I am not the judge of urgency&mdash;I am prepared to accept the motion and submit it to the House for decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask is there any precedent for the guillotine motion which contains three separate things, one, the Emergency Imposition of Duties Bill, 1932; (2), the Finance (Customs Duties) (No. 2) Bill, 1932, and (3) the motion for the adjournment? Would the Minister tell us what the urgency is about in all three?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me or for any other person to labour the urgency of that part of the motion which deals with the Emergency Imposition of Duties Bill, 1932.  As I said yesterday, our trade has already been attacked and I do not think any Party in the House is prepared to stand up and say that the Government are to be left powerless to make a defence against that <Col N="1093" /> attack.  As regards Part II of the Motion, the Seanad adjourned on Wednesday without having concluded the proceedings of the Finance (Customs Duties) (No. 2) Bill, 1932, and a special meeting of the Seanad is being called to conclude the business this morning. As the Bill must become law and as it is desirable to avoid recalling the Dáil on Monday in order that the Bill should become law, that Bill becomes a matter of urgency also.</P>

      <P>Would not this Bill fall to be considered to-day in any event?  As a matter of fact I do not wish to say anything about the other House and I am not going to.  They are taking steps to-day to rectify their mistakes, and the only thing we want to know is whether the Opposition in this House are in the position that they are going to hold up the financial business of this House and whether they want to come back here on next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday?  It is they have been clamouring for the adjournment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The urgency of the Finance (Customs Duties) (No. 2) Bill arises from the neglect of the Executive Council, that first of all in the other House they did not transact their business properly and now they find themselves having to do it like this.  I have personally no objection to this but I submit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Government in the last couple of <Col N="1094" /> months has bitten off more than it can chew.  It has tried to do business during the last two or three months without exactly knowing where it was going.  The position is that with regard to that particular matter, the Finance (Customs) (No. 2) Bill, the ordinary Finance Bill and the Butter Bill, one of these measures was quite sufficient for an inexperienced Ministry such as that to deal with. They imposed various tariffs, made certain alterations without having kept their eye upon the business that was to be transacted, and at the present moment they had in order to put all these extraordinary measures through, to get the Seanad to meet and this House to meet with a notice of motion such as is before us, in order that the laws passed by the State would not be brought into disrepute. They have dragged the administration through the mud.  They are covered with the slime of their own making&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether the Deputy heard it before or not he has got to admit that it is true.  There is nothing but incompetence stamped upon what the Government has done.  Nothing. The two Houses have got to be assembled to-day and we have got to have a time limit in regard to it in order that the Minister for Finance shall not be brought before the court for collecting moneys to which he is not entitled.</P>

      <P>Precisely, but not without notice.  But I am speaking now about financial matters.  I am exposing the incompetency of the Minister for introducing into this House a measure which he had to amend with <Col N="1095" /> such a number of amendments as the Minister for Finance knows.  It just so happens that if the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance had not happened to have turned his coat&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>And that there shall be no debate upon the Committee Stage of it and no debate upon the Report Stage.  That is the position in respect of this Bill, introduced here into the House yesterday at a time when the President was in the precincts of this House but did not come in to the House to explain what was going to be done under this measure, nor what policy was being pursued by the proposed application of this measure. This is being done in circumstances in which we have had no single word of explanation from any Minister on the far side as to what is the meaning of any particular section or sub-section or bit of a sub-section in this <Col N="1096" /> Motion.  We are going to pass this measure, which gives absolute financial control over every possible kind of thing in this country, without any direct reference to any particular emergency that exists because of any condition in any other country.  These are absolute powers over the financial conditions in this country.  As I say, we have had no explanation, good, bad or indifferent, from the Ministers on the far side as to what they mean. The President deliberately kept out of this Chamber, both when the measure was being discussed yesterday and when the Second Reading Motion was being made.  I, for one, protest vehemently on the way in which this House is being treated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what Deputy Davin's intervention means.  If this House is being treated in this way with the co-operation and with the support of the Labour Party, then I think that we ought to have some explanation from the Labour Party on this particular matter.  I do submit that this House, adjourning as it did last night, with the expectation that the President would be here to-day to give some explanation both of his policy and of the details of this particular Bill, should adjourn the Second Reading until such time as the President is prepared to come back to this House and say that this measure, is, in his opinion, necessary for him, and what are the circumstances in which, in his opinion, this Bill is necessary for him, and where the policy that is enshrined in this particular Bill, in these circumstances, is going to lead our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appeal to the Ministers to look well and carefully before they insist upon pressing this Motion.  The Minister knows perfectly well that the condition of the House at the present moment is that we are not apprised of what the President himself has to say on this Bill.  There are many members of the House anxiously awaiting to hear what the President has to say.  We all know that at this moment he is engaged on State <Col N="1097" /> business of the first importance.  So far as I know, the whole country is watching that State business with every hope and with every desire to help, in any way they can, in its successful conclusion.  If this Motion is pressed through now, the House is being asked to take a step of the greatest possible gravity, although that might not be imagined from the way in which it was referred to by some speakers on the Fianna Fáil Benches last night.  We are asked to take that step before the President himself has informed the House of what his opinion of the situation is. I have no desire to embarrass the Government in any way in the course of the negotiations which are proceeding, but I do appeal to members not to allow a consideration of convenience about coming back on Monday or coming back on Tuesday, or on Wednesday, to influence them in the arrangement of business to-day.  This Dáil will not hesitate to come here on Saturday, Monday or Tuesday, or at any other time that the Government may think it necessary that they should come in order to deal adequately with the question.  I do not think that the members are asking anything unreasonable when they suggest that the President himself should be here, before we are asked to deal with as grave and weighty a matter as this Dáil was ever called upon to deal with.  We are ready to come on any day or at any time that will suit the convenience of the Executive to deal with this matter with the utmost possible despatch.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with the points raised first of all by Deputy Mulcahy and secondly, and expanded to some extent, by Deputy Dillon.  This Bill is introduced as a Government measure and on the collective responsibility of the Cabinet, with the full sanction&mdash;it could not be introduced otherwise than with the full sanction&mdash; of the President and of the Executive Council.  What has been said from the Government Benches expresses the mind of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The President in London is competent to speak for the Cabinet.  As to the urgency of the matter, the British have already taken powers, as I have indicated, to hurt, if they can, and to restrict and impede the normal course of our trade with that country.  Are we, simply because negotiations or conversations are taking place at the moment, to leave ourselves defenceless pending the outcome of those conversations; or are we to do the prudent and wise thing&mdash;that is, to arm ourselves with powers which, we hope, it may not be necessary to use, but which, in a certain eventuality, we may be compelled to resort to?  We have not taken the initial step in this. We did not propose to put up penal tariffs against British produce or British manufacture.  We adopted an extremely reasonable attitude from the beginning&mdash;to submit what is a very grave issue for this country to arbitration. We put up what I believe are fair conditions and conditions which no man, impartially minded in the matter, could say were impossible or unreasonable. All that has been futile and we have not been able to bring the matter to the court where we believe it can be fairly tried.  An attempt has been made by force to coerce us to do something else, and we are supposed to stand with our hands tied by our sides to be smitten on both cheeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The other night, before the introduction of this Bill, but when it was foreshadowed, I said we seem to be facing up to an economic war unless some negotiation, of which we were not informed, were in progress.  I <Col N="1099" /> suspected that the Government would surely make some last attempt to prevent what would be a real calamity taking place, and I seem to have been correct, in that matter, and that some negotiations were going on.  Now it seems to me that the Government, have, for the first time, as far as we know, entered upon negotiations on this matter, because what was published, so far, indicated that there were no negotiations going on.  There was merely a statement that this was a matter that might be referred to arbitration and then there was long-distance correspondence.  We now know that, apparently, negotiations had begun, and I think the wise and prudent thing for the Government to do would be to try, with all its strength, to make a success of these negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposal, now before the House, might have a sort of psychological justification if something that is being done by the British is an injury or would be an injury to the trade of this country.  There might, then, be a demand, in the country, for some action by the Government even although that action, while it might do some damage to the British, would only increase the damage done here at home.  But I recognise, as I said, that there might be some reason for the Government to do something, and that if they could not do anything better they might be compelled to hit back, although the hitting back might not have the desired effect, and might put an additional burden on the people here. Now there is an alternative.  Negotiations are going on and my view is that the Government here should not hurry on with their economic war preparations, and that they should not try to get the country plunged into that position. So far, only two blows have been struck, as it were.  The first blow was struck by our Government here, and that blow was returned by the British Government.  Now negotiations are going on.  I think if blows are struck now, while the negotiations are going on, if we propose to strike a third blow in order to prevent a fourth blow by the British we will only succeed in <Col N="1100" /> making things worse.  I do not see why the Government should not await the issue of these negotiations and call the Dáil together again next week if necessary.  Now that negotiations have been begun do not let us imagine there is nothing to do but to pursue a policy of returning blow for blow.  I must say this: that in all the negotiations that we carried on with the British we found that there was an eminently reasonable consideration given to all arguments.  Even in matters where there was great difficulty we were always able to make progress.  We were never, in any matter, faced up against a stone wall.  If this Government finds itself up against a stone wall in any matter it is because of its unreasonable attitude, and because of its desire to fight, and because of its desire to raise the temperature of the atmosphere.  I suggest there should be no reason for raising the temperature now.  I suggest that the Government, entering upon negotiations, should say it is sincere, and that they want a settlement and let that operate on the mind of the other party, and it will operate on the mind of the other party. Nobody can enter upon negotiations if he feels, in advance, there is going to be no settlement.  No person entering upon negotiations will succeed if he feels that he will fail to effect anything.  Nothing will be lost by recognising this and there may be a great deal gained.  I would regard the entering into an economic war here as an absolute calamity.  I believe, that from the point of view of the material well-being of our people, it would be more serious than civil war. It might not do the great amount of damage that the Civil War did but, so far as other damage is concerned, it would be very likely worse, and it would be no real consolation to the people of this country that they succeeded in doing damage to the British. We have no particular interest in making the British suffer.  We are not concerned to deal with the British side at all.  We are concerned to consider our own people and to do our best for our own people.  I suggest that the Government, in entering upon an economic war, have had no regard for <Col N="1101" /> the interests of its own people.  They are behaving like a mad bull.  The policy they are pursuing would be regarded as reasonable only in Bedlam. They should not fling this country into an economic war but they should let the negotiations operate, and I say, if these negotiations are not successful the fault will be with the representatives of this country.  Many negotiations have been conducted, and much more important negotiations and negotiations in which larger sums of money were involved.  (Interruptions.)</P>

      <P>When negotiations about public debts were carried on there was a much larger sum of money involved than there is here.  The claim of the British Government was larger in these negotiations than the sum involved in the negotiations that are taking place now.  These negotiations were carried on successfully, and I am satisfied, remembering the new position created in the world at Lausanne, and the new movement throughout the world that is taking place that a satisfactory settlement can be reached if the representatives of this country, in this business, have due regard to the interests of this country, and are not concerned in proving that the wrong they did years ago was right.  If they deal with the business between the people a satisfactory settlement can be got on the question, if the true interests of the country are not neglected for a mere Party advantage.</P>

      <P>Deputy Blythe considers, apparently, that the moment is opportune for making a satisfactory settlement but, at the same time, he wants to tie the hands of the Government and not to allow them to take proper steps to defend themselves in case the present attempt at a settlement fails.  What has brought about the change in which Deputy Blythe admits there is a good chance of a satisfactory settlement? What has brought about that change? <Col N="1102" /> Has it emanated out of Lausanne, or, is it that this Party is asking the country to support them in facing this position of crisis in which the British Government would be compelled to state their case in a fair court, and that we would abide the result?</P>
      <P>Knowing Deputy Blythe's experienced career as a negotiator one feels that perhaps too much emphasis may be laid on his advice at this juncture.  Anything we are doing or propose to do will, in the first place, be done in the full light of public knowledge, and everybody in the country will know it.  We will not be in the position that we will go to London and do something, conceal it for six months and then publish it to the world; neither will we be in the position of having settlements signed by individuals, initialled by individuals, upon which it will be proposed to bind this country for very substantial sums.</P>

      <P>You might have made reference in this House to the fact that a settlement was made in connection with the land annuities, but&mdash;and I am open to conviction&mdash;I question whether the text of the Agreement was made public.

    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the object of Deputy Blythe's speech?  One could understand the position of the Party working themselves into a frenzy, into a regular series of Jeremiahs during the last couple of days as to the dreadful things that are going to happen the country, but are they afraid now that a settlement will come about?  What is their attitude?  They seem to have changed over-night.  Deputy Blythe feels that it is not the Government who have to take responsibility for the whole matter, who will have to face the country be their actions right or wrong, that they are not some way trustworthy or competent to undertake the task that they are at present facing. I think that if Deputy Blythe were reasonably sincere or had reasonable commonsense, he would realise that no matter how high an opinion he may have of himself as a negotiator it may at some time be necessary to change negotiators, and, that it would not be the slightest disadvantage to this country to change negotiators at this juncture.  It is a very significant matter as Deputy Flinn pointed out last night that the Party opposite had on the question of the Oath run away from the position which they themselves had taken up and that they did not stand up to Mr. Thomas when he tried to argue that there was an essential difference between South Africa and the Irish Free State on a constitutional question.  The Party ran away from the position they had taken up that this country stood on terms of absolute equality, that this country was absolutely sovereign and that we could take <Col N="1104" /> any step we wished so long as it concerned our internal domestic affairs. In two matters, the matter of the letter read in the House of Commons and in the matter of the Statute of Westminster, as it affected them, they ran away from the constitutional position they had themselves taken up.</P>

      <P>Deputy Blythe has definitely stated that if the negotiations broke down the responsibility will be on this Government.  Deputy Blythe's co-operation in a matter of this kind on a national issue cannot extend any further than that.  The first time ever the land annuities question was brought into the House I, for one, appealed to the House that it should be dealt with as a national matter.  I pointed out that in the days of the old Irish Party, in financial matters gravely affecting the economic welfare of the people, we had always even Irish Unionists who agreed with us on that special question and were prepared to stand by us.  At least, if Deputy Blythe cannot help, he certainly should not attempt to weaken the position in any way.  I suggest that when his Party try to place the onus for any failure that may occur on us they are not doing any good either to themselves or the country.  If the negotiations do break down, and I hope they will not, they will have ample opportunity to take up the cry throughout the country.</P>

      <P>With regard to the particular proposal before us, it has not been suggested, and it would not be suggested by the President if he were here, what steps exactly we propose to take under this.  We are asking for powers to deal with the situation.  We are faced with the responsibility of answering a threat, of answering the embargo that is sought to be placed on our goods and we are not going to take any step without the most careful consideration. We realise that any step we may take may be in the nature of a double-edged weapon.  We realise that, as a result of any steps that are taken, our own people may suffer to a certain extent, and any measures we may take will have to be very carefully thought out if they are not going to injure our own people as well as the foreigner; but we simply must have these powers.</P>
      <P>Is it suggested by Deputies opposite that if the negotiations break down, if there is no possibility of a settlement, that the Irish case should be left completely in the air, that the Government which is responsible for that case should not be in a position to take whatever measures they consider fit to safeguard their own people?  Deputies opposite have laid great stress on the situation that is going to develop in this country, but the Deputies themselves, if they were in the same position that we are in or in a much less serious position, would undoubtedly look for these powers. As they know themselves from experience, when a Government seeks these powers, various arguments can be made against them; but if a Government is not going to have powers to deal with an emergency and be prepared to take steps to meet it, then that Government is powerless either in maintaining order in its own country, in maintaining a proper condition of affairs to enable its own people to get a living and in the matter of negotiations with the foreigner, it is not going to be in a reasonably strong position.</P>

We are not discussing the merits of the business.  This is a discussion on the question as to whether it should be taken now or whether we should wait until the President returns.  The Minister is taking the opportunity to discuss the merits of the business on this question.  I did not discuss the merits and I do not want to discuss them.

We simply must have them now and we must be in a position before starting negotiations, if they are negotiations, to say that we have taken all precautions, before they are started, to take suitable steps if the possibility of settlement breaks down.  It would be quite impossible in the midst of negotiations, once they have been started in a proper manner, to come to the House and ask for these powers.  The Deputy knows that very well himself.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to say any word in this discussion which would be likely to embarrass anybody engaged in the present conversations or negotiations. I quite agree that President de Valera with the knowledge that he must have had at his disposal late last evening, was quite right not to respond to Deputy Mulcahy's demand for his intervention last night.  Deputy Blythe has incorrectly stated that negotiations are about to begin this morning.  The fact which must be apparent to most people is that negotiations took place some considerable time ago here and across the Channel and that the negotiations which he is now referring to are negotiations that are about to be resumed.  I would ask Deputy Blythe to remember that this economic war has not been started by the people of this State and that the demand for holding up the legislation recently introduced by the present Government would be justified if Deputy Blythe could say on behalf of the British Government that they would not proceed any further with the Act passed and already put into operation by them. As we are aware it is true that at this very moment an economic war is being carried on by the British Government, but if the Deputy could get up here and say that that war would cease immediately the negotiations were resumed, I think he would be making a very good case in support of his demand for the holding up of the legislation now before the House.  What he is really demanding is that this Government and the people of this country should stack their arms while the economic war is being carried on by the British Government and the people <Col N="1108" /> on the other side of the Channel.  No member of this Party will, in a light-hearted fashion, give a vote for a Bill which proposes that such drastic powers should be given to the Government here.</P>

I know that the powers that are being taken by the British Government are strictly limited by their pledges and in order to raise the moneys which they rightly or wrongly contend have been retained by this country.  Is it the intention of the Executive Council to use the powers they are now asking for, to recoup themselves to the same amount <Col N="1109" /> which the British Government are proposing to raise from the duties on Irish produce; or is it their intention to plunge into an economic war which goes far beyond the war of which the Deputies here have recollections?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan (Galway) Mr. Hogan (Galway)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Galway): The Minister for Education stated that he wanted to know the reasons why we changed our mind and why we thought that these negotiations would be more successful now.  He gave another reason. He said there was a new Government. That is quite right.  In fact the new Government can do better.  Any Government that persuades a country that their policy is the correct one and gets a majority for it and goes out to exploit that majority properly will do better.  That is the reason as well as Lausanne and the general world conditions. What we want to be sure about is this, that the new Government are going to take full advantage of their position; that they really desire to settle.  They can make a settlement. They could do better than we did in our time.  They should not take full credit for that for two reasons; first, because we did our job and secondly, because they did not do their job.  There are two reasons there and the English Government are acting in that way.  There is a new Government in Great Britain now and the moment a new Government comes in they are in a position to make new concessions and arrangements.  All parties in England are acting in this matter.  What is happening at the present moment?  Sir Stafford Cripps and Major Attley are acting in this on behalf of the Labour Party of England.  Is Sir Stafford Cripps a traitor?  Is Major Attley a traitor? They are not.  And there is no more reason for making the case that we are acting as traitors to this country than for making the case that Sir Stafford Cripps and Major Attley are traitors to their country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not tackling the situation as it could be tackled at all.  In every average country the representatives of that country have the interests of the country at heart.  If we had the interests of the country at heart and if <Col N="1110" /> the Government had the interest of the country at heart there is no doubt that a settlement could be come to on this occasion.  We are asked to unite. Deputy Davin asked us to unite behind the Government.  Unite about what?  I do not know at the present moment what the dispute is about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait now a moment.  It comes to this.  You can state your case in general terms.  The dispute by this time has come down to details.  One thing we can be certain of and that is that the dispute is not about the land annuities.  It is about the tribunal. What is the trouble about the tribunal? I do not know.  Who is to be chairman? We have not been told.  There is one man who can tell us.  President de Valera.  Is it our nomination?  We do not know.  We have got nothing but the vaguest information on that question.  Now I put this to Deputy Davin and to the Labour Party&mdash;be-fore the country is to be plunged into an economic war which as Deputy Blythe says will have more serious economic disadvantages than a civil war, should not the country know what the fight is about?  What is the issue? Surely this issue will be clarified by President de Valera who is meeting the Prime Minister to-day?  I do not know that he will come to an agreement. I hope he will.  Surely while these negotiations are going on and while these discussions are taking place in London this Bill should be adjourned until the issues are clarified for us.  What I complain of is this&mdash; when this Bill is passed we are beginning an economic war and the country is being rushed into an economic war that will lead, first, to poverty, and, then, to revolution.  There may be people on the opposite benches who like that and that is what I am afraid of in the circumstances.  I am afraid that there are Deputies on the benches opposite who are more concerned to see a social and economic revolution in this country than to see a settlement of this question.  I do not want to make any extreme statement but I know perfectly well that is so.  There are Deputies who are very much more <Col N="1111" /> concerned to see that and that is what we complain of.  You have a great chance.  President de Valera has got as good a chance as any leader of a majority party ever got in this country. He has a great chance.  I deny, as Deputy Davin says, that negotiations began.  Negotiations never begin until people get down to business and we have never yet got down to business. They may be beginning now, but they are not being resumed, and what I complain of is this, and I would say it to you, sir, and, through you, to the country, that the procedure and the sequence of events look very much like as if the present Government were more anxious for a fight than for a settlement.</P>

      <P>I am aware that negoti-tion was offered and accepted, but, so far as I know, it is the form of tribunal that is at issue.  I do not know what exact detail is in issue or in dispute. Does Deputy Davin know?  Is it the chairman or is it the nominees?  It is only a detail, remember.  Am I right in that?  Will anyone challenge that statement?  It is only a detail and none of us can say specifically what that detail is.  Is it the chairman or is it our nominees?  It has been suggested by somebody that the real question at issue is as to whether our nominees should be taken from outside the British Empire.  Is that it? <Col N="1112" /> If that is the issue, if the position that the Government is taking, is that there are no two persons in Ireland, North or South, who could be our nominees, the country should know that, and should understand it, before beginning an economic war.  What does Deputy Davin think?  If the issue is the chairman, let us hear exactly what is in dispute about the chairman, and let the country know it before plunging into this war.</P>
      <P>If the Government persist in going ahead with the Bill, I think they are throwing away a magnificent chance that they have got of making a good settlement.  They say that the English have taken the initiative, that the English have passed the Bill and why should not we?  Let me take them on that argument, from their own point of view, that because the English passed the Bill, there was no reason why we should not pass a Bill.  Look at it from their own point of view.  The English are not imitators.  They are occasionally original and they do not do exactly what other people do.  If you want fight, the most effective form of fight is not to do exactly what the other man does, but to exercise a little imagination and originality, and agree that because the English have passed a Bill is no reason why we should.  Looked at from our own point of view, is it good business for us to do it?  The Minister for Education asked &ldquo;Should we run away?&rdquo; There is no question of running away.  The English run away often and then come back and win.  Every country does it. &mdash;the French, the Germans, they all run away a bit, they trim, and, then, they come back and win.  All the talk that is being put up on the opposite benches does make it look extremely like as if the Government were prepared to throw away a great chance which the last election gave, not only to them, but to the country.  I am satisfied that they could make a settlement. Let us have a decent issue. Let the President come back and tell us that the British insist on nominating the chairman.  We have heard of a Feetham Court, but there is no question of a Feetham Court.  If there is we will unite behind you.</P>

      <P>But that was never in question.  There was never any question of a Feetham Court, never at any time&mdash;so far as I know the only question was one of the British insisting on nominating the Chairman&mdash;and why, then, should Deputy Flinn&mdash;but I do not mind him, because he is always darkening counsel; it seems to be his function&mdash;but why should Deputies, who have the interests of the country at heart, darken counsel in this crisis by making a statement of that sort? If, as I say, the English make that case, you will have something to unite about.  You will have the country behind you, but you cannot expect the country to rally behind you, or any party, unless you show that you mean business, and you have not shown that yet.  If you persist with this Bill, it certainly leaves the impression in my mind that you are more desirous of an economic war for an entirely irrelevant purpose, for which you got no mandate from the people, than for a settlement of this important question.</P>
      <P>Let me make one point more.  In all these discussions I would ask Deputies to give up, once and for all, the statement that the Land Annuities were paid as a result of a secret agreement. That is inaccurate to the knowledge of every Deputy in this House and, above all, inaccurate to the knowledge of the Labour Party and Deputy Davin. There was an agreement made in England in 1923, and amongst other things it referred to the Land Commission annuities.  The President announced in June 1923&mdash;I have his quotations here&mdash;in this Dáil, that that agreement was made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In August, 1923.  After that, every year our accounts appeared with the annuities transferred to England. They were transferred to the knowledge of everyone and this is a secret agreement!  Language should mean something.  I ask Deputies to give up talking about a secret agreement. There could be no agreement more open.  Whether it was a secret or not, the amount payable is in dispute at present.  The President, for whatever reasons you like, has a majority which enables him to go to England and re-open the question, and I believe he could get a good settlement.  I am afraid he and his Government are taking every possible step to prevent a settlement being arrived at.  I am asked now to agree to a Bill that everyone admits will have the most serious consequences imaginable to the country, and yet I go so far as to say that Deputy Davin and every member of the Labour Party must agree that we do not know at present what point of detail of difference there is between us and the British.</P>

We can meet here next week; we can meet here the week after, and the country can get a full warning of what the position is and then we will all be in a position to judge as to what attitude we should take on whatever policy the Government puts before us.

The Irish people, because of the political and economical oppression of the British, have been tightening their belts in a land of plenty.  They have been producing food for John Bull to grow fatter.  If this war goes <Col N="1118" /> on the one result will be that the Irish people will grow fat on their own food and John Bull can grow thin or get some other stuff to grow fat upon. We will start a new industry in this country, that is the slimming industry. We are in the strongest possible position to stand up to England in this matter.  We have the food; we have more food than we know what to do with.  We have a market here for £35,000,000 worth of foreign goods, and we can offer foreigners, who want a market for their industrial products that we cannot produce at present, a slice of that market in return for taking some of our goods that we want to get rid of.  But, even if all comes to all, and the trade between this country and other outside countries stopped, we would be in the happy position here that we would have more food than we knew what to do with. I tell you this, that if you go into the slums of Dublin and see the unemployed labourers there who never see milk or butter, they will be damn glad to get some.</P>

The British have taken powers to impose tariffs on our goods. We are only asking the Dáil for authority to say to the British that if they are not going to buy our goods we are not going to buy their goods and that we will go elsewhere for the things we require.  It is no secret, even to the pro-British members of the Opposition, that England has almost 3,000,000 unemployed.  We buy almost £35,000,000 worth of British goods.  Is a market worth £35,000,000 to be despised by the British, who cannot find work for 3,000,000 of their population? Not a bit of it.  We are in a strong position.  We buy more British goods than England buys of Free State goods.  It was a most amusing thing to observe in the long list of the tariffs the British put on that they did not impose one on tinned milk.  The <Col N="1120" /> reason they did not do it is because there is a factory in England depending upon selling the tins here.  If we only stand for our rights and say to the British, &ldquo;We are not going to buy your goods if you do not buy ours,&rdquo; then the British will come to their senses pretty quickly.  The British stand to lose in this.  From a social point of view, if this goes on a good lot of Irish people who never got a decent feed in their lives will stand to gain.</P>

I think that is a damnable slander to cast upon the representatives of the Irish people who are at present engaged in a life and death struggle with the British.  Since President de Valera took over office he has carried on the traditional policy of real Irish leaders. He has done everything he can to make a real peace with the British. There cannot be a real peace if the British continue to be tyrants and if we are to be slaves, because the slaves will always, I hope, desire to burst their chains, whether they are economic or political chains.  All we want is a decent peace with the British. We do not want to be fighting with them, but if they are going to strike at us we have to be in a position to defend ourselves.  All we want the Dáil to do is to put us in a position to be able to defend ourselves if we are unnecessarily and unwarrantably attacked by the British.</P>

      <P>Before the question is put, I want to make a suggestion to the Minister.  I am not going to make a Second Reading speech at all.  The Minister will admit that he has not dealt, and that no member of his Party has dealt, with the most important things in this Bill, the Excise Duties.  They have nothing on earth to do with any quarrel as to procedure between Great Britain and this State at the present minute. Those can only be dealt with by the responsible Minister upon the Committee Stage, and there are several amendments down dealing with that matter.  I want to know why there is no time being given for the Committee Stage at all.  Section 2 is not a homogeneous section.  Somebody might approve of one part of the section and disapprove of another part. Customs and Excise are on a completely different footing.  Why is it not possible to give two or three hours to discuss the Committee Stage of this measure?  What is the particular urgency for rising at 4 o'clock?  Why not continue on till 6 o'clock if necessary&mdash;or until 8, or even 10 o'clock to-night?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hugo Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice the usual emigration.  It is the custom of members on the opposite side of the House, especially on the Front Bench, to attack individual Deputies in their absence, and to clear out, as readily as possible, when they are attacked by Deputies in their presence.  It has been their custom to attack members on this side of the House when they could not be followed and carefully to avoid attacking them when they could be followed.  I would be very glad indeed&mdash;enthusiastically glad&mdash;if we could put this debate to-day upon lines of co-operation between men recognising the real difficulty of the position, recognising the fact that right does not mean that the solution of the problem will be upon your side, but upon the basis of those who recognise that, however, right their cause may be that the other man has a horse-shoe in his glove for luck.  I would be glad to put it on the basis of recognising that it is a stupid and wrong thing that this country and Great Britain should now, at this late date, follow the example of the criminal lunacy of the world in the last 17 years, by which the whole brains and activity of the Governments of the world have been used for breaking the channels of trade and cultural connection, one with another. I would be very glad indeed to do that.  We on this side of the House would be glad to co-operate on these lines.  But how can we?  I put it to any fair-minded and honest man, how can we assume that that co-operation will be given, and sincerely carried out, in view of the statement of Deputy Blythe that if negotiations of any kind which are now taking place, break down, it will be the fault of the Free State?  I want you to face that issue.  I want you to face the facts that in the name of the Party opposite an undertaking has been sent to the world that, before the verdict is given, before these critical and difficult negotiations&mdash;because though they are entered into to come to a solution, they will be very difficult&mdash;were entered into they are saying to the world that unless we come to a satisfactory solution the fault is ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who is going to take the responsibility of saying that that is not a criminal utterance?  You cut the heart out of it.  Now what is the position of England in a matter of that kind? There is no man in this House who is less prejudiced against England than I am.  There is no man who is more willing to recognise that while she has her point of view, in these and other matters, as she is entitled to have, there is no man more willing to recognise her physical and material and financial strength.  They will be all thrown into the contest.  Brennus threw the sword into the scale in Rome, in the old days, and these people will throw the sword, and the banks and their money and the whole of their political influence and political affiliations, all over the world, into the scale against us.  I recognise the difference.  What we do need is to go into such a contest with all our power, with our armour upon us.  And above all do we need to go into that contest with the knowledge that our own people are sound behind us, and as advocates of our own people, united.  What sort of a position is ours if we go into court knowing that there is an organised party here in this country, <Col N="1127" /> backed by the whole of the old garrison with their control of the economic avenues in this country, prepared to say, and having said, in this Dáil, that if the negotiations break down the Free State was wrong <i>ab initio?</i>  What is to be the position if we go into these negotiations bound to come to a settlement, or in other words to admit that we are the people responsible for having failed?  What they are asking us to recognise is that they have behind them, in this country, people who are going to compel us to come to a settlement, at any price, or who will go out into the country and organise by every means in their power the destruction of those who refuse to come to a solution unless it is a reasonable and proper one.  I do, deliberately put on record again, even at this eleventh hour for the repudiation of the whole of Cumann na nGaedheal, that statement of Ernest Blythe, that statement that cut to the heart of our position, that statement which would be fatal to our position if it were not a fact that Deputy Blythe and that small section of his own Party or of his organisation, for which he speaks, no longer represents anything behind it which could regiment the will and the purpose of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>You had a very different statement, a statement which I willingly welcome and it does not come from someone in favour of whom I can be accused of having any personal prejudice, nor does it come from one from whom I have ever received any courtesy in this or any other debate.  It comes from Deputy Hogan of Galway.  Deputy Hogan of Galway said that we were in a position to make a good settlement. What did he mean by that?  I want him to tell us.  Remember that the first position was that no single penny of these annuities belong to us.  That was the original position of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, that not merely did they not belong to us but that the attempt to get a legal decision as to whom they did belong was embezzlement. Now we are told that a good settlement can be made by us. What does he mean?  Does he mean that a very large proportion of the <Col N="1128" /> total amount which has already ille-gally passed over to the hands of the British Government can be restored to us?  Does he mean that while we might have to throw that portion of thirty millions over the windmill, it is possible for us to get a solution by which the present and the future product of the land annuities will remain with us?  Is that what he means?  Is that what he is prepared to help to do?  If it is, he has made a statement which will help to wipe out the shame and the degradation of Blythe's statement before.  I want to develop that position a little.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely sorry that through inadvertence I used the name without the prefix.  I had no intention of any kind or description in leaving it out.  Deputy Hogan said that not merely were we in a position to make a good settlement, a statement which must mean that we can retain some considerable amount if not the whole of the land annuities in our possession &mdash;but he went further and he said that we were in a better position to make that settlement than the preceding Government.  What did he mean by that?  I think that there is a certain amount of truth in that, and I think that it is a significant and a valuable statement if he stood behind it. Things do not happen suddenly; they <Col N="1129" /> evolve.  That Government was in occupation of the position it held for a period of ten years.  It had certain relations built up out of the necessity of the civil war and the accommodation which it had received from the British Government, financial, military and personal, during that time.  There were all sorts of agreements and understandings in existence.  Functions were built up between them, and again I want to be quite fair to them.  In the hurly-burly of discussion, in the attempt to defend their position against attacks from their opponents politically they said:&mdash;&ldquo;We are bound to say things which would not be put in exactly the same terms in which we would have said them if such a condition had not existed.&rdquo;  The mere fact that another political party was demanding, as a right, the retention of the annuities in this country, the mere fact that another party was attacking them, attacking them as bad servants and bad stewards of the estate, for not having retained those annuities, meant that in answer to that attack they, undoubtedly, had to say things, possibly had to say things, politics being what they were, of a kind which stated a case which was more extreme than the case that they wanted to believe.  Let us assume for a moment that in reality they thought that this was a doubtful case, but that they could not admit that it was a doubtful case in face of their opponents.  They had to use much stronger language in repudiation than they would if they had been perfectly free.  They had to produce arguments which, possibly, they otherwise would not have to produce. They were committed so deeply to the retention of the land annuities that it was probably quite impossible for them successfully to initiate a movement for their retention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware of that <Col N="1130" /> but I shall come to a conclusion at once.  I am very anxious indeed that what was valuable in the statement of Deputy Hogan&mdash;the possibility of settlement, the possibility of co-operation in that settlement, the possibility of our position being more useful in making a settlement&mdash;should be accepted by the other people.  We are asking them to put behind us the assistance which will enable us to do what possibly they could not have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall only take up the time of the House for a few minutes.  This is the first opportunity I have had of listening to a full length speech by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and I feel that he is a brave man.  He is a brave man to ridicule and mimic the speeches of the Opposition, because in all friendliness I must say that I never heard a style of speaking more open to mimicry and ridicule than the rotund oratory of the Parliamentary Secretary.  It seems to me&mdash; although my withers are unwrung for I have not previously spoken&mdash;that the Parliamentary Secretary's complaints against the opponents of this Bill are unreasonable and inconsistent.  At one moment he rebukes them for the undue melancholy of the views they take of the present crisis.  In the next moment he insists that the British, in bringing on this crisis, have struck a blow to please the Opposition. On the preceding day we had a statement made by Deputy Cleary that the Opposition were chuckling and delighted at what had taken place.  I think the Government Deputies ought to make up their minds on which leg they are standing when vilifying the motives of the Opposition in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all being asked to rally round the Government.  The great question is&mdash;what are we to rally round them about?  The interrogation put by Deputy Hogan cannot really be too often repeated.  What is the point at issue?  Where have they got to with the British Government in these discussions?  Has there been up to the present any discussion as to the merits of the case?  We have not <Col N="1131" /> heard of it at all.  The Government have been a long time in office and now we find ourselves on the verge of an economic war with Great Britain. I want to ask the Government here, what I should ask the British Government if I were a member of the House of Commons, what has been said of the merits of the case in this discussion? It looks very much from all we know as if we have been brought here to the verge of a ruinous economic war without the merits of the case having been discussed at all.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago the Minister for Finance started a suggestion that it was the duty of the Opposition and the duty of the Independent members to fall in behind the Government and to help them in this issue.  I pointed out at the time that so far we had no opportunity whatever of considering the matter in this House since this Dáil began.  I then suggested a secret session should be held so that every Deputy would be able to speak his mind without fear of presenting arguments to the other party in the dispute. That suggestion was not adopted by the Government and I remain in doubt as to where the justice of this question lies.  No one of us has been given an opportunity of co-operating in obtaining a satisfactory settlement. We are asked to-day to rally round the Government but as far as I can make out rallying around the Government simply consists in an attitude of open-mouthed admiration of the Government and in giving them complete and implicit confidence, a confidence which they have given us absolutely no reason for entrusting them with.</P>
    <P>Now, sir, there is no doubt that it would be a tremendous boon to this country to save £5,000,000 a year. But I do not think there is anything to be gained by presenting the matter in a form that cannot deceive anyone who looks even superficially at the facts of the case.  As I say we have not had the advantage of a discussion in this House on this matter and therefore I am subject to correction in the few statements I wish to make.  Of that £5,000,000 I believe I am approximately <Col N="1132" /> correct in saying that about £2,000,000 comes back to this country; that about one and a quarter millions comes back in the shape of interest on land stock held in this country and that about another three-quarters of a million comes back in the shape of R.I.C. pensions given to people in this country.  I believe it is also true that the British Government pay European War pensions to residents in the Free State which amount to about £2,000,000 a year.</P>
    <P>If these facts are true it follows that we are only exciting public opinion unnecessarily in this country by representing that our life blood is being drained out to the tune of £5,000,000 a year, when in fact if you set off these items against each other it is a matter of £1,000,000.  If those facts are true it also follows that if we succeed in retaining £5,000,000 here, as God knows I hope we shall, we shall in effect be getting a subsidy from Great Britain.  If we do succeed in getting a subsidy of some millions a year from Great Britain as indeed was proposed under the Home Rule Bill of 1912 I for one would be only too delighted.  But I see no reason for confusing the facts of the case and for exciting our people by representing things in a more gloomy light than is justifiable.</P>

      <P>Another matter can be referred to without danger of prejudicing our case in any negotiations, a matter which might excite public opinion here unduly.  The President has invited us to multiply by the figure 66.  I do not know whether this represents the true ratio to-day between British taxable capacity and Irish taxable capacity.  I should doubt very much if it does, because since that figure was arrived at the assets of Great Britain in foreign countries have enormously depreciated.  But whether it is exact or not, if we excite ourselves by multiplying by 66 the so-called tribute, it is necessary, in order to preserve our sense of proportion, to multiply certain other things by 66 also.  For example, if we want to consider the value to us of the British market we ought to multiply by 66 the £30,000,000 of exports we send to the British market.  We ought to multiply by 66 the dividends and the interest that residents in the Irish Free State receive from British investments, and we ought to bear in mind on that basis what we jeopardise if we really engage in economic war.  It might also be relevant when considering the question of economy in this country&mdash;<Col N="1134" /> perhaps not strictly relevant to this Bill&mdash;to multiply by 66 the revenue the unfortunate taxpayers in this country are called upon to bear, and to consider how enormous our expenditure is on that basis.  It might give a good deal of impetus to the campaign for economy which I certainly desire to encourage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the proposals are that have brought the President over to London.  I can give a guess, as anyone can give a guess.  My guess is that something is being proposed on the lines proposed by the Labour Party in the British House of Commons about a fortnight ago, that there should be some body formed, consisting of representatives of either country, to examine the whole facts of the case, not an arbitration Tribunal but a sort of Commission to examine and report, and that on the basis of that report there should be either negotiation or arbitration.  I do not know which.  That would be my guess. I hope the Government will be assured that they will have the earnest support of everybody, I should think, amongst the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, and amongst the Independents certainly, in any effort they make to have this question settled on peaceful and reasonable lines.  During the General Election I constantly urged settlement of this matter by arbitration. I predicted what I still believe to be true, that if we were to deal with this matter, merely by withholding this sum of money, we should do terrible damage to the country's credit. It is no use talking, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance did last night, as if we were simply paying something over to a bigger man with a bigger stick.  After all, there is actually an agreement between two Ministers for Finance, and the world at large is accustomed to pay regard to agreements arrived at between two Ministers representing two countries, whether or not such agreement was ratified by the Legislatures. I do not say whether that agreement was justified or not, but a certain agreement was made.  To disregard such an agreement without some independent corroboration of our <Col N="1135" /> case is certainly liable to affect the credit of this country.</P>
    <P>I also stated that such action might lead to economic war.  I thought if England did deal with the matter by putting duties on our goods she would commit a folly.  I still think she committed a folly in putting duties on our goods.  But, I pointed out that if you made people angry enough they were willing to hurt themselves in the effort to hurt you.  I think it will be scarcely denied by anybody&mdash;whether we were right in doing so or not&mdash;that we have done plenty since the Dáil assembled calculated to make the English angry. If we have an economic war I am one of those who regard it as a calamity. It will do enormous harm to the British, but I believe it will do infinitely more harm to our own people. If I were an Englishman I would prefer to settle this matter by drawing the name of the arbitrator out of a hat than having an economic war, and, as an Irishman, I feel exactly the same.  In fact, I would prefer to settle the whole thing by the toss of a coin rather than having an economic war.  For that reason, I implore the Government to beware of pig-headedness and fanaticism and to think of the sufferings of our own people.</P>
    <P>When I listen to speeches that are intended to rouse up the war spirit in this country, when I listen to the exploded principle advocated by the Minister for Defence this morning, that the best way to secure peace is to prepare for war, my mind inevitably goes back to the European War.  I should have thought that that was sufficiently disproved; the old thing we used to write essays about in our schoolboy days, that the best way to secure peace was to prepare for war.  Sir, in listening to such a speech as the President made the day before yesterday, my mind does go back to August, 1914, when I saw bands of youths parading the streets of London cheering for war, and when I thought of Sir Robert Walpole's saying, &ldquo;To-day they are ringing their bells; very soon, they will be wringing their hands.&rdquo;  I also remember the incitements then received <Col N="1136" /> by the various Governments of Europe from all the mischievous fools that encumber this planet, urging them to stand firm; to stand by their rights.  They did stand by their rights.  They stood by them nobly. What was the result?  Unspeakable misery, millions of people killed, and the civilisation of the world laid in ruins.</P>
    <P>We are told to-day that the duty of every Irishman is plain.  I think it is plain.  Of the two women who stood before the judgement seat of Solomon which was the true mother&mdash;the one who was so combative, who was so obstinate, and so fond of an irrevocable decision, that she was prepared to see the baby cut in two, or was it the other one?  Which is the true Irishman to-day?  The one who seeks applause from the Irish race, or the more unthinking members of the Irish race at home and abroad, by beating the drums of war, or the one who struggles in spite of misrepresentations to avert the catastrophe that threatens us?  For my part, I leave to the people who are more Irish than the Irish themselves, the honour of that tough-fibred patriotism which considers the present crisis a blessing in disguise.  Hitler in Germany, President de Valera in Ireland, the spurious mother before the judgment seat of Solomon.  I can see no difference in principle between the three.  I think it will be a happy day in this country when we discard once and for all the habit of fussing and blustering about our national rights and when we turn our thoughts to the true interests of our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Deputy who has just spoken on the very sensible speech he has made and on the temperate tone which he adopted in that speech throughout.  While there are those who can stand on the ditch and applaud what is going on in the arena, it is the unfortunate people in the arena who are going to suffer, who are suffering, and who have already suffered in connection with this matter. There are three phases of this <Col N="1137" /> question.  The first phase was presented to the people when it was stated that we had a right to the land annuities and that we were going to hold them until Britain proved her legal right to them.  The people were not told that in the event of a dispute arising out of the presentation and settlement of that legal right, the economic fabric of this country was going to be disturbed and that there was going to be a war on an economic basis between the two countries; that the business of the country would be upset; that small and large farmers would be seriously hampered in their business and that some of them might be broken.  No such intimation was given to the people of this country. They were led to believe that this was a matter that could be settled easily, legally and favourably.  What is the history of this whole business of the Land Commission annuities?  During the period that the Party opposite was in the wilderness, when they were solving the national question by burning houses, all these questions came up for consideration.  What were these questions?  Not the Land Commission annuities or the R.I.C. pensions, but Article 5 of the Treaty which laid down our responsibility for the service of the public debt of Great Britain and the war pensions being paid by Great Britain.  Not until 1926, when our liability in respect of these two items had been wiped out, did we hear anything about our rights to hold the Land Commission annuities or about the Act of 1920.  Not until our liability for pensions payable by Great Britain in Great Britain and in this country was wiped out did we hear anything about our legal rights to hold the Land Commission annuities.  When the Attorney-General of this State points out that a secret document was signed, and attempts to delude the people of this country by saying that no confirmation of that was got from the people, that is deceit, nothing less than deceit and political corruption of the first class.  In this House in 1923 members representing the people were informed regarding every item which affected the people in that instrument. They were told what their liability <Col N="1138" /> was.  In the Appropriation Bill, passed through this House, there was a sum for Land Commission annuities plus our responsibility for excess and bonus stock.  There is no use in misleading or attempting to mislead the people in describing as a secret document, kept from the people, what was actually disclosed in both Houses and paid according to the sanction and under the law of this country.  So it was in 1926, when the then Minister for Finance undertook to discharge in full, without deduction of income tax our liability for Land Commission annuities.  Why was that done? Because there had been a most favourable financial settlement made in respect of double income tax between this country and Great Britain&mdash;a more favourable settlement than any country has with any other. No other member of the British Commonwealth of Nations has such a favourable financial settlement made with Britain in respect of the return of income tax as this country has.  I should like to know whether, if this measure is passed into law, any attempt will be made to interrupt that most favourable arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the year 1729, in the Irish Parliament held in the Bluecoat School and reported in the earlier almanacs of this country but excluded from the later ones, there is a report of an attempt in that Parliament by the British Minister to get twenty-one years' supply.  That was beaten by a single vote.  This Parliament is asked to-day to pass a Bill which will give the Minister or the administration power for all time to collect any money required to run the affairs of this country.  There will be no further necessity to impose taxation when this Bill is in the hands of any administration. We are not told whether or not any of the restrictions which are in the British Bill are going to be observed in the administration of this measure.  We are not told that there is going to be any care taken in respect of the vital interests of the people of this country in the attack upon the British&mdash;whether or not efforts will be made to ease the burdens on the people.  The Bill <Col N="1139" /> might almost be said to be a perpetual measure for imposing taxation.  If it passes into law, giving such powers to the administration, you can roll up your Parliament.  There will be no necessity to meet here any more.</P>
    <P>We have not been told that the Government proposes to use these powers with any discretion.  We have not been told that they are only going to raise a certain amount of money. For what purpose is the money required? The Ministry is holding the Land Commission annuities.  Is this money to be given to the farmers who are going to lose the price of their produce by reason of the tax in Great Britain?  Is there any suspensory fund which will reimburse the farmers for any loss occasioned in connection with the British Act?  Is there any indication as to what use will be made of the revenue in the event of any revenue being derived from the operation of this measure, and if no revenue is going to be collected, what is the use of it?  Is the purpose of this measure purely and simply to keep out British-manufactured goods from this country?  If that be the reason, if there is no possible chance, by reason of the impositions under this Act, of British goods coming in here, what are the farmers and business people here going to pay for other goods?  What about business, commerce and the industry of agriculture in this country struggling under the weight of such impositions?  When this measure was first introduced as a White Paper, there was no limitation in respect of the period in which one of these impositions would run.  On second thoughts, the Ministry produced an eight months' variation. They will endeavour to satisfy the people by stating that the measure only runs for eight months.  What is the meaning of the eight months? After seven months and twenty-seven days the order can be reimposed&mdash;on the twenty-eighth day after the seventh month.  So it runs from one time to another.  We are being asked, 203 years after the previous demand was made, to give, not twenty-one years' supply, but supply for all time. <Col N="1140" /> We may be told that they do not intend to use that power, but we have not been told that.  We have not been told by any Minister the limitations there may be in respect of this instrument. We have not been told what is the meaning of &ldquo;excise licence.&rdquo;  An excise licence might be required from me to-morrow morning to come in from my residence.  A stamp duty might be placed on my tram or bus ticket or a duty might be required in respect of a motor car, if I travelled in it.</P>
    <P>We have not been told that they do not intend to do so.  &ldquo;Impose, whether with or without qualifications, limitations, allowances, exemptions, or preferential rates, an excise duty on any particular matter or thing as from any specified day and, for the purpose of such duty, require the taking out of a licence for the doing of any particular thing.&rdquo;  What is the meaning of that? We have not been told.  We have had three or four Ministerial speeches, and not one of them, I am informed, dealt directly with what is in that measure. What are the excise licences for and what are they to be restricted for? The Constitution of this State is not worth the paper it is written on if that measure passes into law.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Impose, whether with or without qualifications, limitations, allowances, exemptions, or preferential rates, a stamp duty on any particular description of document or transaction as from any specified day and, for the purpose of such duty, require a document or a particular form of document to be used in or in connection with any particular description of transaction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They could impose a document on the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and insist on his signing it and insist on a stamp duty being paid before he would be allowed into that Chair.  They could impose on him, if they wished, a stamp duty compelling him to pay £1,000 before he gets up there.</P>

      <P>What is the proposal for it?&mdash;&ldquo;This is a measure to empower us to fight the British and any man who denounces this, any man who does not support this, is playing the English game.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>A measure, even if it were only to put us in as strong a position as the British, is necessary, in these circumstances.  These circumstances, in my view, should never have been allowed to arise.  Those who are trustees in respect of defenceless people ought not to allow those defenceless people to be made the sport of politics, and the most defenceless people in this country are going to suffer most in respect of this thing. 200,000 farmers in this country have uneconomic holdings.  The whole average in respect of Land Commission annuities amounts to £10 per holding. Just imagine a man in the City of Dublin having a house the valuation of which is £10,&mdash;that is the value of the average agricultural holding in this country and the measure that is put before us, to put us in the same position as the British, has none of the peculiarities of the British position. What is the sum of money that is required?  What is the policy behind it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When, as I said, a few moments ago, we relieved this country by means <Col N="1143" /> of our responsibility for administration of a liability in respect of the service of the National Debt of Great Britain and of war pensions, we arrived at this position in this country&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>And a large part of the Six Counties, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That, comparing us with the people on the Continent, there were no reparations, no inter-governmental debt in respect of the war but there was this matter of the Land Commission annuities for which this country was liable, and the Parliament of this State was so informed, and was informed, when we were putting before the Parliament the acceptance of our agreement in respect of Article 5, that we still had the liability in respect of the Land Commission annuities.  Not only that, but the fact is that, while the service of the cost of the interest and sinking fund on land stock amounted to £4,100,000, and we collected only £2,930,000 in Land Commission annuities, we only paid, in respect of the excess on the bonus stock, £134,500 annually, and the British people are taxed annually, and it is in their estimates for this year, to the extent of £971,780 in respect of the excess on the bonus stock.  That is the position and the people are entitled to know it. When we read legal opinions in respect of Land Commission annuities, signed by the Attorney-General, amongst others, that this was a lost asset in 1920-21, and that the Dáil made a decree that the Land Commission annuities should not be paid, then, I say that our legal case, if that be the basis of it, is in very poor hands.</P>

I should be prepared to give the assurance required by Deputy Davin, that the Bill would be repealed if agreement were reached as to the composition of the proposed arbitration tribunal and the terms of reference thereto, and if the agreement were ratified by the Dáil, and if the British Government repealed the penal legislation which they have enacted within the last few days against this country.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate, but reference has been made to me by Deputy Cosgrave.  He has charged me with deceit, inasmuch as I stated that the agreement of 1923, which has been mentioned in this discussion, was kept secret and deliberately kept secret.  Why Deputy Cosgrave should make that charge against me I cannot conceive.  It is pretty difficult to understand.  It must be due to either of two causes.  Either I have misread or completely misunderstood the documents which are on a file which I have here beside me, or Deputy Cosgrave was unaware of the correspondence which was passing between his Government and the British Government.</P>
      <P>I have referred to this matter before, and I have been hesitant about referring to files in any Department.  I do not know whether it is proper to refer to them now, but I think that if Deputy Cosgrave did keep in touch with the Department, or if he asked Deputy Blythe, under whose hand some of the letters passed and under whose hand the telegrams passed, whether the statement I made was correct, he would tell him my statement was true.  I presume Deputy Cosgrave referred to the statement I made in a speech at Templemore some considerable time ago.  If Deputy Cosgrave had asked Deputy Blythe or Deputy Hogan whether my statement was true or not&mdash;again, unless I misunderstood and am unable to interpret the English language as used by those Deputies in their correspondence or by their officials under their authority&mdash;I believe they would have assured him the statement I made was absolutely true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorAMaguire" hpid="Mr. Conor Maguire Mr. Conor Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conor Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Without even going so far as that, I think I could refer Deputy Cosgrave to an answer which he gave in this House, when he was actually asked for the text of this agreement.  He was asked in 1926 by Deputy Conor Hogan when it was proposed to publish the terms of the agreement, and his answer was that the matter was under consideration and that it and other agreements would be published at some later time. The question was asked on 3rd February, 1926:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Conor Hogan asked the <Col N="1149" /> President whether the text of the Financial Agreement of 12th February, 1923, entered into between the Government of the Saorstát on the one hand and the British Government on the other, and containing, <i>inter alia,</i> provisions as to the collection and disbursement of moneys advanced under the Land Purchase Acts, 1881-1909, will be communicated to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Here is the answer of the man who said that the terms of this agreement were revealed in 1923&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan (Galway) Mr. Hogan (Galway)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Galway): I never said that.  I said that so far as the agreement for the payment of the annuities to the British was concerned, that was revealed expressly in the Dáil in 1923. Whether the agreement was secret or not, so far as that agreement provided for the payment of the annuities to the British by us, that was revealed in the Dáil in 1923.  Stick to that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Conor Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with Deputy Hogan in a moment.  Here is the answer made by the ex-President to Deputy Conor Hogan in 1926:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The President: The Government have recently been considering this question and several kindred matters.  A decision has not yet been reached, but I hope to be able to give the Deputy a definite answer before very long.</P>
      <P>Did he ever give that answer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>May I intervene for a moment?  There were several other matters besides the land annuities and the contribution towards the excess stock in that agreement.  Those other matters had not been finally dealt with then.  If the Attorney-General will look up that particular arrangement he will find there was a sum in respect of liability for railroads and other matters that were not then decided. So far as my statement is concerned, the statement as regards the secret document which had reference to the <Col N="1150" /> Land Commission annuities and to the excess on bonus stock, that was disclosed to the House in June, 1923, and in July, 1923.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Conor Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to allow myself to be taken off the point by such a slick attempt to get away from the statement which Deputy Cosgrave charged me with making deceitfully.  I stated in Templemore that the 1923 Financial Agreement, which is the root cause of all the trouble here, was kept secret and deliberately kept secret.  That was my statement and that is the statement upon which Deputy Cosgrave bases his charge of deceit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the consent of the Attorney-General, may I ask him one question?  Did he mean to convey to the people then that the agreement, in so far as it related to the land purchase annuities, was kept secret?  Did he mean to convey that to the people? Will the Attorney-General answer that question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorAMaguire" hpid="Mr. Conor Maguire Mr. Conor Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conor Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal in one moment with the question of whether this agreement, so far as it referred to the land purchase annuities in addition, was kept secret or not.  I am dealing now with the statement in which Deputy Cosgrave charged me with deceit.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>And adhere to.  Well, I am very much surprised and sorry that Deputy Cosgrave, in view of his own answer given in this House, in which he promised that the terms of this agreement would be made public, which promises were never fulfilled, and to which I was obviously referring, should still charge me with deceit. I have repeated two or three times already the statement which I made and that was that the only argument, relied upon, I believe, for the first time by the British, was that this agreement was deliberately kept secret for nine years.  The very same charge was made in the British House <Col N="1151" /> of Commons the other day&mdash;that it was kept from the Table of the British House of Commons.  That agreement was&mdash;I repeat it&mdash;deliberately kept secret at the request of this Government here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that as I promised.  We have been charged here with creating a situation which is causing considerable disturbance. Whatever we are doing we are not going to enter into any more secret agreements dealing with the finances of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I could score a heavy political advantage, were I to read the correspondence and telegrams on this file, I will not read them, in order to avoid causing further bitterness; but will content myself with saying&mdash; Deputy Cosgrave seems to smile and sneer as if he wishes to goad me into reading the telegrams and dispatches from this side of the water that were sent to prevent the London people from publishing certain parts and conceal them from the people of this country.  Apparently, he thinks that that is a matter for mirth.  The British Government were charged in the very same way by members in the British House of Commons with having been, to some extent, responsible for the trouble that has been created by assenting to the thing and keeping these things secret from the British Parliament and people.  So far as the land annuities are concerned, the Deputies who have seen the correspondence <Col N="1152" /> between the two countries will see that the British claim for the payment of the annuities is based on this agreement.  They put their cards on the table in their dispatch and they quote&mdash;I confess for the first time did I see it&mdash;the text of the agreement upon which they reply.  Deputy Hogan says that all this was revealed to the Dáil and he is very anxious to have that proved to the House.  Everybody knows that when this agreement of 1923 was entered into there was a state of things in this country and there were conditions here which enabled transactions of this kind to be carried out without the attention of the people being called to them. I do not want to go into past history or to rake it up at all.  I only want to remind the people, who wish to criticise us, to remember the position that obtained here in 1923.  I see that the debate in the Dáil on the 1923 Act is followed by a Public Safety Act. In the early months of 1923 the Free State Constitution had just been passed&mdash;it had only been passed about five or six weeks&mdash;when a message came from London that there were certain financial matters to be cleared up.  Certain emissaries were sent across the water, and without any mandate even from the late elected Dáil, without any subsequent ratification, this particular agreement was entered into.  When the Land Act came before the Dáil, Deputy Hogan, I presume, was then in charge of the Land Act.  Did he tell the House, at any stage, that under this secret agreement the terms of any land legislation to be passed in this country were subject to the approval of the British Government?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Not likely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the terms of this agreement was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The terms of any new scheme which the Free State Government may propose to enact after such consultation with landlords and tenants as they may think necessary shall be subject to the concurrence of the British Government in consideration of the guarantee mentioned below.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan (Galway) Mr. Hogan (Galway)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Galway): That is what was secret&mdash;not the annuities.  Which leg are you standing on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand what the interruptions are intended to gain for the Opposition.  The whole agreement was kept secret.  The statement already referred to in Volume 3 of the Official Debates, column 2498, says: &ldquo;The law provides that these annuities are to be collected henceforth by the Government of Saorstát Eireann, and that the proper amounts should, in due course, be paid into either of the Funds of which dividends and Sinking Fund payments in connection with the various Land Stocks are paid.&rdquo;  I cannot see a single reference to this agreement.  An arrangement has been referred to. Why was this agreement so shameful that it could not be read at that time? He speaks of an arrangement.  Why was this agreement so secret that it could not be read at that time?  What was in the agreement that made it politically unwise to reveal it to the Dáil?  If, as suggested, at the time, and by the legal gentleman who advised him on this case, some time ago, there was real liability upon this country to transmit the annuities to Great Britain, what was the necessity for this agreement?  Apparently, the British did not think the law clear with regard to the annuities and required a formal agreement such as this.  This agreement deals with something more than the transmission of the annuities.  It is a charge upon the Central Fund for something to be measured by the amount of the annuities payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to enter into the legal side of the question or to go back to the earlier dealings between this country and England, or to open up any legal argument on the question of the obligation of the transmission of these annuities to England or not.  At that date the position was this: The 1920 Act had been placed upon the Statute Book.  I am leaving out whether it came into operation or not. That is a matter on which the two <Col N="1154" /> sides of legal advisers took opposite views.  The 1921 agreement was signed, and that contained Article 5 which dealt with the public liabilities in the 1920 Act.  Look at the practical position as it stood when these amounts were agreed to in London. Why should there be an agreement transmitting the annuities from the Free State while these annuities were retained in the Six Counties?  Why, as practical negotiators dealing with millions of pounds, should people assume, against this country, that the sum of £3,000,000 should be paid over to England?  If they were so clear upon it why did they not publish it to the world?  Deputy Hogan himself pressed, in 1926, for the publication of this document but he could not get it from his colleagues.  Why not have published it in 1923?  Why, to come down to a recent date, was it not submitted to Counsel who advised the late Government?  Why does it find no place in those negotiations?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why do you think?  Is that agreement law?  You are a lawyer.  I ask you, is that agreement law, and do you submit anything but law to Counsel?  Is not that the answer to your question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is a solicitor and he seriously asks me, where the question at issue is whether there is liability on this country to transmit the annuities&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Legal liability?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether where the question is whether there is legal liability to transmit the annuities to Great Britain the document on which the British Government based their whole case should be submitted.  We said, in our despatches, that there was no legal liability, and the British Government produced this document and said there is legal liability.  Yet Deputy Hogan has the hardihood to suggest that when his own Counsel were asked to advise his Government this document should not be consulted, even then.  So we have to get this out of the way before we reach the question whether the view submitted <Col N="1155" /> by those who advised the late Government, or the view submitted by those who advised Fianna Fáil, is correct.  That is their stand upon the matter.  That is not my submission. Deputy Cosgrave went to London and entered into this commitment, or agreement, and was so ashamed, or afraid, of having it reviewed by the Dáil that the public were kept in the dark.  He wanted us to argue the case out in blinkers.  He kept the documents from the Dáil, and the public upon which, eventually, the claim of Great Britain was based.  Apparently the intention was that it was never to be published until Mr. Thomas revived it in his despatch.  Then it came to life. I presume it would come to life by a search in the proper department after the change of Government; but if there had not been a change of Government, and if the Opposition had got back into office, the Irish people would not have seen that agreement yet.  I do not know whether Deputy Cosgrave will now withdraw the charge he made against me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Attorney-General answer the question I put to him?  Does he mean to tell the people that we kept the agreement relating to the land annuities, a secret?  Let him answer that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I said, as clearly as I could, that neither the clause relating to the land annuities and the control by the British over land legislation here nor any of the other clauses, up to the time they were revived in Mr. Thomas's despatch, were given to the Irish people.  I challenge Deputy Hogan to produce evidence contrary to that.</P>

      <P>We are asked what is the question at issue, and why we should want to have these wide powers.  I did appreciate the speech of Deputy MacDermot.  I think the tone was admirable in the circumstances, but I think we might have had a better tone in some of the speeches <Col N="1156" /> made on the benches opposite.  I did expect that Deputy Blythe, amongst others, would have stood by us, more or less, at the moment on this question.  We have joined on the issue with Great Britain&mdash;an issue as everybody knows narrowed down to the question of the personnel of the arbitration tribunal.  There may be views as to the wisdom of making that an issue upon which there should be agreement.  There are some people, I suppose, who consider that we should give way.  Our attitude upon the matter has been definite; we have taken up a certain stand.  We have, as a Government, decided that we will not yield upon this question of the personnel of the tribunal.  That issue need, in no way, further embitter the atmosphere, or widen this discussion or rely upon <i>tu quoque</i> argument.  I do suggest to the Opposition that this is not the first time that there was a practical difference between this country and Great Britain upon the same issue.  Deputy McGilligan is listening to me and I challenge him to deny that.</P>

      <P>The question is simply whether the personnel of the arbitration tribunal should be confined to citizens of the British Commonwealth. That is the question that has been raised between this country and Great Britain.  A definite stand has been taken on this side of the water, that we shall not agree to the tribunal being restricted to citizens of the British Empire.  That is the issue at the moment upon which the Government has decided to stand.  Why there should be so much fuss about this particular Bill, I fail to understand.  We are taking measures and we are asking <Col N="1157" /> the Dáil to give us power to deal with the situation.  As the Opposition point out, the responsibility is on us. I can assure Deputies that the Government has a better means of judging the wisdom of the actions which they are taking than any other body of persons in the country.  They have decided immediately that it is necessary to get these wide powers in the circumstances.  We merely ask that the situation should not be made more difficult by such statements as were made this morning, that if the negotiations break down the responsibility will be upon us.  That is a statement which should not have been made in the discussion.</P>
      <P>I also, I think, am entitled to appeal to persons who can affect public opinion outside, if it is possible to suggest it to them, that this is a national issue and that the national interests might well be served by allowing us a chance to deal with this situation for a little while, to give us a chance to see if we can bring about a satisfactory conclusion either to the negotiations or to the struggle which may possibly come on.  We have had carping criticism, things such as appeared in the leading article in the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; this morning, which I think should be most strongly deprecated.  Why should a responsible paper go out of its way to suggest that the war which is about to take place, while it is going to be possibly injurious to England is going to be disastrous to this country, in order to encourage people across the water in the idea that we will never venture on the fight?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know the old maxim that he who wants peace must be prepared for war.  We merely ask that this country should be prepared for war. We are not irresponsible.  I do not know that I am so irresponsible that I am prepared to indulge in the economic destruction of this country, an object for which it is suggested we are asking this power.  We have no intention, as far as I am aware, of using these powers beyond the limits we consider absolutely necessary to safeguard the interests of the country <Col N="1158" /> and to bring our cause to victory. That is the sole object of taking these powers.  I can assure any Deputy who wonders whether we are really utilising in the situation to assume powers which we will use for our own purposes that that is not the case. This measure is simply designed to deal with the present situation and to give the Government power to deal with it in the best way it thinks fit. The House, I think, if it reflects on the matter will realise that we see our responsibility and that we are not likely to enter lightly into a struggle on this question or that we shall not do anything that would impair the social structure or do anything fool-hardy. We are merely endeavouring to see that if we are attacked we shall be prepared to defend ourselves.</P>

      <P>I intend to speak now.  I do not know what the pretty Minister is anxious about.  I want, before I come to deal with the &ldquo;blinkered&rdquo; Attorney-General to <Col N="1159" /> refer to the most scandalous statement that this House has ever had to listen to.  Deputy Cleary, speaking on this debate, some couple of nights ago, said that he had heard two Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies rejoicing over the British duties in the hall.  Deputy Cleary was challenged to give the names but he failed to give them.  It is unfortunate, sir, that the rules of debate in this House do not permit me to characterise the Deputy as I should like, for his conduct.  I can refer him, however, to this: that he had previously made a statement with regard to the Civil Service in a speech in the country and when I asked his own President about that statement, the President very nearly characterised him in answer to me as I should like to characterise him now.</P>
      <P>I say so much as a preamble because I want to assert, right at the start, that I am not going to speak in this debate with any feeling that the British Government is going to get information from me, information which they do not already possess or cannot get of their own ingenuity.  I am not going to be hampered in this discussion by any of these insinuations about being a British Opposition.  There are people on this side of the House who, when British opposition had to be faced, did not think it was necessary to separate their defence from that of any of their fellows who were being charged with them.  I hope the Minister for Finance understands that allusion.  There are men in this part of the House who risked more than the bubble reputation that the Minister for Finance is so evidently striving to get. This Party is informed with the spirit of these men and we are not taking anything from a person, who in the pungent phrase of a certain Senator, if he had persisted in the course he proposed at one time to follow might now be the unknown soldier in Westminister. It was a pity he was not allowed to join up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Attorney-General has been running in blinkers for a long time.  I did not understand what was his hesitancy until he gave us that valuable phrase&mdash;&ldquo;in blinkers.&rdquo; He talked here of the secret agreement.  We can realise now the hands into which this great case has fallen.

      <P>We saw the petty use that could be made of that big issue by the man who is supposed to be the leader of the legal fraternity in this country and certainly is the leader of the legal fraternity that is around and about the present Government.  He talked of a &ldquo;secret agreement.&rdquo; He has been criticised as being deceitful in the use of that phrase, and he showed by his own comments to-day that he spoke deceitfully and the epithet should not be withdrawn because it has been justified by the Attorney-General's own conduct to-day.  Since the &ldquo;secret agreement&rdquo; came to his notice he has given a legal opinion on it, and that legal opinion, as given in the news-papers, was that it made no change in the law of the case.  And now we are told to-day that it is the root of the whole trouble.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can look for the reference in the files of his own paper.  It makes no difference, and the Attorney-General knows it, and he has stated here to-day that it makes no difference in the law.  We are asked why we did not put it before counsel who advised on this matter. It was precisely because it made no legal change and so could not affect the legal opinion requested.  It has no binding force in law.  When that agreement was described as &ldquo;secret&rdquo; that description was used only for the purpose of making the people of this country believe that payments were made without the authority of the House.  That precise argument was made use of in a letter which two people belonging to that party thought fit to write to an English newspaper last week that these payments were not authorised by Vote of this House.  The Attorney-General knows that that is completely and entirely false.  If he can understand anything he must know that, for in the course of this debate there has been read out what Deputy Cosgrave did say in 1923 when moving for a sum of £3,133,000, for the Land Annuities Estimate.  In answer to a question by Deputy Wilson he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1162" /> The actual sum due to pay the annuities is much greater than the sum which comes in.</P>
    <P>Now, if the Attorney-General thinks the agreement was secret, let him ponder over this:</P>
    <P>At the recent negotiations which took place in England we came to a provisional arrangement which binds us, or in which we accepted liability for the payment of a certain sum pending a settlement regarding the major question.  That sum in all amounts to about £160,000 over and above the amount we will get in annuities.  We considered at the time that it was a fair bargain.  It does not prejudice or make weaker our case, and it leaves open the question of the ultimate settlement of the difference between the actual sum collected from Land Commission annuities payable to us here and the actual outgoings in order to provide interest on the land stock and the Sinking Fund.</P>
    <P>On that statement President Cosgrave was further questioned by the man who was then Deputy Johnson and by the man who was then Deputy Wilson and he gave details as to these payments. The Attorney-General cannot, however, deny that he did say that at the recent negotiations which took place in England we came to an agreement with Great Britain which binds us to a certain sum.  That is certain.  Later on we had the Land Act of 1923 and Section 12 of that Act was passed by this House which knew what it was about.  The details of that Act also were questioned.  The present Attorney-General, of course, was not here then.  Note his excuse to-day on that point.  That Act was passed in 1923.  The Attorney-General notes with horror that it was followed by a Public Safety Act and, apparently, he was so perturbed by that Public Safety Act that he could not attend to this matter then or that even yet he does not know whether Deputy Cosgrave did make a statement about the negotiations and what resulted from them.  I remember that the late Kevin O'Higgins at the time described that Act as being mainly directed against the romantic Neds of the Hill <Col N="1163" /> that were wandering about.  The Attorney-General must then have been one of these, and he is still so shocked when he thinks of that Public Safety Act that he cannot get into his head the full meaning of that plain English phrase:&mdash;&ldquo;At the recent negotiations which took place in England we came to a provisional arrangement which binds us, or in which we accepted liability for the payment of a certain sum pending a settlement regarding the major issue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is the use, then, of the phrase &ldquo;secret agreement&rdquo; if it is not intended to be deceitful?  What is its use if it is not to make people believe that that money was paid over and that the Dáil knew nothing about it? It is as clear as anything could be that the House knew it and everybody voting the money knew it.  The Labour Party here knew it and the Farmers' Party knew it.  The leaders of both Parties questioned about it and they both got information about it and their recorded questions show that they were present when the matter was raised and discussed in the House.  Section 12 of the Bill was voted for by a majority of the people of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney-General wants to know why we did not hold the land annuities seeing that the Six Counties were holding them.  What about the counterpart of that?  Would he have us pay everything which we would have to pay under the 1920 Act seeing that the Six Counties were paying? Yet these are the arguments on which the Attorney-General has shown himself to-day to rest.  That is the weighty legal opinion in reliance upon which this country has been rushed into an economic war.  That is the whole legal strength behind the Government. That is how the whole matter rests as revealed by the Attorney-General's speech to-day&mdash;the strength and weakness of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say here that I have always held the view that it would be a great matter to get the legal arguments in this case out of the way.  I do not believe one bit in the case the Attorney-General has signed.  We here never did.  I have said before in this House that a man's opinions on anything are worth nothing more than the worth of the arguments upon which his opinions are based.  We have seen before us some people who have pushed themselves into politics by reason of their legal opinions.  We have had experience of three of the signatories to the legal opinion upon which this <Col N="1165" /> country has been precipitated into an economic war.  We had a Deputy&mdash;no longer in this House, because the South County Dublin, I think it was, gave him the record beating that any prominent man ever got in this country&mdash;whom, when proposed as Attorney-General, the present Cabinet turned down&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Personalities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and chose instead the present Attorney-General. We have heard the latter's exposition of the law here&mdash;and I can leave it at that.  We have the Minister for Justice, and if his law were as profound as his silence we might have some feeling of security, but he has not kept silent always.  He has broken silence now and again, and every time he breaks silence he shatters the illusion that his legal opinion is worth having. I believe that a great advance would be possible if only we could get the legal position clear, and all legal issues out of the way.</P>
      <P>Personally I would take any tribunal before which to get that legal issue fought merely to get it out of the way, because in my belief it will be thrown out of the way without much delay. There is a good case beyond that; certainly there is some case beyond it, but it is never going to be properly discussed so long as there is economic warfare, or so long as there is reliance upon legal opinion of the type I have mentioned.  We are never going to have the real case made about the land annuities, the only one that can be pleaded; we are never going to get that as long as there is foolish reliance upon the very foolish legal opinion given about this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, we will never get to a proper and a clear position on the land annuities until other items are put for ever behind us.  The attempts made by the Minister for Finance, and, amongst others, by the President every time he speaks, to equate the payments due on foot of the settlement of our land question with reparations and war debts must be abandoned.  Again I say I do not believe I am giving anything away to any person of intelligence, British or otherwise, when I say that <Col N="1166" /> that is nothing upon which we could base such a comparison.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Reparations and war debts!  What has this got to do with reparations and war debts? There has been an attempt made on the Continent to get reparations out of the way and the special aim of that is to enable the nations to pay their commercial debts.  If there was ever a commercial debt this is one.  No be-fogging of the question by introducing war debts will ever survive the light of examination.  The attempt to equate this question with war debts can only induce in the minds of those resisting our claim the feeling that we have no proper case.  The whole thing is being befogged and clouded by the attempt to establish equality between things completely distinct.  Reparations!  The very term shows what it means, payment by a vanquished nation on account of what she was supposed to have done in the way of damage to a country which fought against her and vanquished her.  What has that got to do with land annuity payments?  Of war debts there are two types; war debts that are international, where one Government lent money to another for sending in certain munitions, or certain other war supplies, or where one Government had put credit at the disposal of another for the purchase of certain munitions.  What has that got to do with the land annuities question? Even take the internal war debts which nations have raised to finance themselves for all the waste and damage that must be experienced in the course of a war.  What have these things to do with these payments? Until the legal folly is dropped, until this absurd attempt to equate these payments with reparations and war debts is dropped, we have not a clear issue to put before anybody. This case should never be attempted and has no chance of success upon the legal issue.  It never had.  There is not a court before which anybody who has studied the question could go with any confidence.  There is not a 100 <Col N="1167" /> to 1 chance of our getting away on the legal point.</P>

      <P>There is, however, a case that could be made.  I want to turn to what Deputy Cosgrave said when the Boundary settlement was under discussion here.  I will quote from the Official Debates of 10th December, 1925, column 1765.  On that issue Deputy Cosgrave said&mdash;and I want to quote all of this, and I do not care what use is made of it:&mdash;</P>
      <P>I am proud to say, and let whoever likes make political capital out of it, that we met honest, just and generous people to make a case to.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave was speaking then of the case made for the elimination of Article 5 of the Treaty and the people he is speaking about are the British Government of that day:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irregulars can go out now if they like and sound that throughout the country.  I am going to tell the truth in connection with these negotiations&mdash;the whole truth.  We explained that we were paying out three and a quarter millions a year for land held by our people, more than half of them occupying un-economic holdings.  We explained that we were sending out of the country a million and a quarter in pensions, and we told the British Ministers: &lsquo;You can if you like assess us for ten, twenty, thirty millions; we will not be able to pay.  Is it any advantage to your country to make us bankrupt?  We are not standing for repudiation. We are prepared to bear our burden; we are bearing at present and will be bearing for a long time, an undue burden, and we are not honestly able to pay a single penny.&rsquo;<Col N="1168" /> It was accepted in good faith and that finished Article 5.</P>
    <P>Get back to the situation of that time.  We were faced with the probable imposition upon us, under Article 5 of some share&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Nineteen millions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was one calculation made&mdash;of some share of British pensions and war debts.  In those circumstances we got the slate wiped clean of those debts, and got that done when and because it was put up as part of our case, that as we were paying out three and a quarter millions for land held by our people, and sending away a million and a quarter in pensions, we could not do anything more.  There is now at hand a golden opportunity, if only the legal quibbles could be dropped. if the legal advice could be quietly forgotten, if the fatuous nonsense about reparations and war debts was put out of the way, there is a case to go on, that the old circumstances have changed.  There is a case for going to the Prime Minister of England, who has come back from Lausanne with a particular settlement and saying that in the new circumstances the 1925 settlement requires revision.  But you can never get anything from these people if you are going to stand on legal rights&mdash;which are without substance or to equal these payments with war debts and reparations, which is untenable, and would not be put up by any one with a grain of sense in his head.  The circumstances of that time can be turned to account&mdash;circumstances in which there was the prospect of very heavy debts for war being saddled on the British, and of our having to share these and when we got them all wiped out by saying:&mdash;&ldquo;Remember we are paying these other very big sums.&rdquo;  There is a case now for revision in the light of that, because of the phrase then used, a phrase which justified our case then and gave a secure hold to the Government of the moment.  There is a case now to be made that that settlement requires revision, and a revision that ought to be in our favour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1169" /> That, however, must be based on the equities of the situation and can only be made by people who are going to announce themselves as being honestly prepared to deal equitably with the other parties to the bargain, the British.  A Government now could get some remission but it has to be a Government of a particular type. The time is ripe, the golden opportunity has arrived, but it requires a sacrifice which I doubt this Government is going to make.  You have got to deal with the British in this case not on any nonsensical legal grounds but on the grounds of equity. Over and over again, as I said, they showed themselves prepared to deal in a generous way on an equitable case being put to them.  That equitable situation has only just arisen by reason of these Lausanne agreements.  If the Attorney-General had spent some of his time, without the blinkers, reading what was said by British statement instead of trying to mug up, in an ineffective way, what the late Kevin O'Higgins, what Deputy Fitzgerald and what I said in England in an attempt to score points off us, he could find in one or two volumes of Hansard many statements with which he could confront individual British Ministers who are at present in conference with his Government. He would find in one volume of debates dealing with the Statute of Westminster that one speaker said that if it did come to any dispute hereafter the way in which the Commonwealth would be held together was not by legal bonds, not by what he called cold logic or hard law but by tradition, by equity and by compromise.  Another said that there was no good in keeping certain institutions alive if, in fact, they were decaying and that the Commonwealth could only be kept together by having material bonds as between the units, by having trading associations of a valuable type between them and having the people realise that their happiness and security both depended on the keeping together of a particular association. That is where this Government cannot succeed because there must be <Col N="1170" /> shown, before you get the British to deal equitably with you, some appreciation of the Commonwealth position and there has to be shown clearly the disposition to continue inside the Commonwealth.  The unfortunate thing is that we are faced with Ministers who have said so many foolish things in the past.  The Minister for Finance told us within the past nine months that the British were down and out, that they were economically decayed.  Naturally, that Minister cannot see any satisfaction in living in economic association with these people.  Other Ministers have said so many foolish things that they are now in the position that they cannot forget them with honour or remember them with security.  They have got to keep to their bad old past and pretend that they believe in it, although a lot of them no longer do. That play acting is going to lose us a golden opportunity of getting rid, on an equitable basis, of some of these debts.</P>
    <P>The present Prime Minister of Great Britain is the same man who was Prime Minister in 1924.  Early in 1924 we had negotiations with the British, when it looked as if the machinery for a settlement of the Boundary dispute had broken down and when the British took every step possible to see that the machinery was re-established&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>At that time the man who is again Prime Minister wrote to us.  This could be retorted on him at this moment by Irish representatives who are prepared to take up an equally decent line.  In 1924, Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, writing to President Cosgrave, said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This aspect of the matter to which you refer is one which I view with the greatest concern.  The Treaty is but the dry bones of a settlement. In the last two years you have clothed it with flesh, but we have yet to breathe into its frame the living spirit of reconciliation.  The feeling grows upon me that this we shall do by remembering that there <Col N="1171" /> are interests wider than those which preoccupy our minds in these two islands.  I want to enlist you, your Government and all Ireland, including the North, in the cause of bringing back peace to the world.  Unless, or until, we can show that we ourselves know how to keep the law and to create friendship between ourselves in these islands, we can do little or nothing, severally or jointly, to bring back the verities of peace either to Europe or the world at large.  I ask you to tell the Dáil and, through them, the people they represent that if Irishmen can lay the foundations of a true and lasting peace, not only amongst themselves but with us, they will be rendering Europe in this distracted juncture of its history a service which future generations will not forget.</P>

I do not believe that that can be done by the present Government.</P>

      <P>Look at their economic history since they came in.  I do not know whether it is economic agoraphobia or economic claustrophobia, but it is a &ldquo;phobia&rdquo; of some description.  The fear may be that Britain might be in trading association with this country and part of the object of the tariffs that have been put on is more to defeat Britain economically than to help Ireland economically.  We know too that there are other things going on in the country at the moment.  I have asked questions about armed forces not under the control of the State.  I was told that drilling was frequent and notorious but I was not told that the law was being enforced.  I was told, in relation to a landing of arms, that the law would be enforced, but if we take a line from the enforcement of the law against drilling we know what that amounts to.  Somebody recently asked about the tearing down of certain flags from private houses in the city and we were told that the Ministry had no official information about that.  Surely the Ministry is not foolish enough to believe that Britain cannot see all that.  They must ask themselves for what purpose arms are coming into this country and for what purpose drilling is going on and they have only to turn up the speeches of members of the present Government to see why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While that situation develops, would any British Government deal equitably with an Irish Government that is basing itself, or preparing to base itself, on such help?  We have seen a further thing.  We have seen correspondence, recently disclosed after the most fatuous attempt that ever was made to <Col N="1173" /> suppress anything, and what comes out of it but this&mdash;that this country, in its attempt to dishonour a very distinguished Irishman, blundered into insulting a very distinguished French Minister, and the Ministry had not even the grace to say&mdash;it is left for the Governor-General's correspondence to reveal that they had, at any rate, the grace to apologise to the French Minister for what they did.  They are not really men enough to say that they did apologise to the French Minister, but the Governor-General has stated that they did, and it is a sign of grace, at any rate, that they recognised that there was a bad blunder committed that night.  In that connection, and since it was regarded as something to be proud of at one time, the whole credit should not go to the two Ministers who were pushed into the lime-light. Others deserve mention.  The Attorney-General was, as usual, caught hesitant, on one leg.  He was not just in at the thing, and he was not just out.  He was there or thereabouts.  He was on the doorstep, and there was still another Deputy of the House who played a part in that dishonourable engagement with the French at Ailesbury Road.</P>
    <P>But though the French were insulted through their Minister, we know that nobody set out to insult the French deliberately.  That, unfortunately, had to be done in order to get insult put upon a distinguished Irishman.  That had to be done to show Anglophobia. We had dishonour done to distinguished Catholics who wanted to visit this country during the very famous Congress period, and that also had to be done, so that certain trouble might be caused to them and to that same distinguished Irishman, and all this so that the reactions of it might be felt in Britain.  We had the misconduct of the Minister for Defence, in connection with the Army Band, and the attempt to destroy a civic function, so that, again, dishonour would be attempted upon a distinguished Irishman, in order to have the repercussions of that, too, felt in England.  What is the chance of the present Government getting any satisfaction, so long as they are not clear that they want to <Col N="1174" /> be in the Commonwealth or out of it? In these same debates, to which I have alluded, one of the speakers in the House of Lords said: &ldquo;We must recognise the big position which Southern Ireland had got in the Treaty, if they care, to-morrow, to say that they would not belong to our association, at any rate, they could rely on this, that there would be no threat of coercion by way of war put on them.&rdquo;  Yet the Ministry will not take a clean-cut decision to get out of the Commonwealth, nor will they take a clean-cut decision to stay in.  They want to have the economic advantages of the association, but they want also to have the liberty to act in a particularly undignified fashion towards certain dignified and distinguished Irishmen, because they find them in certain representative positions.</P>
    <P>We have on the seas, at the moment, three representatives of the Ministry going to Ottawa.  For what?  According to the &ldquo;Irish Press,&rdquo; they are looking bronzed and well.  They will bring back the bronze with them and that will be about all.  Not even golden ounces will be theirs, but merely bronze.  What nonsense is it to have these people reported as running committees on the liner 1,300 miles out from this coast, with Ministers in charge of these committees. One of these committees is to deal with British trade, when British statesmen have said so far as they are concerned, &ldquo;no agreements with the Irish Free State.&rdquo; Another is to deal with Dominions trade and in that connection we should not forget that one of the few signs of preparedness announced to us, for the Ottawa Conference, was the receipt of a letter from Southern Rhodesia.  As our trade with that country was stated in answer to another question as being £13 one way and £1,300 or £1,400 the other, and as none of the other Dominions had approached us on trade matters a whole committee to deal with Dominion trade seems out of proportion.  We have a third Committee dealing with currency and allied problems and the Minister for Finance not there!  For what did these representatives go to Ottawa? <Col N="1175" /> They certainly did not go having made serious preparation here to get anything of value done.  They certainly did not go with any preparations made, on the economic side, by touch with our producers as to what they want, they had no real arrangements with any of the other Governments but they had been decisively snubbed by one Government, and did not treat this House truthfully in regard to the snub given to them by that Government.  They walked out of this House rather than listen to a statement I myself made, showing that they had not treated the House frankly in that matter, but despite them the truth came out within a very few weeks after.</P>
    <P>What are these people doing on the seas journeying to Ottawa where no agreements of any value will be made with them and while no arrangements on finance, trade or land annuities can ever be come to with them so long as they continue to be a Government which will not make up its mind where it stands politically?  As I said previously, it cannot make up its mind where it stands politically because its past is there&mdash;its actions, its pronouncements, its incitements which it cannot forget with honour nor remember with safety at the present time.  That is the situation, and so, we have this Bill, and so we shall have economic war.  That economic war is described by the President as a blessing in disguise and in return for that blessing in disguise, we are going to tax our own people and the goods coming in to them.  We should have been making presentations to the British if it were really a blessing in disguise.  We were told by the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech, this year, that he was putting on tariffs so as to raise one million pounds revenue from our people; yet in this Bill, by some sleight of hand, we are going to impose customs duties now which will not hurt us, which will not raise say, another million pounds from our consumers, but which will hurt the British to that extent.  We have got to see that <Col N="1176" /> worked out.  That, again, belongs to the Peter Pan school of economics which the Minister for Finance so thoroughly understands.</P>
    <P>We are to be hurt in a particular way, and that hurt is called a blessing in disguise.  We are going to hurt ourselves more in another way, and that is called retaliation and not mortification. Is there any hope that even now there is likely to be any wiser counsel prevailing? Must we drive this nation to ruin simply because President de Valera must have his past history in this country legitimatised, for that is all that is happening?  Will his ambition, at this point, not even overcome his pride?  Many a man would give his soul, if he were an ambitious man, as the President is, to have the chance he has now to make a settlement with the British.  There is only one thing that will stand in the way, and it is that individual's pride, and his past to which he looks back with such pride, a pride that is not shared by very many others.</P>

Now that they are in, if they give way, can this be used always against them also?  Remember if knives are out, there is apt to be a more powerful weapon in the hands of the others than there is here, despite all the whistling from the other side as they go through the wood.  If that argument has any force with regard to the people of this country, it has equal force, and even more force, with the people in the other country and before these two peoples get into that terrible conflict and work themselves up to the point that neither can give way, they should pause and try to get back to the old circumstances, not on the legal grounds&mdash;wipe them out&mdash;not this foolish nonsense about war debts and reparations&mdash;abandon these&mdash;but simply return to the old circumstances on which the 1925 agreement was founded and see if some better solution cannot be arrived at equitable to both sides.  That demands here only this sacrifice, that the people of the country will accept the Treaty conditions, possibly modified Treaty condition, but Treaty conditions all the while. Yet such as it is I doubt if that sacrifice is going to be made even for the best of causes.</P>

      <Col N="1178" /> I have only one last word.  Last night Deputy Flinn thought fit to refer in this House to the late Kevin O'Higgins.  It is a pity that that poor man cannot be preserved even in his grave from such a dishonour as a complimentary reference by Deputy Flinn. (Deputies: &ldquo;Hear, hear.&rdquo;).  Deputy Flinn talked about the great advance and said that nobody talked of the great retreat.  Deputy Flinn came to this country on his great retreat.  One could adapt the old Roman habit and address this House as &ldquo;Conscript Fathers&rdquo; only for the fact that by so doing one would be submerging the only item which renders Deputy Flinn conspicuous and notorious&mdash;that in this House he is the only conscript we have. He talked about people who had betrayed. It comes very ill from a man who betrayed, not merely the place where he was born, not merely the whole tradition in which he was brought up, but who at times has betrayed even the doctrines of the Party he is now supposed to represent.  Kevin O'Higgins was a brave man.  He cared neither for life nor reputation when his country was at stake, and the only thing in which there could be any comparison between him and Deputy Flinn is that Deputy Flinn cared nothing for his reputation when his life was at stake.  His reputation then was nothing to him; since, it is equally nothing in the regard of decent men. He described himself as a C3 man in the War and that is what he is in everything and that is what he revealed himself to be last night, and more particularly so in his reference to Kevin O'Higgins.</P>

      <P>This debate, unfortunately, has brought up considerations that should not have engaged our attention now.  Yesterday, what was the situation?  As I saw it, the Government of this country had differed with the British Government as to our legal liability in respect of certain payments. The Government of this country proposed to the British Government impartial arbitration on that legal liability, and in that proposal I believe the Irish Government was acting in accord with the strictest rules of honour and integrity.  The British Government accepted the principle that arbitration was the proper method to resolve this legal difficulty, and a difference then ensued as to the Chairman or the personnel&mdash;how it would be constituted&mdash;and it was proposed by one of the parties to that dispute to embark upon an economic war with this country.  Those were the circumstances prevailing yesterday, and the Government came to this House with proposals which were introduced by the Minister for Finance in a speech which I found some difficulty in following, but in which he said the responsible Government of the country considered this Bill was essential if they were to have the powers necessary to meet the situation that had been created.  Beside him, for a time, was seated the President of the Executive Council.  There were many members of this House, I believe, with an open mind, resolved to do their duty, who wanted to hear what the President had to say on a measure of such enormous importance and in a crisis of such boundless gravity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate was wound up last night by a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, who confined himself almost entirely to telling funny stories, including the story of Peter Pan.  That was the spirit in <Col N="1181" /> which a Parliamentary Secretary, a member of the Fianna Fáil Government, was proposing to deal with a grave crisis and as solemn a determination as this country was ever called upon to make.  The debate last night ended on a note closely approximating to imbecility.  This morning we opened the papers and found that the President was gone to meet the Prime Minister of England.  I must say when I read that news I was profoundly thankful.  I do not hesitate to say&mdash; though this may be considered a popular thing to say now&mdash;that if the President had stated here that in order to defend the interests of the country it was necessary to have the Bill that was introduced here passed, and that England was not prepared to continue a free and reasonable discussion as to the personnel of the arbitration, I would have voted for giving the President those powers.  But when I came in here this morning I was greeted by the old motto of every armament manufacturer in the world, that the best way to preserve peace is to prepare for war.  If it were a travelling salesman for Vickers who told me that, I would understand the message.</P>
    <P>Those were the self-same words that were uttered by one country after another prior to 1914.  When Russia was mobilising, Germany was explaining to the world that the best way to preserve peace was to mobilise herself in preparation for war.  France was demonstrating that in order to compel Germany to be pacific she herself must organise her warlike forces.  What was the result of it all?  The result was such a war as the world had never seen before.  I do not deny that England has struck a blow.  The decision rests with us as to whether we are to react to that with the same madness that helped to precipitate the world war of 18 years ago, or are we to say that, as the President has gone into conference with the Prime Minister of England, pending the report of that conference we will remain silent and wait in the earnest hope that there will be a peaceful and amicable settlement of what might have been a bitter quarrel?  Our appeal to the Minister to-day is not to <Col N="1182" /> pass any judgment on the situation, not to yield an inch at this juncture, not to suggest that the position of the Irish Executive has weakened by a hair's breadth, but simply to say that while the President is not here to state his mind and counsel his Party in the Dáil, and while he is engaged elsewhere in discussions with the head of another State, our duty is to do nothing but await his return.  In my opinion, that was our duty to-day; that was what we ought to have done.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that yesterday, if the President had assured us there was no hope of peace and that he could not persuade Great Britain to withdraw from the threatening attitude she was taking up and, consequently, it was necessary for the Executive to have these powers, I would have been quite willing to give them.  But to-day the situation is that we are asked to strike a blow in return which may precipitate an economic war which will gravely, perhaps irreparably injure this country and England.  Such a war would inflict suffering, not upon the politicians who will declare it, but upon the railwaymen, the dockers, the merchants and their employees in England and on the same class of people and the small farmers in this country.  It is easy for Mr. MacDonald and Mr. Thomas to be bellicose.  They will not get thrown out of their jobs.  It is terribly easy for us to say that our duty is to stand firm and challenge Great Britain to do her damnedest, but we are not going to lose our jobs because of it. There are men and women in Ireland and England to whom a struggle of this character is going to mean hunger and suffering.</P>
    <P>I am going to exhaust every possibility, to strain every endeavour, without regard to pride or prejudice or conceit or anything else, in an effort to adjust the matter.  I would be prepared to humble myself in any respect if I could protect our people and the English people from the disasters that threaten and, at the same time, maintain the honour of this country.  I believe President de Valera at this present moment is of the same mind.  I <Col N="1183" /> believe he is struggling to avert what may be a catastrophe.  If this Bill passes, if this Government insists on putting this Bill through all its stages to-day, they are making the task that confronts us much more difficult.</P>
    <P>I will not put forward here the armament manufacturers' slogan that the way to secure peace is to prepare for war.  I believe the way to secure peace in this matter is to show the world that you are able to sacrifice everything but national honour for peace; that you are prepared to show every forbearance and every courage to resist misrepresentation in order to preserve peace.  It is a matter of indifference to me what motives are attributed to me when I vote against this Bill in the circumstances in which it has been introduced to-day.  I will vote against it because I believe it is being pressed through the Oireachtas to the jeopardy and the destruction of peace.  To that proceeding I will never be a party.</P>

      <P>I intervene on a point of practice.  There are only 12 minutes left.  The discussion of this Bill has been appallingly curtailed.  It is a measure of great importance. Members of the Government have spoken on it.  The practice of the House has been&mdash;and I myself as a Minister have been subject to it, and so also has the ex-Minister for Finance &mdash;that, in the interests of the Government and their convenience in doing the business of the State, when the Dáil was deprived of normal privilege in discussion it was then recognised that the Opposition ought to have free play.  The Minister who moved that the time be curtailed is now about to rise again in order to prevent anybody else speaking.  I would like to point out that I stood up on a previous occasion when Deputy McGilligan got up to speak and he was called upon first.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Two points have been made in this debate.  First of all, the point was made that the Government of the Irish Free State are unreasonable in demanding that we must get the legal question out of the way.  What is the legal question which we must get out of the way?  This agreement of 1923, the only argument which the British Government have pleaded against us in connection with this issue.  We have stigmatised that document as a secret document.  An attempt was made here in the House to-day to show that that document had been put before the people.  If it were put before the people, why are there letters on this file from one Minister of the last Government to another stating that he considered it undesirable to publish the text of the agreement reached with the British Government? Why is there another letter on this file from the ex-Minister for Finance to the British Treasury refusing to permit that Treasury, in furtherance of a test case which they wished to try in a British court, to publish and make public Part I. of that agreement which deals entirely with the Land Annuities? If it were not secret why is there a proposal on the file that if the British Government found it essential to publish <Col N="1186" /> the agreement, in order to win its case in a British court, that that Part (Part I.) of the agreement, dealing with the Land Annuities, should be pasted over?  If this was not a secret agreement, why did they demand that it should be pasted over before the agreement could be produced in a British court?</P>
      <P>As to the second point, it has been said that we are unreasonable in demanding that the personnel of the tribunal should not be confined to members of the British Commonwealth. The late Government in a dispute of much less importance than this, refused to accept another Commonwealth tribunal&mdash;everyone of them, I see, has left the Front Bench, including Deputy McGilligan who was the Minister principally concerned with it at the time.  They have left because they were afraid they would be challenged. They refused; and we have refused too.  Suppose that between the Governments of Australia and Canada and Great Britain there was a dispute as important as this between those countries and that Australia or Canada refused to accept the tribunal accepted by the British Government, that they refused to have the membership of that tribunal restricted to members of the British Commonwealth.  What attitude would the British Government have taken up?  I can answer that by a quotation from the debates in the British House of Commons on the 6th of this month.  Mr. Lansbury speaking on that date said:</P>
      <P>If I thought any appeal was any good I would make it, but I feel it is almost useless.  Yet on the simple narrow issue of who shall arbitrate and who the Chairman shall be, I challenge whoever is going to reply to say, if South Africa and Canada had a dispute, would anyone dare to stand at that Box and declare that, if they choose to go outside the Empire the British Government could prevent them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>And Mr. Thomas, the present Secretary for the Dominions, replied &ldquo;No.&rdquo; No, if Canada, or Australia want to go outside, they will not prevent them. But if the Irish Free State, with its bitter experience of the Boundary <Col N="1187" /> Commission to guide it in this matter, says &ldquo;We must go outside,&rdquo; then, rather than allow them the free choice which would be allowed to Canada and Australia they say &ldquo;No, we will declare economic war upon you if you do this, we will make the streets of your cities filled with hungry people.&rdquo;  They have said that they will do that.  The purpose of this Bill is not to wage economic war upon them, not to destroy England's industry, but to safeguard our own people against hunger and want, to open up new markets for our goods if the British market is closed to us and to recoup, from the hostages which British industry has given to this country&mdash;to recoup our citizens for any loss which British penal statutes may inflict upon them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give us an undertaking in relation to this measure that, if the Bill comes into operation, it will not be used to impose any further burden on the already over-burdened farmers of this State?  I want an assurance from the <Col N="1188" /> Minister as to that.  This House will not be sitting, and we want to know that those powers will not be used in such a manner as will inflict any additional burden on the agricultural community of this State.</P>

      <P>Leanfar den réim sin agus bainfear breis feidhme as an nGaedhilg mar úirlís múinte do réir mar bhéas na múinteoirí agus na leanbhaí ag teacht isteach ar an nGaedhilg go dtí go mbeidh gach adhbhar scoile, ach amháin an Béarla.  dá mhúineadh tré Ghaedhilg do sna leanbhaí go léir ins na bun-scoileanna, d'fhonn is go mbeidh ar a gcumas an Ghaedhilg d'úsáid mar a ngnáth-theangain i gcúrsaí an tsaoghail.</P>
      <P>Is ar an gcuma so dar liom a tiubharfar thar n-ais an teanga mar theanga labhartha na tíre.</P>
