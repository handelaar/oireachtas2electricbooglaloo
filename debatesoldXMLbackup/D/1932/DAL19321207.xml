      <P>asked the President if, having regard to paragraph (3) of the despatch of 6th July, 1932, received by him from the British Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (P. No. 829), he still adheres to his statement made in the Dáil on the 19th October, 1932, that as regards arbitration the British Government had signified its readiness to arbitrate on the question of the land annuities provided the tribunal was of the character outlined in the 1930 Imperial Conference Report.</P>

      <P>The passage in my speech of October 19th cited by the Deputy referred to the original attitude of the British Government on the question of arbitration.  The despatch of July 6th indicated no change except in detail; the British Government still adhered, and, so far as we are aware, still adheres, to its refusal to refer the dispute to a freely chosen tribunal.</P>

      <P>I have asked if, having regard to a certain paragraph in the despatch of 6th July last, the President still adheres to the Statement he made in the Dáil.  That statement was that the British Government had signified its readiness to arbitrate on the question of the land annuities provided the tribunal was of the character outlined in the 1930 Imperial Conference Report.  The despatch says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The form of tribunal which His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have proposed was that recommended at the Imperial Conference <Col N="860" /> of 1930 and, for that reason, this form of tribunal still seems to them to be the most appropriate. Nevertheless, they are ready, in order to arrive at an amicable settlement, to consider any variation in the form of tribunal which His Majesty's Government in the Irish Free State may wish to suggest, so long as its members are drawn from within the British Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>Has there not been a change?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know if the Vice-President would still consider it inaccurate to say that the British Government have signified their readiness to arbitrate provided the tribunal is of the character outlined in the 1930 Imperial Conference Report, despite what I have read from the despatch of the 6th July.  Arising out of that, I asked previously, and was told to wait until the despatch was in my hands, if there is anything to prevent nationals of the Irish Free State being appointed as representatives or as nominees of the Government or, for that matter, if there is anything to prevent a Free State national being appointed as chairman of the tribunal.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs to state (1) if it is a fact that a Mr. S. Nunan has been appointed to a post in the Office of the Saorstát Consul-General at New York, or attached in any capacity to any of our Diplomatic or Consular establishments in the United States of America; (2) if so, on what grounds was the making of a new post recommended and decided; (3) if Mr. Nunan was appointed after his qualifications had been investigated and <Col N="861" /> reported upon by any Board or Committee of Selection, and, if so, what was the composition of this Board; (4) what are the qualifications of Mr. Nunan for this appointment and (5) if the creation of the new post/or the appointment of Mr. Nunan thereto were recommended in the report made by Mr. S. O'Mara.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly (for the Minister for External Affairs)</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Seán Nunan has been appointed to the post of Consul in the Saorstát Consulate-General at New York.  The appointment took effect on the 1st November of this year.  This appointment did not involve the creation of a new post.  The services of the officer who previously held this post are being retained in the New York Consulate pending his transfer to another post.  Mr. Nunan was an officer in the Dáil service from 1919 to 1923, during which time he served in Dublin and in the United States.  He applied for reinstatement in the Civil Service to the Committee of Enquiry into the cases of civil servants who resigned or were dismissed for political reasons and was recently reinstated on the recommendation of that Committee.  His appointment to the post of Consul was not considered by a selection board, as I was satisfied, in view of his previous service in the United States and his knowledge of American conditions gained during ten years' residence there, that he was particularly suited for this post.  The appointment of Mr. Nunan was accordingly made under Section 6 (2) of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1924, as amended by Section 3 of the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act, 1926.  Mr. O'Mara's report did not make any recommendation with regard to Mr. Nunan.</P>

      <P>As the Vice-President has stated that this man was employed in the Dáil service from 1919 to 1923, I should like to know what Department of State he was employed in during the last six months of the period and what office he held in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some particulars of his career in the service here. I shall read all the information I have <Col N="862" /> with regard to him.  Mr. Nunan was a clerk in the First Dáil from January to April, 1919.  From April, 1919, to June, 1919, he was Private Secretary to the President of Dáil Eireann.  In June, 1919, he was sent to the United States in connection with the raising of the Dáil Loan.  From December, 1919, to December, 1921, he was Registrar of the Republican Bonds Organisation. In December, 1921, he returned to Ireland.  In April, 1922, he took charge of relief work and served on the White Cross Committee up to September, 1922.  In September, 1922, he was suspended from duty and placed on half pay until January, 1923.  From January, 1923, he received no pay, so that he may be regarded as dismissed from that date.  It is understood that Mr. Nunan went to the United States in 1924.</P>

He was a successful business man and held a very responsible and important post in a large stock-broker's office in New York.</P>

      <P>The benefit of the agricultural grant already extends to agricultural land situate within the boundaries of urban districts constituted since the passing of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898.  The question of the future application of a proportion of the grant to other urban districts is under consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken care to differentiate between land in country towns and land within the boundaries of cities and large towns which would have considerable value as potential building ground.  There is a unanimous demand that agricultural land within the urban boundary of these small country towns should have the advantages to be derived from de-rating. Perhaps the Minister would bring in an amendment to this effect to the Bill which is at present going through the House?</P>

      <P>An offer was made to Miss Jennings for the purchase of 176 acres of the lands of Granure and Gorteenard and refused by her.  These lands were subsequently gazetted under the provision of Section 24 (3) of the Land Act, 1923, with a view to their acquisition.  The owner's objection to the acquisition of the lands was partly disallowed by the Land Commission, but she appealed to the Judicial Commissioner and her appeal is pending for hearing.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been drawn to a case recently heard before the District Justice at Ennistymon when a baker was convicted and fined for not selling bread by weight, the defence in the case being that the bread in question was fancy bread and as such appeared to be exempt from the terms of the Act which states that all bread must be sold by weight, except fancy bread and further, to ask the Minister if he will give instructions for the cessation of such prosecutions throughout the country until the law is amended or until a properly agreed definition is arrived at as to what constituted &ldquo;fancy bread.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That is not an answer to the question put down.  The Minister must be aware that there has been a good deal of trouble in the county with regard to these prosecutions, and a great amount of difficulty with regard to the definition of what is fancy bread.  I ask the Minister if he intends at any time in the near future to bring in legislation dealing with the sale of bread by weight, and dealing with a proper definition of what constitutes fancy bread.  At the present time what is called household bread in one part of the country is fancy bread in another, and a prosecution under one heading in one district will fail in another part of the country <Col N="869" /> owing to local usage.  Speaking on behalf of the trade generally, I may say that we are anxious that there should be some proper definition arrived at in regard to the sale of bread.  In any legislation that he may introduce will the Minister consult the traders through the Irish Master Bakers' Association, so that a proper understanding may be arrived at?</P>

      <P>The position in regard to the sale of bread is governed by a very old statute, dated 1838, I think.  An amendment of that statute has been under consideration and certain proposals have been already put forward with that object in view. I have no doubt that when the matter arises for legislation the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be glad to consult with the responsible people in the trade with regard to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that millers and dealers in some parts of the country hold large stocks of oats for which there is at the moment comparatively little demand, owing principally to the abundant harvest of cereals and potatoes, and also to the fact that the milling industry, in anticipation of the coming into force of the Maize-plus-home-grown grain Mixing Scheme on the 12th October last turned out for distribution to retailers abnormally large quantities of ordinary maize meal during the preceding ten days.  I am in hopes that when those abnormal supplies become exhausted, which must happen shortly, the demand for meal will revive.  Moreover, when the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Bill, now before the Oireachtas, becomes law, it will be practicable, should circumstances render this course desirable, to require millers to use such increased percentage of home-grown grain in the meal mixture during the remainder of the cereal year as will go far towards absorbing such stocks of oats as may reasonably be regarded as surplus to the national requirements for other purposes.</P>

      <P>There is on the Order Paper to-day, as the House will see, the Second Stage of the Auctioneers Bill.  Since I got leave to introduce that Bill the question of procedure has arisen. It has been pointed out to me that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges discussed this general question as to what should happen a Bill which had gone a certain distance in one Parliament, and the question of completing it came up in another Parliament, and they came to a decision on a certain resolution which ought to be put forward in the first place.  It seems the best thing for me to do is to ask the House to-day for leave to withdraw this Bill, and move that resolution, and then re-introduce the Bill next session.  I propose to ask the House for leave to do that, so that the Bill may get the advantage of having complied already with Standing Orders.  I ask the House to give me leave to withdraw the Bill for the present, to move the resolution which has been prepared later, and I ask leave to re-introduce the Bill.</P>

      <P>This Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Bill was to be the great hall-mark of the Minister for Agriculture as an agriculturist. We were told all through the summer that we were to wait and see, and that, no matter how desperate the conditions might be to which Irish agriculture had been reduced, as soon as the Minister for Agriculture had placed his great remedies before the country, all our difficulties would vanish away; that the most wonderful vista of prosperity would be opened <Col N="884" /> up to the agriculturist; that he would have nothing to do except to walk forward very straight and easy and play his cards to win.  Those were the promises which were held out when this Bill was still in the mind of the Minister for Agriculture.  But when this Bill came before the House, and when we had an opportunity of seeing this great measure of relief for Irish agriculture, we discovered that it is a Bill which can be of only the most trivial benefit to the farmers in any part of the country, and it can be of no benefit but it will, as a matter of fact, act to the detriment of the majority of the farmers of this State.</P>
      <P>As a result of this Bill we are going to have these fantastic regulations as to the mixture of portions of homegrown grain with Indian meal.  That is to be one of the great cures for the distressed state of agriculture now&mdash; that one farmer is to sell his grain to another farmer and buy back the other farmer's grain in exchange, there being nothing but the miller's profits and the retailer's profit placed in between those two farmers.  Farmer A wants yellow meal and he is compelled to buy yellow meal or Indian meal which contains certain proportions of the refuse corn from Farmer B's farm.  If Farmer B wants to buy a certain amount of yellow meal, he has got to buy a mixture which will contain the refuse corn from Farmer A's farm.  This extraordinary business by which one farmer is to sell his corn to another farmer is supposed to make both rich, instead of doing what it will do&mdash;tend to impoverish both.  Though a man will have a certain amount of his own oats which he can use, he has to buy at a higher price some proportion of some other farmer's oats, barley or wheat, and this is to set Irish farming upon its legs!  That is to enrich the Irish farmer!!  And then we come on to this encouragement to the growing of wheat to such an extent that it is going to enrich every farmer in this State who decides upon growing wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is one thing clear at the present moment it is this: that in no part of the world is wheat growing at the present moment profitable&mdash;that in no part of the world at the present <Col N="885" /> moment can wheat growing be made pay.  There is an enormous overproduction of wheat.  There is a surplus of wheat all over the world. Growers of wheat are at a loss what to do with their wheat owing to their inability to find a market for it.  It is just at this time that the Government here decides that the one crop which the world over is being sold at a loss to the producer is the crop upon which a very considerable sum of the money of this State is to be expended.  I have here in my hands a circular sent out by one of the largest importers of wheat in this State.  It is a circular sent out to the customers of that firm. It is dated 10th November, 1932, and it contains this very significant remark:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In a cable from Winnipeg yesterday the <i>Times</i> correspondent mentions the fact that sawdust is dearer than wheat.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is not surprising that sawdust should be dearer than wheat, because in the large wheat-growing areas of the world, since they cannot sell their wheat as a food for man or beast, they are compelled to utilise it as a fuel. Naturally, they find sawdust a better fuel than wheat, and at the present moment in Winnipeg, the centre of the great Canadian grain-bearing district, people are actually receiving more for sawdust than they are for wheat.</P>
    <P>This is the time at which the Minister thinks it well that State money should be&mdash;I will not say lavished&mdash; expended for the purpose of inducing farmers to grow an unprofitable crop. I listened to the very hard-hearted speech in which the Minister introduced this Bill and I know that he is now satisfied that the Bill is going to have very little effect indeed.  I believe he knows that failure is going to attend its operation.  His estimate of the amount of tillage that will follow the expenditure of State money is, I think, in the neighbourhood of 60,000 acres.  A great deal of that land, no doubt, is already under tillage.  But 60,000 acres, out of the millions of acres of arable land in this State, represents little more than a flea-bite.  Wheat-growing this year, <Col N="886" /> even under the Minister's most sanguine estimates, will affect but an infinitesimal portion of the area of the State and will be of advantage only to a very small number of farmers.  If you look at the area under wheat in Connaught you will observe that even if it were twice as large&mdash;and that is the estimate of the area to be put under wheat next year&mdash;it would still be insignificant.  For the whole County of Mayo, so far as I can calculate, it will mean a subsidy of only £800.</P>
    <P>We were told&mdash;I do not think we will be told now, because, after all, there is a limit to human audacity&mdash;that once this great measure was operating the Irish farmer would immediately see salvation at hand.  It seems to be quite clear that, apart from small areas especially favoured by climate and special pockets of soil, this is not a country in which wheat can be grown with any reasonable prospect of being able to compete with the enormous wheat-growing areas of the world, which, for generations to come, can more than supply the world's wheat requirements.</P>
    <P>I know it has been said that Ireland at one time produced a very considerable amount of wheat.  No doubt that was the case, but it was wheat grown under circumstances absolutely different from the circumstances of to-day.  At that time the plough was known only to a comparatively small extent in this country and almost all the work was done by spade labour. Wheat was undoubtedly grown, but its cultivation was already declining. That was a period when a man received only six-pence as wages for a whole day's work. Spade labour was practically for nothing and the land could be tilled in a fashion which would be absolutely impossible nowadays.  In those days this country was competing with other countries in which mechanised production had not come into being; it was competing with other countries before the steamer had become a practical proposition and, in consequence, the dues for the importation of wheat into this country or Great Britain were very much heavier than they are now.</P>
    <P>Except possibly on one or two farms in certain areas, I do not believe you <Col N="887" /> will get anybody to agree that he can grow wheat profitably under the terms of this Bill.  Nobody will agree, I think, that the country is going to be lifted by this measure out of the state of poverty in which other measures of the Government and the folly which the Government have shown since they came into office have plunged the entire farming community.  They have practically killed, so far as it lay in their power to kill, the industry which must always be the principal industry of the country&mdash;the rearing of livestock of all classes.  If agriculture is to be carried on in a common-sense fashion in this State that must surely be regarded as the principal industry. At the moment the Government have practically killed it and they have reduced all our farmers, especially the small farmer, to a state of poverty.</P>
    <P>This Bill, instead of helping the small farmer, is going to hurt him.  He can get no advantage from any subsidy which this Bill provides.  He will have to buy the flour and the yellow meal which it is necessary for him to have. Flour nowadays is regarded as a necessary, but if we have the present Minister for Agriculture in office for another few years it may not be regarded as a necessary of life in this State; the ordinary small farmer may have to regard flour, as the Minister for Finance told him not so long ago, as an unnecessary luxury.  The small farmer at the present time does think that he is entitled to a better diet than mere potatoes.  He thinks he is entitled to have flour as a food for himself and his family.  He thinks he is entitled to the full advantage of the fall in wheat prices and he believes that fall should be reflected in cheaper flour.  This year, when the cattle trade, the pig trade, the egg trade, and all the other trades upon which the farmer has been living have broken down, is essentially a year in which every single thing which is a necessary to the farmer should be kept down in price.  There should be a subsidy for the importation of flour just as there should be a subsidy for the importation of meal and artificial manures, instead of having a tax upon these things.  The ordinary <Col N="888" /> farmer is being hit by this measure and not helped.  If you are helping anybody, you are helping just a favoured few in a favoured area.</P>
    <P>When I turn to the Bill itself, I see failure written all over it.  When I look at the details of the Bill, when I see the elaborate machinery that is to be set up, when I have regard to the cost of that machinery, and when I consider the number of new officials which will be necessary if the Bill is to be in any way workable, I say that money which might be spent profitably to the farmer is, so far as he is concerned, being flung away.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture must admit that, in its present form, the Bill is unworkable.  It would only be workable if the Minister would give us some definition of &ldquo;millable wheat.&rdquo; If there is to be no definition of &ldquo;millable wheat,&rdquo; if it is to be any stuff which can be put into a mill and ground, then God help the unfortunate persons who have to eat the flour. Every grain of wheat, no matter how defective it may be or how diseased it may be, whether it be a crop affected by smut or a crop that has grown a second time in the stooks, can be put into a mill unless there is a definition of &ldquo;millable wheat,&rdquo; and unless the wheat must conform to a certain standard before the subsidy can be paid for it.  The Minister tells us that it passes his wit and the wit of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and their joint wits to produce a definition of &ldquo;millable wheat.&rdquo;  But they will have one, they say, some time.  They will have a regulation.  If they are able to frame a regulation, why cannot they frame an Act of Parliament?  If they are able to define &ldquo;millable wheat&rdquo; for the purpose of a regulation, why cannot they define &ldquo;millable wheat&rdquo; for the purpose of this Bill?  Are their brains going to improve suddenly; are they going to be very much superior intellectually next April or May, or at this time next year?  Are they going to be intellectually better so that the feat impossible to-day will be possible to them a year from now?  Will they tell us the reason why they expect a problem that defeats them to-day to prove <Col N="889" /> soluble in the immediate future?  It is plain to the intelligence of every person that the reason why we have no definition of &ldquo;millable wheat&rdquo; is that any definition which the Minister would venture to put forward would shut out nine-tenths of the wheat crop of this State.  The definition would have to be so lax and the quality of flour which the consumer would have to accept and be satisfied with would, in consequence, be so wretched that the Minister is afraid to put a definition in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Last night we discussed this precious maize section, under which a certain amount of maize in stone bags, as it originally was, was to be allowed to be sold, at a necessarily enhanced price, to the poor, who are portion of this community and who have to take maize meal as portion of their diet. The Minister told us that by means of his amendment he would bring in regulations later.  Why are all these regulations to come later?  Is it not that the Minister finds it now beyond his capacity to frame a workable Bill and is endeavouring to postpone the evil day?  He sees as clearly as everybody else that he cannot frame a workable Bill upon these lines and he is deliberately asking for time to have regulations brought in.  If his mind were clear, if he had thought out this Bill, I presume he would be just in as fit a position at present to let us know his thoughts upon these subjects as he would be at any future time.  But he shirks; he will not let us know.  He is simply begging for time, so that the period of his being found out even by his own most rabid supporters will be somewhat postponed.  This is a rank bad Bill all through.  It is a Bill which is supposed to help the farming industry and it is a Bill which is not helping the farming industry.  It is a Bill which, I hold, is a waste of public money and a detriment instead of a help to the farmer.  In consequence, I shall ask the House to vote against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Since Fianna Fáil came into office one Bill after another has been brought before this House for a declared purpose.  On examination, it has frequently been proven that the <Col N="890" /> declared policy is subsidiary to a very different line of policy enshrined in the Bill.  So far as this Bill is a Bill to prevent any individual getting monopolistic control of the milling industry here, it is a good Bill. Monopoly by an individual or by a Government is bad.  But if there must be monopoly, I should rather have a monopoly controlled by an Irish Government than a monopoly controlled by an English, French or German syndicate.  If the Bill stopped at providing safeguards against a monopoly of the milling industry in this country I should support it.  But it does not.</P>
      <P>This Bill embarks upon a much wider field of activity and it starts that journey without any steering gear, because the Minister was forced to confess in the early stages of this Bill that neither he nor his advisers could devise a definition of millable wheat. That admission immediately opens the scope of this Bill illimitably and denies to this Dáil any knowledge of the true amount of its liability under the provisions of this Bill.  As far as we were able to find out in the course of the debate, the Minister, according to the circumstances prevailing in each year, can raise or lower the standard for millable wheat, and even as he raise or lowers it he will not be able to define any general rule for any particular year by which every sample of wheat is to be judged.  Where that blank in the Bill is going to lead him I do not know, and I do not think he knows himself.  That in itself I think condemns that part of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the principle underlying the Government's policy of promoting the growth of wheat?  I could understand a policy designed to increase tillage with a view to absorbing unemployed persons in rural areas at any cost, but I would expect any Minister for Agriculture to have as the sheet anchor of his policy the encouragement of farmers to use their land to the best advantage.  I ask the Minister this question: If there are two varieties of wheat which may be sowed and one will produce 15 barrels to the acre and the other ten barrels, which would his Department recommend the farmers to sow?  Surely the one that would yield <Col N="891" /> 15 barrels.  If that be true, if the Minister for Agriculture knows that the farmers can sow some crop other than wheat and dispose of that crop and with the proceeds of that sale buy all the wheat their land could produce and have a margin over, why does he subsidise them to grow wheat?  Why does he encourage them to make a use of their land which is not the most productive use that they can make of it? Why does he encourage them to cultivate an uneconomic crop and a crop which he knows in this country is particularly vulnerable to weather? The only answer I have heard from the Minister so far to that question was that he desired to create a situation wherein the people of this country can survive war or the cutting off of foreign supplies of wheat.  If the Minister seriously recommends a Bill of this magnitude to Dáil Eireann on the ground that there is hanging over this country the continuous peril of war, then I think he has chosen a weak ground on which to defend his Bill. But I cannot imagine any other answer than that weak and futile answer to the dilemma I put to him.  I would be interested to hear from the Minister, before he seeks final approval for this Bill, what his answer is to the question: Why his Government encourages the people to sow a crop which he knows himself will not give the best return that they might get for their industry?</P>
    <P>Now we come to the last objection to this Bill and, to my mind, the gravest.  It is the duty of every State, I should think, to look after the interests of every section of the people they are called upon to govern, but their first solicitude should be for the weakest section, and the weakest section of the community is the poorest section.  This Bill, by its provisions in Part VI and the other parts governing the milling of maize, by the Minister's own admission is calculated to increase the cost of the staple feeding stuffs of the pig-rearing industry and of the egg-production industry.  I do not have to tell the Minister, or any member of this House, that these two industries are the mainstay of the people in the <Col N="892" /> congested areas.  Since the first day that the land war was started in Ireland it has been the purpose of Irish leaders to do everything they could to ameliorate the conditions of the people living in the congested areas, and, under the British Government, the special difficulties they had to contend with daily were recognised by the institution of the C.D.B.  There was a removal of red tape, there was a freedom of action given to the C.D.B., because the Government were compelled to admit by those who represented the Irish people at that time, that the circumstances under which the people in the congested areas lived called for very special treatment and nothing was allowed to stand in the way of making their lot easier in so far as the Government could do it.  I need not remind the Minister of the way in which the C.D.B. was financed. If he would cast his mind back to it he will see that it typifies the whole attitude of the then British Government towards that problem.</P>
    <P>Now the first big act of policy on his part as an Irish Minister for Agriculture is to tell these people plainly that he is going to increase the cost of the sheet anchor of their principal industries of pig-rearing and egg-production. I do not know how he could have avoided doing it if he was resolved to proceed upon the lines outlined in this Bill, but I think that that consideration alone should have convinced him that these parts of the Bill which were calculated to do that should have been abandoned.</P>
    <P>There is a wider consideration, and a weightier consideration even than that. Deputy McMenamin and myself, and I have no doubt the members of his own Party&mdash;Deputy Brady and Deputy Blaney&mdash;have informed the Minister that maize meal is an essential foodstuff not only of the congested areas as a whole, but of the poorest people in the congested areas.  I want to place on record now my appreciation of the readiness with which the Minister attempted to meet that matter, but I think the mere fact that he was obliged to admit that that aspect of the situation had escaped his notice entitles me to believe that he did not examine <Col N="893" /> that aspect of this case exhaustively before committing himself to this policy.  I think the Minister has gone a long way towards meeting the food aspect of this problem, and I do not despair that he will come the rest of the way by making regulations for the congested area rather earlier than he proposed to make them.  I cannot believe that if the Executive Council had thoroughly appreciated the great difficulties they are putting in the way of the everyday life of the poorest people in this country in making their living by pig rearing and egg production, or if they had realised the burden that their proposals were going to lay on those people who use Indian meal as a foodstuff, they would have sanctioned the introduction of this Bill in its present form.  I am satisfied that in so far as this Bill promotes the sowing of wheat in this country it will be a failure.  As I said before, I recognise that the Minister has certain loyalties, and I respect him for them. I can very well remember when one of the main planks of Sinn Féin was that we should make this country self dependent and starve John Bull.  I think I can even remember when Deputy Finian Lynch was in charge of the business of starving John Bull by slaughtering pigs on Aston Quay.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of which the Minister for Agriculture and Deputy McGilligan were such adornments.  I respect the Minister for that tradition, but I do think that when the responsibilities of office fell upon him he should have considered his loyalties with that same dispassionate calm with which some other things are considered.  I heard recently another stalwart of his Party referring to the extraordinary difficulties of dealing with the transport problem in this country.  He said that in Opposition the solution of the difficulties that lay in the way of the <Col N="894" /> Government in the matter of transport seemed easy, but that from the Government Benches they assumed a most extraordinary complexity.  All honour to him for that admission.  He went on to say that when his Party perceived the complexity of the problem they made up their minds it was not a problem into which they should rush without very careful consideration, and that they were giving that very careful consideration to the problem now. I am afraid that in the matters referred to in this Bill those prudent counsels did not prevail, and loyalty to an old and out-of-date belief prompted the Minister to draft the later parts of this Bill, prompted the Fianna Fáil Party to support the later parts of this Bill, and will encourage the Fianna Fáil Government to make it the law of this land.  If they do, it will not be the first misfortune that Sinn Féin brought to Ireland, and I am afraid it will not be the last.</P>

      <P>The self-supporting, independent policy of Sinn Féin was a tragedy according to Deputy Dillon, and apparently the benevolence of John Bull in catering for the congested districts was a blessing, according to him.  I do not know if we can accept that to be the fact in view of our experience in later years, and even in the years when this wonderful, benevolent John Bull catered so very well for the congested districts of this country, according to Deputy Dillon. He accused the Minister of loyalty to an old policy which he holds is out of date.  I am afraid that Deputy Dillon is an upholder of an older policy, which is much more out of date, and even out of custom, than the one he accuses the Minister of upholding now and enshrining in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Dillon were not so overcome by loyalty to an old and out-of-date policy he would be able to advance with the times&mdash;he would be able to see something good in the measures which are brought forward here to make this country self-supporting and independent of John Bull, and he would not criticise them from the old and ancient standpoint which we used to be accustomed to years ago from <Col N="895" /> another Party in the very early days of Sinn Féin.  The only real reason, as far as I can see, why this measure is being opposed by people on the opposite benches is that we cannot, they hold, compete with outside countries in producing wheat.  Because Canada can produce wheat at a very low figure, this country should not make an attempt to produce wheat. Can Deputy Dillon or Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, who criticised this measure, tell us of anything we can produce here that cannot be produced in an outside country at a cheaper rate?  Can they point to any industry that has been established here by the aid of subsidies from Cumann na nGaedheal, or the aid of subsidies from this Government, that can be carried on here cheaper and more economically than it can be carried on by any outside country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan is not so well bred as Deputy Cosgrave. He does not understand such matters. By a little more association with Deputy Cosgrave he may be able to imbue some of that good breeding, and be able to conduct himself in this House a little better.  We are told that wheat should not be grown here because it can be produced cheaper in Canada.  Let that suggestion be carried to its logical conclusion and we ought to give up all our industries and buy in the cheapest market outside. <Col N="896" /> There is no other logical conclusion which can be reached from the arguments of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's remedy would be not only to buy wheat in the cheapest market, but this year he would subsidise the importation of flour; he would subsidise the importation of maize meal; he would subsidise the importation of every type of feeding stuff that is to be used by people in the West of Ireland for the feeding of pigs and fowl.  That is Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's alternative to this Bill.  I wonder would he go to the County Mayo and preach that doctrine.  If he would, where are the subsidies to come from which would go to aid the farmers in producing live stock?  Where would you find subsidies for the importation of flour and the importation of feeding stuffs?  I think Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney would have to increase the taxation to find those subsidies which would go to help our farmers.  I know that the British may have done very well in their days of benevolence, if we are to believe Deputy Dillon, in looking after the Gaeltacht and in having the Congested Districts Board, but I know people in the West of Ireland who are more anxious to avail of this Bill than they were of any of the British Acts which were introduced in the West of Ireland. The Opposition are not aware evidently that in the County of Mayo agricultural instructors cannot supply the amount of seed which is at present being demanded of them by the small farmer in preparing for the growing of wheat. They have not half the amount of seed available which is being asked for by the farmers of Mayo for the growing of wheat this year, and I suggest the small farmers of Mayo know their business just as well as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, who is not a small farmer or a tillage farmer in any capacity.  I think that fact alone should be a lesson to those who oppose this measure.  The farmers are convinced there is something good in the measure, and I think the Minister is to be congratulated in letting this measure pass through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard talk of a monopoly being made by the flour millers.  There was a <Col N="897" /> monopoly created during the Cumann na nGaedheal Government of flour millers.  That was quite acceptable. That was quite all right to Deputy Dillon and the others.  Or was it simply because those flour millers could be circularised by Deputy McGilligan for Cumann na nGaedheal funds?  Is it because all that is to be changed and that flour millers can no longer be circularised by Cumann na nGaedheal for election funds that all the opposition is to this measure?  I suspect it has a lot to do with it.  If that is the real reason I am convinced more than ever that this is a good Bill and will be accepted as such by the farmers throughout the country.</P>

      <P>It is a pity we cannot discuss wheat without having a Deputy of the type of Deputy Cleary thrown in as part of the landsturm to try and turn the tide, and when the trap drops on Fianna Fáil he has to fall back on the economic policy of the Government.  Deputy Cleary made a statement once about the Civil Service.  When I asked his leader about that, the Deputy got the most scornful repudiation that any decent man ever had to submit to, and I hope I am not misquoting him in using those two words.  On another occasion the Deputy made a particular statement in this House and was challenged to produce evidence to support it and in the end the House accepted that the Deputy was behaving as usual, and that he had deserved the imputation which his own President put upon him with regard to the accuracy and with regard to the objective truths of statements he has been guilty of from time to time in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told by the Deputy, and I put it on a par with most of his other statements, that the small farmers in the county he represents are so keen about wheat growing that the instructors cannot supply sufficient seed.  Is the Minister for Agriculture going to increase his estimate for the amount of subsidy required in the coming year, or did he know previously about this terrible rush to the instructors to get seed wheat for Mayo?  We will judge the Deputy again on the increased acreage under wheat, but we will only <Col N="898" /> judge him when we see the increased acreage, because his statements so far have not attracted from the House the merit of being believed.  So, too, we get this running down to a phrase that if we are going to have as our test for everything in this country the price charged to the consumer for the produced article, then we ought to try our hands at everything.  His own Minister had the brazenness here, about three weeks ago, to tell us that under the particular measure he had for cement we could get cement produced here under the cost at which the cement was being imported.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Cleary when he says he does not put much credit in that statement.  Of course we have produced many things here cheaper than they could be brought in from outside.  That is how the whole economic system of the country is being built up, on the basis that people went in for the type of production that paid them best, and there is no other way in which the economic system is going to be built up in any country except on that particular basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has spoken of the machinery of the Bill, and stated that a more cumbrous measure has never been before the Oireachtas. When we had it discussed the only refuge of the two Ministers in charge was to refer back to the Agricultural Produce Eggs Act.  I was interested to look back over the course of that Bill when it went through the previous Parliament, and the first thing that marked a difference between it and this Bill was this, that the Minister for Agriculture in introducing it had stated that he had it considered with the six or eight organisations which represented the trade in the country. They were not merely in agreement with its terms&mdash;they wanted him to go further.  The measure was brought into this House and it was accepted by the then Opposition and the only difficulty the Minister for Agriculture had in the House with regard to that Bill was to prevent more restrictive clauses being put into it&mdash;clauses which would not restrict the Minister&mdash;they would have given him greater powers&mdash;but would have restricted the producers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="899" /> The only amendment which was brought forward with regard to giving publicity to matters in this House was the one brought forward by the then Deputy Baxter and accepted, and at every stage it was expressed and reiterated that the measure was brought forward after consultation with, and with the consent of, the people who were most concerned. What about this measure?  We have been told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on many occasions that the flour millers are against it.  In fact he fears a conspiracy on their part to defeat the objects of the Bill.  We have been told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the maize millers are against it and he also fears a conspiracy on their part to defeat the object of it, and so he has produced certain drastic clauses in order to give him power to coerce them to do his bidding.</P>
    <P>The two groups mainly concerned and who are affected by this Bill are not in agreement as were the groups affected in the other case.  They are in open hostility to this measure.  Deputy Dillon referred to the pivotal point of this measure as far as one part of it is concerned.  We have three big things attempted in this Bill; one is the imposition of tariff duties upon flour and the attempt to get flour manufactured in this country.  Another is the attempt to get wheat grown in this country and have it milled in this country.  The third thing attempted is the maize meal mixture part of the Bill and all that that part of the Bill attempts.</P>
    <P>But the pivot of the whole measure is in regard to the growing of wheat.  The incentive that was supposed to be given under this Bill was the greater acreage under wheat in this country.  On that the whole thing pivots and on the success of that part of this Bill pivots the whole economy of Fianna Fáil. Yet, as Deputy Dillon pointed out on Clause 6 of this measure, the Minister was compelled to admit that he despaired of getting a definition of millable wheat.  He said later that he was not so despairing now, and so the weakness of the case in bringing in the <Col N="900" /> measure turned entirely as to whether there should be a standard prescribed as to wheat&mdash;as to whether the wheat should be standardised as millable wheat.  But having come to the conclusion that a definition was unattainable that left him in a peculiar position.  Now we get a statement from him that he believes it will be possible for him to get a definition.</P>
    <P>I believe with Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney that it is ludicrous to say that it is not possible to enshrine in some form of words a formula or definition as to what millable wheat is.  But the real explanation of that is the explanation given by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.  If the Minister establishes a definition which is really a wheat definition, the definition of wheat which is fitted to be milled, he knows very well that there is not going to be 16 cwts. of wheat to the acre grown in this country able to pass that test, and he has got to increase it by subsidising what he calls wheat.  He has got to attempt to increase tillage, and the only way he can do it is by having a definition so fantastic that he may be able to get 16 cwts. to the acre out of 18 cwts., which is the normal local production in the country, passed as millable wheat.  And in that connection Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney referred to the matter of the price, and this is the point or one of the points which affects the community mainly, and it has got to be attended to.</P>
    <P>How is the price going to be regulated under this Bill?  As far as the community is concerned we know the community has got to pay the difference between 25/-, that is, the standard price, and whatever is the average ascertained price in any year; and if that average price is very low the cost to the community is going to be very great.  Further, if that average price is very low as representing a very low type of wheat sold, the average cost to the community is going to be very great.  Further, if that average price is very low as representing a very low type of wheat sold, the average cost to the community, from the angle of the bread they buy, is again to be increased.  Surely then it is clear that why there is going to be no definition of millable wheat is because the amount that would pass the standard, if a proper millable standard was fixed, would be so small that the <Col N="901" /> hope of getting an increased half a million acres under wheat in this country would be blown up immediately.</P>
    <P>Supposing we are not going to have a standard prescribed&mdash;and we will come to that point very soon&mdash;it will pay the miller to take whatever wheat is offered to him or, rather, whatever is offered to him as wheat, no matter what rubbish it may be; pay a very small price and convert what is offered to him into flour, not flour that is going to be eaten by humans but into feeding stuffs for animals.  That will be used in some mixture as animal food.  If the price can be beaten down to a half of what it is now because of no standard being prescribed, the miller will find it possible to take anything offered and the grower is not to lose, because for the rubbish he will get the difference between the price paid him and the 25/- that is guaranteed.</P>
    <P>The Minister's answer to that is that it is the farmer's look-out to get the best price that he can.  But then he runs into another difficulty, that the farmer, in fact, has the miller by the throat, because the miller is to be in the position that he must take a certain quota and mill that certain quota of millable wheat, because in certain areas the farmer or group of farmers can offer him whatever they have got and offer it to him at whatever price they ask.  That, of course, will resolve itself in one or two ways. Surely the easier way to resolve that difficulty is not to hold out against the price demanded by the wheat grower. The miller on the whole is the better able to stand the strain.  And there comes a point when if the farmer cannot get a good price it pays him better to get a low price, because he will then be able to sell a very big amount to the miller.  Again, the farmer will not lose, because the miller will get something which he is not bound to put into bread and he can make use of it in some other way.  The grower must get as a bounty the difference between what is paid and what is laid down as the standard price from year to year.</P>
    <P>The object of this as far as the wheat <Col N="902" /> sections are concerned is to increase wheat production in this country.  We are told that is a desirable thing. When we look for arguments as to why it is a desirable thing we are generally told to look at what the acreage was under wheat in 1847 and we are to forget all the circumstances of that ominous year.  What is the use of quoting to us what was grown in this country under entirely different circumstances in 1847?  I may as well point to the fact&mdash;and it has been pointed to as an argument in another case&mdash; that at one time we used to produce an enormous number of ordinary farmers' carts and governess traps. But if anybody was to start a factory and hope at this moment to produce and sell the same number of governess traps and farmers' carts as were sold, say, 50 years ago, he would find it would be a very unwise speculation. Would anybody go now into the business of producing stage coaches in this country because of the fact that we had stage coaches some years ago?</P>
    <P>Why go back to 1847, a time when the wheat lands of the world were not as extensive as they are now, when there was not the competition that there is now, and when the people of the country could not have got the importation from outside at the cheap price that they are getting it now?  There are people here who think, by merely quoting and pointing to a date when we had a particularly big acreage under wheat, nearly 100 years ago, that that is an argument why we should now go back to that type of production.  The Minister sought to give an economic reason for this.  On the 10th November the Minister said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are certain things we would all feel the loss of very much if we were prohibited from importing them.  But if we could reduce certain of our imports by producing these cereals in our own country we would then be in a position to lessen our exports and allow our own people some of the meat, milk and butter that we are exporting.  We could, on the other hand, enlarge our imports in other directions and import some luxuries that we cannot afford to import at present.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="903" /> That is the nearest we got to an economic argument upon this point. The Minister said &ldquo;Let us cut down on certain imports and produce at home.  Then, if we did produce at home we would not have to export so much.&rdquo;  So far, without reservation, that might be taken as correct; but then there is a sudden jump:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We would then be in a position to ... allow our own people some of the meat, milk and butter that we are exporting.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Would the Minister like to develop that economic thesis at length?  Will the Minister take this as a plain statement against his argument, that if you proceed to produce dearly in the country what previously you have been importing cheaply, the purchasing power of the community is to that extent lessened?</P>
    <P>If a man has £100 to spend, and part of it has to go for breadstuffs and he can get enough breadstuffs in a particular period of the year for £5; and if, through production having to be done at home, he has to pay £15 for his breadstuffs, then he has £10 the less to spend on everything else than he previously had.  So far from being able to enjoy some of the things that used to be exported, and even if the country were hopelessly full of previously exportable matter, he is not going to gain in the end, because his purchasing power has been considerably reduced.  That is the thesis on which all this turns&mdash;produce at home, no matter at what cost, and you have immediately gained an advantage.  The argument is that if you can produce at home what you were previously importing and sell it at the same cost you have an advantage, and if you can produce at home what you were importing with only a slight difference in the cost, you are probably gaining, but the probability has to be examined in the light of the wealth produced at home and the new employment given. But if you are going to produce dearly at home in order to make up for previous cheap importations, you are losing, and the whole community, in the matter of breadstuffs, is going to <Col N="904" /> lose because the purchasing power of everyone will be affected; there will be less to go round for other things, necessaries or luxuries.</P>
    <P>At any rate, we are going in for the production of wheat.  We are going to grow, under conditions that are recognised as unsuitable for wheat production, some increased amount of wheat.  I am glad that the hopes are so restricted in the first year, even though it does mean the postponement of the entry into the new Paradise for a longer period.  We are only working up from about 22,000 acres to something less than 70,000 acres, despite the rush for all the seed for the wheat. The whole thing is going to cost the community, by way of subsidy, £200,000.  When that wheat is dried and transported, and when it is eventually milled and turned into bread, there is going to be some cost on the community in addition to the £200,000.  The Minister expects £200,000 to be paid for getting an extra 40,000 acres under wheat.  We will pay in the price of bread, we will pay in the quality of bread.</P>
    <P>I heard this Bill described as being the nearest thing to the Scriptural phrase: &ldquo;Casting your bread upon the waters.&rdquo;  We are going to have given to us for the future wheat with an enormous moisture content and we are not even going to have the Minister determining what is millable wheat. We may have any rubbish.  We may even find that the subsidy per acre on tobacco will work out to the good of the flour millers or to the bad of the flour millers, as the case may be.  We are going to have this dear production at home in lieu of the previous very cheap importation.  We are doing it at a time when this grain was never cheaper.  In the body of the report presented to the House last night as a result of the Ottawa Conference the difficulties of the cereal countries were set out at length, but all turned upon this, that so far as Canada was concerned the type of production which used to bring them in about one-and-a half dollars had now got to the point where for the same quantity there was being given to the producer something slightly more than 50 cents.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> We are going in for this type of a cereal two years after the condition of Austria had become so precarious that the brains and the finance of the League of Nations had to be diverted to the disposal of Austria to get her out of wheat and into the production in which we now are, the production that is so much despised by the Government Party.  With the whole tendency of the world running against this type of production we are going into it under Government pressure, with a host of officials and under circumstances in which even the Minister has declared that he does not know if it would be possible to determine what millable wheat is.  This matter was previously the subject of discussion and examination by a Committee.  That Committee was not, as many other Committees that have examined into the matter have been described&mdash;it could not be described&mdash;as an expert body.  They had before them many experts who gave us the advantage of their particular point of view and their experience in the country.</P>
    <P>The result of that was that nobody could be found, except members of the Fianna Fáil Party, to write down their names to the statement that, eventually, we could get produced in this country the wheat we require for our breadstuffs.  We got a report to that effect signed by them, and we got an addition by two Labour members who sat upon that Commission that they thought that something less ambitious might be achieved in time. But they carefully refrained from saying at what cost.  The majority flatly turned down the whole scheme.  In face of that, we are going into it in this haphazard way.  We are told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in his usual contradictory fashion, that those who oppose this Bill are making the last rally to be made by &ldquo;the advocates of the grass ranches and the bullocks in defence of the policy that has prevailed here for almost a century.&rdquo;  The speeches here, he said, &ldquo;marked the swan song of that policy; the introduction of this Bill marks the end of it.&rdquo;  Having expatiated on the evils of cattle production in this country, he went on to say:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="906" />&ldquo;Deputies spoke of it as an alternative to the raising of live stock and the production of live stock products. It is nothing of the kind.  There is nothing inconsistent with a tillage policy and nothing inconsistent with a wheat policy and the operation of raising live stock and the production of live stock products.  In fact, it is possible to get a greater development of live stock production and the production of live stock products if we have tillage as a basis of our agricultural economy than otherwise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When you speak against this Bill, you are speaking in defence of the ranches and the bullocks, but the argument for the Bill is not that it is going to do away with either the bullocks or the ranches but that it is going to lead to more bullocks as well as to more wheat.  That shows the confusion behind this section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The second part of this Bill deals with flour.  Deputy Dillon has expressed the opinion that if this Bill aimed only at the prevention of a monopoly in the flour milling business in this country, he would vote for it and that he would be particularly pleased to vote for it if it prevented monopoly control of home flour milling by an outside group.  If that case had been made at any time, it could have been answered.  There is no attempt to make the case here that there was a monopoly of Irish flour milling by an outside group.  What we do know is that the Flour Millers Association is in definite hostility to this measure and that that Association is composed, in the main, of Irish millers and not of foreigners.  No statistics have been produced to show, say, that the imports of wheat are going down and that the imports of flour are on the increase.  There is nothing over the last five years&mdash;you have got to take some period like that to allow for changes produced in a small number of months by big purchases made at sea&mdash; to show that flour importations were on the increase and that wheat importations were decreasing.  There is nothing to show that the flour milling industry in this country was on the decline.  Nothing whatever can be shown to prove the contention, so often <Col N="907" /> advanced, that the flour milling industry was passing into the control of foreigners.  One business transaction alone took place&mdash;an ordinary business transaction.  There was no danger of a monopoly and there was certainly no danger of a monopoly under foreign control.  If there was such danger, the minute it was shown, it was possible to meet it.  Because it was recognised as being easily possible to meet, no attempt was made to enforce such a monopoly.  We have the importation of flour now under licences.  We have everything regulated and controlled by the Ministry so as to get flour manufactured here.  In that matter, too, we are lucky; we had that considered by a Commission. That Commission, in a lengthy document, reported in a brief way in so far as the main contentions of the millers were concerned when applying for a tariff on flour.  The Commission pointed out in that Report on the application for a tariff on flour that the applicants do not claim that even with the reduction&mdash;a reduction was likely to take place because the applicants would be operating to greater capacity than before&mdash;their costs would be as low as the present costs of the British mills with which they have to compete. In a later page&mdash;page 41&mdash;of this Report they say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The applicants admit that they themselves will take advantage of their monopoly of the protected market to raise the price of their own flour to a point higher than the price now prevailing but lower than that of flour imported subject to a duty of the amount which they have proposed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Commission further said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The main difficulty which has confronted us in dealing with this application and has prevented us from recommending in its favour is the smallness in the increase in the number of persons likely to be employed in consequence of a tariff, together with our disbelief that the additional output secured by a tariff to the Saorstát millers would enable them to reduce their costs of <Col N="908" /> production sufficiently to prevent a rise in the price of bread.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They reported against the application for a tariff which was small in comparison with what is now on.  They reported against it because there was no great extra employment going to be given and because the applicants admitted that they were going to raise their prices, and that that increase of price was going to be reflected in the price of bread.  There is a calculation which can be easily made.  On the tariff there requested, and without any additional, cost being imposed on the millers through the necessity of having to mill home grown wheat, the extra cost would be £350,000 a year.  We have already £200,000 for a subsidy on wheat and some unascertained amount representing the increase which will take place in the price of bread because of the difficulty of manufacturing Irish grown wheat into flour.  We have the calculation that getting flour manufactured at home, even if it were from imported wheat, would cost about £350,000 more.  We get very little increased employment, and if it is necessary to prevent a monopoly growing up in the country the answer is that we should wait until that shows itself.  It is only imagination which suggests that it has shown itself already.  The forces which have prevented any attempt at a monopoly are still operating, and will continue to operate to prevent any monopolistic growth in regard to flour milling in this country.</P>
    <P>Finally, we have the portion of the Bill which deals with the maize mixture.  In that, also, we are fortunate inasmuch as a Committee has inquired into and reported on it.  In that also we have the advantage of knowing that the people mainly concerned are definitely and clearly hostile to this measure, and that they base their hostility&mdash;they agree almost entirely&mdash;on the reasons set out in the report that was published when this proposal first came forward.  They have their own calculation as to the costs that are going to be entailed on the consumers of these mixtures afterwards. They believe that there is going to be very little advantage to the producer and grower, and there is <Col N="909" /> going to be a heavy cost upon those who mainly use these things.  It must be remembered that the people who mainly use these mixtures are producers of other things, and these mixtures have to be regarded as the raw materials of a business on which the country used to live and from which it derived considerable profit.</P>
    <P>The report is there to be read, but a summary of it was recently given by the Secretary of the Cork Farmers' Union, who wrote upon this proposal when it first emerged in this Bill.  He makes the calculation, founding himself on the facts produced before the Committee, that the very minimum cost of the admixture proposals is going to be £446,000 in a year.  He calculates, and it is a calculation borne out by the figures given in the report, that if the cost of administration, transport, etc., be added, the proposals would entail a total of about £600,000 in increased costs to farmers and breeders.  So we have £600,000 from the maize mixture proposals, £350,000 from the manufacture of flour, leaving out the fact of home-grown wheat altogether.  The Minister's calculation is that, upon the small increase of wheat production which he looks forward to of from 20,000 to 60,000 acres, there is going to be a subsidy paid of £200,000.  If his hopes are fulfilled, and his desire to see this country getting into a half million acres of wheat production, that subsidy will be enormously increased. Remember that the 40,000 is not even extra acreage.  It may be a substitution by people who are doing other things at present.  But to get wheat substituted for something else is going to cost, as far as the subsidy alone is concerned, £200,000; flour manufacture in the country, £350,000; and the maize meal mixture, according to the calculation of those who have written upon it and whose arguments lie there for refutation, if they can be refuted, an extra cost of £600,000.  For the £200,000 part of it, we are to get whatever increase of employment will be given by the 40,000 acres newly put into wheat.  For the milling proposals we get something inconsiderable.  For the maize mixture it is difficult to say if there is anything.  In fact, I think the <Col N="910" /> general defence is that there will be nothing in the way of increased employment, but it is going to prevent certain people going out of a particular type of production.  We are told in this report in a series of paragraphs that the drive for the adoption of these admixture proposals came from the barley-growing districts; that they had their origin in the difficulty of selling the surplus production of that grain, consequent upon the decline in the demand for barley on the part of the brewing and distilling industries.  Then this paragraph follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that the oat has been always by far the largest cereal crop grown in this country... yet oat growers as such, constituting as they do the vast majority of the grain growers of the country, have made no serious demand for the adoption of the admixture proposals as a means of providing them with a market for their produce.</P>
    <P>They report that it is impracticable to suggest any scheme for the administration of a law based on those admixture proposals and they wind up with the point that has been so clearly stressed by Deputy McMenamin and by Deputy Dillon.</P>
    <P>The adoption of the proposals would impose serious hardship on considerable numbers of people in certain parts of the country&mdash;small farmers, cottiers, labourers and others&mdash;of whose daily diet, maize meal, a wholesome and relatively cheap food, forms an important part.</P>
    <P>Then they go on to the question of cost.  In other respects, they say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The admixture proposals do not possess the advantages claimed for them by their advocates&mdash;we are satisfied that a mixed meal composed of 85 per cent. of maize and 15 per cent. of home-grown grain could not be produced at the cost of maize meal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then follows a calculation as to price.</P>
    <P>Here is the new economy.  We are going out of a type of production that has brought profit to this country.  We are going out of a type of production that the most distressed country in Central Europe was asked to go into <Col N="911" /> and we are going into the type of production that that most distressed country was helped out of.  We are going into wheat at a time when wheat was never cheaper.  We do not know what it is going to give in the way of increased employment.  There has been no suggestion that it will mean anything, but we know the Minister's calculation is that £200,000 is to be paid by the people of the country in the way of subsidy on this matter alone.  We are going to make our own flour at a cost of £350,000 extra in the price of bread and we are going to have these admixture proposals, as to which the Tribunal, the maize millers, and at least one farmers' union, vocal on the subject, have estimated that the cost is going to be not less than £600,000 in a year.  All that is being done because the Minister thinks this is a sound economic argument: that if we could reduce certain of our imports by producing cereals in our own country, we would then be in a position to lessen our exports and allow our own people some of the meat, butter and milk that we are exporting.</P>
    <P>For these things, and without any appreciable impact upon employment, we are to pay the total of £200,000, £350,000 and £600,000.  It means that the purchasing power of the community has been lowered by about one million in the year, and that sort of economic advantage is not going to allow this country to be wealthier or happier.  But that is the only approach to an economic argument that they give, and it is entirely vitiated by the fact that the Minister did not take this into the calculation: Are you going to substitute a production at home which is either as cheap or cheaper than you used to import?  If you are not going to do that, and you cannot claim you are going to do that, there must be some other argument used. If we are going to produce more dearly at home what we used to import cheaply, what are the advantages to offset the loss of purchasing power? Is it employment?  Is it wealth of production?  Is it something that will show afterwards that whatever we do produce will be produced better&mdash;a <Col N="912" /> finished article that will be some way better?  These arguments may be used, but they have not been used.  No case has been made on them and the cost to the community at home would damn these proposals.</P>
    <P>In addition to that there is the fact that they will probably prove unworkable. The Minister said that for the wheat part he would only require two experts at about £1,500 for the two. He has estimated, I think, the cost departmentally for the whole measure is not going to be more than a couple of thousand pounds this year and probably three thousand in a full year.  We would like to have that further investigated.  It possibly may not cost more than two thousand or three thousand pounds, but, if it does, it will be because these things will be regarded as unworkable.  They will be derided through the country and nobody will take advantage of them. But that is not the only hope we have. The Minister could assist that hope by getting a definition of &ldquo;millable wheat,&rdquo; and by getting one that would stand the test&mdash;one that would indicate wheat and not rubbish&mdash;but he says he despairs of getting that.  Again, I agree with Deputy Fitzgerald - Kenney that it is not a despair of getting a formula to enshrine a thought.  If there is a thought about what millable wheat is it can be defined in many terms; it can be defined in the general type of definition that is in the British Bill, or in terms of constituents, certain strength or uniformity.  Unless there is a definition there is going to be no reason why the miller should not buy anything that is given to him and mill that, not, happily, for human consumption but for other purposes, and there is no reason why the grower should refuse to take a small price because the community will pay in the long run, and there will be an increased cost to the community in other respects.  That is, however, the only hope we can hold out&mdash;that the Minister will persist in this idea, that he will be ashamed to give a definition which would pass 16 cwts. per acre of Irish wheat as millable, and that in the end the Bill will break down by <Col N="913" /> reason of the many absurdities it contains.</P>

      <P>The principal argument against this Bill, is, I think, the silence of the Deputies on the Government Benches other than the Front Bench. I do not think there is a single Deputy on the Government Back Benches who has got up to make a serious defence of the Bill.  One or two Deputies did speak, but they alluded to the Bill at no great length.  We had an example of that to-day in the speech of Deputy Cleary.  He spoke for some time, but as far as I know he made no reference whatsoever to the Bill.  He did make his usual reference to the actions of Deputies and ex-Ministers on this side, and of course Deputy Cleary could not allow his speech to conclude without his usual reference to the actions of Deputies and ex-Ministers on this side, and of course Deputy Cleary could not allow his speech to conclude without making what I might call a very ignoble reference to Cumann na nGaedheal.  He said&mdash;these may not be his exact words&mdash;that Deputy McGilligan was possibly not interested in the millers except for what he could drag out of them in contributions to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  I say that is a statement that no Deputy with any consideration for veracity ought to make in this House, but it is only what we should expect from our experience of speeches made by Deputy Cleary.  Beyond that, and one or two other little generalities, he did not make any reference whatsoever to any sections of this Bill.  Evidently he was unable to defend the Minister in regard to any sections of it.  I think it was Deputy Dillon who said that the Bill itself was an attempt to put into effect the Minister's loyalty to an old faith.  Perhaps that pretty well expresses it.  We know that the Minister has for years been imbued with the desire to compel farmers to <Col N="914" /> grow wheat, and he is not alone in that. The Minister for Industry and Commerce and other Ministers were imbued with the same desire.  It used to be compulsory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I accept the Minister's word, and I will accept his word on behalf of his Party if he wishes.  Anyhow the Minister if he ever held the view, and I accept his word that he did not, has now adopted persuasion in lieu of compulsion.  Persuasion in this case is to be a bait to the farmer who grows wheat of a bounty on that portion of his wheat which will be millable.  I will advance for a moment no argument on the word &ldquo;millable.&rdquo;  It has been pretty well discussed on the various stages of this Bill.  This Bill is split up into two parts.  The first part concerns itself mainly with what has come to be known&mdash;to the farmers down the country, at any rate&mdash;as &ldquo;the mixture.&rdquo; Hitherto the farmer, up to the introduction of this Bill by the Minister, or this Act if it becomes law, has by experience found that one of the cheapest&mdash;perhaps the cheapest&mdash;fat-producing foods he could use was maize.  He proceeded to use maize, and for a considerable number of years he has used maize as the cheapest and the most efficacious fat-producing food he could buy here or elsewhere.  The Fianna Fáil Party, in the person of their Minister, imbued with a desire to&mdash;if they could&mdash;carry out their own <Col N="915" /> policy of increased tillage, thought it wise that the use of maize, if it was to be used at all, should be greatly curtailed, and that the farmer for the feeding of his pigs and other animals &mdash;and in certain parts of the country, I am sorry to say, even for the feeding of human beings&mdash;was to be compelled to pay a greater price than he had hitherto paid for this greatest fat-producing commodity; not alone this, but that he should be compelled, if he used this food at all, to mix it with certain other foods, which perhaps were cheaper, but which in the main were not as good as far as results in producing fat were concerned, with the exception of, perhaps, barley. Barley, the Minister himself said in his speech&mdash;and he quoted some notices to prove it&mdash;might be as good as maize, weight for weight, in producing fat, but that, taking price as the basis, it was not as good because it was dearer.  This meant that the farmer was to be compelled to use a mixture of maize, barley and oats&mdash;or perhaps some of the wheat that the Minister would be unable to persuade anybody to use for any other purpose &mdash;and those substitutes for maize will be dearer than maize.  The resultant price of the whole mixture will be much dearer than the pure maize that the farmer hitherto used for feeding his animals, with the added cost of the manufacture and the added fear&mdash; and this is what most concerned the farmer down the country&mdash;that when all is said and done he can have no guarantee that the mixture which reaches his house will not be contaminated by the addition of dust or other adulteration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister answered us in an earlier session of the Bill that that would be made impossible, that inspectors were being appointed and other precautions taken.  I agree that the Minister would take every precaution to provide against that, but in the long run, when this mixture has passed through innumerable hands&mdash;whole-salers, retailers, millers and everybody else&mdash;the farmer will have in his mind a suspicion that he will be unable to get rid of that the mixture <Col N="916" /> is contaminated by something other than maize, and, mind you, he may be right.  There is no general justification, in fact, no justification at all, for this mixing process provided for in the first part of the Minister's Bill, and I believe that the majority of the farmers, small or large, if they were personally asked, would give their verdict against it.</P>
    <P>We come to the second portion of the Bill and it mainly applies to wheat.  Now, as I said, the Minister attempts to persuade the people and the farmers of this State to grow wheat by the bait of a bounty, and by the bait of a guaranteed price of 23/-per barrel.  In any debates we have had during the last four or five years on the subject of wheat the prospective price then was not 23/- but 30/-per barrel.  I think I am not misquoting anybody when I say the price mooted during the debates on this subject for the past two or three years as an economic price for the farmer to grow wheat was 30/- per barrel, and here we have in this Bill the Minister coming forward with a guaranteed price of 23/- per barrel as an inducement for the farmer to engage generally in the production of wheat.  Now I deny that 23/- per barrel for wheat is sufficient to compensate the farmer.  Even if he gets 23/- for every stone of wheat he grows, and of course the Minister does not propose to give him that, but I will admit he is making a great effort to give it to him in this Bill, he would not be paid.  Now Deputy McGilligan says that this Bill pivots round the word &ldquo;standard&rdquo;&mdash;the definition of what is or what is not millable.  I do not know but that I was perhaps the first to start the hare in this respect and I might be one of the last to speak about it.  Arising out of the discussion on this Bill, the one thing that struck me in it was the standard, and I asked the Minister then what was likely to be the standard which he hoped to produce.  Was it perhaps a standard that would be compared with the standard of No. 3 or No. 4 Canadian Wheat?  The Minister, I suggest, did not answer that in any part of the debate.  He did say later <Col N="917" /> on that he despaired of finding a standard for millable wheat.</P>
    <P>That reduced the Bill for the moment to something in the nature of a farce.  In endeavouring to save the Minister from his despair, or perhaps to compel him to seek other sources of information that might lead him to change his mind, I ventured to put in an amendment to a section that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the section should be changed to the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; so that the Minister would be compelled somewhere to set up a standard.  Unfortunately, I was not here to move my amendment when it came on, but the Minister's reply, I think, was to the effect that he would like to accept it and that it appeared that he would have, at any rate, to fulfil what Deputy Bennett was aiming at.  I am glad to see the Minister has come to the conclusion that under the Bill he must prescribe a standard and so we have arrived at a stage when by a particular section the Minister, on his own words, is compelled unwillingly to put into operation, or to define in regulations, a definition of the word &ldquo;millable,&rdquo; which he already had stated definitely in this House was impossible of defining.  The Minister in a section of this Bill has provided for himself the solving of an impossibility. I am rather in sympathy with the Minister in his task, but even yet when the Minister is replying we should like to have some idea of the lines upon which the Minister will proceed in solving the impossible. The Minister stated there was no definition of millable wheat.  I suggested there was the British precedent and he said the British precedent meant nothing&mdash;the British definition meant nothing.  Anyhow, it did make an attempt to define the word &ldquo;millable.&rdquo;  I suggest again he could add to it that there was such a thing as percentage of moisture, there was even such a thing as standard of wheat per quantity, a standard of wheat per bushel, or if you like, a standard of wheat per gallon&mdash;that would be of use in determining the quality of wheat.  There are other standards, as Deputy McGilligan pointed out, such as the percentage of glue; and various <Col N="918" /> other things that the Minister, if he wished to get any information about, could have done so and I hope now that he is compelled to prescribe a standard that he will do so, otherwise this Bill which on the face of it is a bad Bill but which all of us would like to see being put into some workable condition.  The whole Bill, as I said, centres round the word &ldquo;millable.&rdquo; Quota is even governed by millable; the percentage which in other sections relates to it is altogether governed by millable; the bounty which the farmer receives, and mind you that is what concerns me mostly, is primarily governed by what is millable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cleary, in his only allusion to the Bill to-day, said the instructors in Mayo were unable to distribute sufficient wheat seed.  Perhaps that is so, but I say it is only an attempt to persuade the people to grow wheat.  I admit there was a little enthusiasm this winter to grow wheat.  So far as the condition of the farmer is concerned, he is anxious to grasp any straw, and from the enthusiasm of the Minister and from the speeches made in this House, perhaps there were a small share of farmers inbued with the hope that wheat-raising would be a profitable scheme.  I venture to predict that unless the Minister can achieve what I believe in his heart he really wanted to achieve&mdash;a definite price per barrel for all wheat grown and not for the portion which is millable&mdash;the unfortunate farmer who is engaging in the growing of wheat this year will be thoroughly disillusioned.  I am sorry to be a doleful prophet but I believe that a very much less quantity than the Minister has suggested will be millable wheat&mdash;that is, that a less percentage than four-fifths of the quantity of grain grown will be millable because that would be about what the Minister inferentially suggested to the House when he said that there were provisions for a bounty on 16 cwt. per acre.  Now 16 cwt. per acre would be four-fifths of the estimated possible return from wheat.  Even on the basis of the most excellent climatic year that we should be likely to expect, the Minister would not get that return and he knows he would not.  It is because <Col N="919" /> he knows he would not that he is so reluctant to put into operation a definition of the words &ldquo;millable wheat.&rdquo;  I think it is due to the House that the Minister would give us the benefit of any researches or conversations or any information he has acquired since he lost hope as to what he now proposes to put into the regulations as a definition of the word &ldquo;millable,&rdquo; because he admits now that he has got to put in something. It is not left to his own discretion.  He has no discretion.  We should have a definition because it would be an easier way out for the Minister.  It is due to the farmer, to the miller and to everybody else in connection with this measure that they should know where they stand.  If the farmer is to grow an acre of wheat it is due to him that he should know where he stands as to the bounty and as to the collection of whatever bounty he gets for the wheat he grows.</P>
    <P>I, for one, will not be satisfied until I know what the definition is that the Minister is to give of &ldquo;millable wheat.&rdquo;  The basis of 23/- per barrel offers the farmer very little.  It does not offer him a paying price so far as the raising of wheat is concerned. The Minister and his advisers may forget that if wheat is grown to any great extent it will be in substitution for oats and barley.  I take it the Minister is anxious to maintain the acreage under barley and oats.  I do not think he wants to lessen in any way the acreage under these cereals.  If the farmer is to grow an additional crop under wheat to the extent of one acre it will mean that four acres will be put under tillage.  He will not only have the expense of one acre under wheat, but four acres in the ordinary rotation.  How is the farmer to dispose of the produce of the other three acres used in the rotation?  He cannot use the other three acres in the growing of cereals.  He has got to use them in the production of turnips, mangolds or some such crops for which there is no demand beyond his own consumption. He will have to produce not only one acre but four or five acres of tillage for <Col N="920" /> every acre he puts under wheat.  He must have not one but four acres additional.</P>
    <P>It is due to the House and to the farmer that we should now be told how he is to dispose of these root crops particularly as the Minister's colleagues have imposed by tariffs additional charges in the way of tillage operations and manurial operations in connection with turnips and mangolds. The Government have definitely taxed artificial manures which are largely used in the growing of these crops.  I do not want to delay the House unduly but I want to point out that this Bill offers nothing to the farmer.  It is a camouflage on his intelligence.  It puts every conceivable difficulty in the way of the millers&mdash;difficulties that they have never asked for.  Lastly, and this is the principal objection I have to the Bill, it puts an unjustifiable imposition on the people who are least able to bear it.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Dillon said, there is the case of the very small farmers, who, perhaps, derived their main profits from feeding pigs and other animals. These producers will be discriminated against owing to the increased price of the mixture.  But it is on the very much larger section of the community that this Bill, when it becomes law, will impose a burden and that is on the consumers of the main article of food in this country&mdash;bread.  Whatever defence the Minister or any other Deputy makes for this Bill, one result and the ultimate result of the Bill must be that the price of bread will go up and the quality deteriorate so that in the end what we are compelling the unfortunate consumer to do is to pay a dearer price for an inferior article. In these hard times that is a consideration sufficiently strong to induce any Deputy in this House to oppose this Bill.</P>

The Deputy told us about the prices of wheat.  He said the price should be 30/- per barrel and that the bounty offered is not sufficient. Why did not the Deputy put down an amendment to have the price raised to 30/-?

      <P>Deputy Bennett and his leader, Deputy McGilligan, talked about millable wheat.  I wonder how it was that 138,000 acres of wheat were grown here in 1918.  I am sure the farmers did not sow it for a joke or for fun, apparently the farmers sowed it to make a profit on it.  That wheat was milled and I remember many of the old ranchers of the Deputy Bennett type coming along to my house looking for a bag of that wheat and taking it to the mill rather than eat the black bread which John Bull was giving them at the time.  They were glad to get that wheat.  I did not hear anyone of them say that it was not millable wheat.  I can speak as one who grew five to ten acres of wheat every year from 1918 to 1926.  I grew it until the policy of the last Government drove the corn growers out of the market.  I can speak with that experience and I can say that the lowest yield I had in wheat during <Col N="922" /> those years was never less than 16 cwts. per acre and it went as high as 25 cwts per acre.  Out of these 25 cwts.  I sold one ton of millable wheat. At least the millers had no objection to it.  Men of the type of Deputy Bennett will be always found in this country. Unfortunately the late Government took their advice, with the result that they found themselves in the mud. Deputy Bennett talked about the price we suggested three or four years ago. He lost sight of the fact that the price the farmer got three or four years ago and the price he got last year for his bullocks were very different.  He knows very well that in the last three or four years there has been a reduction of £13,000,000 in the value of the farmers' produce.  There was a difference of £13,000,000 between what the Irish farmers got in 1931 and the price they got in 1924 and 1925.  Thank God we now have an Executive Council who will see that the land is tilled and that employment is given to the people.</P>

I would be ashamed if anybody on this side did not do better than Deputy Bennett did.  He spoke about giving all the help he could to improve the Bill.  He introduced a dozen or so of the most ludicrous and silly amendments any Deputy could be guilty of introducing.  He talked about <Col N="923" /> his desire to improve the Bill, but he made very little effort in that direction. I do not believe this mixture is going to contain dust.  Deputy Bennett and other members of Cumann na nGaedheal seem to think that the Irish miller or Irish farmer cannot be honest. If it is a question of mixing Irish barley and oats, they consider it is going to contain sand and dust.  When you receive the maize exported by the honest farmer in the Argentine or in America there is no question raised about it at all; there is no inspection or no inquiry necessary; it is sure to be right and the Irish farmer is always safeguarded.  But the dishonest Irish producer cannot be trusted.</P>

I said there were three big advantages to be derived from it.  I pointed out we have been paying ten million pounds a year for cereals and if we could only succeed in spreading that money amongst the farmers by getting them to grow the wheat, barley and oats necessary to replace the imported cereals, we would increase the farmers' income by ten million pounds.</P>

      <P>This Bill gives an opportunity to our farmers to grow their own barley, wheat and oats.  I said that this measure will mean increased employment.  Deputy McGilligan referred to the Economic Committee that examined into the matter.  There <Col N="925" /> were figures put before us on another occasion by the then Minister for Agriculture relating to the cost of growing wheat, barley and oats. Manual labour was set out at £2 6/6 per acre.  Our additional requirements in cereals will amount to 1,300,000 acres.  Multiply that by £2 6/6 and you will have the amount brought to the agricultural workers or the working farmers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon said that I gave an argument that in the event of war we would be secure here.  I mentioned that, but that is not the principal argument. I am told that I am only half-hearted in this thing because I did not speak much about it.  On the Second Reading the closure had to be moved and I did not get an opportunity of speaking.  On the Committee Stage Deputy Bennett and others like him took up the whole time of the House on silly amendments.  Even then I did not get an opportunity of speaking on the Bill.  It almost looked as if I would have to move the closure again to stop Deputy Bennett.  At any rate, I am not half-hearted.  One of the reasons indicating why I was half-hearted was that the bounty is so low.  It was mentioned that in 1929 I argued that 30/-would induce farmers to grow wheat. At that time it would, and it would pay them well to grow it.  At that time the farmer would have a profit by getting 25/- a barrel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we give a guaranteed price and a guaranteed market we expect to have the wheat grown, but at the same time we must watch the interests of the taxpayers.  We have started at 23/6 and 25/- and, if necessary, we may have to go higher.  We consider it will not be bad if we get 65,000 acres the first year.  We pointed out that the price of wheat must be guaranteed two years in advance and the reason for that is that the farmer must be given an opportunity to prepare the land the year prior to growing the wheat.  In the first year he must turn up the land and put a root crop on his lea land and in the second year he will grow wheat. Generally they sow a root crop on the lea and then wheat.  We could very well claim that no advantage need be expected under this measure for the <Col N="926" /> next two or three years, because the farmers must prepare for the crop. Deputy Bennett argued that a farmer could grow wheat only once in four years.  In the circumstances, Deputy Bennett should not expect any advantage sooner than three years from now. He says it only comes in rotation once in four years.</P>

      <P>There is a little.  The chief argument against this Bill is that we cannot define &ldquo;millable wheat.&rdquo; That is a lovely Cumann na nGaedheal point.  Unless you can define &ldquo;millable wheat,&rdquo; the scheme is going to fail.  I wonder could Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney or Deputy Bennett define &ldquo;cooking butter&rdquo; for us.  Yet &ldquo;cooking butter&rdquo; is sold.  Could anybody define it?  Could any one define &ldquo;malting barley.&rdquo;  We do not define &ldquo;malting barley,&rdquo; yet we know that the farmer brings his barley to the buyer and that he takes it if he thinks it is fit for malting.  If he thinks otherwise, he tells him to bring it home.  Likewise, the farmer will bring his wheat to the miller and, if he thinks it is fit for milling he will take it.  If not, the farmer will bring it home.  That is the best definition of &ldquo;millable wheat.&rdquo;  Unfortunately, I am compelled to put it into words but I do not think it makes the slightest difference.  It will all depend on what the flour miller will take.  If the farmer succeeds in selling his wheat to the miller, it will be millable wheat. The definition is the docket the farmer gets when he has sold the wheat. Deputy McGilligan spent hours on this point.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney woke up to the point to-day and began to talk about &ldquo;millable wheat.&rdquo; Deputy Bennett told me a fortnight ago that he could give me a definition of &ldquo;millable wheat.&rdquo;  He came back on that point to-day.  Within the next four or five months, I am going to give a definition of &ldquo;millable wheat.&rdquo; Deputy Bennett said that we had the British definition, and that that may be the best we can get.  I am not sure about that, but as soon as we get our advisory committee together we will ask them to look at the British <Col N="927" /> definition.  That committee will give me a definition and I will put it into the regulations.  How much better will we be when all that is done?  It will remain with the miller to take the wheat which he considers millable from the farmer and it will remain with the farmer to get him to take it.  The definition will be forgotten.  It will be put out of the way.</P>

That, the Deputy may say, amounts to the same thing but I never had the standard of &ldquo;millable wheat&rdquo; in mind.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said that we could not give a definition of &ldquo;millable wheat&rdquo; because if we provided for a decent standard, as the British standard is taken to be on the other side, nine-tenths of the wheat here would be unsuitable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are told that there is a surplus of wheat the world over and we are asked why we should go into wheat.  There is a surplus of everything.  Deputy McGilligan referred to Ottawa.  I remember sitting on a committee at Ottawa for hours and hours with Australian, New Zealand and other delegates and trying to find what they would do with their surplus meat.  Another committee was set up to find out what <Col N="928" /> would be done with surplus butter. Meat, butter and cereals were being dealt with and after that, there was, I think, a committee to deal with fruit.  There is a surplus of everything &mdash;a surplus of meat and butter as well as of wheat.  We were told about Austria and the League of Nations trying to get them to go out of wheat and into meat.  The whole difficulty is to find an export market for meat, butter and other products.  We are not going to look for an export market for wheat.  We want to use it at home and it is evident to everybody that it is easy to fix a price for wheat or anything we want to use at home, when it will be years before we have a surplus, if we ever have.  To fix a price for beef, of which we have a 90 per cent. surplus, is a difficult matter. It is difficult to find an export market, as every country knows.  We may be finding it especially difficult at present but, apart from that, every country is finding it difficult to obtain export markets for its products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill, we are told, are very harsh on poor people. Even Deputy Bennett talked about the poor people to-day.  The provisions are also very hard on the miller, we are told.  Deputy McGilligan tells us that the principal people concerned are the millers.  They are not the principal people concerned.  They are only brought in to this because we had to bring them into it.  The people concerned are the producers.  We would not have troubled about this Bill if the millers only were concerned.  We had to consider the interests of the producers and, in so doing, we had to deal with the interests of the millers. Some of the millers may be hostile to this Bill.  We have discussed the Bill with them and met them as far as possible, but there must come a point at which they will have to give in in the interests of the common good.  The same Deputies who speak about the hardships on the poor, the hardships on the millers and the hardships on the farmers who are going to feed their stock tell us that the Bill is unworkable. If it is not going to work, it does not matter.  They can save themselves the trouble of talking about <Col N="929" /> it.  They say that we cannot grow wheat in the country.  If wheat is not grown, no subsidy will be paid and the thing falls through.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon says that the farmer should use his land to the best advantage. That is why we have not used compulsion on any farmer to grow wheat or oats or barley.  We have given them an inducement to grow these cereals to fulfil our requirements. I am accused of having the old belief in the Sinn Fein policy of self sufficiency.  That belief is shared by practically every country in the world. Only three countries have not done something to encourage the growing of wheat&mdash;Great Britain, Ireland and Denmark.  Now, Great Britain and Ireland have taken the matter up and only Denmark remains.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan says that he examined the Eggs Act because we quoted it here so often.  He says that in that case the Minister consulted the interests concerned.  We consulted the interests concerned.  We could not have consulted the interests concerned in a better way.  We went to the farmers at the last election and told them that if they returned us to power we would bring in a tillage scheme.  They did return us and we are bringing in a tillage scheme.  He said that there was only one amendment introduced into the Eggs Bill as it went through the House.  It would have been well if the Opposition had been as sparing in their amendments to this Bill, because most of them were absolutely destructive and had no other idea behind them, and the others did not show very much thought. Deputy McGilligan said the time will come when it will pay millers to take bad wheat at any price, and let the farmers get the remainder of the bounty, and turn it over to feeding stuffs.  I thought the Deputy had read the Bill, but it is evident that he has not read all the Bill, because Section 76 would have shown him that if a flour miller buys wheat from a farmer he must use that wheat in flour for human consumption and cannot dispose of it in any other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan made a very long <Col N="931" /> speech and his three main points were (1) Wheat cannot be grown in this country; (2) unless you can define millable wheat the whole thing is a failure; (3) that the principal interest concerned was the millers.  Comment on that is unnecessary.  He went on to say that there was no case made that an outside monopoly attempted to get control of the flour mills here; that there was no danger of a monopoly; certainly no danger of a monopoly under foreign control.  After developing that point for some time, he said that we could at least have waited until it showed itself.  Deputy McGilligan did wait until it showed itself. Imagine Deputy McGilligan or any Deputy saying that foreigners were not getting control and getting a monopoly of flour milling in this country!  It is a well-known fact and does not need arguing that Messrs.  Rank and Company were coming into this country and taking over the flour mills.  Everybody knows that.  Yet Deputy McGilligan says that there was no such thing as foreigners getting control of our flour mills.  That is a most extraordinary statement for any Deputy to make.  A more extraordinary statement still, perhaps, was when he said that we should have waited until there were signs of it.  Suppose we did wait longer and let Messrs.  Rank and Company get control over the flour mills. If we brought in a Bill to take over these mills from Messrs.  Rank and give them back to the original owners, what would Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney say?  He would say that it was real rank confiscation in that case.  He says that the people mainly concerned in the maize mixture were opposed to the whole thing, namely, the maize millers. I do not think the maize millers are the people mainly concerned.  I think the people growing oats and barley who want to get a price for their corn after they have tilled the land, are those mainly concerned.  It is because we want to get a price for these people for their oats and barley that we are bringing in this Bill.  We had to do it in some way or other.  We could have imposed a tariff or we could have kept maize out and in that way raise the <Col N="932" /> price of oats and barley.  We could have done it in several ways.  In the end, we decided that the best way was to compel the maize millers to use a mixture of home-grown grain.  It is only accidentally that they come in, but as they have come in it is, in our opinion, in the interests of the growers of grain and the country generally that the maize millers should fall in with certain regulations that they must now fall in with.  Before the introduction of the Bill we had a conference with the maize millers, and we discussed this matter for about three days, but when the conference was over-I admit that the maize millers were just as hostile as when we met.  At least I did my best, but I could not do any more.</P>
    <P>This Bill, of course, is not a panacea for Irish agriculture.  Surely we will be able to do something more for agriculture than this.  Surely we have done a little more than this for agriculture, if it comes to that.  But it is part of the agricultural policy of Fianna Fáil.  I believe it is going to do a great deal for agriculture.  As Deputy Cleary said, it is going to do a great deal for agriculture even in Mayo, which is represented by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.  It is quite true, as Deputy Cleary said, that some of our overseers in Mayo in charge of the distribution of seed wheat were the first to send word to the Department that the supplies had run out and they asked for more seed to be sent.  So that even in Mayo there is a sort of enthusiasm for the sowing of wheat.</P>

      <P>The Minister challenged me to-day when I drew attention to something he said on a previous occasion.  I want to ask him if he has been correctly reported on column 42 of the official reports.  He was deprecating the setting up of a Milling Advisory Committee composed of flour millers for a certain purpose and he went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not the sort of committee to which we would put the question:&mdash;&lsquo;What is millable wheat?&rsquo;  They would naturally require the very highest standard of wheat.  We, on our part, might be anxious to get <Col N="933" /> them to take more wheat than they would regard as of the very best standard.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister to-day said that the test of what millable wheat will be is what the millers will mill.  In this he said that under certain circumstances he will make them mill what they would not ordinarily mill-what they would reject.  Surely there is a great difference in principle between these two dicta.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little difference when it comes to the point. The miller will be asked to take a certain percentage.  He knows he has to take, say, 100 tons of Irish wheat. He will take the best 100 tons that he can get.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The first amendment which is to delete paragraphs (e) and (f) must be taken in conjunction with the amendment to Section 5 which proposes to insert the words &ldquo;other than the Irish Land Commission&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;person.&rdquo;  The result of the amendments is, if they are carried, that the Irish Land Commission will not get the advantage of this Bill, and that they will have to pay full rate on their lands as heretofore.  I mentioned yesterday afternoon that I would bring forward such amendments here.  I listened last night to the Minister for Local Government. He said for two reasons an amendment of this nature should not be accepted.  The first one he said was that the Land Commission should be treated as well as other persons would be.  As a matter of fact they are not treated like other individuals in this Bill&mdash;they get preferential treatment &mdash;because whereas if an ordinary person has got several holdings of land, they are all taken together to form one general Poor Law unit and the Irish Land Commission if they <Col N="937" /> have several units under the value of £10 each are entitled to have each one of these taken separately. The Minister for Local Government also said that any purchaser from the Land Commission would get that plus a remission on the rates.  I must disagree with him on that point.  He seems to think that the small portions or large portions of land in the hands of the Land Commission are lying there idle.  They are not lying idle. The Land Commission is getting grazing rents for every one of them. There is no connection between the grazing rate or the poor rate or anything else, and the sum which the individual coming in is going to pay when he is given the land.  The estates may be treated as units and the individuals are not.  I have put my arguments as briefly as possible.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept these amendments.  As I said last night, I am surprised that the Deputy should be moving them in connection with this particular grant of a quarter of a million pounds when he and his Government last year, and on previous occasions, made much larger grants totalling one and three-quarter million pounds in aid of the agricultural community and he did not seek to impose this principle with regard to these specific grants.  I do not know why he wants to do it now.  The amount which is involved is not very material but it would have the effect in relation to the Bill we have before us of altering the whole principle of it; our Schedule would have to be altered, and our Bill could not be got through now.</P>

      <P>That is so, and for that reason, and also for the reasons I gave last night, we cannot accept these amendments and must vote against them.  It is correct, I maintain, that the advantage that is given to the Land Commission will go to the holder, whoever he may be, who may come into possession of the land now held by the Land Commission.  The advantage will be gained by the holder of any of these lands who goes into occupation before the 31st March of this year.</P>

      <P>Somebody has suggested to me that perhaps there is good reason for that&mdash;a reason which the Deputy is aware of.  However, I will not go into that matter as it might lead us into an argument which would keep us here too long.  I think it is not a principle that ought to be introduced on the small grant in view of the fact that first of all the principle was not introduced when much greater sums were in question, and secondly, for the purely practical matter that it would necessitate the altering of our whole Schedule as set out now, and we could not do that at this stage.</P>

      <P>This is, of course, a very temporary Bill as far as I understand, to relieve agriculturists in the present stage of depression.  But I do not see why the whole sum available should not go to the agriculturists. I do not see why some of it should go to the relief of the Land Commission. The Minister has said that he wants to relieve agriculture.  If the Minister asks he will find out the position.  As far as the other points with regard to the small dwellings that the Minister said did not come in, I want to say that I have not touched on the small dwellings; but small dwellings are not occupied by Government Departments. When there is £250,000 given in relief to agriculturists the whole should go in relief and some of it should not be kept back by the Government.  If you are saying to the people.  &ldquo;We are giving you £250,000&rdquo; then you should give it.</P>

      <P>Is it a fact that the Deputy's colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, enunciated a principle that his Government did not approve of relief grants finding their way back to the Treasury and he instanced a case of a relief grant administered by the Land Commission? He said that the Land Commission was unable to expend the whole of the money during the financial year and that some of the money remained on hand, whereupon the surplus was sent back to the Treasury. This £250,000 is a relief grant and the object of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's amendment is to secure that no part of it will pass through the conduit pipe of the Land Commission.  Do I take it that Fianna Fáil approves of that principle?  If the Minister says that he accepts the principle but that it would be impossible now to put it into operation in this Bill owing to the amount of work in the Schedule, then I am prepared to accept the section as it is, if the Minister says that in any future grant care will be taken to exclude the Land Commission from any benefits given to the small holders.</P>

It is not at all the proper thing that moneys that are intended for the relief of agriculturists should go back to the Treasury.  At any rate, I am informed that the whole sum that might go back to the Land Commission or into the Treasury would not amount to more than £200 or £300.</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Minister that there does not appear to be.  Perhaps he would say what the figure is.  If the Minister examines the position as between Leitrim and Sligo in this Bill it practically means that £1 is going to be given to every holder of land.  There are 160,000 persons with holdings under ten acres; and the equivalent of persons under £10 valuation mark leaves you in the position that you have about 250,000 who are going to get money out of this grant and they are to get about £1 each.  But if you look to the position in some counties you will find that the Sligo men are going to get 22/- whereas the Leitrim man is going to get £1.  The Cavan man is going to get 22/- while the Monaghan man will only get £1; the Kilkenny man is getting only 16/- and the men here in Dublin will get only 12/-.  I would ask the Minister to say whether that is so or not and what the ratio is between the grant and the total amount specified?</P>

    <P>The reason I move this amendment is because in County Waterford there is one urban district which, in my opinion, should have been included.  I <Col N="944" /> fail to see why this district was omitted when towns of less importance have been included.  The amount of relief to be given is not very much.  I had not much time to make out the exact figures, but I estimated it roughly at £40.  That is not a very big sum, but in these rather difficult times it will afford a certain amount of relief to the urban holders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This subject was dealt with last evening when we were discussing the Second Reading.  I do feel that the agricultural holders in urban areas ought all to get the same relief as agriculturists outside in the rural areas.  It was not found possible, however, to introduce that principle with regard to this allocation.  I will repeat what I said last night.  As regards this question of agricultural land, all the grants that were made in previous years by previous Governments and also this grant, the whole subject will, at an early date, have to be re-examined.  These grants were made at different times, on different bases and on different principles.  I think the whole subject will have to be re-examined.</P>
      <P>If it could be done, I would like to see it done before another year is finished.  I would like to see the grants consolidated where they are given on one definite principle and I would also like to have included the holders of agricultural land in all urban areas. Some of them have the advantage of getting the different grants now, but until such time as that re-examination is made and the whole subject investigated as to the method of division of these grants and the principles on which they are to be made, I think the question of towns like Dungarvan and other similar towns where there is agricultural land within the urban area, will have to stand over.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter by way of question with the Minister to-day and I did not feel quite satisfied with his answer.  I think the Minister's statement now shows that he is not quite satisfied with regard to this matter.  Deputy Goulding and myself are agreed that towns like Dungarvan, Kinsale and Bandon, urban areas in <Col N="945" /> country districts, should be put on the same basis as regards agricultural grants as the general agricultural land in the rural districts.  In those cases there is agricultural land within the urban boundary and I do not see what difficulty or trouble can arise about scheduling this type of agricultural land so as to give it the benefit of the derating schemes.  I do not see what examination the Minister needs, because it is a fairly simple thing to define agricultural land within the urban boundary in places like Dungarvan, Bandon, Kinsale, Fermoy and Macroom.  They all stand in the same relation to each other.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to understand why any examination has to be made.  I do not know if the Minister himself understands what examination is necessary.  It is an important point for the people within the urban boundaries who want relief.  I cannot see why there should be any difficulty in extending it to them.  Will the Minister explain what difficulties there are?  Agricultural land is agricultural land whether it is on a mountain, in an area remote from a town, or whether it is within the boundary of a country town.  I can quite understand difficulties in a city where so-called agricultural land within a city boundary may have potential value as accommodation land or as building land, but I cannot understand why, in respect of a country town, an examination has to be made to find out the difference between agricultural land within an urban boundary and agricultural land outside that boundary.  One piece of land may be a half mile from the centre of the town and another piece over one and a half miles away.  This is a very important matter for the individuals concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Muckross Estate, now about to become the property of the people, comprises some of the most beautiful scenery in the world.  It contains within its confines most of the scenery celebrated as Killarney.  The present owners acquired the estate for the sum of £50,000 some 22 years ago, and, since then, a further sum of £110,000 has been spent on maintenance and improvements.  The property has been managed and run with a view to increasing its attractiveness.  The grounds around the house have been cleared.  Beautiful lawns and gardens have been laid down.  Reafforestation has gone on on a big scale.  The woods have been opened up with paths and clearings.  The estate is now at such a pitch of perfection that the only anxiety the Government need have is <Col N="947" /> lest it may not be possible for the State to maintain it in its present condition. Now, through the munificence of the owners, this property comes to the State in trust for the public.  Visitors will henceforth have access to all parts of the estate&mdash;to tracts of mountain, wood and forest hitherto known only to a few.  The gift will multiply the attractions of Killarney to visitors and it should provide a stimulus to the tourist traffic in the Free State generally.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity of expressing the gratitude of the Dáil and the people to Senator Vincent and Mr. and Mrs. Bowers Bourn for their great generosity and for the fine example of public spirit which they have set.</P>

      <P>This is a very remarkable gift, a very generous gift and a very princely gift.  It reflects very great credit on the Oireachtas that it has an honoured member who is making this remarkable dispensation.  It is a generous and a noble act of citizenship and I am sure that practically everybody in the State will realise the princely character of the gift.  May I say that there have been gifts not as great but, nevertheless, very great given to the State by another family. The Milltown family offered and gave to the State their silver and pictures and subsequently offered the whole estate.  The whole estate was not accepted but the State is in possession of the silver and pictures.  Unfortunately, we did not find ourselves in a position to accept the estate.  I have got two suggestions to make in connection with this gift.  One is that the word &ldquo;Senator&rdquo; should precede the words &ldquo;Arthur Rose Vincent.&rdquo;  The other suggestion is that it would be a graceful act to invite the Senator to occupy the premises there during his life or at his pleasure.  He has been associated with the place for twenty-two years.  His wife was very much attached to it.  His other family connections, Mr. and Mrs. Bourn, might care, on occasions, to visit the place. They were particularly generous to visitors who came to Killarney.  So far as I know, practically everybody was at liberty to go through the estate.  This <Col N="948" /> is a remarkable evidence of citizenship on the part of a princely family.</P>

      <P>This gift is being made to our State by a member of what used to be called &ldquo;the ascendancy class&rdquo; in this country.  I rise because Senator Vincent asked me to say that he would wish the gift to be regarded as symbolic of the desire of himself and his class for appeasement in this country and for good feeling between all the classes that compose our State and as symbolic of the desire of every section of our community to be regarded as welded solidly into one homogeneous whole and to be associated with the most ardent aspirations for the prosperity and glory of the Irish people in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the Bill be now read a Second Time. This is a Bill to give effect to Article 41 of an International Convention for the safety of life at sea signed in London on 31st March, 1929.  It amends the Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894 to 1921, in so far as it is necessary to give effect to the said Article 41. Article 41 is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The contracting Governments agree that after midnight on the 30th June, 1931, helm or steering orders, i.e., orders to the steersman, shall on all their ships be given in the direct sense, e.g., when the ship is going ahead an order containing the word &ldquo;starboard,&rdquo; or &ldquo;right,&rdquo; or any equivalent of &ldquo;starboard,&rdquo; or &ldquo;right,&rdquo; shall only be used when it is intended, on ships as at present generally constructed and arranged, that the wheel, the rudder-blade and the head of the ship shall all move to the right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In ancient days when there was a rudder of a different type, with a shaft out of it, when they wanted a ship to go to the right, they moved the rudder to the left.  In consequence of that a practice grew up which became obsolete with the modern type of ship.  An International Convention for the giving <Col N="955" /> of orders at sea was adopted and will be applied as from the beginning of next year on British ships.  It has always been the practice on American ships and ships of other countries.  It is desired that our law should be in conformity with the law of Great Britain and it is desirable, therefore, to have the Bill passed before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>(1)  The customs duty imposed by Section 11 of the Finance Act, 1928 (No. 11 of 1928), as amended by subsequent enactments shall be charged, levied, and paid on the following articles imported into Saorstát Eireann after the passing of this Act at the respective rates hereinafter mentioned in lieu of the rates mentioned in the said Section 11 or any such amending enactment as aforesaid, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  on all parts of motor cars which are, in the opinion of the <Col N="957" /> Revenue Commissioners, engine assemblies as defined by regulations made by the Revenue Commissioners, transmission assemblies as similarly defined, or propelling gear assemblies as similarly defined&mdash;at the rate of an amount equal to 15 per cent. of the value of the article:</P>
    <P>(b)  on all parts of motor cars which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, are either radiators, lamps, or starting motors and are imported separately&mdash;at the rate of an amount equal to 15 per cent. of the value of the article:</P>
    <P>(c)  on all parts of motor cars which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, are metal doors or metal body shells or assembled metal parts of such doors or shells and have not been painted, upholstered, or fitted with glass or wood, and are suitable only for incorporation in the body of a motor car designed, constructed and intended for the carriage (otherwise than for reward) of not more than six persons exclusive of the driver&mdash; at the rate of an amount equal to 40 per cent. of the value of the article.</P>
    <P>(2) The customs duty imposed by the said Section 11 of the Finance Act, 1928, as amended by subsequent enactments shall not be charged or levied on any of the following articles imported into Saorstát Eireann after the passing of this Act, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  on any component parts or accessories of motor car chassis which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, are not assembled otherwise than by welding, soldering, or any like process;</P>
    <P>(b)  on any component parts or accessories (other than doors and complete body-shells) of motor car bodies which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, are not assembled and are suitable only for incorporation in or use as an accessory of the body of a motor <Col N="958" /> car designed, constructed and intended for the carriage (otherwise than for reward) of not more than six persons exclusive of the driver.</P>
    <P>(3) Whenever the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is satisfied that any articles chargeable with duty at a rate fixed by this section are required to be imported by a manufacturer for use in a process of manufacture in Saorstát Eireann, the Revenue Commissioners may be licence authorise such manufacturer, subject to compliance with such conditions as they may think fit to impose, to import such articles without payment of the said duty either, as the Revenue Commissioners shall think proper, without limit as to time or quantity or either of them, or within a specified time or in a specified quantity.</P>
    <P>(4)  In this section the expression &ldquo;motor car&rdquo; has the same meaning as it has in Part II of the Finance Act, 1928 (No. 11 of 1928), and the expression &ldquo;motor car body&rdquo; has the same meaning as it has in Section 14 of the Finance (Customs Duties) (No. 2) Act, 1932 (No. 11 of 1932).</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give certain remissions in respect of duties upon parts of motor chassis and motor bodies.  In order to encourage the construction of motor chassis here, rather than their importation complete, it is proposed that the present duty of 33? per cent. will apply only in respect of the complete chassis.  At present it applies to the chassis and each part of it.  In future unassembled parts will be free of duty.  Certain assembled parts, that is, the engine unit, the gear assembly, and the back axle, will be subject to 15 per cent. duty, with a preferential rate of 10 per cent.  We propose to regard as an unassembled part any two parts which are joined together by a process of welding, brazing or soldering.  In other countries they have in operation a three-tier tariff of this kind.  The part of the chassis which it is proposed to allow in at the medium rate of duty is what is elsewhere called the knockachta <Col N="959" /> down chassis, that is a chassis the greater part of the assembling work on which has yet to be done, but the more difficult assemblies are allowed in as such; consequently when this amendment is inserted in the Bill and this Act comes into operation a person desiring to get a motor chassis can either import it complete and pay the present duty on it without any increase; he can import it in unassembled parts and get it completely free of duty; or he can import it partly in the form of unassembled parts and partly in assembled parts, and he gets those parts at the medium rate of duty of 15 per cent., with a 10 per cent. preferential rate.  It would require a considerable amount of skill and some elaborate machinery to assemble the chassis from completely unassembled parts.  There is one firm which will possibly undertake to do so, and there may be others.  I have no reason to believe that quite a number of firms will not engage in the assembly of the knock-down chassis, and an intimation to that effect has already been given to my Department.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the matter of the motor bodies.  At the beginning of the year we imposed a stiff duty upon completed motor bodies.  The result of that duty has been that Messrs. Ford have since been constructing their motor bodies here, and of course that firm, as Deputies are aware, does much more than half the total trade of the country. Certain other firms made some progress in the matter of getting their bodies completed here also, but generally speaking, the motor traders and the coach builders of the country did not seriously set out to solve the problems that necessarily arose when that new condition was created.  Certain representations were made to the effect that it would greatly facilitate the trade if, for a period at any rate, the importation of what they called a body shell were permitted, that is the shell of an all-steel body imported as such &mdash; unpainted, unupholstered and without any wood fittings or glass work attached.  We were disinclined to do that, particularly because there is at any rate one firm, producing more than <Col N="960" /> 50 per cent. of our requirement of motor cars, doing the complete job here, and it would be bad policy in our opinion to take any action which would make it unprofitable for them to continue doing so in competition with firms that were doing only part of the process of manufacture here; consequently in the case of the bodies we also propose to institute a three-tier tariff system.  The present position that no duty is payable upon unassembled parts will continue; the present position that a duty of 50 per cent. is payable upon the complete body will continue, but in between we are going to permit the importation of assembled parts of bodies up to and including the complete shell, at a rate of duty of 40 per cent., with a preferential rate of 26? per cent.  It will be possible for a motor trader or a person who proposes to engage in the motor assembling business to import all parts of a knocked-down chassis and to pay duty upon them at the rate now proposed, to import the body shell at the rate of duty now proposed, to complete the construction of the car here, and to have that car at less than he could have had it heretofore, even if we assume that the manufacturing process involved in the completion of the car here is going to cost very much more than it would cost if done elsewhere. It is undoubtedly to be expected that it will cost something more, but we may reasonably assume that as the work progresses and those who come into the industry get more efficient that cost will go down.  In any case if the persons interested in the trade take advantage of the concessions now being given them, and seriously set out to establish the industry here, they can do so, and can have motors available for sale to the public at a price no higher than that at which cars would have been available at imported complete at the old rate of duty.  That is the purpose of this amendment, which I move.</P>

      <P>The only change we made was one made at the request of <Col N="961" /> the motor traders, which permitted &mdash; for a period of three months, from the middle of May to the middle of August &mdash; the importation of completed motor cars at a somewhat higher rate of duty than that which had previously prevailed, but lower than that which subsequently prevailed.  That concession was given upon the motor traders' undertaking to me that at the end of that period they would be in a position to do the job here themselves, and to supply their own requirements of completed cars.  That undertaking was not carried out. There may have been some misunderstanding between the motor traders and myself as to what that undertaking meant, but as I understood it it was not carried out, and that is the position.</P>

      <P>The only case &mdash; I am taking the Deputy seriously &mdash; ever advanced either before the Tariff Commission or by those engaged in the importation of motor cars, against the establishing of this industry here, was that the cost of the machinery necessary for welding the parts of bodies together was too high, having regard to the size of the market here. To build a car under the conditions imposed by this amendment requires no machinery at all.  The actual outlay is negligible.  It is all manual work and there are plenty of skilled workers here available to do that. The duty on commercial cars and omnibuses remains unchanged, and in connection with these types of cars, we have had it stated to us by people who have a knowledge of conditions prevailing in other countries and who are competent to express an opinion that the work done here is never below and very frequently superior in <Col N="962" /> quality to the work done in the construction of similar cars in other countries.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is discriminating between Fords, who are a comparatively new firm in this country, and the old established motor traders of this country, who were established before Messrs. Fords ever set foot in Ireland and before he ever established his factory in Cork.  I might tell the Minister now that some of the citizens in Cork would tell you that the advent of Messrs. Fords to Cork was the biggest curse which ever fell upon them.  Talking about bodies, the bodies come over finished and they are admitted free because there are a few rivets to be put in them at the works in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="963" /> The Minister will remember that the old-established firms in the motor industry in Ireland have a capital which amounts to something like £370,000.  These people have approached the Minister with regard to concessions on the importation of bodies and they tried to make some arrangement with the coach-builders so that some of these things could be done locally.  The Minister knows well that the coach-builders were unable or were unwilling to meet the motor trade in the matter.  I suppose the Minister will understand that.  He received from the motor trade a letter sometime in November in which the motor traders stated that their position since the imposition of the special tariffs was one of complete stagnation.  The letter reads:</P>
    <P>There has been practically no business to keep us employed; we have been compelled to discharge 120 hands.</P>
    <P>That is more than is employed in the whole of Fords at the present time.</P>
    <P>Our combined gross turnover has already reduced by 60 per cent. in last year, and we are faced with the prospect in most cases that if present circumstances continue we must prepare to close our premises.  The figures of reduction for the month of October are much greater than those of September.</P>
    <P>As stated to you by our representative to whom you were good enough to give an interview last June, we were quite willing to accept the situation created by the new tariff provided the coach-builders were in a position to produce the bodies we required. With a view to facilitating them, two conferences were held at our request in your offices, but the attitude of the coach-builders at these meetings showed that they were not anxious to do business and convinced us that they were not serious in their desire to undertake the building of private bodies.</P>
    <P>Ever since then, they have as a body, adopted a dog-in-the-manger attitude, attempting in no way to <Col N="964" /> justify their claim that they are competent to build motor bodies and at the same time declining to admit the fact.</P>
    <P>From the inquiries we have made, it seems clear that no coach-builders in the country have a plant at all suitable for the building or assembling of modern car bodies, and there is no sign that any of them is prepared to instal plant for the purpose.</P>
    <P>Even if a coach-builder were to instal plant, the difficulties of conducting the business so that the demands of the different distributors could be met would be enormous, as can be fully explained in an interview.</P>
    <P>Now, this matter, as I said before, is to subsidise Fords practically at the expense of the old-established industry and under sub-section (3) Fords is the only manufacturer in this country which can legally be called a manufacturer, and, as such, is entitled to import without payment of such duty or without limit as to time or quantity the things specified previously.  I think it is a grave injustice to the whole motor trade &mdash; a trade which was established before Fords was even ever heard of in this country &mdash; after putting every penny they possessed into it. They even had to raise overdrafts in the bank to carry on this industry, and these men now are going to be jeopardised merely for the sake of a very ephemeral condition in the assembling of motor bodies in Fords.</P>

      <P>On Section 7, there is one small matter to which I would like to call the Minister's attention.  There are cinematograph films of the full standard size and sub-standard size used for the home cinematograph by the amateur photographer.  There is in Dublin at present a plan for what is known as processing these small sub-standard films.  If the section is to apply to these sub-standard films it will be cheaper, or as cheap, to send them to England and, therefore, a certain amount of employment already being given in the city will be <Col N="965" /> hampered.  I wonder would it be possible for the Minister to make this section apply only to films of the full size standard?</P>

      <P>Before Section 9 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Subject to compliance with such conditions (if any) as the Revenue Commissioners may think fit to impose, there shall be payable in respect of any nicotine or tobacco extract manufactured from tobacco in Saorstát Eireann and any preparation in the manufacture of which any such nicotine or tobacco extract is used as an ingredient, on the exportation of such nicotine, extract, or preparation, to the exporter thereof an allowance at such rate (not exceeding the increased cost of such nicotine, extract, or preparation due to restrictions, requirements, or conditions imposed on or in connection with the manufacture of such nicotine or extract for the protection of the revenue) as the Minister for Finance shall from time to time determine.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every person who manufactures from tobacco in Saorstát Eireann any nicotine or tobacco extract shall furnish to the Revenue Commissioners on demand all information in his possession or procurement relating to the increased cost arising from restrictions, requirements, or conditions imposed on or in connection with the manufacture of such nicotine or extract for the protection of the revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  Any person who fails to comply with a condition imposed by the Revenue Commissioners under this section or who, on demand made by the Revenue Commissioners under this section, furnishes to the Revenue Commissioners any information or alleged information which is to his knowledge false or misleading shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary <Col N="967" /> conviction thereof, to an excise penalty of fifty pounds.</P>
    <P>There is a factory in this country which manufactures certain insecticides from tobacco waste.  These insecticides are of a nicotine nature.  The firm engaged in the business has an export trade.  Because of the necessity for safeguarding the revenue a number of restrictions had to be placed on it.  It has been the practice in the case of distillers that where for revenue purposes restrictions have been imposed in this respect an allowance is paid in respect of these exports.  It is proposed to adopt this revenue device in the case concerned in order to offset the disadvantages inflicted upon the concern by the necessary regulations in respect of protecting the revenue and to make it impossible for fraud to arise.  The matter was brought to the notice of the Government in another way.  A proposal was brought forward that the particular difficulties of this firm should be met in another way; but it was decided that the usual revenue device in such cases should be adopted and so this is being inserted.</P>

      <P>At Reference No. 16, to delete paragraph (b) in the second column and the entries opposite it in the third and fourth columns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House is pressed for time and I would like to start off by pointing out to the Minister that my amendment only refers to floorings and sheetings, and as it will not be possible to get this timber until far into next year, he might very easily postpone this section until the Budget comes next year. It would mean giving the timber merchants an opportunity of knowing what was coming so that they would be able to prepare accordingly.  I would like to point out that it is not as easy as I thought at first and there are some difficulties.  The Government have imposed a tax on imported joinery and mouldings.  Imported joinery is undoubtedly going to increase employment and so is the tax on mouldings.  I think the Government have very much underrated the amount of employment that will be given by the manufacture of mouldings. They will have to be now run in the Saorstát, not by the piece or yard, but by hundreds of miles.  Nobody need laugh at that.  Perhaps it will run into thousands of miles.  The timber merchants say that this will mean a very considerable increase in business and there is a certain amount of organisation needed.  It is all very well to tell them to wait.  Later on they would have to say to their customers: &ldquo;You will have to wait your turn.&rdquo; Their idea is that the proper course should be to allow them to make arrangements <Col N="970" /> to get in their proper stocks, their catalogues, and provide machines and instal them.  Having said that, you may wonder why the trade are making difficulties about floorings and sheetings. It might be thought that the manufacture of floorings and sheetings are pretty much what mouldings are. Floorings and sheetings will produce some rather obscure reactions.  They are not the same as mouldings.  The manufacture is not the same.  They are produced by different machines, though you might immediately answer me by saying they can be produced by the same machine.  That is quite true, but the stocks will have to be got from countries other than Scandinavia, from which the stocks for these boards will have to be imported.  I would ask the Minister does he imagine that timber merchants in the Saorstát can, at a moment's notice, provide 25 per cent. additional storage for these boards? Some of their trade must suffer.  I would like to point out to the Minister that the saw millers, each in their turn, find themselves faced with a number of undesirable precedents.  In some cases there will be a very large expenditure on machinery.  I do not know whether the Minister would take this as a desirable time to think of embarking on the spending of a large amount of money on machinery and on machines of a type that will do twenty times the work of any of the machines in the Saorstát at the present time.  Side by side with this a very large amount of refuse will be created.</P>
    <P>In the Free State we have been trying to encourage our production of electrical energy and it now seems as if some of the mills will have to start to burn their refuse in the boilers and use coal.  From the economic point of view of the country, that is not a very desirable expedient. I have said each merchant must have very large additional storage for these boards.  Most of the timber merchants are engaged in bringing timber from the country of origin and supplying it to the people here.  Another section of their trade, the hard wood trade, has to be taken into consideration.  They control that <Col N="971" /> trade only to a very slight extent.  A lot of them will have to give up the sections they devote to hard wood for the time being, and that business will be done from across the water.  I do not know whether the Minister thinks it is desirable to decrease the direct importation of this wood and encourage the trade amongst firms from neighbouring countries.</P>
    <P>If very considerable outlays of capital are made, it will tighten up money and we all know the stringency in regard to money at the present time.  I do not think the Minister would be pleased to find that the credit terms of the trade had been shortened.  I am afraid the Electricity Supply Board have set rather a bad example, because they have reduced their credit terms from three to two months.  Before the Minister can get going it will be well into next year and probably the next Budget will be before us.  I told the Minister about the reorganisation that has occurred. He is, no doubt, aware that some of the mills have been tried in Belfast and they found the amount of labour saved so considerable that they do not have to work on Saturdays.  I am sure he is aware of what happened in Cork.  I would like to recommend this amendment to the favourable consideration of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>The answer to most of Deputy Dockrell's points is that if we want to get this work done here we shall have to start some time and we contend that this is as good a time as any.  Deputy Dockrell says that we may not be able to get the rough timber into the country before next April or May and he argues that we should wait until then.  If we were to wait until then it would be probably six or twelve months before we could really get going.  The mills would not be properly equipped and possibly there would be still a difficulty about arranging for supplies.  I feel certain that if we were to wait until April the merchants would come along to us and say they were not in a position to do business then.  If we allowed six months, that would bring us into next <Col N="972" /> winter and consequently the period would have to be extended for a year because of the difficulty in getting timber during the winter months.</P>
      <P>In our opinion, it was best to act as we did when we imposed the duty. We have not restricted the importation of planed and dressed timber.  It is coming to those saw millers who have intimated their intention of continuing in that part of the business by installing the machinery necessary to enable them to deal with the planing and dressing when the timber is available.  That situation will continue as long as the necessity for it is demonstrated to us.  The timber will come in when those difficulties have been met.  The shut down will take place at a specified time and from that date all the planing and dressing will will be done here by the millers who have, in the meantime, installed the necessary equipment and are in a position to deal with that side of the business.</P>
      <P>We have either to give up the idea of doing this at all or else we must decide upon doing it at some definite period and, in our opinion, this time of the year is as suitable as any other; in fact we consider it more suitable than at any other period of the year. We are prepared to continue the licensing provision in order to ensure that there will be no hold up and until the supplies of raw timber are available and also until the merchants here are in the position to handle it properly.  The point to remember is that instead of starting on the process next April we will by that time have completed the process and from that month onwards we can contemplate all that type of work being done within this country.</P>

      <P>The Minister has entirely overlooked what I said about mouldings.  There are only three sections in the timber merchant's business, the mouldings, the planed flooring and the joinery.  The Minister has imposed duties on mouldings and joinery, which the trade have accepted.  They wish a certain time in which to digest that change affecting two-thirds of their trade.  I think the Minister might very easily wait three months before putting <Col N="973" /> the third imposition upon them.  The Minister referred to the giving of permits.  He is giving permits only up to the end of December for normal requirements.  Normal requirements have been interpreted to mean something approaching the quota.  The quota is rather difficult to work, particularly when you are communicating by telegraph with Scandinavia and you are told the ship will not go up unless you take 150 standards.  We are now within three weeks of a shut-down and that is not a very long time.</P>

      <P>The period of operation of the licence will run to the end of December.  Evidence was procured from various sources and conflicting statements were made, and we decided to institute an interim period in which we would endeavour to get accurate information on all the points raised, particularly the point about the availability of supplies in these months of the year.  The necessary inquiries have been made in that connection in all the countries concerned, and will be available before the end of that period in order to enable us to determine whether a shut-down should take place then, or in January, February, March, or at any other period when a shut-down of the licences may be considered advisable.  In the meantime, although &ldquo;normal requirements&rdquo; is the term used&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is not being enforced rigidly.  It is intended to prevent the stocking up of timber here in anticipation of a period when the shut-down takes place.  That is what would have happened if we had announced in advance our intention of imposing this duty next April.  By that time there would be a year's supply in the country.</P>

      <P>The Minister's assurance that this is an elastic term will relieve some people in the trade whose hair is being turned grey.  The Minister has not answered my point as to a respite.  You have given the trade a duty of two-thirds of their output and they have to prepare for that.  They <Col N="974" /> want you to give them a bit of respite&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

There is an enormous amount of work in mouldings and it would be better if people were allowed to prepare properly so as to be able to serve the trade properly and not leave them to wait their turn.  Remember, you are not going to get Scandinavian boards. You are going to get boards planed in this country, which are very different things.</P>

    <P>The present duty upon complete wireless sets is 50 per cent.  There is a duty on parts of 33? per cent. Since that duty was imposed, the matter has been given very careful consideration and it has now been decided to reduce from 33? per cent. to 25 per cent the duty upon parts, defining parts as completely unassembled parts &mdash; loud speakers, transformers and condensers.  The duty on loud speakers, transformers and condensers will be 25 per cent. There is every prospect that the manufacture of these sets upon a factory scale will be undertaken here in the very near future.  Consequently, any increased demand that might arise from the establishment of the new station at Moydrum will be supplied from Irish sources.  It is the purpose of this amendment to assist in ensuring that.  The whole effect is to reduce from 33? per cent. to 25 per cent. the duty on parts.</P>

He has to communicate with the Excise and Customs officer but I do not know if it is necessary to get his permission before he can order the medicine or if he will be allowed to get the medicine he orders by wire by the next morning's post.  Any restriction that would cause any delay in the delivery of that medicine would be criminal, because the life of the patient is involved.  I do not know why a doctor should be called upon to give all those reasons&mdash;possibly post mortem reasons&mdash;for ordering.

      <P>This amendment was intended to provide further facilities for medical practitioners to import therapeutic substances in case of emergency.  The matter had been discussed in this House on Second Reading by Deputies Mulcahy and Hennessy and an amendment was inserted which appeared to cover adequately the points at issue.  On further consideration of the Bill however and after discussions with medical men outside the House, it appeared to be advisable to provide further facilities and as a result this amendment was inserted in the Seanad and I recommend it for the acceptance of the House.</P>

    <P>Question proposed&mdash;&ldquo;That the Dáil do now adjourn until Wednesday, 1st February.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil is now going to adjourn for approximately two months.  We are adjourning at a time when our national economy in this country is in a very serious, but not dangerous state.  It so happens that we are amongst the few countries, if there are really any other countries in the world, in the position of a creditor State.  We have considerable investments outside and we had up to some short time ago a fairly sound national economy here.  At present we are in the throes of an economic conflict which is reducing considerably the revenue from our principal industry&mdash; agriculture.  The effects of this economic war are manifold.  They have their results upon other people as well as those immediately engaged in agriculture.  In so far as the agriculturists are concerned the effect on some has been almost catastrophic. Few have escaped lightly, and it would be impossible to estimate what the actual losses are in a great many cases or what the potential losses may be in quite a number of cases.  Agriculturists have really been attacked on two sides, on the one hand in respect of their exports and on the other in <Col N="981" /> respect of the costs incidental to their industry.  These costs have been very considerable.  The result of these two attacks has been that while the immediate effect of the blow has directly affected agriculturists its reactions have been felt all along the line and employment throughout the entire State has been affected.  Unemployment has increased; want has increased; poverty has increased, as is evidenced by the numbers receiving home assistance and the cost of it throughout the State.  The numbers compare very unfavourably with last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now certain people who were quiescent a short time ago redoubling their efforts, and who are interesting themselves in a policy which they describe as &ldquo;Boycott British Goods.&rdquo;  Our main market is in Great Britain.  The main source of the wealth that comes to this country is Great Britain.  We are one of Great Britain's best customers. National economy in practically all countries is such that few countries can expect to export and to escape importing.  There has been, however, quite recently an activity on the part of certain people to boycott British goods.  I understand that one of the persons most prominently identified with that is an Englishwoman.  In any case the Press reported recently instances where certain traders had been called upon in Dublin and elsewhere throughout the country and warned against stocking British goods. One of the disadvantages of this conflict is that you have not alone what are called statutory impositions on the part of the two countries, but you have also the boycott, either silent or pronounced, in either one or the other. I think it is the duty of the Government to take steps to see that there is no interference with traders stocking goods here and doing business according to law.  If we desire to prohibit goods from any country let us do it according to law.  Let us enact legislation and let it be seen clearly and distinctly what our proposals are. We have passed a measure here within the last ten minutes giving preferential rates to British goods. <Col N="982" /> Let us be honest both with ourselves and with those with whom we are in conflict, if we are in conflict with them.  If there has been any departure from the settled practice of giving traders the protection to which they are entitled, then I should like to know why that departure has been made.  I do condemn most positively any attempt on the part of any of our citizens to organise with a view to injuring either the trade or the goods of any other country.  I have no apology to make for that statement because there is no person here who has, so far as his means allow, done more than I have in respect to Irish manufacture.</P>
    <P>We are a separate and independent State and we have all the obligations as well as the rights of an independent State.  We have obligations towards people outside this country as well as towards our own people.  Apart altogether from any spiritual obligation that there is on us in that connection, it is to our material advantage to keep on good terms with our neighbour when we are dealing so extensively with him as we are.  By reason of this economic war there has been a shortage in the money circulating in this country. Traders are short of money; business is interrupted; there are complaints about the state of business and complaints about the difficulty of collecting accounts.  At this period, when one requires to have circulating in the country all the money available, this economic conflict we are now engaged in with the British is stopping the circulation of money, decreasing the wealth that should pour in here, and is leaving us at this time of universal world depression in a weak position.</P>
    <P>One of the most remarkable publications issued by this Government since it came into office was the record of the proceedings at Ottawa.  At Ottawa the other countries of the Commonwealth all stated what their difficulties were; how hard pressed they were to meet the enormous obligations that were resting upon them in respect of borrowed moneys.  New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and perhaps to a lesser extent South Africa, had to point out how much money they had to pay to their <Col N="983" /> creditors in respect of borrowed money. It transpired that in one case, I think it was Australia, where they were in serious financial difficulties a few years ago, they had to increase their production enormously and reduce, as far as they could, their importations.  The result of the increase of their production has been that we have had to meet enormous competition on the British market in respect of mutton, lamb and butter.  Australian and New Zealand&mdash; particularly Australian &mdash; exports to Great Britain have practically doubled in respect of mutton, and they had gone up two and a half times in respect of butter.  Those are articles with which we are in competition.  Those countries, as I have said, have their own serious financial liabilities to meet, but they met them in the way in which they almost deluged with goods the market with which we are in competition.  They have drawn from that market, and must draw from it even though the price is small, very much more money than might otherwise be expected. They have reduced the price of our goods there, and have in consequence limited our spending capacity, limited the means we have for providing employment, curtailed our wealth, and interfered with our production.</P>
    <P>In the case of those countries the appalling thing about it was the enormous sums of money they had. We were, as I have said in the beginning, better equipped to enter upon this international competition for trade than any of the other countries, and we have, unfortunately, come back from Ottawa, where there was a possibility&mdash;not alone a possibility but a probability&mdash;of doing a great good for the country, empty-handed, except for two agreements, negligible in value, but of themselves capable of extension, if we had had proper attention paid to the needs and the requirements of this country.  We have got to make up our minds here now that it is upon whatever we are able to produce at a competitive price that we are going to make the prosperity of this country. We have to make up our minds, so far as public expenditure is concerned, that if it is raised to such a height as <Col N="984" /> will interfere with that production or increase the cost of that production above any relative international standard, the people of the country are going to suffer.</P>
    <P>While we have heard that this Government, according to its own account, has practically carried out its undertakings in respect of public commitments before the election, it is quite apparent from what has transpired that they have achieved all the easy things.  The passing of Acts empowering the spending of other people's money is no fulfilment of what they promised before the election. They have introduced two or three Acts.  I will give them credit for all the Acts they like to claim for.  What it has come to in substance is this, that they have collected more from the people, when their capacity to pay was never lower, in order to vindicate themselves, but they have failed in their fundamental policy, and that is to rebuild on sounder and better foundations the national economy of this State.  Now, if we were to take stock of the wealth of the country and its potentialities at this moment, as compared with when they came into office, they would show a very large falling off, and it is from the wealth of the country that any possible results can come in respect of employment. The returns in respect of employment, the returns in respect of home assistance, and the huge amount of money spent in that connection are proof positive of what I have said, that notwithstanding the moneys they have raised and spent, the results are much worse than what they were before they came into office.</P>
    <P>In July, 1931, 76,000 persons were in receipt of home assistance: in July, 1932, 90,000; in August, 1931, 76,000 approximately; in August, 1932, 92,000; in September, 1931, 26,000; in September, 1932, 94,000; in October, 1931, 80,000; and in October, 1932, 102,000.  Practically the same results can be seen in respect of the expenditure. The expenditure in July, 1931, was £10,748 per week; in July, 1932, £12,307; in August, 1931, £10,642; in August, 1932, £12,475; in September, 1931, £10,933; in September, 1932 <Col N="985" /> £12,956; in October, 1931, £10,954, and in October, 1932, £13,432.  It is no pleasure to read out these figures.  I would very much prefer to see the other side of the picture, but taking the case as it is and seeing that danger signal, what is going to be done about it?  In respect of the taxation that has been imposed this year, has the Government taken advice as to what possible results their policy might lead to, whether or not they had been drawing upon capital, or whether they were simply drawing from revenue.  If from capital then the results in the future are going to be worse than they are at present.  Much the same result, as I have said, can be extracted from the figures of registered unemployed.</P>
    <P>We have had our political experiments here in this country; we have had our political differences; but on one thing, at any rate, there ought to be agreement, that is what is the measure of the contribution that can be given from all sections towards the rehabilitation of our national economy. On that question there can be agreement. The first essential in that connection is peace with Great Britain. One does not win all one's wars, and it may be too costly a war to win if we won it.  It may be much too costly.  If we save £5,000,000 and lost our export trade what we have gained is a bagatelle &mdash; an absolute bagatelle.  If we could save some of the £5,000,000 and keep and extend our trade, then we would have done well.  If, as a result of the sober weighing up of all those factors, the Government sees the wisdom of doing what is best for this country then they will end this war, and the sooner they do it the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWhite" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Dáil to the manner in which importers' licences have been granted indiscriminately, not on the merits or according to the rules that are laid down but according to the strongest political influence that the applicant can pull, with the result that at the present time importers' licences are granted on wholly political and partisan lines.  Two questions were on the Order Paper to-day, and I submit that the Minister for Finance was not in a <Col N="986" /> position to defend the action of the Department in the issuing of the licences.  One of those licences was issued to a firm in Cardonagh, Messrs. McDonagh &amp; Company, who, in my opinion, were not in a position to show a quota of any import of Indian corn grain.  Another application was made by a trader named Norris.  That man's invoices can be produced, and they will show an import of grain for the year 1931 of at least 150 to 200 tons, but because he was unable to use the same political influence as other people his licence was refused.  The issuing of these importers' licences does not alone refer to the import of grain, but to other articles as well as maize, and I submit that in the circumstances the various departments should change their method of issuing those importers' licences, that they should issue them in an honest, straightforward way to people who are entitled to get them, and make investigation into the representations that have been made by the various firms who were supplied with those importers' licences.  Another question I have down to-day, and which was answered by the Minister for Agriculture is in connection with this new mixture of ten per cent. oats and 20 per cent. maize, the result of which is that in my part of the country there are very large stocks of oats left on the hands of the traders, and they cannot get a penny for them.  The result, inevitably, will be that a very large proportion of them will be spoiled before there will be a market found for them, and I think it is up to the Minister to consider the question of giving an export bounty at once in order to give these people an opportunity of getting rid of their surplus stocks.</P>

      <P>It is a peculiar state of affairs to hear these people on the opposite benches coming forward with all their complaints when they themselves have caused the whole trouble. Their whole grievance apparently is that three individuals with no authority went over to Britain and handed over £5,000,000 per year of our money. That they had no authority was proved by a resolution passed in the Dáil on <Col N="987" /> the 26th February, 1926, when Deputy Cosgrave was then President.  Despite that resolution, the money was paid every year, and I think there is nothing more amusing than to hear Deputy Cosgrave talking now about the British market as our only hope while he knows right well, as I pointed out a fortnight ago in the Dáil, that he could have walked over there last year and made a case not alone for the retention of that £5,000,000, but a case for getting back every penny illegally paid.  He knew that quite well and he knew also that our farmers were getting £13,000,000 less for their produce in 1931 than they got in the year 1924, the year after Mr. Blythe signed the secret agreement.  He knew also that the difference in price which the farmer got in 1930 and 1931 was just about double the land annuities&mdash; £6,000,000 difference between the price of what the farmer got in 1930 for his produce and what he got in 1931.  Notwithstanding all this, they sat there and just said &ldquo;if the old farmer is not able to pay his annuities we will evict him, but the blood money must go over to Britain.  We must get the last farthing, no matter who pays.&rdquo;  The individual's name was even mentioned in this secret agreement, who was to fix the price the Irish farmer was to pay for his land and that individual was a member of the Masonic Order in this country who&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Very well.  For the past four or five years those people have used the whip on the back of the poor Irish farmer on every available opportunity, <Col N="988" /> with their Land Act after Land Act, with the tenants' interests and the landlords' interest&mdash;the landlords who kicked the poor tenants out. Whose fault is it if there is trouble with Britain at the present time? Britain put on the tariffs.  Who told them to put them on?  Deputy Blythe, of course, who went around last year and said: &ldquo;I will advise John Bull what to do,&rdquo; and John Bull put the tariffs on the cattle.  Every time we attempted to meet Britain in the hope of arriving at a fair settlement our delegates found before they ever left this country that they were stabbed in the back.  For instance, when Mr. Thomas came over here to fix up the arbitration business he made no demand that the payment of the half year's annuities which were due should be paid before they would arrive at a settlement.  Similarily, when the President of this State went over to Britain no demand was made for the half year's annuities before they would negotiate a settlement.  On the very night Deputy Norton left this House to go over to Britain and see if a settlement could be arrived at, the Deputy of the kicking cow, Fitzgerald-Kenney, and Deputy Blythe got up here and stated that before there was any settlement at all, or any negotiations entered into, the half year's annuities should be paid, and when the President of this State went over the following day, Mr. MacDonald, using the bullets handed to him by his friends here, said: &ldquo;You must pay the half year's annuities before any negotiations can be entered into.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had Deputy Cosgrave talking about home assistance.  Well, the poor people are getting more now than they ever did when the Deputies opposite were in power&mdash;home assistance has been doubled&mdash;and we have taken every case separately and looked into its merits.  We hear another cry, &ldquo;Look at the lists in the labour exchanges&rdquo; and &ldquo;Look at the increased unemployment in the country.&rdquo;  There was many a poor fellow, sometimes perhaps with a wife and five or six children to support, who walked the soles off his boots before he got employment in Deputy Mulcahy's labour exchange and <Col N="989" /> after walking there he would find at the end of the time that there would be some young gentleman just demobilised out of the Army, and if a vacancy did arise then that young man would be entitled to first preference as against the poor man who had been coming there for months, even though the young fellow had no family.  I challenge Deputy Mulcahy here in this House to deny that.  As usual we have them coming along here with their nonsense. Anybody who studies the position knows the facts well.  Deputies opposite know it only too well.  When I challenged them here a month ago to come down to East Cork and let the country pronounce between them and us they ran away from that challenge.</P>

      <P>I can say that in my constituency we have found permanent employment for 400 hands and in a few months' time we will have permanent employment for 1,000 hands &mdash;hands that were deprived of employment by, I will not say the deliberate work of, the late Executive Council. That Executive Council by their action closed down the Glanmire mills.  The late Minister for Industry and Commerce by a 20 per cent. tariff on waterproof coming in, and the 25 per cent. tariff on other materials for making them, closed this mill.  Last year we had as a consequence the Civic Guards walking around the streets in waterproofs made by the Victory Rubber Company of England.  The difference between the price tendered by the Irish contractor and the English contractor was 9d. per suit.  For the sake of that 9d. per suit, 103 hands were thrown out on the roadside to starve and the work that should be given to them was given to foreigners while our Civic Guards were swanking around in waterproofs made in London. <Col N="990" /> Thank God there is now in office a Government who are going to see that there is going to be no unemployment and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that if there is to be unemployment it is Englishmen who will be unemployed and not the people of this country.  We have at present down in Glanmire 103 hands working in the factory that was closed down last February through the laziness of the late Minister for Idleness.  That is the gentleman that is now taken up by the Catholic Party.  We have the same position now with regard to our flour mills.  Only one week after we came into office we had young Mr. Rank down in Midleton with his tape measure measuring the plant with a view to transferring it and closing down the mill in Midleton.  But there is a Government there now who will not allow that.  That mill is now working 24 hours a day with three shifts a day. And that is the mill that was practically closed down through the able work of our late Minister for Idleness. We have the same position existing in practically every single industry in this country.</P>
      <P>What was their policy?  Anything that can be made cheaper in any other country than it can be made here should not be produced here.  I heard Deputy O'Donovan coming out here last week with that doctrine.  That was the policy of the Farmers' Union Party and that was the policy adopted by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party&mdash;anything that can be made cheaper in any other country should not be produced here.  If we follow that policy out to its logical conclusion we should take all the individuals in this country who are in employment, gather them all up and put them into one work camp as I heard the Farmers' Union representatives practically advocating.  In their places we should bring over coolies to do their work.  That would be the natural working out of their policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are the people who come along now and complain about unemployment. They are just like the fellow who comes along after having set fire <Col N="991" /> to the house and when it was well burned out asks for compensation for the loss of the house.  These people have for years, through the illegal payment of moneys to another country, brought about that state of affairs and they come along now and say &ldquo;the house is going to be burned.&rdquo; I did not look for any decency from them, but if they had any spark of decency at all they would shut their mouths.  It is nothing that these people should have been handing over money to England since 1926, since the resolution was proposed by Deputy Cosgrave.  That is the resolution to which I have already referred.  That resolution states that unless the agreement has the approval of the Oireachtas it is not effective nor legal. That was the resolution carried through in this House.  When did the Ultimate Financial Settlement receive the sanction of this House?  That is what I would like to know?  That resolution, of course, was proposed with their tongues in their cheeks, but yet the cardboard Mussolinis went over and paid the money to a foreign Government.  These people say to the Government &ldquo;Why do you not settle now?&rdquo; Why did they not settle last January?  They were the people and they have as their policy one of settling this.  They are the people who threw the chestnuts into the fire and they are the people who should take them out.  Surely to goodness they will get a share of goodwill in the settlement. They drew salaries for acting illegally for the last five or six years.  Why do they not come along now and do the right thing.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we will find later on that there are other agreements made by them and documents that did not come into the grand burning that took place before they went out of office.  But there were a few documents saved from the burning.  They are apparently very disagreeable documents now to members of the late Government.  If they have any more of them they might as well come along and make a clean breast of the matter.  They should not be coming in here as a party of cant and humbug.  If they have any respect <Col N="992" /> at all left for themselves they should keep their mouths shut and hide their heads now until the fight we are carrying on is over.  That is the very least they should do.  If the people who set fire to the house cannot in any way help now to put out the fire, they should at least refrain from throwing any more petrol on it while the fire is burning.  But that is what these people are doing at the present moment.  As far as we are concerned, I gave them a fair offer a month ago and that was that if they wanted to know the people's opinion of our policy they could come down to my constituency and test that opinion.  I promise the Opposition that when they do come there they will get the answer that any and every group who ever sold this country got from the Irish people.</P>

I am afraid there are a number of Deputies here who are inclined to treat Deputy Corry with a certain amount of levity, and who are inclined to think that the statements he makes are hardly worth listening to.  As a matter of fact, a large number of Deputies cannot even bear to listen to the Deputy.  They walk out when he gets up to speak.  I think that is a mistake. The Deputy is rather clever as, in my opinion, he has just proved, because he has talked for nearly half an hour and said nothing.  He avoided dealing with any point which was raised, either in this debate or upon any of the matters which were discussed during this session, which would be relevant to this debate.  The <Col N="993" /> Deputy nearly succeeded in making the impression upon himself that he has, apparently, made upon many Deputies, when he talked about unemployment and about outdoor relief.  He talked about unemployment.  I would ask any Deputy, even Deputy Corry himself, who has time to-morrow, to look up the Official Debates, and to read the speech the Deputy made this day 12 months ago&mdash;on the same motion, when there were at least 50,000 less unemployed than there are to-day.</P>

      <P>They are not getting it yet.  If the Deputy reads the newspapers, and I am sure he does, he will find that in order to obtain it the unemployed are compelled to force their way into some meetings.  I think the House is under a debt of gratitude to Deputy White of Donegal, as it looked as if the debate was going to collapse until he came to the rescue. <Col N="994" /> We did not see that same enthusiasm, and that same general desire to get up and plead the cause of the unemployed that we saw twelve months ago, and two years ago.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle was going to put the motion when Deputy White came to the rescue.  Why?  Is it because the unemployed are better off to-day than twelve months ago?  Is it because there are less unemployed to-day than twelve months ago?  Will Deputy Corry tell the House, even now, after nine months, what is the plan which he, in common with other members of his Party, told the electorate last February they had for the immediate solution of the unemployment problem?  We have not seen the plan yet.  The House has not seen it; the country has not seen it.  I wonder if the Labour Party has seen it; the plan that was to find employment for 80,000 and, I think, 41 persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the plan?  Did it ever exist except in the imagination of Deputies? If there is a plan surely, in fairness to themselves, if not in fairness to the unemployed, it ought to be produced. We were told that whilst unemployment was to be reduced taxation would also be reduced.  Can the Vice-President tell us, or can he give me an answer to another question, as I failed to extract an answer from the unofficial Minister for Employment&mdash;I think &ldquo;for Unemployment&rdquo; would describe him more accurately.  How much of the £1,000,000 for road work has been allocated and upon what basis has the money been allocated?  How much of the amount allocated has been spent to date, and how much remains to be spent?  Can we have from the Minister for Local Government and Public Health an assurance that a letter similar to that which he addressed about six weeks ago to the county surveyor for the North Riding of Tipperary informing him that he was forwarding £4,500 as a final allocation, and hoping that the county surveyor would take steps to see that in the whole of the North Riding the £4,500 would be spent before the 31st March next, was not sent to every county surveyor in the Free State?  If the Minister for Local Government and <Col N="995" /> Public Health will accept my words, he need have no fear whatever about the £4,500 being spent before the 31st March.  I can assure the Minister that it has been spent already.  We are hoping that the Minister in this matter, as in many other matters, may change his mind.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech Deputy Cosgrave referred to the British boycott movement.  I want to say that if it is thought necessary or desirable to boycott or to exclude British or goods produced in any other country, this House, and the present Government, have all the powers they require.  They can absolutely exclude any goods and we can, in effect, live within brass walls or, if you like, glass walls.  I agree that no person, no group of persons, and no organisation, not acting under the authority and with the consent of the Government elected by the people, has any right whatever, good, bad or indifferent to interfere in any way with the trade of this country, either the internal or the external trade.  In that connection I would like to have a reply from a Minister who is not present.  I am sure some of his colleagues will reply for him.  I would like to ask the Minister for Defence if he issued an order that Bass's ale is not to be supplied in military canteens.  If the order has not been issued by the Minister, has it been issued by any other person acting under his authority?  If not, can the Minister assure the House that the order has not been issued by anyone? If the order has been issued, I think we are entitled to get from the Minister his reasons for giving such an order.</P>
    <P>I want to say that so far as I am concerned I have no brief good, bad, or indifferent, for Bass's ale.  We are producing in this country at the moment&mdash;and I am stating this quite frankly as one who has a little experience of it&mdash;an ale that can compare favourably with any ale produced elsewhere.  But let us be quite clear that if we are going to have tariffs or embargoes, no tariffs or embargoes can be issued or given effect to in this country by any person, any group of persons, or any organisation other than the Government <Col N="996" /> elected by the people of the country. I think that even my friend Deputy Corry will subscribe to that.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other matters to which I should like to refer but I do not want to take up much more of the time of the House because I understand&mdash;and I may say I am myself quite in agreement with that understanding&mdash;that the debate is to conclude at a certain hour.  I do not want to take up time that properly, and perhaps more profitably, should be given to other members of the House but I do say this on the eve of the recess&mdash;perhaps on the eve of an election&mdash;that if the Government have a plan for dealing with unemployment, if they have any machinery thought out, if they have given any consideration to the production of any machinery to give effect to the motion which was debated in this House for about four days, and which was passed unanimously by the House on the 26th June last calling upon the Government to provide work or maintenance to meet the immediate needs of the unemployed, I want to get from the Vice-President a statement as to what steps, if any, have been taken to give effect to that.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Vice-President if he is aware that since the motion was passed by the House and accepted by the Government on the word of the President, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and certain lesser lights in the Party, the bill for the maintenance of the unemployed has been increased enormously and that instead of its falling on the national Exchequer, it is falling on the local ratepayers.  Is the Minister aware because of the failure of the Government to give effect to the motion, that the outdoor relief bill in the South Riding of Tipperary has been increased as from the last meeting by £1,000 per week?  I should like to ask the Vice-President if he can tell me when he is dealing with the matter, or if he can tell the ratepayers of the South Riding of Tipperary, in particular the farmers &mdash;and again, I would like to remind the Vice-President, in case he does not know it, that South Tipperary is mainly, if not altogether, a dairying <Col N="997" /> district&mdash;how they are going to provide another £52,000 per year in rates to meet the increased poverty and destitution which have necessitated that increase in South Tipperary.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to say anything in this debate, but I feel called upon to do so, after listening to Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Morrissey talking about the increase in home assistance and how it has gone up by leaps and bounds for the few months this Government has been in office.  I do not know whether Deputy Morrissey, who comes from a rural area like myself, is a member of a home assistance committee or not.  As one who has been a member of a board of guardians, and who is at the present time chairman of the Home Assistance Committee for North County Dublin, I should like to say a few words on the conditions that prevailed during the years the other Government was in office.  Heretofore we could only give outdoor relief to an old man or woman who had a doctor's certificate.  At the present time any young man is entitled to go to the home assistance officer in the rural area.  That was not permitted until this Government took up office. For instance, in the year 1930-31&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree, but it has been referred to here by Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Morrissey in stating that the outdoor relief bill has gone up. They referred to the rates in 1931-32. In 1931-32 I was surcharged for giving a widow with one child home assistance because she was an able-bodied woman and the doctor would not certify that she was unfit for work.  At the present time, single persons even though they may be only 18 or 19 years of age, are entitled under Section 30 to get home assistance.  I have advocated that myself always, and the relief bill has gone up every year since 1920.  It has doubled since this Government came into office because everybody is entitled to get home assistance and more luck to them.  They are quite entitled to draw it when there is no work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="998" /> To come back to the question of unemployment; in January, 1932, the last Government, when hard pressed, gave a grant of £1,500 to County Dublin.  I do not know why it was given in the month of January.  It would not give a breakfast to all the unemployed in County Dublin.  The present Government has made a grant of £19,000 to relieve unemployment in County Dublin.  We did not hear much talk about what the other counties got. Deputy Morrissey did not tell us what Tipperary got, but I think we can take it for granted that they got over £19,000.  I am open to correction, but I think they got £27,000, judging from what I saw in the Press.  Along with the £19,000 which Dublin got there was £11,000 granted for public health purposes. We are asking for a little more and I hope the Minister will see his way to grant the few thousand pounds that has been asked at the present time.  It is only a small sum, £6,000, and I have every confidence that the Minister will grant it to relieve the pressure during the coming few months.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey mentioned Bass's ale.  There was a time when I was interested in these goods, but at the present time it is to be hoped that the Ministry will take the attitude of prohibiting all classes of drink.  That is my attitude in this House and in my constituency.  I do not mind what any person may say or what action they may take against me.  I say that the canteens should be shut down together with a lot of other halls throughout the country.  I hope the Minister will take some notice of that and say that he will introduce a Bill later on during his term in this House to do away with all drink.  That is my attitude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Previous speakers have referred to the British boycott, and the last two speakers have mentioned the matter of Bass's ale.  I understand that recently members of the licensed trade in Dublin have been written to by this Committee that calls itself the British Boycott Committee and asked not to sell Bass's ale.  I understand that individual traders have been visited by young men, and warned to <Col N="999" /> dispose of their existing stocks of this commodity and not to get in any more. In certain cases the actual demeanour of those who called upon the traders may have been courteous enough.  But traders know very well the sort of people who are running this campaign and they know very well that the request, no matter how it may be phrased, and no matter in what tones it is delivered, is a threat.  The licensed trade, I believe, have asked the Minister for Justice to meet a deputation to discuss the matter.  I understand the Minister for Justice has refused to meet them.  It seems to me that the Minister for Justice ought to meet them, and to consider, with them, what way this campaign in general can be stopped and what way it can be stopped as applied to this particular trade.  It is a very wrong and intolerable thing that people carrying on their business should be subjected to interference by organised gangs of bullies, and that nothing effective should be done to deal with them.  As this particular commodity was mentioned I think that nobody in the House can fail to see the economic danger that is involved in allowing a boycott campaign against the sale of this commodity to be carried on, apparently, with the connivance of the Government.  If the Government does not take steps, as has been proposed by the members of the licensed trade, it will appear inevitable that the boycott is carried on with their connivance.  Deputies can see easily a campaign of this sort might, in a certain direction, prove to be the last straw and might cause permanent economic injury and permanent loss to employment in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the Ministry that it is their duty to deal with the whole of this boycott campaign.  I know that the newspaper organ, with which the President of the Executive Council is associated, has refused advertisements desired to be inserted by the Boycott Committee.  And that is all to the good. But there should be something official done by the Government.  It should not be possible for this campaign to <Col N="1000" /> be carried out openly, as if it was a perfectly legitimate thing, and not a tyrannical interference with the rights of the citizens.  I know there may be difficulty in making legal detection. Undoubtedly there would be certain difficulty in getting evidence that would lead to a conviction for conspiracy or intimidation or something of that sort, but if the Government took energetic action, they could be successful and if they coupled that energetic action with the clear pronouncement that ought to come from them, there would be general support from the community that would enable them to deal with it.  I think it should be dealt with and should be dealt with as a question of law and order.  It is also a question of grave economic significance. In every aspect I think it is an intolerable thing.  There are now powers in the hands of the Executive Government with which they could stop the sale of this commodity in a few weeks if they desired.  They could stop it without the disorder this leads to.  If the Government let the people running this campaign get away with it they will proceed to others and we will have evils of every sort arising out of it.  The Government ought to take their courage in their hands and deal with the matter.  They ought not to be afraid of those irresponsible people or any allegations they make.  The Government should do its duty, as a Government and certainly it is its duty to see that no movement of this kind is allowed to get growing.  If it is allowed to grow it will naturally only produce disorder and will raise such difficulties.  Even if we had a settlement to-morrow, it would be impossible to get rid of the bad feeling that this would create in a particular market for a long time if allowed to go on.  I am not surprised that Ministers are not anxious to join in this debate.  I do not suppose anybody on the Front Government Bench would feel as satisfied, or could speak with the conviction on the matter, that Deputy Corry appears to have.</P>
    <P>When the House assembles again, after this adjournment, nearly a year will have run since they came into office, and during that period there has <Col N="1001" /> been the gravest deterioration in the economic state of the country.  The unemployment figures that the Government have been compiling have shown such an increase in the number of registered unemployed.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is now introducing his new schemes with a great flourish of trumpets, has said he would find out what the real unemployment was all over the country with the object of reversing the policy of the last Government. He now says these figures are inaccurate and that the scheme is wrong.  We are told further that there is less unemployment than the figures show.</P>
    <P>Deputy Curran and other Deputies spoke about grants and home assistance. A good deal of money has been spent in the form of home assistance and in the way of relief grants, but it is no use, because in spite of it, the actual suffering of the poor and the amount of distress in the country are increasing.  Unemployment is increasing despite the men who have got work in a few of the new factories.  Hardship and destitution are becoming much more prevalent, despite the changes that have been made in outdoor relief, and people are suffering more.  The worst of it is that with all this increasing unemployment, and all this increased poverty and destitution, we are only at the beginning of a very bad spell.  Every week the economic squeeze is becoming tighter.  Employers have had to take their first action in works in which the whole staff and full wages were maintained up to a week ago.  They have had to get rid of some of their staffs, while others have been forced to take compulsory holidays; and when the Christmas season is over the whole arrangement in many factories and workshops will have to be reconsidered and rearranged.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies in the case of agricultural employment.  Labourers who have been getting the old rate of wages, up to this, have been told this week that they cannot be kept on, or else the wages will have to be cut down.  The economic position is really <Col N="1002" /> like a stone running down a hill.  All these dismissals and reductions in wages are caused because the decrease in the spending power of the public is going to reduce trade still further and is going to lead to more reductions and is going to lead to more discharges of the same sort.</P>
    <P>People who are conducting these protected industries, on which the Government have imposed the high tariffs, have many of them said that they are getting no real benefit out of the tariffs, that when the tariffs are taken in conjunction with the whole of the rest of the Government policy, they are worse off than before.  They may not have foreign competition to face, or to put their backs into industry in the same manner as formerly, but they have not the customers who can pay, so that, while they ought to be selling more and employing more, some are employing less and selling less.  If the Government policy continues, I see no alternative to that position getting worse and worse.</P>
    <P>The Government, when it came into office, was faced with the position in which the income of the country was falling.  Where the slump was affecting our whole economic fabric, where they ought to have been careful not to cause any shock, and where, if economies could have been reasonably effected, they ought to have effected these economies in expenditure so that production should be carried on successfully and people in business might have the best opportunity to maintain their business and improve it when improvement would be possible, instead of that the Government introduced a tariff policy which was absolutely unconsidered, a tariff policy which caused losses that were entirely unnecessary and which were not counterbalanced by any advantages whatever.  They put on tariffs at heights at which they need not have been put on and on articles for which there was no justification for putting them on.  This tariff policy raised the cost of living and the cost of production, and increased in many cases the cost of the raw material.  At the same time, in spite of decreasing powers of expenditure, it wantonly <Col N="1003" /> increased the cost of living, causing an enormous increase in taxation which will run up to £4,000,000 a year and which actually is £2,750,000.  When the Ministers were told that their increase in taxation, their putting up of the income tax to 5/-, and so on, would injure employment, they scoffed, but I think that some of them must realise now that that taking of money out of the taxpayer's pocket has been one of the things that has frozen trade, that has caused a fall in turnover, and made it necessary for business houses to decrease wages, and that it is one of the things that has prevented the tariffs being any good to the businesses already established because it took away the funds existing for the purchase of their goods.</P>
    <P>Along with all that, we have had the commencement of the economic conflict. I think that, even if we had not that conflict, the policy of the Government would have made things worse, but in view of the unnecessary commencement of that conflict, in view of the refusal of the Government to arbitrate or to negotiate, I think that things have been brought to such a state that within 12 months, if the conflict continues, not only will we have widespread bankruptcy, but I think we will have such suffering and hardship on the whole community as many Deputies fail altogether to recognise.  I do not know whether I might make a suggestion to the Government for the ending of the economic war.  It may seem a fantastic proposal, but it is not more so than many of the things to which the Government have already committed themselves.  The Government has pledged itself, and Ministers have pledged themselves recently, not to pay over the land annuities or the other sums that are in question to Great Britain until there has been arbitration or until negotiations have convinced them that they have got to be paid, or until some consideration makes it worth their while to pay them.  On the other hand, they are paying bounties on exports.  Those bounties are scarcely reaching the producer at all.  If they are having any effect on prices in the <Col N="1004" /> market, it is an infinitesimal effect. Your 12½ per cent. is not producing 3 per cent. increase in the price.  Nevertheless, the bounty is a contribution to the British Customs duties levied on the other side.  I do not know whether this Government would agree to arrange to have a deposit account to the amount of £5,000,000 with the British Customs authorities, from which they might draw the duties charged on any goods exported.  In that way, we could export freely.  We would have Free Trade, but the honour of the Government would be saved, because we would not be paying over the land annuities.  Perhaps the Government would adopt some device like that.  It is a device of the sort that would be dear to the heart of the Leader of the Government.  He would always prefer to do things in a complicated way instead of a simple way, and perhaps he might consider this proposal.</P>
    <P>So far from reducing expenditure the Government policy is bound to increase expenditure enormously.  The Minister for Finance, in answer to a question I put to him, indicated that the Revenue staffs have already been so increased that an extra cost of £61,000 will fall on the Exchequer.  Nearly all of that £61,000 is due to the tariff policy of the Government.  Of course, the tariff policy of the Government has thrown enormous other extra charges on the people.  If a Control of Prices Bill is put into operation, if there is any attempt to make it effective, there will be new hordes of officials and new charges thrown on the taxpayer.  The Cereals Bill, which has been passed to-day, will also throw great charges on the taxpayer.  In every direction, the Government policy is going to mean greatly increased expenditure and it is going to mean greatly increased numbers of public officials. And, in addition to all this, the Government is faced with declining sources of revenue.  Income tax is bound, in view of the yields of income of the present year, to be down very seriously in the year that will begin on 6th April next.  If the Minister wants to get the revenue from it that he is getting now, he will have to increase the rate.  If he does increase the rate, <Col N="1005" /> there are going to be reactions by removals of people from this country that will rob him of the result of that increase.  So far as I can see, it is certain that, no matter what the Minister does in that respect, his yield of revenue in the year beginning in April next is bound to come down.  His yield of revenue from many other taxes will also decline.  The Government, I know, is not likely to be stuck for money in the present financial year. They can use the Suspense Account. They have an Exchequer balance.  They have, owing to the good credit that was built up by the past Government, borrowing power, and they can continue to borrow on that credit, but they are eating up the nation's capital. They are producing a position wherein twelve months from now, if the present Government remain in office, we are bound to be up against a financial crisis of the most serious kind.</P>
    <P>I think that it is the duty of the Government, even now, to make some effort to end this state of affairs.  They can end it by some side-stepping device if they like.  We will be satisfied if they end it.  They can end it by arbitration, they can end it by negotiations if they are prepared to negotiate. All the indications on the other side are that terms can be got that would be advantageous to this country. If they do not end it not only will the economic deterioration continue and become more rapid, but your British Boycott Committees and other illegal organisations, will tend to become harder to deal with.  The Government, if they continue in office, and maintain their present policy for any length of time, will present this country with a legacy of collapse and disorder which will be very hard to rectify, no matter who takes control after them.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to take any part in this debate until I heard the pessimistic speech which has just been delivered by Deputy Blythe. Deputy Blythe and many of his leading colleagues, ex-Ministers, have become born pessimists since they changed their seats in this House.  Deputy Blythe himself has, within my own <Col N="1006" /> recollection, and in one case even quite recently, made speeches in this country which do not well fit in with the responsibility he held in this House as a Minister in the past ten years. He, apparently, can see nothing except bankruptcy, ruin and revolution facing this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>What useful purpose does Deputy Blythe, Deputy O'Higgins or Deputy Cosgrave, or any other leading member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, serve by suggesting, not to the people of this country, but to the people outside, that the country is worse than it really is?  We are told that because of certain incidents here and there throughout the country that may have been created by irresponsible people, that we have in this country thousands of Communists and revolutionary individuals.  I prefer to take the word of Cardinal MacRory regarding the number of Communists inside this country than the suggestions contained in speeches made by Deputy Blythe, Deputy O'Higgins and others. The people of this country, no doubt, regret many things that have happened and hope that these isolated incidents will not occur again.  We have been given indications from the Ministerial Benches, on several occasions, that they will see to it that the Government writ will run in this country.  We have every right to accept the assurances given in that respect by people who hold positions of responsibility in the country.  It ill becomes leading members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, men who held offices of responsibility in this country for ten years, to be broadcasting to the world that this country is worse than any other country in the world to-day.  There has been far less crime committed in this country during the last year than even in one city in the United States, or in a big city in any other part of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree to a certain extent with Deputy Blythe that there is a shortage in the circulation of money in this country this year compared to the amount that was in circulation last year.  May I, for that reason, suggest <Col N="1007" /> to the Minister for Finance and to his Parliamentary Secretary who is responsible for dealing with schemes for the relief of unemployment, that that is all the more reason why they should let whatever money they have in hands flow a good deal more freely, particularly at this time of the year. I know, and the members of our Party have reason to know, that the pigeonholes in the offices of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, as well as in the Department of Local Government, are filled with schemes which if put into operation would provide useful employment for thousands of people in areas where employment is badly needed, and where the circulation of money would serve a useful purpose, especially at the present time.</P>
    <P>Now that we are on the eve of an adjournment of the House until 1st February next, may I tender this advice to the Minister for Finance and to his Parliamentary Secretary: to study immediately, carefully and sympathetically, during the Christmas period, the schemes that are lying in their offices.  I advise them also to circulate whatever money they have so that it may be utilised for the purpose of carrying out useful schemes in the areas where unemployment and distress are acute.</P>
    <P>I have not spoken very often in this House during this session, but I have listened, since the establishment of this Government, to speeches made from the Ministerial Benches which would lead one to believe that they rely altogether upon the building up of industry in this country by the imposition of tariffs.  Now I do not know, because I have no inside information, the extent to which additional employment has been provided by the tariffs which have been imposed during the past year, but I venture to suggest that time will prove to the Ministers of the present Government that tariffs alone are not going to build up a new economic structure in this country.  I wonder does the Minister for Finance know&mdash;Deputies on the Opposition Benches do but are afraid to tell him &mdash; the extent to which <Col N="1008" /> the banking policy in this country at the present time is operating for the purpose of reducing the amount of money in circulation as well as driving many decent farmers into a state of bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>It is well known that during the years 1918-1922 foolish farmers and their friends throughout the country bought up land at ridiculously high prices.  To-day we are faced with the fact that the banks which encouraged them to buy land at these very high prices &mdash; the banks that helped to increase prices &mdash; are sending civil bill officers around many parts of the country endeavouring to recover sums of money which are now far beyond the present value of the land then purchased. A case was brought to my notice the other day where a small farm in, my own constituency&mdash;it is a typical case &mdash; was in the year 1920 purchased for the sum of £3,650.  The foolish farmer responsible for that purchase has since paid off £3,000, yet he is faced with the fact that the sum of £2,600 is still due to the bank. That farm that was purchased in 1920 for £3,650 would not fetch £500 in a free sale to-day.</P>
    <P>I want to advise the Minister for Finance that some way must be found out of that particular kind of difficulty. Thousands of farmers in all parts of the country are affected and are being pursued by our banking institutions for the recovery of money which the bankers themselves know these farmers are unable to pay.</P>

I hope that the present Minister for Finance and his colleagues in the Ministry are not satisfied that the new economic structure which they have in view can be built up under the present banking policy as we know it.  May I hope that he will see his way, if necessary, to set up perhaps during the period of the adjournment some small committee or commission of experts who, from their <Col N="1009" /> expert knowledge, can examine fully into the operations of our present banking institutions.  Such a committee may be able to devise some means whereby the new economic structure which the Government have in view can be built up inside a shorter period than if the operations of our present banking policy and methods are allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>I rise, as we are faced with an adjournment for two months, in an effort to induce the Minister for Finance to allow the money, which he says is available, to flow more freely through the country than it has flowed up to the present and to induce the Government to examine, as quickly and as sympathetically as they can, the hundreds of schemes lying in the pigeon holes of the Board of Works, the Land Commission and the Local Government Department, and to let out as much money as possible during the Christmas season and the period of the adjournment generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Blythe has left the House.  Deputy Blythe's speech was compounded of contradictions.  We had a host of vague statements depicting depression in the blackest terms in which he could find words to describe it, statements of woe strung one after another in a long jeremiad without one concrete fact to establish the truth of what he was saying.  In fact, he never touched reality except in one point when he said that the economic policy of the Government had increased the cost of living.  I think that Deputy Blythe's speech can be judged and can be condemned by that statement because within the last six months, the cost of living index has fallen from 165 to 155 points, and the statistical data, carefully compiled by those who are competent to compile it, contradict the one statement in which Deputy Blythe came into contact with reality and show that, far from the policy of the present Government having increased the cost of living, there has been, in the six months during which we have been in office, a substantial fall therein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His speech was consistent with the general attitude of the Opposition in <Col N="1010" /> this matter.  Since the change of Government, the Opposition have taken up, in regard to the policy of the Government, an attitude of open opposition, of active opposition and, so far as the discussions are concerned, an attitude of absolute negation.  They have never come forward with a single helpful proposal or suggestion.  They have utterly belied the statement which Deputy Cosgrave made, on resigning office, that they would be here to help the Government in the difficult task it had before it, and, to-night, in the speech of the ex-Minister for Finance, we have had a further manifestation of their anti-national attitude.</P>
    <P>We are engaged in a dispute with Great Britain upon which grave issues hang&mdash;the future prosperity of our people, our ability to maintain in this land an increasing population, the opportunity to change our economic structure, to redress its present unbalanced condition and to place our people in the position which other European peoples are in that, in times of peril, they can fall back on their own native resources to find them in food, to find them in clothing and to find them in shelter.  There has not been a graver issue raised since the day when the last native Irish Parliament sat in the City of Dublin in 1690 and some attempt was made to recover for the Irish people the land that was taken from them by the sword.  I say that in Irish history there has not been a graver issue raised than has been raised now on this question of the land annuities.  There has been taken from us a tribute, the extent and magnitude of which, measured in proportion to our own resources, in proportion to the sacrifices which our people have had to make in order to pay it, stands without comparison on the face of the globe.  As the President has often said, the reparations which Germany paid, in proportion to the resources of the German people, are insignificant compared with the burden which this tribute imposes on us.</P>
    <P>The yearly payment which Great Britain makes in discharge of her debt to the United States of America is very much less, but when the British Government, speaking for the British <Col N="1011" /> people, feel that, in the circumstances in which British trade and commerce finds itself that it is beyond the capacity of their people to pay a just debt, and make representations to another Government that they are unable to discharge their obligations in that regard, they, at any rate, received in the House and in the country the unanimous and united support of every English politician and of every English citizen.  In our country, our Government are in a position which is only similar to that of Great Britain in that we are unable, as they are unable, to meet this tribute.  It is different from the position of Great Britain in this regard that, whereas they feel that in honour they would be bound to pay, we feel that neither in law, honour or equity is there any obligation on us to remit this treasure.  When we are in that very much stronger position in regard to Great Britain, how is this Government treated by those who, for the past ten years, have been proclaiming themselves the sole custodians of the national liberties, the jealous defenders of the people's interests, the incorruptible Irishmen who, despite misrepresentations would place the welfare of the people before their own personal reputations?  How have we been treated by them?  By the suggesting of the very policy by which Great Britain might collect this tribute if the Government refused to pay it.</P>
    <P>If there are duties, and penal duties, upon our imports into Great Britain, let the House and the country not forget what Deputy Corry reminded them of this evening, that the man who first suggested that tactic to Great Britain was the late Minister for Finance, the present Deputy Blythe. It was, possibly, from the point of view of those who are seeking to collect the annuities, a very helpful suggestion which Deputy Blythe made at that time.  At any rate, they thought it was a helpful one and they proceeded to give effect to it.  But contrast the practical efficacy of the advice which Deputy Blythe gave to the British Government in regard to this problem of the land annuities with the proposal <Col N="1012" /> which he made in this House to-day. He described it as fantastic.  I say it was not merely fantastic; it was malignant and mischievous.  He found in our present situation something which awoke a spirit of levity within him and he threw across, laughing as he made it, a preposterous suggestion, one which he himself stigmatised as being fantastic.  That is the only assistance and that is the only advice which Deputy Blythe, following Deputy Cosgrave, could give to the Government in its present position.  Deputy Cosgrave, of course, the Holy Willy of the Opposition Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;asked what measure of agreement, of co-operation, can we get in the present circumstances? What can be done to restore national economy?  If we save, he said, £5,000,000, what does it profit us if we lose our whole trade?  He was professing to be concerned about the present situation.  If he were concerned about the present situation surely his first duty would be to make the people realise the magnitude of this issue and not attempt to belittle it in the way in which he did; make them realise that it is not one mere payment of £5,000,000, but the payment of £5,000,000 for at least twelve and a half years and, after that twelve and a half years, the continuance of a further payment of £3,000,000 for another thirty-three years.  That is what hangs on it.  A payment of £5,000,000 in a period during which agricultural prices will tend to fall lower and lower.  A payment of £5,000,000, the real burden of which upon our people will tend to mount for the life-time of a generation. That is the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The toal product of our trade with Great Britain, measured in terms of real profit, is the difference between what it costs us to produce and the price which we receive.  It could not, at any time, be more than £7,500,000. And he is asking us willingly to forego our right to retain in this country a sum which at least is two-thirds of the total profit which we derive from our trade.  Putting it in <Col N="1013" /> another way, if our trade with Great Britain were to increase by 60 per cent. of what it was in 1931-32, he is asking us to refrain from increasing that trade.  If Deputy Cosgrave had been really sincere in his offer for co-operation I, for one, would not reject it.  If he were prepared to do, even at this eleventh hour, what the leader of the Liberal Members who resigned from the National Government in Great Britain only a short time before did in regard to the issues which they have raised with the United States of America &mdash; if he is willing to come along and say that the Cumann na nGaedheal Opposition is at last ready to take its place behind the Government which is fighting to retain these land annuities and will give to that Government all the support that it can command, I would say that that overture on the part of Deputy Cosgrave would be very gladly and very warmly welcomed by us.  But that is not what is offered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blythe said: &ldquo;Let you do anything, only let this thing be ended by your side-stepping the issue.&rdquo;&ldquo;Let you do something,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which might meet with acceptance in the eyes of the President.&rdquo;  Well, the President stands to-day as he stood in 1921 and 1922 in the eyes of Europe and of the world as an unflinching, clear-eyed statesman, without recourse to any subterfuge, who would be guilty of no trick and who will do everything to uphold the honour and secure the interests of this people.  And if there is to be a settlement with Great Britain, it will not be the sort of settlement that the Irish people have been subjected to for the past ten years.  There will not be a public pronouncement and a secret document. It will not consist of a public pronouncement detailing to the Irish people the alleged advantages which they have secured from that settlement and a secret document which would deprive them of those alleged advantages.  Whatever we do will be done in the open and whatever we say in regard to any settlement which will be made will be the whole truth and there will be nothing concealed and nothing secret about it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1014" /> Deputy Blythe said that if negotiations were to be opened all the indications are that fair terms will be got.  I have never concealed in this House that I am personally very anxious that there should be an end of this quarrel.  I know that every member of the Executive Council is in the same position in regard to it.  We have eagerly sought a settlement &mdash; an honourable and just settlement &mdash; of this dispute.  We have scanned the horizon for signs or indications that an honest settlement could be got.  I confess that I am disappointed.  I have not seen any signs or any symptoms of a change of heart on the other side of the Channel which would make us optimistic in that regard.  Deputy Blythe says that there are indications.  Have the indications been conveyed to him?  Where has he seen them?  What do they manifest? What do they show?  What idea do they give of the form which the settlement will take or the form in which it will be sought?  Either he was speaking in utter disregard of what his words meant or else he must have had something in his mind.  If he had anything in his mind in that regard, surely it was his duty to disclose what he knew to the House, if he did not feel that he was bound to disclose it to the Government.  Or was this just another trick, just an attempt once more to weaken the morale of the people, just another attempt to misrepresent the attitude which the Government have taken up, to try to represent us to the electors as a collection of unreasonable men and unthinking and stiff-necked individuals?  Either Deputy Blythe must have had some authority for the statements which he made or they must have been made once again in an attempt to becloud the issue and to weaken the confidence of the people in the present Government.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the campaign in progress in this country concerning British goods.  I should like to say that the one thing that appals me about a campaign of that kind is that people should waste their energies in the furtherance of a policy so negative and so bad.  If they really were strongly concerned to advance the general policy of the Government, they could have found an outlet for their energies in a <Col N="1015" /> much more helpful way.  There is no use in boycotting the goods of any country unless you are prepared to replace them with others.</P>
    <P>The best way to ensure that that replacing will take place is to develop, encourage and support our own manufactures. As much can be got and as much can be done in furtherance of the policy of the Government by going into whatever shop may sell the commodities that you are concerned in keeping out and asking for those which are of native manufacture.  Deputy Blythe said that the Government had very wide and very far-reaching fiscal powers, which enabled it to deal with questions of this kind in the way which seemed, in its judgment, best.  Every aspect of our trade with great Britain has been examined.  We have seen fit to impose tariffs on certain articles of British origin and we have seen fit to allow others to come in without let or hindrance.  I think that those who are concerned in a campaign of this kind should give the Government credit for, at least, as much zeal and enthusiasm as they have.  Whatever issues have been raised between us and Great Britain, whatever domestic issues have been raised in regard to membership of this House, or the constitutional rights of this people, this Government has been neither weak nor yielding.  It has done everything that possibly could be done to discharge the mandate which was given it.  If it has not seen fit to do everything, which some people think might have been done in the economic sphere, it is because there were good, sound reasons why it should not be done.  Those people who want to widen the campaign are not a help to us, but a hindrance.  With regard to the pressure which has been brought to bear on individuals and traders, the Minister for Justice has already indicated that he will afford every protection necessary to traders who are subjected to unwarrantable interference in their business or who are threatened with violence.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Defence has deprived me of the commentary which I was going to make on Deputy Mulcahy's insinuation, that an order can be issued to the Army without the Minister for Defence being aware of it.  Possibly, it is the memory of his own past that inspired the Deputy to make that suggestion. Possibly, he was thinking of the time when he was Minister for Defence and when the real responsible head of the Army was not the Minister for Defence, but a camarilla consisting of the heads of the secret society which was being organised inside the Army with his consent, and not merely with his consent, but his actual assistance.  The present Minister for Defence knows what is being done in regard to the Army and is prepared to answer to the House for the Army and he says that no order of the type referred to by Deputy Mulcahy has been issued. <Col N="1018" /> There were one or two other things I should like to have said.

We had taken time by the forelock and the Bill that has gone through the House this evening, giving effect to the new tillage policy of the <Col N="1019" /> Government, will be in active operation next spring.  Next year, therefore, there will be a decrease in the import of wheat into this country, a decrease in the import of foreign flour, a decrease in the import of foreign-made boots and clothing, an increase in our employed population, and an expanding Irish market for the products of Irish farmers.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance has been very kind to allow us three minutes to reply.  He might at least, in a short debate like this, have spared us the wastage of time which we have had.  He told us that this is the gravest crisis since 1690. So it is.  He has spoken of the terms of the British Note to the United States and the lack of assistance to the Government Party by the Opposition in their dealings with Great Britain.  If the Minister would use some of the leisure that is going to be his now to study the British Note he would see how an approach to a country with which another country has a difference might be made.  He would see that the advice given to his Party by Cumann na nGaedheal in April last was good sound advice that might very well be followed by a Government, no matter how proud or how national it was.  He would see that in one part of the Note a distinction is made between a commercial debt and a war debt; that a commercial debt is one where persons having received money are not only able to pay back the capital and <Col N="1020" /> interest but improve their own position at the same time, and that a war debt is one which goes up in smoke.  The present Government have taken the land of Ireland, in respect of which the farmers had entered into a commercial debt, and in order to save their own faces have turned that commercial debt into a war debt.  For their own purpose they have turned Irish fields into what the guns turned the fields of Flanders.</P>

      <P>They have destroyed an industry that was increasing, that was giving improved conditions of living to our Irish farmers. They have done as much harm as the explosives that were taken to France to blow up French towns and French fields.  They have done that, as I say, in order that they may turn what was a commercial debt, bringing with it all the developments that a soundly invested commercial debt would bring, into a war debt.  If the Government will review what they are doing in respect of the debt and in respect of their relations with Great Britain, in so far as they react on our people here, and if they will study the line of approach that the British are making in their Notes to the United States, they may, even at this late hour, remodel the line of approach they are making to the British, and bring the difference between themselves and the British to a speedy conclusion, a conclusion which is absolutely necessary if the economic future of this country is to be saved.</P>
