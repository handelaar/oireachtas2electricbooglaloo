      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will say if he has any information regarding the statement published to-day on behalf of Messrs.  Gallaher to the effect that in consequence of unfair discrimination against that firm in the present Budget proposals it will be compelled to close down forthwith the recently established factory at East Wall, Dublin, which at present provides employment for 300 persons, and whether he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I have seen the statement <Col N="530" /> published on behalf of Messrs. Gallaher (Dublin), Ltd., referred to in the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>The financial position of the State necessitated an increase in the tobacco duty in the recent year.  When considering the possible consequences of such increase the Government had to take into account the position of Saorstát firms engaged in the tobacco industry, many of which were working under considerable difficulties.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, a number of Saorstát firms in this industry have gone out of business during the past nine years.  The Government, consequently, decided to give a concession in respect of this duty to Saorstát owned firms established prior to 1922.</P>
      <P>In arriving at this decision the Government had advertence to the fact that the firms operating factories both in the Saorstát and in the United Kingdom were, and have been for some time past, paying duty at a higher rate in the United Kingdom than it is now proposed to levy here.</P>
      <P>The announcement of the decision of Messrs. Gallaher to close their Dublin factory is deeply regretted by the Government because of the unemployment which may result amongst the workers engaged by the firm.  The Government has under consideration the extent to which it is possible to make special provision for the employees concerned who are citizens of An Saorstát by securing for them a preference in employment in other industries which are being established as a result of the Government's industrial policy.</P>

As regards all firms competing in the Saorstát, are they not entitled to equal rights?  It is a commercial transaction.</P>

      <P>I would like to press my inquiry for this reason: If the impression goes out that Messrs.

      <Col N="533" /> Debate resumed on Resolution No. 7, Item No. 21.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, the expression used by the Minister for Industry and Commerce yesterday puts a cloud of mystery about this tariff.  He stated last night, with great emphasis, during which he thumped the table, that there was great evidence of dumping in this industry, and that he was prepared to prevent it.  He said that 25,000 tons were dumped during the first three months of this year.  The Minister also stated, after Deputy Corry confirmed the figure, that 32,000 tons was the normal import for 1930.  The Minister did not give the figures for 1931, and did not mention, when dealing with 1930, the months during which these phosphates arrived.  What is the mystery about this?  When the Minister was asked about this tariff in the first instance, he did not know whether North Africa was inside or outside the Empire.  When the matter was brought to his attention he said that these phosphates were tariffed.  The Minister put a tariff on an important item for agricultural purposes without knowing anything about the matter.  Evidently the Minister does not know anything about it, but Deputy Corry seems to know, judging by the way he was briefing the Minister yesterday.</P>
      <P>Everyone who knows anything about this question knows that shipments of these phosphates come here during the winter months only, as they are applied only in the late winter and in the spring.  That is the only season during which phosphates come here.  These phosphates are largely consigned to co-operative societies.  The firms that import them have no stores.  The stuff is put on the quays at Dublin, Limerick and Waterford and some other ports of call.  I know that cargoes arrive at Limerick and Waterford, because I have taken stuff from the quays there. The consignments are bought by cooperative societies on behalf of their members.  The Minister thought it exceptional when 25,000 tons came in three months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not unusual. Everyone knows that consignments do not arrive until the users are prepared to take them away.  The other phosphates come from Belgium.  We had the spectacle yesterday of Deputy Corry visiting the benches on this side, asking Deputies to put up a case against this tariff, and telling one Deputy that he was going to support him.  As soon as the case was made, Deputy Corry made a violent statement in favour of the tariff.  What is the mystery?  There is a mystery, and Deputies who were here yesterday must recognise that, whatever the mystery, Deputy Corry is the missing link.  This is one of the most unjust impositions ever placed on the agricultural community.  We had the Minister's figures that 200,000 tons of phosphates are used every year.  The highest figure he can give is 32,000 tons to prove that Irish firms have outside competition.  What is the comparison between 32,000 and 200,000 tons?  Nobody in business would make the case that there is a comparison. There is only competition to keep prices at a reasonable business level.</P>
      <P>The proposition here is to take away that competition from the manure ring. Everyone knows there is a manure ring, that it is highly organised, and that the whole idea is to take away the small competition of 32,000 tons, and the 25,000 tons during the late winter and early spring months.  I suggest to the Minister that he has not gone into the case at all, and that he has been briefed by someone else. When he was asked about the matter recently he knew nothing about it.  All the indications point to that.  I would be sorry to think that the Minister had put on the tariff on his own initiative, knowing as little as he seems to know about the matter.  I feel very keenly about this.  I think it is a most unjust and a most disgraceful tariff, and that it seems to have all the marks of jobbery about it of which the Minister seems to know nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What amazes me is the confidence of the Minister in his own Party discipline.  How he hopes or ever hoped to get a tariff of this kind <Col N="535" /> through Dáil Eireann is a source of astonishment to me.  If there was one blot on this Budget it is Financial Resolution Number 7, and, if there could be a blot upon a blot, it is the 21st item in the Schedule.  Deputy Gorey is an emphatic and an effective speaker, but I do not think it helps our case to suggest that the Government would apply a tariff to super-phosphates without adverting to any of the relevant circumstances, and if they did advert to these they knew nothing about the matter.  That is manifestly untrue.  I believe that in facing the problem of artificial manures the special position of superphosphates of lime had to be recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may have been represented to them by Irish and English manufacturers that they were prepared to meet world competion and world prices in the matter of compound manures, and that superphosphates rambled in under the general heading of compound manures.  Now there is all the difference in the world between the composition of superphosphates of lime and the composition of compound manures.  Most of the Irish and English factories have done the compound manure business, quality for quality, pretty well, but it is the experience of everyone&mdash;farmer, cooperative society and manure factor&mdash; that unless you have the competition of Continental superphosphates on the market the price of superphosphates will go up in this country by £1 a ton. The day that you stop the introduction of the competition of Continental superphosphates of lime on the Irish market, on that day the price of super-phosphate of lime will increase by £1 a ton.  Every farmer on the Fianna Fáil Benches knows that.  I am reluctant to quote my personal experience in a debate of this kind, but year after year I myself used the Continental prices for the purpose of securing reductions of from 5/- to 15/- on the prices tendered by Irish and English manufacturers.  If the Minister will look into that&mdash;there cannot be the slightest doubt about it in the mind of anyone closely associated with this trade&mdash;he will discover that year after <Col N="536" /> year the English and the Irish producers bring down their prices from the original quotations the moment the Continental quotation comes on the market.</P>
    <P>As to abnormal importations, I do not think that matters very much.  I do not know if this was one of the emergency tariffs that was put on, but, of course, the Minister must be aware that superphosphate of lime and these compound manures are only imported into this country during three months of the year practically.  There may be a little imported in December, but the vast bulk comes in in January, February and March.  The Minister must also be aware that superphosphate of lime is largely the basis of most of the compound manures.  I will not press the case of Peruvian guano, but I think that it might have been taken into consideration. To my mind the vital thing in this question of superphosphates is &mdash;I want to assure the Minister that if he makes a further examination he will find this to be so&mdash;that the imposition of this 20 per cent. tariff on superphosphates of lime means that he is going to increase the price of superphosphates to every farmer in the country by from 12/6 to £1 a ton.</P>
    <P>Now, I descibed the tariff on maize as a tariff based on the principle of insanity.  I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that to compel the farmers of this country to pay practically £1 per ton more for superphosphates, with the land of this country in the condition that it is in&mdash;the Minister for Agriculture said it is starved for phosphates&mdash;is absolutely suicidal, because the result of it will be that they will not pay, and you will find large areas of the country where people who used to put out four or six cwt. of superphosphate of lime reducing the four to three and the six to four.  The result of that will be grave injury to the quality of the soil of the country and a grave diminution in the output of the soil.  If the Minister ever walked a meadow which had been effectively treated with superphosphates and a meadow which had not received an adequate dressing, he would see the loss that would accrue in one year to this country from an inadequate use <Col N="537" /> of phosphates.  By this tax he is creating a situation in which that may occur all over the country.  Why he should do that, the result of which will mean an enormous additional loss, passes my comprehension.</P>
    <P>How the Executive Council can possibly stand over this tax I do not understand.  The important thing to remember is that the imperial preference, so far as superphosphate of lime is concerned, does absolutely no good. It is the Continental product that keeps the price down to an economic level, and if you remove the Continental product from the market then it is absolutely certain that you are putting from 10/- to £1 per ton on superphosphates in the coming season.  If you do that you will inflict an injury on this country the effects of which will be very serious indeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>If it was the design, aim and object of the Executive Council to injure the small farmers of the country, and certainly in the West of Ireland, I could hardly imagine any tariff which they could put on which would be more calculated to carry out that design than the tariff we are now discussing.  You must bear in mind that super-phosphates&mdash;to deal only with phosphates &mdash;is the manure which is most largely used in agriculture.  In many parts of the country super-phosphate is the only manure used in meadows.  It is more necessary than any other manure for all classes of farm crops.  Now agriculture is going through a very bad time, and in no part of the country are people suffering more, owing to the agricultural depression, than the smallholders in the West of Ireland. You are, so to speak, putting a tax upon one of the most necessary raw materials for farming.  This tax on super-phosphates must have the effect of raising the price of them. The manure trade is almost entirely a cash trade.  Certainly, in the West of Ireland if a farmer is going to use manure, as he ought to, he has either got to pay a very heavy rate of interest if he defers his payment for it, or he has to pay, as the majority of them wisely do, cash down.  But in present conditions ready money is extremely <Col N="538" /> scarce in the West of Ireland. The fall in the price of cattle and pigs and of farm produce, of every single thing that the small farmer has got to sell has now left him extremely short of ready money.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Dillon has pointed out, this is not a tax which will have any immediate effects, but it will have effect next Spring when the manures required are being bought.  Judging from everything that we see, the outlook for the small farmer at the moment is very gloomy.  If he is going to find the price of super-phosphates put up it will mean that he will have to go in for less intensive cultivation than he is doing at the present time.  My view of Irish farming and of small holders is this, that they ought to be encouraged more and more to go in for intensive farming, and to put out more artificial manures than they are putting out at the moment. In my view, the land ought to be made to yield more by an increase in the quantity of manures used, by getting supplies of better seeds and other things of that kind.  In other words, the land wants more capital put into it.  But instead of encouraging the ordinary tenant farmer and the ordinary small holder to put more money into his farm, as he ought to be encouraged, you are by this tax driving up the prices of most important manures.  That will prevent him in the future from putting in the amount of manure which he is putting into the cultivation of his land at the present moment.  That is bad for the individual and bad for the farming economy of the small holder everywhere in Ireland.  I would like to ask the Minister, passing away from super-phosphates, why is there this tax on ground mineral phosphate.  Why is that imposed?  I take it that it is imposed on ground Tunisian rock which comes in here and which forms the basis of semsol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister what is the object of this tax on ground mineral phosphates.  These phosphates come in in the raw state and are put in in the raw state undressed. Manures made up in those phosphates are not the best for grass, I grant you.  They came in during the <Col N="539" /> war, they are a second grade manure, a cheap manure, and they are a very valuable manure for second class pasture. There seems to be a tendency to think that manures are only used upon meadow land and not for tillage purposes, but everybody who has got rough pasture knows that it pays extremely well to top dress, and basic slag or semsol makes a cheap class of manure.  I would like to know what is the object of putting tax upon ground mineral phosphates and I would like to have some explanation of that.  In my opinion the crying need for the small holders in Ireland now is to get the things necessary for him if he is going to farm his land at all correctly and to get these things as cheap as possible and nothing should be done to make them dear.  Agriculture, as I said, is going through a very bad phase at the present minute and to put this largely unnecessary burden upon the small farmer appears to me to be most unfair to them and appears to be a tariff that will have repercussions upon our agricultural methods in the future.  It will have a very bad effect upon our agricultural methods in my opinion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask a question or two in connection with this matter.  As a non-agriculturist I was very much interested in the very informative speeches of Deputy Dillon and Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney. Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney suggested that it is intended to impose a tariff on ground mineral phosphates and he said that that commodity entered very largely into the manufacture of semsol?  Is that so?  I am aware that semsol is manufactured in large quantities by a big firm of fertilisers in Cork City who give a very large amount of employment there.  I ask those who know something about agriculture this question.  If there is a tariff placed on ground mineral phosphates how will that affect such a factory as Goulding's?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to get at, as a non-agriculturist, and I listened <Col N="540" /> with great attention to the speeches of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and Deputy Dillon, is: If this ground phosphate which forms a component part of semsol, which is manufactured to a large extent by Goulding's, is to be tariffed will that in any way handicap the industry in Cork City, for if so I shall vote against this Resolution?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said yesterday that the imports of phosphates last year were somewhat abnormal.  So that the Dáil may be in a position to judge of the extent to which they were normal, I would ask the Minister to give the figures relating to the imports of superphosphates for the last two or three years.  The Minister will realise that superphosphate is used much more extensively now than some years ago. The use of it is increasing, has increased year by year because the farmers have come to realise that superphosphate is a necessary manure for their purposes, and for that reason they have been using increasing quantities of it year by year.  There may be some relation, and there probably is, between the abnormal imports of last year and the increased use of phosphate by farmers in this country.  If the Minister had consulted his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, he would have discovered that the inspectors of the Department of Agriculture have been recommending farmers for years past to use phosphates much more extensively, and it is, as a result, to a certain extent at least of the propaganda of the officials of the Department that phosphate is to-day used so extensively by farmers throughout the country.  Every one of those inspectors has encouraged, and, as a matter of fact, facilitated, farmers to secure supplies of these phosphates.  The Minister for Agriculture could also have informed him that owing to the decrease in the number of dairy cattle in this country there is naturally a decreased supply of farmyard manure available for manurial purposes.  Hence it is <Col N="541" /> that the use of artificial manure has increased, and increased enormously, as the Minister will find out if he inquires, by farmers for years past.  It will, as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney pointed out, seriously handicap farming operations in this country if the Minister insists upon imposing this tax.  We have been told for many years past in debates in this House that the land of this country is going out of heart.  For one reason, on account of the wet seasons, and for certain other reasons the land of the country is decreasing in quality.  It is necessary, therefore, that manures of all kinds should be made available to the farmer. This tax will undoubtedly, as Deputy Dillon pointed out, lead inevitably to an increase in price.  It is inevitable that manufacturers in this country will put up the price.  The one factor that kept down the price in the past was competition from outside.  If that factor is removed it is inevitable that the manufacturers in this country will put up the price.  If artificial manures are to be kept down to a reasonable price, if the Minister is anxious to make it possible to keep down the price of artificial manures to a normal level, he should allow competition from outside, even if it was limited competition, because it is the only factor that can keep down the price of artificial manures to a normal level in this country.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider the question of the imposition of this tax, because there is no doubt whatever that it will inevitably force up the price of manures, and by forcing up the price of manures you are limiting the possiblity of the farmer being able to secure the artificial manure necessary for the improvement of his grass lands.  Not only is super-phosphate used, as the Minister probably does not know, for grass lands, but it is also used as a mixture for growing potatoes and root crops generally. I would impress upon the Minister the importance of reviewing the imposition of this tax, and of giving the farmers an opportunity of carrying on their operations on the same scale as heretofore.</P>

      <P>I think, as <Col N="542" /> well as I can remember, in the confusion of the Minister for Finance being anxious to bring matters yesterday to a close, that the Minister did state that one of his principal reasons, in fact, his principal reason, for introducing this tariff was that as a result of the imposition of the tariff in England, a lot of the continental phosphates were diverted to this country, and that, I think, in the opening months of this year&mdash;or was it the first four months?&mdash;there had been an increase of some 25 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>That during the first three months of this year there has been an increase of 25 per cent. It has been pointed out again and again from these benches and, in fact, from every quarter of the House, except the unpaid Parliamentary Secretary to the Executive Council, who has spoken strongly in favour of this tax, that, after the month of May, there is practically no importation of superphosphates into this country, and that, in fact, in certain months there is no importation at all, judging by the returns we have here before us.  For instance, in 1931, in the month of June there were only 700 tons; in July, 41 tons; none in August or September; one ton in October; 26 tons in November, and then it goes up again to 800 tons in December.  That fully bears out what was said from all over the House.  Therefore, do not speak of 25 per cent., but speak of the aggregate number of tons extra that were introduced.  And then we are told that the aggregate increase of about, say, 8,000 tons&mdash;I should say that would be the very most&mdash;say, a 25 per cent. increase, would endanger the employment of 1,000 people working in this industry in this country.  The Minister also, I think, said that there was an abnormal increase over last year; but if we take the figure for the year 1931, as given in the trade returns, and compare it with the previous year, it will be found that in the year 1931 there was practically a falling-off of precisely that 25 per cent. from the previous year.</P>

      <P>I am taking the total year, and it has been pointed out that most of the importations come in in the first three months.  There were, in the year 1930, 42,000 tons, and in 1931, there were 32,000 tons.  Therefore, there was practically a diminution in 1931 of 20 per cent. to 25 per cent., precisely what it has gone up this year, and he has not proved that they were abnormal, even if there was a 25 per cent. increase.  It is absurd to suggest that because there is an increase of 8,000 tons, the whole business of 140,000 tons is in danger.  We have heard from everybody interested in the trade, and in farming, here, that this is calculated to do a great deal of damage, and I suggest that the Minister has not made out the slightest case for it, even from the point of view of the statistics his own Department has published, but, of course, he will give us an assurance that this will do no damage to farming.  None of the tariffs are going to damage anything. In fact, we were told last night, and, I think, even the simple heart and trusting mind of Deputy Dillon got a shock, that, as a result of the tax on maize meal, its price had fallen in this country, and not as a result of world prices.</P>

      <P>I put the Minister a question: Was the decrease in price due to the tariff?  And he answered &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I think, in the hearing of the whole House.  In other words, he has left out of account altogether, <Col N="544" /> as he usually will do in these cases, the fact that were it not for the tariff, world prices would have brought the price of maize down still further even than at present.  Dealing with a simplicity of mind of that kind I suggest that an assurance that this will not damage agriculture is absurd when we have had from most of the farming Deputies, except Deputy Corry, whose official attitude certainly seems to be against our argument and in favour of the tariff, and from people interested in farming, from whatever Party, whether Independent or those who had a knowledge of dealing with the material itself in the way of selling to the farmers, an assurance that this will mean an increase in price to the farmers of this most important commodity. Of course, if Deputy Dillon thinks that that will have the slightest effect on the optimism of the Minister, I do not know what he is doing in this House, or what he is learning in this House, so far as the attitude of the Government is concerned.</P>

      <P>I wish to intervene in order to put some Deputies right, because, apparently their ignorance of this is only equalled by their ignorance of a number of other subjects.  Four out of five farmers in this country last year, and in every year, used the product of the Irish factories.  That is one fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And when we are told about the adverse effect on the farmers, the possibility of their using a smaller quantity of fertilisers and the like, keep that fact in mind.  Four out of five farmers use the products of the Irish factories.  We are not making it impossible for any farmer to get all the quantity he wants of these products.  There is an adequate supply available in the country, and even if the supply in the country runs short, there is no duty on products imported from Great Britain, or any other country in the British Commonwealth. So far as competition is concerned, the suggestion which Deputy Roddy made has been adopted.  We have allowed a considerable measure of competition still to prevail, and those engaged in <Col N="545" /> this industry in this country have no objection to meeting competition from any country in which the standard of living and the working conditions in the industry are, in any way, similar to ours.</P>

That takes into account 10/- for freight and 10/- in consequence of the depreciation of our currency. These superphosphates are being produced at about 30/- a ton.  It is not possible to produce them in this country at that price.  Will Deputies say that we should get the benefits of the cheap superphosphates and let the Irish products disappear?  Will the farmer be better off?  He may be better off for a few months of this year but I think in the long run he is going to be the victim of the consequence of the disappearance of the Irish industry. There are several facts which Deputies appear to be forgetting altogether. First of all, a great number <Col N="546" /> of fertilisers are not subject to duty at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Basic slag, guano, sulphate of ammonia and a number of other fertilisers in very common use, are not subject to duty.  A number of these fertilisers, particularly sulphate of ammonia, is subject to duty on entering Great Britain.  The imports of sulphate of ammonia into this country this year increased by over 300 per cent.  We have not imposed a duty on that particular commodity because the factories here are not in a position to supply our requirements and for other reasons.  The fact is that our farmers, because of the fact that we have not imposed a duty, are in a position to get their supplies at a much lower price than the farmers can get them at in Great Britain.  The home factories, as I have said, are at the moment and always have been supplying 75 per cent. of our requirements.  Get that fact quite clear because all this talk about hardship being imposed on the farmer is futile nonsense.  The fact is, so far as four out of five farmers are concerned, that no hardship is being imposed upon them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  If the increase in the rate is due to profiteering then undoubtedly they will be penalised and then undoubtedly we will take action, but if the increase in price is due to the increase in price of raw materials it would be justifiable and there would be no question of penalisation. In so far as their chief competitors in the British market are concerned, they are in a more favourable position here.  The British imposed a <Col N="547" /> duty and because of that duty there was an increase in the importation of these superphosphates and compound manures into this country.  There was an increase of 30 per cent. in March of this year as compared with March of last year.  Deputies on the opposite benches are wondering why we do not take the usual course adopted and allow an industry to disappear first before taking steps to protect it.</P>

      <P>Last year Britain imposed a duty upon these things coming into England and last year intense competition from the Continent developed. There has been an increase in the first three months, I will admit, of 25 per cent.  The imports of super-phosphates have increased 300 per cent. and the imports of sulphate of ammonia also increased.  We are not subjecting sulphate of ammonia to any duty.  The agricultural industry is being placed under no hardship whatsoever and the livelihood of a thousand people is being preserved.  We can, if the Deputies wish, deliberately decide that it is better for us to be in a position in which we can buy these compound manures and fertilisers in <Col N="548" /> the cheapest market in the world and allow another industry to disappear. Do the farmers want that?  That is the inevitable consequence of the removal of these duties.  You cannot produce these things at 30/- a ton.</P>

Is that what the Deputies want, that the thousand men engaged in this industry be deprived of their employment and the factories engaged in the production of these things be closed down? If that were done and if the workers were maintained by the farmers out of the home assistance fund, then we would have very severe criticism from the Deputies opposite for not taking action in time to preserve the industry. So far as the farmers are concerned, their position is not being worsened in respect of 25 per cent of their requirements. For these things they have only got to come to the Irish factories instead of to the importers of the continental stuff.  In respect of a great range of artificial manures of one kind or another, there is no duty. In respect of the articles which we have brought subject to the duty the greater requirements of the country will be and always have been supplied by our own factories and we want that position to continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister consult any of the three out of five or four out of five farmers?  Did he even <Col N="549" /> consult the representative of the Minister for Agriculture who is here to-day, Deputy Corry?  Because in the absence of the Minister for Agriculture he seems to hold the agricultural brief for the Minister.  Did the Minister consult Deputy Corry before the introduction of this Resolution? Deputy Corry has been in fear and trembling lest somebody might not get up to oppose this tariff.  It seems to-day as if Deputy Corry has transferred his allegiance from the farmers to the manufacturers.  Evidently he has.  The Minister has spoken of four out of five farmers.  He appears to be wrong in his figures because according to the figures he gave me it would work out at 3½ out of 5.  Are the four out of five farmers or the three and a half out of five who use this product satisfied with the Minister's explanation?  Are not they well aware that the importation of one-third&mdash; the Minister said one-fourth&mdash;of these commodities has the effect of keeping down the price of the home commodity? The Minister attacks us when we talk about keeping down prices.  I do not care one whit.  Speaking as a representative of the farmer, if the manufacturers cannot increase their production it must be done at the expense of the farmer.  Here we have an industry producing, as the Minister says, 140,000 out of a possible 200,000 tons.  They are competing with English and foreign manufacturers and they have expanded their trade so that, as the Minister himself said, they have command of four-fifths of the total.  It is, I think, a little less but the home manufacturers have command of a great proportion of the trade.  Are we, the farmers of this country, to stand for a proposition which takes away the only possible competition with these merchants and put them in a position to charge anything they like, as they will charge, notwithstanding the legislation which the Minister is to introduce?  Deputy Corry, the Assistant Minister for Agriculture, knows as well as I do that that will be the effect.  Deputy Corry, who has apparently changed his allegiance from the farmers to the manufacturers, knows as well as I do that if there was necessity for stopping <Col N="550" /> the importation of foreign manures, now, above all times, is a most inappropriate time for such legislation.  As Deputy Corry knows, the farmer is now absolutely unable to meet the costs which are pressing upon him.  Deputy Dillon said, rightly, that the price of these manures will possibly go up one shilling per cwt.  Probably it will.  But even if the price only went up one penny per cwt. as a result of this tariff, or 1/8d. a ton, it would be a burden on the farmers greater than the Minister for Industry and Commerce or Deputy Corry can estimate. Deputy Corry knows, if the Minister for Industry and Commerce does not, that many small holders have been able to increase the stock-carrying power of their farms by almost 100 per cent. by the constant application of these manures.  Does the Minister, or does Deputy Corry, mean to tell us that even a small addition to the ordinary price of these manures will not be a considerable hardship on the farmers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a remarkable silence on the part of the Farmer Deputies on the Government Benches.  Deputy Corry alone stepped in where others feared to tread, having changed his allegiance. I defy any farmer Deputy to get up and make any sort of case, good or bad, for the Minister's proposition, or to go back to his constituents and defend the Minister's proposition.  The Minister suggested last day that there would be a thousand extra men put into employment. He has corrected that.  He said he was trying to preserve in employment the thousand men there at present.  Even if we increase the business by one-third, we are not going to have a great many extra men put into employment.  And it will be all at the expense of the farmer.  Practically every farmer uses, at one time or another, some of the manures specified in this tariff.  If allowed to stand, this tariff will be a handicap on farmers, small and large, greater than the Minister or Deputy Corry can estimate, and greater than any of us, without figures as we are at the moment, can estimate.  Even if the increase in price be only 1d. per cwt., which is the lowest <Col N="551" /> computation that can be made, the handicap will be very considerable.  Is Deputy Corry prepared to go down to Cork and tell the small farmers engaged in tillage or in grazing and helping out the worn-out soil with some of these manures, that he is supporting this tariff because a certain manufacturer in Cork, without this tariff, would not be able to make the profits that, possibly, he made a few years ago? That will be the explanation that Deputy Corry will have to give when he goes down to Cork&mdash;not that certain manufacturers are in danger of going out of business, because they are not. Any manufacturers who are in the position of supplying three-fourths of the needs of this country against foreign and Commonwealth competition cannot say that they are in grave danger of being forced out of business.  There is not an iota of justification for this tariff.  The Minister cannot have taken ordinary care in considering it.  He cannot have taken steps to consult any of the people whom it would affect, except the people on the manufacturing side.  I notice that the Minister for Agriculture is now beside the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Minister for Agriculture knows, if nobody else on the Government Bench knows, the effect that this tariff will have on the agricultural community.  My appeal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce having failed, I appeal to the Minister for Agriculture to use his influence with his Government to stop this imposition on an already overburdened section of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to follow the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he intends it to be a serious contribution to this debate instead of a piece of flamboyant rhetoric.  He says that 75 per cent. of the manures used in this country is made in Irish factories.  What on earth has that to do with this issue?  If 100 per cent. of the manures used by Irish farmers was made in Irish factories it would not influence the matter.  The majority of farmers use Irish-manufactured manures.  I myself use a considerable amount of artificial manure&mdash; all Irish manufacture.  I am chairman <Col N="552" /> of a co-operative society which sells a large quantity of manure&mdash;all Irish. But we do not want to see the price of any manure go up considerably, to the detriment of the farmers.  Under this proposed tax the price must go up.  What I would rather expect with the fall in the price of cattle and in the price of all world commodities would be that next year we would have a very considerable fall in the price of manures.  I think the price of manures should follow the world tendency, and that it should not be kept up artificially by tariffs to the detriment of the farmer.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is full of woe when he thinks of super-phosphates being put on the Irish market at £2 10s. 0d. per ton.  He did not tell us what grade of superphosphate he referred to.  So far as I can gather, the Minister considers superphosphates as one whole.  He is not aware that there are different grades of superphosphates at different prices.  Even XXX superphosphate at £2 10s. 0d. per ton, if it could be got&mdash;and I do not see why it should not, with the present fall in world prices&mdash;next spring, would be helpful, indeed, to the Irish farmer.  I do not see in the least why it should destroy the Irish manure manufacturer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the Minister's case.  He says that the Irish manufaturers will have to go out of business.  They have 75 per cent. of the business now, and they will have to close down if a tax of this nature is not put on.  Either the sale of artificial manure in this country has been going down enormously or the output of the manure manufacturers has been increasing enormously.  It must be one or the other.  In the year 1930 the importation of rock phosphates was 94,000 tons, and in 1931, 63,000.  Of basic slag in 1930 the importation was 38,000 tons; in 1931, 28,000.  In 1930 the importation of sulphate of ammonia was 21,000; in 1931, 18,000.  In 1930 the importation of superphosphate was 42,000; and in 1931, 31,000.  As to compound manures and other fertilisers, in 1930 the importation was 38,000; in 1931, 34,000. In every single one of these items there has been an enormous drop between <Col N="553" /> 1930 and 1931 in the quantity imported. What is the reason of that?  Is it that the price of manure has become so high that Irish farmers cannot use it, or is it that the manure manufacturers have captured the market?  I do not know which it is.  But whichever it is, it is an overwhelming argument against the imposition of this tariff at present that between 1930 and 1931 there should be this enormous drop in the importation of artificial manures.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce seems to think that sulphate of ammonia is a substitute for superphosphate, because he says that you are getting sulphate of ammonia in without any tax.  The Irish farmers can carry on practically as well, though not as efficiently as at present, if you stop the importation of sulphate of ammonia altogether, because there are substitutes for it, Sulphate of ammonia is purely a nitrogenous manure, and there are other nitrogenous manures which can take the place of sulphate of ammonia.  I do not think any farmer in the House will contradict that proposition.  As a matter of fact, sulphate of ammonia is not the most largely used of nitrogenous manures.  Though it is more suited for some purposes than the other nitrogenous manures, yet it can in fact be done without, but you cannot do without superphosphates if you are going to use manures at all, because the phosphates are more important than nitrogenous or potash manures.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister for Industry and Commerce talked about the gold standard.  What has the gold standard to do with it?  I cannot see.  It seems to me that the Minister was simply trying to beat the air.  The gold standard has nothing to do with the number of tons imported.  I have given the figures of the number of tons imported.  If the Irish farmer is going to be exploited, as seemingly he is going to be exploited, in aid of the manure manufacturers, then it is an extremely bad thing for the agriculture of this country, and it will ultimately be very bad for the manure trade here.  They may get a higher price per ton for the manure they sell, but the manure trade will lose on their <Col N="554" /> sales, because you will put it out of the power of the farmer to use necessary manures.  The farmer can do without a great deal of manures.  Take the manuring of grass land and pasture.  That is a very wise thing to do, and very often a paying thing, but it is not necessary.  All that will drop away.  If you are going to have a rise in the price of other phosphates, you will find that basic slag, which can be got at very much the same price, because it is not manufactured here, and therefore can be imported, will cut out the other phosphate manures for such purposes as basic slag can be used for, such as meadows and turnip growing.</P>

From 1927 onwards, while I was on the benches opposite, trying to help the farming community, I know the assistance we got from Deputies Bennett, Gorey, and the rest.  I challenge Deputies on the opposite benches to say that they ever did anything in the farmers' interests in the last five years.  I admit that the step was a very short one for some of them from the farmers' interests to the landlords' interests.  These Deputies, under the whip of Deputies Good and Thrift, trotted into the Lobby in support of every proposal brought into the Dáil to scourge the hide of the unfortunate farmers.  They voted against every Land Bill brought in in the farmers' interests.  It is all very well for those people to come along now and shout.</P>

      <P>The import of superphosphate for the first three months, January to March, of 1929, was 21,000 tons; from January to March, 1930, 22,000 tons; from January to March, 1931, 20,000.  That meant that the import was falling until it became 20,000 tons in 1931.  In 1932, from January to March, it went up to 25,500 tons, an increase of 5,500 tons.  We can examine the position, and we know where we were hit during the last four or five years.  We know what happened when we had, I am sure, 100,000 tons of foreign barley thrown into our market and how it affected the market here. We know what happened when the Russian oats were thrown in last year. We know what happened when the foreign butter was thrown in and the effect it had on the market.  The then Government had to protect it, even though they were too late.  We do not intend to wait until we have 1,000 men thrown on home assistance.  Deputy Dillon spoke of £1 per ton increase. Where did he get his figures?  I thought a gentleman like him would have some idea of figures.  Where did he get the figure of £1 per ton increase? This tariff will, roughly, amount to 12/- per ton.  The reduction in imports was from 44,000 tons in 1929 to 32,000 tons last year.  In other words, the Irish manufacturers were able to hold their own, and more than hold their own, in the market here.</P>

      <P>We have to face the position that this import of artificial manure has been driven out of the British market by a tariff and has then been dumped in here just as flour was being dumped in here from Britain. We have to protect our own manufacturers. The total amount of the tariff will be about £18,000, and I say if the Irish farmers have to pay £18,000 on manures coming in here, it is a small price for protecting our manufacturers. We have to bear our end of the stick, and I for one would rather bear it in a tariff than in home assistance of 8/- a week to support a man and his five or six children.  When we are accused by Deputies opposite of changing our allegiance we want to know how long ago it is since they changed their allegiance.  Where was the late leader of the Farmers' Party when he clapped down on the backs of my constituents £27,000 in the last ten years and walked into the Lobby in defence of his action?  I thought that Deputy O'Riordan, from Castletownroche, as the Deputy on one occasion styled himself, or Paddy O'Riordan, when he was caught with the hares, would know all about the manufactures in Cork.

The policy of Deputies opposite, as they absolutely proved while they were on these benches, has been to get our Indian meal and our flour ground by the foreigner, to give everything to the foreigner, and then expect our employers to come in and buy their produce.  If that is their idea it is not mine.  I would ask the late Minister for Education to consult his legal assessor, Deputy Gorey, on these matters.  He is brought down there for consultation.

      <P>I should like briefly to intervene in this discussion and I should wish the Minister to say whether it is for revenue purposes or for protection of the manufacturers of artificial manures that he is imposing this tariff.  Deputy Corry has stated very candidly and truthfully that the manufacturers of artificial manures are holding their own and more than holding their own.  In that I thoroughly agree. I think I am correct in stating that the firm of Goulding, Ltd., controls about seven-eights of the manure factories in this country.  If we look at the Stock Exchange and examine the prices of the shares of Goulding and Co., Ltd., and compare them with the prices of any other shares in the market, what shares do we find are best on the market?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDavis" hpid="Mr. Davis Mr. Davis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davis</NameTxt>
      <P>Gouldings.  They are holding their own and I am very glad to say that in the recent past, more particularly since the introduction of this tariff, they are holding their own still better and a scrutinising public are looking forward with confidence to see the firm of Goulding and Company making more money in future as a <Col N="558" /> result of this tariff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This tariff is imposed as one of the many blisters that the farmers of this country have got to endure.  Many blisters have already been applied.  On the one hand the position of the farmer is that everything he has to dispose of to-day is going down in price.  Anything that you can refer to to-day that the farmer has to put on the market has gone down in value practically 50 per cent. within the past six months. On the other hand, everything he has to purchase has gone up from 50 to 100 per cent.  I wonder, in such circumstances, how is he going to balance his budget as a result of these tariffs? I can visualise the position of the farmer in this country becoming a very unenviable one, and if now or in the past he has found it difficult to make ends meet these tariffs are going to make it not alone difficult to make ends meet but absolutely impossible.  We know what position he will find himself in if it goes beyond his reach to purchase artificial manure.  We are all aware that, as a result of the use of artificial manures by farmers in this country their position has been vastly improved.  If you deprive him of that by the imposition of tariffs of this kind at a time when everything he has to sell is going down in price and everything he has to buy is going up, he will be in a very bad way indeed.  I think it is one of the most cruel and harsh attempts to hit him severely and make his position absolutely impossible.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the matter with great care, because under ordinary circumstances it would be bad and very bad, but under the present conditions it makes his position impossible.  I speak from knowledge of the position of the manufacturers, as one who deals extensively in artificial manures and as a seller and upholder of Irish manufacture. Whenever I can purchase Irish manufacture&mdash;and that is at all times&mdash;I have purchased and sold nothing else, and sold even at a disadvantage rather than purchase the stuff which is dumped on our market because, to the credit of our manufacturers I must say that they can turn <Col N="559" /> out an article equal, if not superior, to any that I know.  I fully realise that artificial manure from Gouldings or anywhere else, is bought on its intrinsic value and that value is arrived at on the basis of its analysis. With regard to the analysis of superphosphate I have heard no one in this debate make any reference to it.  I wonder has the Minister for Industry and Commerce been advised by the Minister for Agriculture that it is on analysis that the farmers, or any one else who had a hand in the trade, calculate the price.  If we are to get away from that position where do we find ourselves?  If the farmer is to go in plainly to the merchant selling manure, one of the things which he is entitled to, if he is a man with any idea of business, is to demand from that merchant a receipt showing the analysis of the manure.  He is entitled to that by law established, and that he must be supplied with.  That is what guards the farmer against fraud and imposition.  Except for certain figures as to the prices of superphosphate we have not heard one word from the other side of the House as to the intrinsic value of that article based on its analysis.  I would like the Minister in his reply to this to tell us plainly&mdash;and I hope, and am confident, he will be candid on this point&mdash;is it for revenue purposes or for the protection of the manufacturer that he is putting on this tariff?  There is one thing that stands out and that is that it is going to inflict a grave injury on the farmers of this country.</P>
    <P>One thing we have witnessed, and with great pleasure, in years gone by, was that the efforts of the instructors under the Department of Agriculture were not fruitless.  They bore fruit in these respects, that they succeeded in dinning into the minds of the farmers of this country the advisability of purchasing and using artificial manures and the great advantages to be derived from their use.  If you look back over the past twenty years or so and compare the quantity then used with that at the present time, you will see the very great advance that has been made, and you will admit that that sound result is something to place to the <Col N="560" /> credit of the instructors of the Department of Agriculture.  I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider this position. Is this going to be an incentive to the farmer to use artificial manures? Is he going to work his farm to the best advantage if as a result of the tariffs he is going to be driven away from the use of artificial manures?  I suggest that if the Minister considered that aspect of the question he would not have committed himself to this policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke as if some Deputies had mentioned a 300 per cent. increase.  Of course, the use of sulphate of ammonia is practically independent of the superphosphate of lime.  He says there is no evidence that the ring operating in this country would advance the prices of superphosphates. If he has not seen that evidence, it has been deliberately withheld from him.  The evidence is in existence, and not only is there danger of it, but an attempt has been made every year for the past five years to do it, and on each occasion it was the arrival of Continental superphosphates on the market that broke the ring.  The ring held rigid until the arrival of the foreign phosphates.  If the Minister would investigate the facts he would see concrete proof of an attempt being made every year for the past five years to raise the price of artificial manures by about 15/- a ton.  On each occasion when the Continental stuff came on the market, and the Minister knows the Continental stuff comes in in boat loads, and when it comes in the price is quoted on the market instantly in every case, the Irish and English manufacturers have come down by from 12/- to 15/- a ton, and we are told that those people who are to fall out of business are going to make a profit at a price 15/- a ton less than they were asking.  The Minister spoke with some asperity and confusion of mind.  I have not the slightest desire to use any but the language of scrupulous courtesy in the discussion, but I do think that I know what the facts are. I know very well that certain interested parties may have withheld information, and all I ask him to do is to look into it, because I know it is there and that he will discover it.  I <Col N="561" /> am not so much concerned with compound manures, because to my mind the key to the whole situation is super-phosphates. We will be able to handle the manures by internal competition. In view of the fact that the manure business of this country is in the hands of Gouldings, and they are in a ring with a small group of manufacturers in England, we cannot break that ring except through the Continental producers. No trader in this country can do it.  You can give them the compound manures and let them have the advantage of mixing and sacking these compound manures here in Ireland, leaving the superphosphates out of account.</P>
      <P>If you leave the superphosphates and lime out of account, as Deputy Davis has said, the analysis is an absolute safeguard for the farmer.  If the analysis shows 35 or 37 per cent. that is good superphosphate and lime whether it comes from Belgium, England or anywhere else.  I assure the Minister that he need not apprehend any confusion of mind so far as I am concerned with regard to this matter. I believe the Minister for Agriculture will confirm what I say&mdash;that if superphosphate is left within the scope of this tariff there is a grave danger of an enormous reduction in the use of superphosphates all over the country and this will operate to the serious deterioration of the land of the country.  We are told that it will be 3d. or 6d. a cwt., but I believe it will be at least 9d. or 1/- per cwt. on the farmer.  The result will be that the people will not buy superphosphate to the large extent they have been buying it.  They will halve their requirements.  Buying the same quantity as they have been buying may mean only an entire loss of 5/- but human nature is human nature and they will save in the amount they want to buy and so reduce their requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry does not understand how it is that the tariff might work out at 1/- a cwt. when the tariff is less than that.  I will tell the House. If you knock a competitor out of trade, if the foreign competitors are kept out, the price will go up and unless the Continental importers put <Col N="562" /> their stuff on board in good time and make their arrangements in October or November for the disposal of their supplies in the spring you may take it that they are out of the market that season.  Gouldings and the other manure manufacturers here can say &ldquo;When we have the Continental fellows off the market we can jump the prices.&rdquo;  They will say nothing now, but in January when the price is quoted the people having made no arrangement with the Continental manufacturers of superphosphates it is quite possible that we will be informed that the cost of raw materials has increased, that the standard of living has risen and, taking everything into consideration they find it necessary to advance the price from £3 10s. to £4 per ton.  There will be a circular sent out to the farmer saying: &ldquo;Do not spare one shilling for it means the improvement of your land,&rdquo; and explaining that at the expense of a half a ton of superphosphates the yield of his stock will be 50 per cent of an increase and that for the sake of the cost it would be a very handsome return and that he should not for the sake of 1/- in the increase of the manure lessen his requirements.</P>
    <P>But the increase of 1/- per cwt. means in this country an increase of 33 and 1/3rd per cent.  I think the Government should pause before they venture to lay a burden of 33 and 1/3rd per cent. on superphosphate of lime.  The result of that will be that the farmers will put out less superphosphates next spring and the yield of the land may decrease by 20 per cent. because of that.  In saying that I do not at all exaggerate.</P>

      <P>A number of Deputies have asked, when comparing these prices, whether the analysis has been taken into account.  Of course, prices have been given on the assumption that the analysis is the same in each case.  The import of manures was down in 1931 and attention has been drawn to that by the Deputies on the opposite side.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney does not know whether it was due to the farmers using less manures or whether it was due to the fact that the Irish manufacturers were turning <Col N="563" /> out more manures last year.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and those with him who lead the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, I am sure, know very well that there were less manures last year because of the fact that there was less tillage in the country.

As a matter of fact, sulphate of ammonia was imported last year to the extent of 20,000 tons, and the other imports would not come to more than 5,000 or 6,000 tons, so that the point that the Deputy was making, that sulphate of ammonia would not come to much, that we were not using much of it, and that it would not be much of a burden on the farmers, is valueless.  We were accused by others of giving to the farmers more than the other consumers could afford to give them under the Butter Bill.  We were told last year by the then Government that we could not afford to give the farmers another £250,000 in relief of the rates.</P>

      <P>&mdash;to help the people who are working in this industry, we are accused of putting an intolerable burden on the farmers.  The consumption of these manures is something less than 200,000 tons a year.  Deputy Gorey says that the extra cost on the farmer is going to come to between £250,000 and £300,000 a year.  Deputy Bennett says it is going to come to possibly only 1d. per cwt.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon says it will be £1 per ton.  I would like if Deputy <Col N="565" /> Dillon would tell us how he can explain the basis on which he makes out that calculation that it might come to £1 a ton when the tariff is only 20 per cent.  I know he gave his reasons for that statement that if we were only going to put on a tariff of 20 per cent. and that if the Irish manufacturers were going to put up their prices only to the extent of 20 per cent. that it would not amount to more than 6s. per ton at the outside over the continental prices, but Deputy Dillon has explained that having put the continental people out of the market, then the Irish manufacturers having got the market to themselves might put up the price to £1 per ton, and the continental people could not come along then because it would be too late to make the necessary arrangements for shipping. I find it very difficult to agree with Deputy Dillon that if, say, next January it was found that the Irish manufacturers were charging too much for manures and they were going to put up their prices because the continental manures would be out of the market, that the continental manufacturers would then find it impossible to send in manures.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce stated here yesterday that there was what amounted to dumping during the first three months of this year.  Whether we call it dumping or not, there was, at any rate, an increase in the imports of artificial manure for the first three months of this year as compared with last year. As a result our manure factories have closed down earlier this year than in previous years.  They found it necessary to put the majority of their men out of employment.  These factories employ 1,000 men.  If that state of affairs continues this year, next year, and the year after what is going to become of our manure factories?  They are going to go the way that the flour factories went under the last Government. I would like to ask Deputies opposite the question that Deputy Moore asked them last night: have they any guarantee, if our factories are closed, that a British ring or a continental ring will sell manures cheaper than the Irish factories could sell them?  I do not expect Deputies opposite to adopt anything but a shortsighted policy.  They never took a long view on anything.  They just look at the present&mdash;perhaps some of them look nine months ahead, but no further. They have not looked into the question of what is going to become of the workers when the manure factories here are closed.  Have they any guarantee, seeing that they asked us for guarantees, from the British or continental rings that in a few years' <Col N="567" /> time, when the factories here are closed, they will sell manures cheaply? I would like to put it to Deputy Dillon that foreigners may come along&mdash;whoever they may be&mdash;and send out a circular, stating that raw materials have gone up, the cost of labour has gone up, and advising farmers not to mind paying an extra shilling for manures, or suggesting that an extra 2/6 per cwt. on manures would not amount to a great deal.  It is quite possible that in two or three years' time we would find ourselves in the position we are in at present with regard to other industries. The Party opposite should remember the mistake that they made when they were in power, when they let the flour mills and other industries go.  They should try to have a little sense at this stage, and should see that we are doing the right thing, in order to save the industries we have.  I would like to have from Deputies opposite an answer to the question that was put by Deputy Moore last night.</P>

If there is undue profiteering we will not hesitate to say to the Irish manufacturers that we are going to withdraw the tariff and, if that is not sufficient, we will not hesitate to throw open the ports again for any manures that may be required.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, quite cheerful.  I do not believe the burden is going to be as heavy as some Deputies have tried to make out.  I am quite certain it is not going to amount to £250,000 or £300,000 a year, as Deputy Gorey suggested. I am quite certain an increase in the price of manure as a result of the tariff will not be as heavy as Deputies opposite have prophesied.  As I have indicated, and as the Minister for Industry and Commerce has made clear, if we find that manufacturers here are profiteering or charging undue prices as a result of the tariff, we are prepared to throw the ports open for the importation of continental manures.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked us if we got an application for the tariff.  We have made up our minds that this tariff is going to benefit the country and we have heard nothing which would induce us to change our minds.  As Deputies opposite know, there were modifications in some tariffs when we heard sensible suggestions made that the tariffs should be varied in particular ways; but there was no sensible suggestion in regard to this tariff and it will remain.  We are not a bit afraid to go on with the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was absent during a great portion of this debate.  Possibly he was not in the House when the Minister for Industry and Commerce spent a considerable amount of time endeavouring to prove that this would mean no <Col N="570" /> burden on the farmers.  Now we have the Minister for Agriculture indicating that he is satisfied that the farming community will bear that burden quite willingly.  I am interested in this tariff because I think it is an excellent example of the way in which tariffs as a whole have been proposed.  I am not going to discuss the rival merits of different manures.  There seems to be a conflict of opinion between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and most of those who have personal contact with farming.  So far as I am concerned, I prefer to take their view against the Minister.  The definite case against this tariff was ignored by the Ministers.  It was made, not merely by Deputy Dillon, but by most of the Deputies who spoke on this side.  There are two definite grounds of objection to the tariff.  The first is the increase in price of this particular commodity and the second is the effect the tariff will have on competitive prices in the State.</P>
      <P>We have had the experience of people actually engaged in this business. I suggest that mere categorical statements by the Ministers that certain things will not occur cannot possibly controvert the experience of men like Deputy Dillon or Deputy Davis, who have put forward arguments as to the effect of the importation of this commodity on the home prices.  They have given us the results of their practical experience, and I prefer their experience to mere, unsupported statements by Ministers.  The experience of those Deputies is that the importation of this commodity from the Continent has led to the reduction of prices here and apparently without any danger of putting the home producer out of the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has been the principal case put forward by the Ministers for this tariff?  They say that if we have not this tariff there is the possibility and, according to the Minister for Agriculture, the probability, that in a couple of years this industry that now employs 1,000 people will disappear altogether.  Is there the slightest evidence brought forward in support of that statement?  The only evidence Ministers brought forward was the <Col N="571" /> figure relating to importation this year and in past years.  What evidence is there of the disappearance of the home producer?  Not a scrap of evidence has been produced by Ministers except the statement that an additional 5,000 tons were imported during the first three months of this year.</P>
    <P>Those who are in immediate touch with the farming community and with the retail trade in this commodity argue that this burden will be put on the farmer.  This is a commodity in respect of which there is a production altogether of 200,000 tons.  There was in this House a very strong case put up against the tariff by Deputies like Deputy Dillon and Deputy Davis, who deal in this commodity as retailers, and by Deputies who have practical knowledge of farming.  Those arguments have never been considered by the Minister.  We have plenty of evidence that most of the tariffs in this Schedule are unwise.  The Minister has adopted the same practice in regard to this tariff as he has adopted in regard to other tariffs.  He has met the manufacturers, asked them what it will cost to produce this article in the country, and then said: &ldquo;Very good, there is your tariff.&rdquo;  He has not considered what will be the effect on the farming community.  The conflicting nature of the statements made in the course of the debate are sufficient to indicate that there should be a proper examination of the effects of the tariff before it is imposed.  Those best entitled to speak for the farming community, men who have an intimate knowledge, more intimate than I or the Minister for Industry and Commerce could claim, have pointed out the heavy burden this tariff will mean on farmers.  I suggest before a burden of that kind is imposed, not merely the manufacturer, but also the farmers, should be heard, together with others who have first-hand knowledge of the subject.</P>
    <P>There are many other tariffs of which the same thing can be said, but this is an outstanding case in which it is apparent that the most important evidence that could be brought forward has not been brought forward.  There <Col N="572" /> was no machinery by which it could be brought to the notice of the Minister before the tariff was imposed.  It is quite obvious from the speech of the Minister for Agriculture that he is determined to give certain grants to the farmers.  He mentioned some of them&mdash;the agricultural grant of £250,000 and the butter subsidy, whatever it amounts to.  What it will amount to only a prophet would care to determine. Whether it will amount to £100,000, £400,000 or £750,000 will depend upon the amount of butter exported.</P>
    <P>That cannot be told unfortunately at the moment.  But against these the Minister and other Ministers have put burden after burden on the backs of the farmers.  This is only one of them. They have inflicted much more serious injury on the farming community than even the proposed gifts they speak of can compensate the farmers for.  It is no answer to the case put up here by those who have a first-hand knowledge of the trade and who are in touch with farming to say that merely because 5,000 tons extra are introduced, merely because, roughly speaking, we are back again to the figure of 1930, that there is a danger.  Where is the danger? 5,000 tons in a trade in which the total amount is 200,000 tons.  We are asked to answer Deputy Moore's statement. The answer is quite simple&mdash;the case does not exist here.  There is no danger so far as anyone can see.  There is not the slightest ground for the suggestions made by Ministers that there is any danger whatsoever of the disappearance from the market of the home competitor.  There is no evidence offered of that that is worthy of a moment's consideration.  We were given various reasons why this should be.  The gold standard was introduced. The one thing that we should be grateful to the Minister for is that he did not bring in the gold ounces.  Then we would have the whole matter perfectly clear.</P>
    <P>I was under the impression that one of the charges made against the late Government was that they let this country go off the gold standard, but if this country went off the gold standard as well as England, how that can <Col N="573" /> be brought in as a differentiating factor which would turn aside the importation of this commodity from England to this country, I do not know.  What is interesting in this is that it is quite obvious that as in the case of many another tariff no examination was given as to the effect of this tariff on the farming community. The Minister for Agriculture has suggested that they would not listen to any suggestions, but at the same time he has instanced various modifications that have been made in other tariffs, very hastily imposed, such as this was, without any examination. I wonder what was the reason for that? Was it that strong pressure was brought to bear on them?  Did the pressure of strongly organised bodies appeal to them?  Not merely was there criticism of these tariffs in the House but there was very strong agitation from important bodies in the country. Undoubtedly it is only when the people become alive to the very severe burden inflicted on them by this whole policy of tariffs&mdash;this is an outstanding and interesting example of that policy&mdash; that the Ministry will begin to mend its hand.  No amount of argument will get over the optimism of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that in imposing tariffs he is conferring a benefit on the consumer and is putting no burden on the community.  Optimism of that kind, as we have it on the Government Benches, is completely invincible against argument.  I put it to the House that there has been an unanswerable case made against this tariff.</P>

      <P>What has the Opposition overcome?  The Deputies sitting opposite were past masters of the art of creating bogies out of their own imaginations and then knocking them down.  They have been engaging in that gentle pastime all day to-day, talking about exorbitant increases in the price of certain artificial manures which they know will not and cannot take place.  What is the position? There is a 20 per cent. duty imposed on superphosphates and compound manures imported from outside the British Commonwealth.  Taking the price as quoted here to-day by Deputy Hassett, Deputy Gorey or Deputy Dillon for any of the Continental products and adding 20 per cent. to it you do not get up to the price at which the Irish products were bought last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that if any of the prices quoted here in respect of <Col N="576" /> Continental manures are increased by 20 per cent., then, on the admission of the Deputies opposite, that increased price is less than the price that was given for the Irish products last year. Consequently, even if people are determined to import these manures they can do so and pay duty on them, and have them at a less price than that at which the Irish products have been available.  The Irish products are being bought because they are better, as well as for other reasons.  Four out of five farmers preferred last year to pay the higher price for the Irish products. These Continental products are produced at in or about 30/- per ton. We cannot produce a similar product here at that price unless we are prepared to adopt a very low standard of living, lower rates of wages, and the very poor working conditions which operate on the Continent in this industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gold standard comes in at this point.  Because of the depreciation of the £ we have got to add to that 30/- per ton&mdash;that is the cost of production on the Continent&mdash;in or about 10/- when trying to get the figure at which that product could be sold here.  If the fall in the value of the £ had not taken place, then these Continental manures should be 10/- cheaper, and, if you add another 10/- for transport charges, it means that, at 50/- per ton, these Continental manures can be delivered at the quay-side here.  So that when you add this 20 per cent. duty you still have them at a price less than that at which the Irish farmer in open competition was willing to pay for the Irish product last year.  We have no duty upon the British product.  In so far as there is competition between England and this country in respect of these items, that competition continues unrestricted. The existing factories here are quite competent to supply the full requirements of the country in these articles. A large range of artificial manures used by farmers are not subject to duty at all.  We have only selected the phosphates and compound manures in respect of which there can be no question of the ability of the Irish factories to supply all our requirements, and of a much better quality, too, than we can <Col N="577" /> purchase abroad.  That justifies the duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to contradict the statement I made here yesterday in regard to the importation of superphosphates by the manufacturers in this country.  They import the rock and grind it out and it is used as a basis of manufacture of superphosphates. I was very much amazed to hear the Minister for Agriculture say that this was all they were asking the farmer to pay.  I think he must be oblivious of the very much larger number of articles in common use by farmers on which a very heavy tariff has been placed already.  He must have overlooked the innumerable taxes that have been put on, increasing the cost of living and which must result in very considerable advance of the cost to the farmer and that at a time when he is least able to bear them.  When markets are doubtful and are practically nonexistent, the realisation of the products of the land will be a very serious difficulty in enabling him to bear even the costs that were in existence prior to the tariff.  Everyone, particularly the Minister for Agriculture and his Department, will tell you that Irish land is not producing anything like what it should produce under normal and favourable conditions.  A large area is not a very big factor in production. It is largely the use that is made of the land that matters.  In many cases educated and industrious farmers are able to produce, from smaller areas of land, a volume of production in excess of what would be produced in very much larger areas of land of the same quality simply because of the manner in which the land is used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of all the taxes that have been placed on the farmer there is no more serious one owing to the value of manure and the part that it plays, and the assistance it renders to production than this tax.  Those of us who have to do co-operative buying and selling know the difficulties they have to encounter.  We are well aware that the manure manufacturers in this country have time after time formed rings which have been only broken <Col N="578" /> by the importation of the Continental superphosphate.  That is my experience. We have succeeded in reducing almost immediately the prices of manure; they have had to come down £1 a ton under favourable conditions in regard to imports.</P>
    <P>I am on seaboard area.  Farmers there use up a considerable amount of seaweed for manure.  It contains a certain amount of nitrogen and an amount of potash but it is practically useless without the addition of phosphate.  It is a tillage area.  The farmers there do not go in largely for house-feeding or the keeping of animals which would supply a large amount of farmyard manure.  They would be helpless without the aid of artificial manure.  I can appreciate the agony of mind of the Minister for Agriculture in trying to make a case for this tariff and the officials of his Department must have informed him of the blow that it will in fact be to Irish farmers if a tax of this description is put upon such a valuable commodity as this commodity is. There is against the various requirements of farmers that have been tariffed this £250,000 which is being made so much of but I say there would be no better way of assisting agriculture than to take that £250,000 and to do something in the line of lessening the price at which manures stand to-day and something further to cheapen them.  It is only by cheapening the agricultural requirements of the farmer and preventing further imposts upon him that you can assist production in this country.  Production is vital to this country.  We are not carrying as large a volume of production as we should.  Because of the want of organised markets or organised purchasing, the country is not producing anything like what it could do.</P>
    <P>We had undoubtedly a very efficient Department of Agriculture.  It has done enormous things for this country and I take off my hat to the Minister and to the officials of the Department of Agriculture for what they have done, but you are nullifying all your efforts in the three items I have mentioned. These taxes are a hindrance to the <Col N="579" /> farmer who has no capital and no market.  A great deal of play has been made about the likelihood of the firm of Messrs.  Goulding closing down.  But they did not close down after the War, when undoubtedly there was a very serious impediment, when continental superphosphates were imported at a very low figure compared with what they were producing.  We know the difficulty the ring has placed in the way.  We know the advantage offered to the trade.  Those who are engaged in buying and selling know what these items are.  Deputy Dillon probably is aware of them.  These are naturally nullified by importation of the same commodity based on the same analysis, and what particular reason can there be to restrain the farmer from getting what is an enormous advantage to him in carrying on his farm.  It is common knowledge to anyone engaged in agriculture that anything that tends to increase the price of the farmer's requirements will make him refrain from getting them.  Anyone in contact with farmers knows their attitude on this question.  Farmers will not stand for any increase in the price of their requirements, and this tariff is imposed for the purpose of increasing price. There is no question about it that at this time they are not able to bear it, and that while the Land Commission are asking for the prompt payment of their annuities the farmers are not able to meet them.  They cannot sell their cattle at the fairs, yet the Government are fixing tariffs upon them that are appalling the farmers in the country, and there is a very loud voiced opposition against them.  I appeal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and to the Minister for Agriculture to use their influence to resist those imposts upon that class which, as I said, cannot possibly bear them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want at the beginning to enter a very definite protest against the remarks with which the Minister for Industry and Commerce opened his last contribution to this debate. He spoke of obstruction.  Obstruction facing what facts?  These, that the Minister for Finance deliberately <Col N="580" /> withheld these Financial Resolutions from discussion in the House until yesterday.  They could have been down earlier.  Then also he made the plea of necessity, and got his resolution through the House without adequate discussion.  There was no obstruction there.  Our opposition to this has been dubbed silly, hypocritical and almost nagging.  We are told that the opposition to this has been, at times, sulky; at times, hysterical; and, at times, nagging, and that the failure of Cumann na nGaedheal in Opposition has surprised even the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It certainly surprised him into silence, in the main, silence with regard to arguments that were put up, and it certainly surprised the whole Executive Council to the point that, when a particular item was under discussion, they had to walk out of the House, when their deliberate misrepresentations with regard to a special important conference were likely to be shown up.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce in talking of this tariff the first day it was introduced, in answer to a remark by Deputy Gorey, indicated his view that North Africa was inside the British Commonwealth.  That was where he stood with regard to certain of the small items in connection with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of the simplest of all the tariffs to consider, and you have to start off from a very elementary point with regard to it, an elementary point, which, possibly, the notorious political economist that Deputy Corry is may not have recognised, that prices in anything are like springs&mdash;they have a tendency to go upwards and they will go upwards, if not kept down by some dead weight.  There are about two good weights that can keep prices down in anything.  One is, that the manufacturer must look for biggish sales, dependent on the particular thing he is selling, and he must, therefore, sell within the bounds of what those at whom he is aiming can buy, and, secondly, and by far the biggest weight that would keep prices down, there is competition.  Deputy Dillon has made two points here this morning that have not yet been answered, and they are two points that could <Col N="581" /> have been understood, if, before imposing or seeking to impose, this tariff, the Ministry had sought from any trader&mdash;not a manufacturer&mdash;his experience, and they would have got from nearly any trader, if he gave a statement honestly to them, what Deputy Dillon has said here several times.</P>
    <P>In answer to one of the points Deputy Dillon made, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, before the Minister for Agriculture made his appearance, made this point, and made it with great vehemence, that you have got to get into your head one fact&mdash;that four out of every five farmers in this country at the moment, who use artificial manures, use Irish manures.  That was supposed to be the making of the case, or the foundation for the making of the case, that the Irish farmer was not going to pay more by reason of this.  The Minister for Agriculture has apparently thrown that case overboard.  He has not got that fact into his head that was so vehemently stressed by his colleague. Instead, he says &ldquo;of course, we are going to ask the farmer to pay something, but look at what we are giving him.&rdquo;  What is going to be the cost to the farmer?  Remember that the amount of revenue looked for from this grouped series of articles is not much. It is intended to knock out the continental manures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement as to the small amount of revenue coming from the group of tariffed articles shows clearly the view of the Ministry on that.  This is not intended for revenue to any degree whatever.  It is intended to keep out continental manures. Has anybody yet answered Deputy Dillon's point, spoken from his experience of the trade, and the point that can be spoken to by anybody who has any experience of that trade, that the only thing that keeps down the ring price in this country is either the coming in, or the threatened coming in, of continental manures?  That point has not been answered.  In answer, <Col N="582" /> or in an attempted answer to it, we get the usual compassionate pleas about the thousand people who are employed, and, again, the answer comes to this, what is the probability of these thousand men losing their employment if the tariff be not put on? On that, we get merely a quotation of figures for certain months in this year, but the official documents show that, even if we take the statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to the percentage increase in the first three months of this year, so far as imports are concerned, you are getting back to the 1930 position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been no case made that there is any probability of any of the present employees of this branch of business losing their employment.  Supposing the case is going to be made that there is some danger.  The Minister for Agriculture attempted to meet another point made by Deputy Dillon with a peculiar phrase.  Deputy Dillon pointed out the circumstances of this trade, and pointed out that certain boatloads of manures arrive at certain times, and it is when they arrive that prices begin to shift and it is when these do not arrive and when there is no danger of their arrival, that prices show a tendency to shift the other way.  The Minister for Agriculture countered that with the statement &ldquo;if next January we see that our manufacturers are charging too much, it will not then be impossible to get continental manures in.&rdquo;  The time limit is a very narrow one in this, and it is doubtful if that could come about, but supposing it does?  Supposing it is within the Minister's power, what about the thousand employees then?  Supposing next January, we get to the point where there is a price charged for Irish manures which the Ministry think too much and the Ministry say that they are going to let in continental manures, cannot the same compassionate plea be made then&mdash;what about the thousand men? Are you going to throw them out for a mere difference of whatever it will be&mdash;even such a thing as 10/- a ton? Are you going to throw out these thousand people for that?  Where is the upward limit that has to be reached <Col N="583" /> before compassion ceases and ordinary business instinct gets free play?</P>
    <P>We are told further: &ldquo;if our manufacturers go out, what guarantee have we that the price of foreign manure will not increase&rdquo;?  Supposing home prices go up a bit.  Is not that same argument cogent still?  You must let them charge the new price&mdash;the same argument, if it has cogency now, has got the same cogency, at any rate, hereafter.  &ldquo;Let the price go up.&rdquo;  If you do not give a tariff, and even if you do not increase the tariff, the argument can still be used.  You dare not let down the home manufacturer because if you do what is going to happen afterwards?&mdash;that argument can go on to eternity, with the price rising every year, unless we have, and know, where is the upward limit when that type of argument is not going to prevail, and we are going to have ordinary business methods having their play.</P>

      <P>This has been spoken of to the point of nausea, but it has not been answered.  Does the Deputy know that the only firm really in this business in this country is in the British ring?  It has not been denied by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>A representative of the firm denied it to me, personally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only because he thought the Deputy was simpler than the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Minister does not deny it, and nobody who knows the business can deny it.  Let us reverse that argument about the home manufacturer. What are we doing?  We are putting out the continental manufacturer, and let me ask those who are so insistent, what is the future of the country going to be if the foreign <Col N="584" /> manufacturer goes out, and we are left at the mercy of one firm?  What is the future going to be if the continental manufacturer, who does bring down prices in this country, on the testimony of people in the business, goes out of operation, and we are left at the mercy of one single firm, and that firm in the ring with the English manufacturers? Is not the danger as great, on the one hand, as it is on the other?  It certainly seems as great to everybody but the people who believe that by passing a piece of legislation in this House they can control prices.  I only hope we get that price-fixing measure brought forward as quickly as possible and put into operation, so that we may see the futility of it in practice.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture makes the point that supposing you do take the continental stuff, taking into consideration not merely the cost of manufacture abroad, but taking the cost as delivered in this country, and adding 20 per cent., the continental stuff is still able to undersell the Irish manufacture, but the Irish farmer is paying a bit more for the Irish stuff because he considers it the better article. Surely, there is a relation between the price of the continental stuff and the price at which the Irish manufacture is going to be sold.  You have the testimony of Deputy Dillon, who is in the business, to which I can add my own testimony, based on the time I was connected with business of the same type, that the one thing which does regulate the price at which home manufactured stuff is sold is the incoming of certain continental manures. If this tax blocks those coming in, as it is intended to do&mdash;it is not intended to gather any revenue&mdash;the loss to the farmer is not going to be 20 per cent. on the price at which continental manure is at present being sold, but it is going to be the highest price the Irish manufacturer can get out of the farmer, the manufacturer being freed of all competition.</P>

      <P>He will be free from the only competition that has counted so far, the only competition that has <Col N="585" /> had the effect of keeping down the price.  One point has not yet been met &mdash;the very definite statement made by Deputy Dillon, backed by nearly everybody who is in touch with the trade, that there is one lever to force down and to keep down the price of the Irish manufacturer, and that is the impact upon him of the imports of Continental manures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, it is dumping. Let us take that much-abused word. Continental manure is brought in here. Nevertheless, four out of every five farmers use Irish manure.  Even if ten per cent. goes on, according to the two Ministers who have made calculations on this matter, the Continental manures will still be sold at a price under the price at the moment for Irish manures.  Where does the dumping come in?  What does the use of that phrase mean?  Dumping to what extent?  Dumping increased to what extent?  Where is dumping shown? Have prices gone down to the point that the shares of the firm concerned are at a very low figure upon the market?  Is the firm likely to be put out of business?  Are its employees likely to lose their employment?  No case of that kind has been made. A statement has been made about importations in the first three months of this year being 25 per cent. above the figure for that period last year.  Even taking that figure, you do not find your imports appreciably higher than they were the year before.  That is what is called &ldquo;dumping.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me get back to the main point made.  It has to be reiterated again and again because until it is answered a case for this tariff has not been made &mdash;that you have a certain amount of Continental manure coming in here and that it keeps the prices low, not merely to the farmer who buys Continental manure solely, if there be such a farmer, but to every four out of five farmers who buy not Continental manure but Irish manure.  We are going to take away the lever which operates to keep down the price of the Irish manure and we are doing it on <Col N="586" /> a statement with regard to imports for three months, although the figure of 25 per cent. addition does not mean that the imports are appreciably over those for 1930.  That is the case for the tariff.</P>

It was an attempt to get a home manufacture going at a certain cost to the community, the cost being equalised by remission at another point.  This is the case of a tariff that should have been inquired into before it was imposed.  The inquiry should have gone beyond the manufacturer.

      <P>Surely that point could have been inquired into.  It would appear to be unnecessary repetition but I do think it is important to stress that the point made at the beginning of this debate by Deputy Dillon has not yet been answered&mdash;that the incoming of the foreign manure operates in a particular way; remove that and it is not a question of fixing the farmer with a mere ten per cent. addition on something coming in but it is a question of what the ring can force prices up to in this country while still keeping sales.  What is going to be the result?  That is what has got to be answered and this calculation of ten per cent. on the very small amount of stuff coming in is not an answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce a few questions which I hope he will regard as reasonable.  He says that this tariff is being brought in to help a declining Irish industry.  Is there as much evidence to show that this industry is declining as there is to show that the Irish farming industry is declining? Is there as much danger of this industry collapsing as there is of the Irish farming industry collapsing?  Is it as difficult to make a living in this industry as it is in the Irish farming industry? Is there any country in the world with an industry so important to it as farming is to this country which would tax its raw material at this particular time?</P>
      <P>I consider that the whole tariff policy of the Government is terribly dangerous to the Irish farmer and I consider that the so-called national policy of the Government is terribly dangerous to the Irish farmer.  I cannot expect the Government to agree with me on that but surely it ought to be common ground to all of us that a tax on the raw material of what is admittedly our principal industry at a time like this is absolute madness.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Dillon stated that the one safeguard a farmer had was that he was getting cheap manures by allowing in Continental manures.  I have been listening to Deputy McGilligan for four or five years in this House making the same case against every industry that asked for protection.  He made the same case as against the coach-building industry.  He made the same case against the tariff on boots, against the tariff on clothes, and against every other tariff, even tariffs that the last Government imposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>He made the very same case against these tariffs, that prices cannot go up so long as imports are allowed.  There is no reason why tariffs should be put on if it is necessary to allow in imports to keep down prices. As the Minister for Industry and Commerce said, this tariff was put on in order to ensure that a thousand persons would get employment in future.  That is the main reason for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>At the farmers' expense, if you like.  I shall defend that case. A Bill was brought in last week by the Minister for Agriculture to give certain opportunities to a certain article of agricultural production.  The Minister for Agriculture said, and the Government were prepared to stand over it, that the Government were prepared to put an extra price on every section of the community in order that the farmer might be kept in production. They were prepared to put on anything from half a million to three-quarters of a million pounds in the year and tax, to that extent, the farmers themselves and every other section of the community in order that the farmers might be kept in the production of butter.  If the Minister came forward to-morrow with proposals to keep the farmers in the proposal <Col N="589" /> duction of barley or oats, Deputy Gorey and the other farmer Deputies on the opposite benches would certainly support that, no matter at whose expense it was.  I am not admitting that the farmers will have to pay more, but if there is any suggestion that they may have to pay more for artificial manure we have all the farmers on the opposite benches getting up and making the case that the farmers should not be taxed, or that they should not do anything in order to keep one thousand people in employment. I think the time has come when the farmers, big and small, should realise that they cannot continue to exist without the other sections of the community.  They cannot remain independent and exist without leaning in many directions on the other sections of the community. Deputy Gorey ought to be long enough here to realise that.  I know what Deputy Gorey's outlook was seven or ten years ago with regard to free trade.  He was an absolute free trader.  He, for instance, opposed the tariff on boots.  I heard him say here that the farmers would have to pay more for their hob-nailed boots if the tariff were put on.  It was quite sound to a certain extent, if the farmers could continue to exist on a foreign market.  But the time has come now when that foreign market will not give them their cost of production. They are no longer getting their cost of production in a foreign market, and they have to fall back on their own country to keep them in production. Deputy Gorey must realise that.  The people who made the statements we listened to to-day are doing an absolute injustice to the farmers. We had Deputy Roddy saying that because dairy cattle were reduced in numbers in this country it was necessary for the farmers to use more artificial manures.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That because dairy cattle were reduced in number it was necessary for the farmers to use more artificial manure, and because tillage had <Col N="590" /> gone down it was necessary for farmers to use more artificial manure.  Why has it become necessary to use more artificial manure if the cattle population has gone down, if tillage has gone down, and the general output of agriculture has gone down very much in the last three or four years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I said.  I did not misrepresent the Deputy. Dairy cattle have gone down, and what is the reason?  The farmers cannot get a price for their dairy produce.  That is the argument Deputy Roddy made, that because the output of agricultural produce had gone down it was necessary to use more artificial manure to grow more grass that would not be used.  That is the logical conclusion you must come to.  There has been a lot of talk about superphosphates being taxed.  There are several other manures upon which there is no tax, such as basic slag, guano and sulphate of ammonia.  It is possible for a farmer not to use any superphosphates whatever, and get as good results out of any of these.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting the other argument.  It is possible for them to use basic slag, guano or sulphate of ammonia, and get as good results. Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney told us that farmers would go in for basic slag, and would not use superphosphates.  When that time arrives we can take other measures.  All the talk about the price of superphosphates being put up, and the farmers being broken as a result of the tariff, is absolute nonsense, and nobody knows it better than the Deputies who tried to make the case. For how many years have Belgian phosphates been coming in?  I do not know.  Perhaps Deputy Dillon knows. Is it four or five years?</P>

      <P>As one who cannot be accused of being in the manufacturers' ring and who is only concerned with the workers in that section of the industry, I can say that there have been 44 workers employed in my constituency as a result of this tariff. The Chairman of the Farmers' Party there, a member of a public board, has proposed a resolution appealing to the Government to prohibit the importation of foreign manures, to enable that industry to survive and to keep these men in employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>That man is a large trader and he realises that if the industry was closed down it would be a serious matter and that whatever may be the increased price of manures, it will be compensated for by the fact that these 44 men will not be thrown on home help, which would cost the farmers in my constitutency, taking it at 8/- per man per week, about £1,000 extra.  As one who has a knowledge of the workers engaged in the industry I can assure the farmers that there is no fear of any increase taking place in the price as the result of the tariff for the reason that you can increase the <Col N="593" /> output of the factory by 25 per cent. without employing another man. The factory can produce at its full capacity and supply the various counties without any extra cost to the manufacturers or the employment of one extra man.  Therefore, it is merely to protect the 44 men who are working in that industry that I am supporting this tariff.</P>
      <P>I should prefer that the Minister went even further with the tariff, because these 44 men if they were thrown on the unemployed list would cost much more than what Deputy Gorey expects this tariff will cost the farmer.  I think the tariff will cost the farmer nothing.  When we, representing the working class, agree to pay 4d. extra per pound for butter to enable the farmer to live and when we are called upon to bear various burdens in the way of tariffs for developing industries, surely we can expect other portions of the community to do something towards assisting the workers? I am sorry the Minister did not prohibit altogether the importation of foreign manures.  We want to develop our own industries but we do not want to develop them under the slave conditions that prevail where some of those manures are manufactured.  That is the reason it is possible to dump these manures into this country and sell them at less than the cost of production here. The workers here are organised and they will never submit to the slave conditions that prevail in countries where these manures are manufactured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard about slave conditions for the first time in this debate.  When we hear that there are slave conditions existing on the other side of the English Channel, we begin to speculate as to what is the real attitude and what are the real ideas behind Labour here. What evidence is there that there are slave conditions in Belgium or Holland?  Deputy Everett belongs to the same international organisation as the organised workers of Belgium and Holland.  He talks about slave conditions in Holland which he must know do not exist, if he is any way well informed in his own organisation.  It is only a joke to put <Col N="594" /> up this cant of slavery on the continent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude of the Labour Party has always been the attitude of the sheltered trades.  They have always been the spokesmen of the sheltered trades, and although they are elected for rural constituencies their policy is to hold on to the rural constituencies while working for the sheltered trades.  That has always been their policy and that is the reason that they are where they are to-day.  Yet, not one sheltered trade centre will return a Labour Deputy to this House.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, I think, was very unjust to Deputies on this side and I resent strongly his description of the opposition to the Resolution when he said that it was purely obstruction.  It is nothing of the sort and if the Minister paid any attention to the arguments he would see very little trace of obstruction in them.  We are able to stand up here and speak with authority from actual knowledge of these matters, and on the tariffs imposed here.  I have never stood up here to speak on anything about which I had no knowledge. I speak on this tariff because I have been using artificial manures for many years.  I can tell the Minister that this year I have used 26 tons of artificial manure.  I can therefore speak with some authority on this matter and I know something about it.  It is unworthy of the Minister to say that we have got up for the purpose of obstruction. I never spoke on any subject in which I had not an interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing emerges from the speech of Deputy Allen, and that is his explanation of why this Party is on this side of the House.  He said it is because of our attitude to tariffs, because we did not impose a lot of tariffs. There was nothing about the Oath in it.  It is not because of the Oath that we are on this side of the House.  That emerges now.  The Minister for Agriculture said that we are accusing him of putting a burden on the farmer.  We do accuse him of putting a burden on <Col N="595" /> the farmer, and we accuse him of putting it on without any necessity.  There is not a shred of necessity for putting this burden on the farmer, and the proof of that is the price at which the shares of the only manufacturing concern engaged in this industry are quoted, and the manner in which they are appreciated on our stock markets. It is one of the most favoured investments in the State.  It embraces all the manufacturers in the State and a considerable number of the manufacturers in England.  They are joined with the other English manufactures.</P>
    <P>The combine or ring is on the two sides of the Channel.  Deputy Allen asked how long are phosphates coming in.  Belgian phosphates only began to come in, and it was only possible for them to come in at any profit when the trade here perfected itself in one solid ring with all the manufacturers in it.  We farmers and users of artificial manures remember it well. The date would be about 14 or 15 years ago.  At that time internal competition ceased, and the manufacturers were able to carry on with that, and they thought it good business for themselves to become one company.  It was only then that it was possible for the continental stuff to come in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>The co-operators of this country will have to buy the phosphates themselves in the place where they are to be found.  The Minister for Agriculture made a statement that we had evidence of unemployment.  He said that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has said that the manure manufacturers had allowed men to go. I did not hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce making that statement himself.  The Minister for Agriculture made it on his authority, and I doubt its accuracy.  No matter what manufacturers may have said on the subject I doubt it.  The system of inquiry into <Col N="596" /> the desirability of a tariff seems to be that a statement by the manufacturer is enough.  The Minister said he had an interview with the employees.  They will say the same thing.  But was there any evidence but word of mouth or hearsay?</P>
      <P>Were these people put on the witness table, and were they sworn in the ordinary sense in which evidence is accepted?  Not a word about that.  I am down in Waterford twice every fortnight, at an important business place.  Now, one of the principal branches of the Goulding factory is located in Waterford, and I have not heard a syllable about unemployment in that factory.  Waterford is one of the ports where most of the phosphate is landed, and I have not heard a syllable about any unemployment in that factory.</P>
      <P>The only thing to make the farmer the abject slave of the manure ring is to compel him to purchase manure whether he wants it or not and whether the price is right or not.  What is the position with regard to the use of manures?  The farmer is not a fool. He has 30 or 40 years' experience of the use of artificial manures, and he has the assistance of the analysis that our Department of Agriculture thought it wise and necessary to impose.  The Department some years ago thought that a very necessary thing to impose for the protection of the users.  I want to go very much further than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Department thought it necessary in the interests of the people and in order to protect the consumer to have an analysis of all manures and to have grass seeds tested in this country, I would like to know what the Dáil is to infer from that?  On the basis of these analyses, on the basis of the solubility of the manure, the farmer, when coming to buy his manures in the springtime, will buy them at comparative prices in relation to their manurial value and their suitability to the particular soil.  He has no preference one way or the other.  He will buy Irish if he can.  He is not tied to the continental manures.  He does not care two pins.  If there is any preference at all he will buy Irish.  I always bought Irish, and paid 2/6 a ton more for it. <Col N="597" /> Value for value, we will give a preference to the Irish material.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the price of the continental stuff is going to be raised to the extent of the tariff. Deputy Corry's figure is a joke, 18,000 tons.  The facts are that the Irish manufacturer bases his price early in the year on the knowledge that the continental stuff is there to come in.  He bases his price accordingly.  What would he base it on if he had not the knowledge that the continental stuff was coming in?  If he knew that the competition was killed, on what would he base his price?</P>
    <P>This is meant to kill competition, and it will kill competition.  It will put the foreign manufacturer absolutely out of business and hand that business over to the ring.  What would the Irish manufacturer base his price on with the knowledge that the continental supplies were there and would come over?  When he has issued his price list, and even when the foreign phosphates arrive at the port here, the Irish manufacturer's price is still further lowered.  How much is that price list lowered because of that?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister for Industry and Commerce know anything at all about it?  The price is lowered as soon as the foreign shipments begin to arrive.  The very fact that these shipments are there is responsible for that.  We are told the price will be raised only to the extent of 12/- a ton or 15/-, or whatever the figure is that it may be raised by the tariff.  It will be more likely to be £2 a ton when competition is killed and the foreigner is out of the business.  It is no exaggeration to say that 200,000 tons of these manures are sold in the country every year, and it would be no over-statement to say that these manures will go up by at least 30/- per ton.  That would work out on the present normal consumption at the enormous figure of £300,000.</P>
    <P>The idea is to kill competition altogether. What was the necessity, first of all, to kill competition in the State? Was it not in order to enable them to charge more?  What is the effect of this competition that we have now? Is it not definitely in order to raise <Col N="598" /> prices?  The price can be forced up to the point where the consumer will not use these phosphates.  I say that that price can be very easily reached now. We have lambs being sold to-day, May lambs, at 30/- to 35/- each.  That is actually being called a good price for fat lambs.  Milk is being sold at 3½d. per gallon in parts of the country, and corn at a low price.  Every other article of agricultural production, and store cattle, are actually unsaleable, practically speaking.</P>
    <P>When a man is thinking of buying artificial manure he is thinking of what he is going to get out of it, of how much it will enhance the yield of his crops, how much it will improve his land, and what he is going to get for the finished article turned off his land. Even if the man has money and can afford to spend it, as a business man he would be a fool if he went farther than I have indicated.  He will only use manure if it is going to pay him.  The probability is that he will not use half as much as he has been using.  He will use less of it in any case if the price goes up.</P>
    <P>Last year I used 26 tons of artificial manures, and only 6 tons two years ago.  The year before last I used 16 tons of artificial manure.  It is a question of the value one gets for the money and the prospects one has from applying the manure.  We are not all fools. I speak about this matter because I am acquainted with it, and I can speak on it with some authority.  There is no justification at all for the suggestion that we are speaking here as obstructionists.</P>
    <P>I would be inclined to say, as I see it, that whether they know it or not the Executive Council and the Government have shown themselves to have been the tools of the manufacturers in this country.  That is the way I see it.  The time, I think, is ripe to preach a holy war against artificial manures in this country in order to bring the Government and the manufacturers to their knees.  That can be easily done, and with as much effect as this tariff can if imposed.  Years ago we got responses to public appeals, and we will get them again.  A thing like this is a public <Col N="599" /> scandal.  It is nothing short of perpetrating a scandal on the people of the country whether the Government know it or not.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when discussing this at first, to be very careful of what he was doing.  Yet when he got up to speak here yesterday he seemed to know less about it than he did on the first day. His whole knowledge was that somebody passed through his office and spent a half an hour there.  The Minister did not know whether Northern Africa was in the British Commonwealth or not.  He makes a lot of the fact that 25,000 tons came in, in the first two months.  32,000 tons came in last year, and 42,000 tons the year before.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has the figures there before him.  Four out of every five of the Irish consumers of phosphates use the Irish products.  Of course they do&mdash;because they think it is better value for the money and because of freightage and because the attitude in particular of the local trader has a lot to do with it, and if the trader in an inland county stocks only the Irish stuff, the consumer must buy Irish stuff if he is going to use it at all.  If you sap the confidence in business competition here in the consumer and the trader, and if you make it impossible for each to use artificial manures, then good-bye to Irish industries, and you will do more harm than good by your protection methods.</P>
    <P>Why was it necessary to end competition here?  Was it in order to give the manufacturers more money, more value, more dividends?  Is it right for any country or State to stand for the encouragement of rings for the purpose of robbing the consumer or extracting more from him?  As soon as a State starts to housekeep on these lines they are open to the accusation that they are either stupid or out for jobbery.  There is no necessity for a ring here at all except to force up prices, and there is no necessity for forcing out this 32,000 tons of normal competition or 42,000 tons except to kill competition and to hand over the consumer here altogether <Col N="600" /> into the hands of the manufacturer.  It would not have been so serious two or three years ago as it is to-day, because the resources of the agricultural community are very much less to-day, and that goes without argument.  Everyone will admit it.  I do not know whether the Minister still thinks we have stood up for the purpose of obstruction pure and simple.  If he still thinks so he is welcome to it.  How, if this little small competition that we have from outside &mdash;if that ring is broken or if its efficiency is impaired in any way&mdash;how is it still the best investment on the market, and for how much are these people prepared to buy legislation of this sort either one way or another? We are long enough in politics to know that there has been an association going round here for the last seven or eight years looking for somebody to do their job, and they did not find them up to lately.  I do not know whether they have found them now.  If they have, God help the country.</P>

That is what Deputy Gorey and Deputy McGilligan and the other members of the Opposition in the debate are asking members of Fianna Fáil and of this Government to do.  Deputy McGilligan referred to the fact that the Minister for Agriculture had stated that if the home manufacturer did not behave in a proper spirit the Ministry were empowered to admit the foreign manufactured article, and Deputy McGilligan says: &ldquo;I wonder what will happen then to the thousand men who are employed in this industry?&rdquo;  Deputy Gorey asked, in the event of this tariff what price will be quoted by the Irish manufacturer?  We do not know what price the Irish manufacturer will quote, but we do <Col N="601" /> know that a thousand men, as Deputy Allen pointed out, are engaged in this industry, and we think we have the sanction of the majority of the people of this country for believing that this Government is entitled to give the Irish manufacturer this opportunity, and we have the powers, if that manufacturer does not behave in the proper spirit, to allow foreign competition and to allow that competition that members on the other side are shouting for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice that I would raise on the Adjournment the question of the position in which a very large tobacco factory in Dublin finds itself because of the new duties, as a result of which the factory has to close down and 300 persons employed in the factory will be put out of employment.  We are dealing here with a very important industry, the Customs duty on unmanufactured tobacco <Col N="602" /> providing about three and a half million pounds yearly.  The Minister for Finance decided, in view of the financial situation, that he would have to get another £350,000 from tobacco entering the country.</P>
      <P>I think it should be pointed out that when dealing with the Budget last year, Deputy Blythe, who was then Minister for Finance, mentioned that he wanted another £300,000, but, for reasons that he fully explained at the time, he decided that it was impossible to get £300,000 from tobacco without injuring the income to the revenue and some of the firms manufacturing here. Therefore he turned away from the tobacco tax.  The present Minister for Finance pointed out that the duty on unmanufactured tobacco is 1/4 greater in Britain than it has been here up to the present, and that, for that reason, there is what he considers a margin up to 1/2 that he can afford to impose on unmanufactured tobacco coming in.  It is not a fact that there is a difference of 1/4 between the amount of duty leviable on unmanufactured tobacco in Great Britain and here. The position here is that there is a duty of 8/2½ on unmanufactured tobacco of a particular kind, while in Britain the full rate has been 9/6, showing a difference of 1/3½ or, as the Minister said, 1/4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no preferential rate here, but in Britain there is a preferential rate of 7/5½.  Increasing quantities of unmanufactured tobacco are being brought into Britain under the preferential rate to the extent, even some time ago, of 25 per cent., and it is still increasing in quantity. There is increased importation of Canadian tobacco.  If the average was taken it would not be more than 9/- per lb. on unmanufactured tobacco in Great Britain as against 9/4½ all round here.  There is no use in the Minister for Finance keeping an eye on the position here and in Britain and taking that as an index of what he can do in the way of taxation here.  He has to look at Irish circumstances, and apparently that is what he has not done.  The Minister pointed out that if he imposed the full 1/2 on all factories it would not be possible for certain <Col N="603" /> manufacturers to survive.  He suggests that by putting half on certain native manufacturers they will be able to continue in business by putting a small increase on the price of tobacco, and that the others by carrying out the policy firms in Britain have adopted can suffer their losses, and can be as gentle in dealing with purchasers of tobacco here as elsewhere, although they are not in the same position as regards the amount of duty they will have to pay on unmanufactured tobacco brought in.</P>
    <P>There is this discrimination between tobacco companies in this country, and we are told that the difference is as between native manufacturers and those who are not native manufacturers, but who have come into the Free State since the 1st April, 1922.  Amongst the firms that have come to the Free State since 1922 have been the representatives of a large tobacco combine, Messrs. Gallaher. Messrs. Gallaher are being put into the position I have pointed out, as a result of certain of their competitors here getting a preferential rate of 7s. 5d. in the lb., and of competing in the early days of their establishment with a very big combine. The Minister anticipated that the price of tobacco would be slightly increased here.  As a matter of policy, dictated no doubt by some of the bigger interests in the tobacco trade, the price has not risen.  Incidentlly, if there was an increase in the manufacture of tobacco here, taking the census of production figures from 1926 to 1929, there was an increase of £500,000 in the manufacture of cigarettes.  Otherwise there would have been a drop of a quarter of a million, so that cigarettes are an important factor in our tobacco industry. The position is that Messrs. Gallaher are going to be forced to close down because they are being discriminated against as not being an Irish firm.</P>
    <P>We are told in the columns of the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; to-day, with a great flourish of trumpets, that a record has been established in the swiftness with which an English firm made application to a property agent to buy up the factory which is going to become derelict <Col N="604" /> on the East Wall.  A factory is going to be closed because it is not a native factory, although it is a fully established one, contributing a considerable amount of money to the revenue, giving a considerable amount of employment, and is a definitely rooted industry here.  That factory is going to be shut down, and there is a flourish of trumpets because an English factory, admittedly, is supposed to be looking after the site in order to come here to start the assembling of motor chassis.  Apart altogether from the heavy incidence of the tax on tobacco generally, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce should, in fairness, look into the circumstances of this firm which is about to be closed down.</P>
    <P>They have told us, without being very explicit, that their policy with regard to industrial firms in Ireland is to have them directed by Irish people, controlled by Irish people, and Irish capital is to be the capital that is to run them.  We are told that in this Session we are to have a Bill that will outline their policy in that connection.  We are told that this firm of Messrs. Gallaher is outside the pale of that kind of consideration. We are told that implicitly by the action taken here.  Messrs. Gallaher are an Irish firm.  They have shown vigour and independence in the development of their industry and in preventing their industry falling into the control of the bigger combines.  In and outside Ireland tobacco-lovers are indebted to Messrs. Gallaher for getting tobacco cheaper than they otherwise would get it.  They have successfully fought very strong combines. The Minister for Finance knows very well that in Belfast they successfully fought more than that and that in times of difficulty in Belfast, when an endeavour was made to prejudice the firm because it recognised no difference of religion in the employment it gave and stood stoutly by Catholic workers, they won through.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows the firm is Irish to that extent.  He knows, too, or he can find out that when, under the changed circumstances here, the Boundary wall came about, Messrs. Gallaher were not in a position to come in immediately; <Col N="605" /> that is, in 1922 and 1923.  They came in since then and, when they did, they were welcomed by tobacco traders from one end of the country to the other.  They have established themselves and, during the last two or three years, they spent upwards of £250,000 in the way of building.  They built up a preliminary factory in Rathmines and then they constructed an up-to-date modern factory at the East Wall that Dublin City might well be proud of.  Their buildings alone cost upwards of a quarter of a million.  They gave employment at a time when it was very badly needed.  At the present moment they are paying about £700 a year in rates alone to the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>They have completed two years' trading here.  Naturally, a firm coming in at the great expense I have indicated will not make millions in its first two years.  Messrs. Gallaher are at the point when, having firmly established themselves here, they are on the eve of making profits.  After the work they gave when they were setting up their factory here&mdash;that is, building work alone&mdash;and after the employment they gave in their factory&mdash;and Ministers are urging that employment is now very necessary&mdash;it is too bad to see them being dealt with in this particular way. Three hundred persons are being put out of employment and Free State shareholders in the firm of Messrs. Gallaher are also, as it were, being put out of their employment&mdash;they are being deprived of their income.  This is happening, too, when additional firms are being invited to come here and start industry of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce contemplate their policy of inviting outside firms with capital and experience to come here in order to develop some Irish industries, they would be well advised to consider seriously what effect upon their long-view policy the shutting down of a factory like this is going to have.  I submit that this is a disastrous line of policy on the part of the new Government. It is disastrous after the ten years' life of a new State to discriminate <Col N="606" /> so drastically against persons who, during the State's short life, have come in and have established quite a number of factories here.</P>
    <P>These factories are a great addition by reason of the employment they give. Messrs. Gallaher are an outstanding example of sound business organisation, sound methods of trading.  Their employees are well treated both as regards remuneration and the circumstances in which they are asked to work.  The factories alone are a great addition to the appearance of our City. The Minister for Finance is faced with this, that the tax which he has put on is too heavy.  He will have to review it and take some of it off soon.  He is faced with that position at a time when he has not yet made up his mind how he is going to differentiate between Irish firms starting industries here and firms that are not Irish.  Before he has made up his mind on that, before he has disclosed his mind either to this House or to the industrialists in this country, before he decides to invite firms from outside to co-operate with him in establishing industries here, he takes an action which must be highly prejudicial to the success of the policy or the line of action upon which he is embarking, whatever that line of action may be.</P>
    <P>What I would like to see is this tax reduced all round.  I do not think that the Minister will agree with that. There is a good deal to be said for a firm with its roots so much in Ireland and with the vigorous and independent spirit that this Irish firm has shown in the work it has done here in Dublin since it was started.  This firm has had only two years of life here and they are getting to their profit-making period just now.  They do deserve special consideration of some kind or special examination of some kind.  If the Minister is going to insist on driving them out of production by shutting down their factory, he should give a fuller examination to the circumstances so as to see if he will be able to give the House a better reason for his action than that the firm is not a native firm.  I will make an appeal to the members of the Labour Party who have given the <Col N="607" /> fullest assistance to the present Ministry in support of their Budget policy&mdash;which, in many instances, undoubtedly has hit the working classes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That attitude was due, perhaps, to some long-distance view on the part of the Labour Party that the workers ought, of necessity, to suffer a little now in order that the long-distance-viewed prosperity may come.  I will ask them what bearing on their long-distance plan, or on their long-distance view of prosperity, has the policy that is enshrined in this proposal, which shuts down an Irish firm employing 300 workers in the City of Dublin, even if it is to let in an English firm for the purpose of manufacturing motor bodies.  I suggest this is a matter that the Labour Party ought not to support.  If they are going to support it they ought to take us into their confidence and show us how the shutting down of this factory in these circumstances is going to help labour, taking their particular and somewhat obscure long-distance view of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a very serious matter and I am greatly afraid that the reactions of the whole position are not seriously appreciated by the Government.  With most of the arguments of Deputy Mulcahy I am in complete agreement.  On the Budget I expressed the view that this experiment in existing circumstances was a doubtfully wise proposition.  What is the purpose of it?  If I understand the expressed policy it is to give a preference to Irish-owned firms&mdash;to Irish capitalists, in other words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say I am not at all impressed with the righteousness of that procedure or with the political or economic principle, because so long as industry in this country, or any other country, is based upon the exploitation of the worker, and is based on waste and inefficiency, then I do not see any particular virtue in any particular kind of employer.  In this tobacco industry we have this concrete example: that the cross channel <Col N="608" /> tobacco firms are paying to-day a rate of wages which in some cases is higher by 60 per cent. than the Trade Board rate of wages paid by those Irish native employers whom it is sought to protect. Quite frankly I am not standing for a policy of giving subsidies to employers who pay scandalously low rates of wages.</P>
    <P>The case made by the Government for this is that it is preference to Irish employers and Irish-owned industry. I am quite sure that the Minister realises that this kind of fiscal preference to Irish owned industry is a preference that can easily be defeated. If he has any doubt about it I invite him to investigate the position at Limerick, where, I understand that an English owned company is having its product manufactured.  I probably will be told that its manufacture is distinct altogether from the local Limerick manufacture of tobacco, cigarettes or snuff.  But I want to know whether it is not possible for this English owned firm to get a preference in connection with their tobacco, because it is linked up in some foggy kind of way with an Irish firm. It is quite possibly for any firm to defeat a financial preference given in this way by the Ministry, and if it is possible to do that the whole theory of subsidising native Irish manufacture falls to the ground.  If the Minister wants to pursue that policy of preference to Irish owned industry, all I would say is, as I said before, that I do not see any particular virtue in it.  I regard the employer who carries on industry on a basis of exploitation of the workers, and just only on the basis of the standard of living, that he concedes to his workers in his financial ramifications, has really no nationality. In many cases, although he happens to be born in a particular country, his nationality is Mammon, his outlook that of dividends, and the business he carries on exploitation.  I hope the Ministry will take back this whole proposal and give further consideration to the matter, and that if they want to carry on the policy of giving preference to Irish manufacturers, let it be in some other way than that of fiscal preference, which could be so <Col N="609" /> easily defeated.  Let them reconsider the whole matter again with much more care than I am afraid it has got.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been asked the reason for this differential tax and we were told that the reason was that we wished to give preference to Irish manufacturers.  That is not the reason. It is true that it is the policy of the Government to exercise a general preference for industries here, owned and operated within the country, as against those owned and operated by persons outside the country. In this particular case there were other considerations which had to be taken into account.  When the Government decided it was necessary to increase the tobacco duty this year in order to secure additional revenue we had to take into account the existence of Irish owned firms.  A number of these had gone out of existence since the cross-Channel firms began to operate here. I do not recall that there was anything like the same Press campaign in respect to the employees of these firms who lost their work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We had to face up to these facts that when the increase took place in England it was the policy of the tobacco combine not to increase its price.  They adopted that policy in order to put out of existence in England their smaller competitors.  We expected it would adopt the same policy here.  If the combine adopted that policy here the Irish manufacturers would be put out of business and 600 instead of 300 would be unemployed. The majority of Irish manufacturers were in serious circumstances because of the level of prices being fixed by the combine.  The majority of the manufacturers are manufacturers of pipe tobacco.  We recognised that and we increased the duty by 1/2 in the lb.  In adopting this policy we are told that these Irish manufacturers will be put out of business and that some 300 workers in Dublin will be unemployed.  We are particularly concerned with the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="610" /> We are anxious to try to keep the possible adverse reactions of the increase of duty down to the smallest possible dimensions.  I think we have succeeded in doing so.  We succeeded in giving Irish manufacturers a preference, but it is a very small preference, and in view of the fact that Irish manufacturers have been Pariahs in their own land for the last ten years, it is time that preference was given to them.  It is not true if Messrs. Gallaher are forced to close down to say that the Government are insisting in driving them out of existence.  This firm are paying in Great Britain a rate of duty on Virginian tobacco&mdash;the tobacco used in the manufacturer of cigarettes&mdash;which is higher than that they are asked to pay here.  I am satisfied for one that if the firm desire they could find means of continuing their existence here, and I am not at all satisfied that it is the difference which has been effected in the rate of duty which has caused them to close down.  I should like Deputy Mulcahy to ask them if the same result would not have been achieved if this differential rate had not been decided upon, if the full amount of duty had been payable by them while the tobacco combine operated its present policy.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if he will introduce proposals for legislation to repeal the law fixing a close season for the taking of salmon between 6 a.m. on Saturdays and 6 a.m. on Mondays, and if in the meantime, in view of the fact that the law in this respect has not operated in Cromane, Co. Kerry, since 1927 until recently, he will take the necessary steps to enable the same conditions to prevail pending the amendment of the Salmon Fishery Act of 1863.</P>
