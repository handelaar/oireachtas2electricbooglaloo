      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state (1) what amount of the Hospital Sweep money from the draw on the Manchester November Handicap, 1931, and the Grand National, 1932, is available for county hospitals; (2) what amount is earmarked for each county and in particular for Tipperary, and (3) on what basis it is going to be allotted, whether it will be on a valuation or population basis.</P>

      <P>The amounts made available for poor law hospitals from the Sweeps on the Manchester November Handicap, 1931, and the Grand National, 1932, are £236,721 17s. 3d. and £270,158 4s. 4d., respectively. As regards the information requested at (2) and (3) in the Deputy's question, it is intended to distribute the money according to local needs with due regard to (a) area and population to be served by the institution or institutions to be improved; (b) urgency of the work proposed; and (c) local financial and economic circumstances. My Department is in communication with the local bodies in Tipperary in regard to their institutional requirements, and pending the outcome of that correspondence I cannot make a statement as to the amounts to be eventually allocated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that the allocation of these funds to the hospitals will provide a considerable amount of employment, as there are quite a number of contracts for improvement works awaiting <Col N="174" /> the distribution of this money. Will the Parliamentary Secretary also see that when it becomes available it will be distributed as expeditiously as possible.  As a result of the Derby Sweep, there will shortly be available a sum of £350,000 approximately for the same purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that a great number of public boards throughout the country have had schemes prepared in anticipation of this money being available, would the Parliamentary Secretary say when it is proposed to distribute it?</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take the business as on the Order Paper.  With regard to Item No. 1&mdash; Financial Resolution&mdash;the Minister for Finance intends to leave over Resolutions Nos. 7, 8, 16, 17 and 26 until tomorrow. It is also proposed that if the discussion on the Financial Resolutions has not been concluded before 6 o'clock to adjourn the discussion for an hour, to take Estimates from 6 to 7 and to resume on the Financial Resolutions at 7 o'clock.  At 10 o'clock it is proposed to take Deputy Morrissey's motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to what the Minister has said in relation to my motion, I stated yesterday, when the President was dealing with this, that so far as I was concerned half an hour would be quite sufficient for me to conclude.  But, of course, there may be other speakers, and if there are I am sure the Minister will agree that I ought to get some little time to enable me to reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce will arrange that the Whips should have a discussion about this question of concluding on Deputy Morrissey's motion.  Perhaps if an hour and a half were allowed it could be concluded.  I do not know that it could be concluded in half an hour because some Deputies may want to speak on it.  There is no use in having half an hour on it to-night if we are not to conclude on it.  I think it would be better if a discussion on the matter could be arranged between the Whips.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>In view of the President's statement yesterday that Private Members' time is going to be taken all through the remainder of the session, I would like to know if any undertaking could be given that special concessions will be made at an early date to dispose of the motions in the names of Private Deputies that appear on the Order Paper.  If we are to have no time to discuss them in this session&mdash;presumably we will not be meeting again until October or November&mdash;then it seems to me that these motions are being pushed away <Col N="176" /> further than is justifiable, and possibly the President might allow them to be discussed on certain days after the delegation leaves for Ottawa.  I throw out that suggestion as a possible way of meeting Private Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the usual practice for the Government to appropriate Private Members' time while the financial business arising out of the Budget is under discussion.  It has also, I think, been the usual practice, more honoured in the breach than in the observance, to make up to Private Members at a later period the time so appropriated.  In any case the matter can be discussed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges with a view to making definite arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Dáil agree with the Committee in Resolution No. 1:</P>
      <P>(1)  That income tax shall be charged for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1932, at the rate of five shillings in the pound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  That sur-tax for the year beginning on the 6th day of April. 1932, shall be charged in respect of the income of any individual the total of which from all sources exceeds one thousand five hundred pounds, and shall be so charged at the same rates as those at which it <Col N="177" /> is charged for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1931.</P>
    <P>(3)  That the several statutory and other provisions which were in force during the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1931, in relation to income tax and sur-tax shall, subject to the provisions of this Resolution in relation to sur-tax, have effect in relation to the income tax and sur-tax to be charged as aforesaid for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1932.</P>
    <P>(4)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this motion, but not in the way that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance would oppose it, because I am not opposing the imposition of any income tax, but I do not think that income tax should be imposed at the rate of 5/- in the £.  There are a great many reasons why income tax should not be raised to that rate here.  It is particularly undesirable that we should put up income tax to the British level if we are to maintain the corporation profits tax, as, apparently, it is the Minister's intention to maintain it.  Corporation profits tax is, in fact, an income tax levied on a limited number of firms, and the imposition of that tax, along with the 5/- tax, means that, in certain cases, there is a 7/- income tax and, in other cases, a 6/6 income tax.  If the corporation profits tax is to be at anything like these rates, I think it is necessary, in the interests of industrial development and economic progress here, that income tax should be kept, to the amount of the corporation profits tax, below the English rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister thinks that income tax is not passed on to the consumer at all.  There are arguments both ways.  There is the line of argument which would go to show that income tax is not passed on, but I doubt whether that particular argument has complete validity, and I think it is certain that, to some <Col N="178" /> extent at any rate, income tax is passed on and, by raising this income tax to an unduly high rate, you are raising the cost of living as well as stifling industrial enterprise.  A high rate of income tax would he less disadvantageous in an industrially developed country, but in a country like this, where there are not the accumulations of wealth that you have in other countries, and where there is not the industrial development, the imposition of this very high rate of tax on profits is something that gives, not merely immediate bad results but produces effects which are very long continued. It causes delays in the undertaking of new enterprises; it causes delays in the development of a spirit of industrial initiative, which are going to be injurious to the country for a very long time.</P>
    <P>There is another factor also to be considered in connection with the rate of income tax in a year like the present. There have been, during the last couple of years, very sharp declines in the yield on investments, and sharp declines in trading profits, and you have the position, therefore, where all sorts of income tax payers are living at present on less income than they had been living on up to a year or two ago.  You have the position where people who are income tax payers are not able either to save for future investments or to indulge in any sort of extravagant expenditure. You have in fact the position where all sorts of income tax payers are trying to lower their weekly and monthly expenses and to reduce their cost of living, and in those circumstances the Minister for Finance imposes an increase of 1/6 in the £.</P>
    <P>The effect of that is going to be, as another Deputy has indicated by an amendment which he has put down, the causing of a great deal of unemployment. You are going to cause unemployment amongst people who are engaged in domestic work of one sort or another.  That will inevitably happen, and it will happen on a fairly considerable scale.  Indoor servants will he discharged and people engaged in various other sorts of what I might call non-industrial or non-business employment <Col N="179" /> will also be discharged, and I think it is certain that the result of this sharp increase in income tax will be that a very considerable amount of unemployment will be caused, apart even from the unemployment arising directly from this increase in income tax at a time when incomes are falling. You will have unemployment caused through this taking away of purchasing power from the private individual.  People will be able to buy less in the shops, and by reason of the decline in trade, shop assistants will have to go, or have their wages reduced.  It will go further back than that, because there will be, in various cases, a decline in the demand for goods from factories here and, to some extent, you tend to neutralise the effect of tariffs that are put on.</P>
    <P>There is another reason, and a very important reason, why income tax should not be put up to the 5/- rate in this country, and it is, that we have here very large numbers of people whose main income is derived from investments outside this country, and whose income arising here is, perhaps, of such a nature that they are not bound to reside here.  There are people here whose income is entirely derived from investments outside this country, and you have others whose position is not exactly the same, but there is no doubt at all that the lower income tax in recent years has caused large numbers of people whose income arises from some other source, but who have some connection with this country, who have some sentimental tie with this country, to come and reside here and to spend the whole of the income here.  What the Minister is doing is, that by taking this 5/- he is losing, in many cases, 15/-.</P>
    <P>The lower income tax was partly designed for the purpose of inviting people, who had a certain association with this country, and who might have been living outside it, or who might have been inclined to go outside it to settle down and spend the whole of their income here.  When we talk about the £200,000,000 of investments that this country has abroad, we simply mean that people living here are <Col N="180" /> owners of investments totalling that sum, and if those people go out of this country, we lose whatever national title there is to that £200,000,000. The effect of putting income tax up in this way, coupled with the corporation profits tax, of putting it up to an extent that is absolutely ridiculous in this country, will be that people in very large numbers are going to be driven out, and they are going out. People have gone out already, and many other people have intimated their intention of going out, and the consequences will be that this Government which is talking so much about unemployment is going to cause unemployment in a great number of directions.</P>
    <P>We come to the final reason against it.  It is difficult for a person who has not access to all the official figures to come to any very firm conclusion, as to the amount of taxation that is necessary.  I am satisfied that, even on the Fianna Fáil scheme of expenditure, more taxation is being imposed than is necessary.  I do not know what the purpose of this overtaxation is.  I do not know whether it is for the purpose of embarking on schemes of expenditure for vote-catching purposes&mdash;schemes we have not heard of yet&mdash;or whether it is for the purpose of postponing an election for a year, and being able to precede that election by big remissions of taxation. Whatever the purpose is, I am satisfied that more taxation is being imposed than anything that we heard about expenditure would indicate as necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What item of expenditure would the Deputy cut out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about expenditure at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Expenditure is taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary does not understand what the Deputy is talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Parliamentary Secretary.  For some occult reason, there is taxation being imposed in the present Budget in excess of what the Government scheme of expenditure renders necessary. <Col N="181" /> I think, therefore, that the Dáil should decline to pass this particular motion.  If it were a motion for a 4/- income tax, perhaps the same argument could not be levied against it with equal force but, from the examination of the figures possible to me, I am clear that neither this increase in the income tax nor the 6d. in the lb. duty on tea is necessary under the present scheme of expenditure.  There are other increases which are equally unnecessary, though not unnecessary in the same sense, because to cut them out would involve a reduction of the expenditure foreshadowed by the Government.  So far as this particular item is concerned, I am satisfied that it is unnecessary to put the tax so high, that it is bad in the immediate interests of the country to put it so high and that it is going to do damage to the country and injure its economic prospects for a very long period.  It is the worst sort of cross-roads taxation.  It is an appeal to the man whose own income is much below the exemption level and who thinks that people richer than himself should be taxed and that no injury to himself or to the community will follow.  The Minister ought not to have that point of view.  The Minister ought to recognise that taxation on this scale &mdash;taxation in a very large number of cases of 6/6 in the £ and, in some cases, of 7/- in the £&mdash;is higher than a country like this can afford. The Minister ought to have faced up, and ought yet to face up, to the situation.  He ought to put no more taxation on now than is necessary in view of the expenditure that must be incurred this year.  He ought not, for the purpose of engaging in expenditure which we have not yet heard about or for the purpose of being able to manoeuvre for election purposes, put on now more taxation than is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the talk we heard in the first part of the Budget statement, the ridiculous suggestions of a deficit last year and the fantastic calculations about the weight of our national debt, were not indulged in by the <Col N="182" /> Minister without a purpose.  I do not believe that they were indulged in out of mere folly.  They were indulged in as a cover for this scheme of utterly excessive taxation&mdash;taxation that cannot be defended.  The Minister seizes on these pretences in order to impose this heavy burden.  He thinks perhaps that he will be able to get away with the plea that it is not his fault.  When, as will naturally happen after taxation has been imposed on an utterly excessive scale, it is clear that taxation can be reduced, he will be able to claim some credit for the reduction, having as far as he could avoided discredit for its imposition.  If the country were pretty well off, if we were not in the economic state we are in at the present time, manoeuvres of that sort might do no harm.  If there was prosperity, if prices were high and rising, a Minister might, if he chose to do that sort of thing, impose excessive taxation for some sort of electioneering purpose and not do great damage to the country.  But the present time is not a time when we can play about in that way with taxation and with the slender and diminished resources of taxpayers.  I hope that the House will defeat this motion&mdash;not that I am opposed to income tax at a reasonable rate.  I think that income tax is a fair tax and a good tax and a tax this country should have.  But I see no justification for imposing a 5/- income tax at the present time, with all the hardship and dislocation that it will bring and all the unemployment that will follow immediately in its train and continue for a long time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Blythe misunderstood me when I rose to ask him a question.  He apparently regarded it as a discourtesy.  It was intended to be a courtesy.  It was intended to help him to make a speech which would be effective.  Deputy Blythe is going to follow his usual practice of getting out of the House when he thinks by so doing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>

    <Col N="183" />
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>When he thinks, by so doing, he can get out of a difficulty.  On this Motion, Deputy Blythe has raised the general question.  He objected to increase of taxation on the ground that there is some subtle, vague and hidden motive behind it.  There is no motive whatever behind this Budget other than that of frankly and openly meeting the commitments that have got to be met.  Nobody in this House is more openly or more deliberately opposed to income taxation, as a regular expedient of government in this country, than I am.  Therefore, that point, so far as we two are concerned, drops.  I would speak much more strongly on the subject than even Deputy Blythe has spoken&mdash;and he has spoken strongly and said some very true things in relation to income taxation. But that does not get away from the difficulty.  When anyone in this House in relation to any one of these financial resolutions objects to taxation he has got to do one of three things.  He has got to say, to the extent to which that particular tax would produce revenue, that he is prepared to leave the Budget unbalanced. Or he has got to be prepared to say that, to the extent to which that particular tax would produce revenue, he is prepared to submit to us another tax which will produce equal revenue and which he regards as more desirable, or&mdash;if you like to use the term, the term we would all prefer to use&mdash; as &ldquo;less undesirable,&rdquo; in the present circumstances of the country.  Or he has got to indicate, on the expenditure side of the Budget, something that he is prepared to have removed.  One of those three things he must do if he is going to be honest in this matter.  So far as I know, we have added to the normal Budget nothing but the money which is to be found for a Bill which received its Second Reading unanimously last night.  So far as the other portions of the Budget are concerned, I submit them to the House in that spirit.  Let any man say what he is prepared to cut out of that expenditure for the taxation which he is prepared to refuse or let him tell us the tax he is prepared to put on instead of the tax he refuses or let <Col N="184" /> him tell us that, to the extent to which that tax would produce revenue, he thinks it is better for the State that the Budget this year should remain unbalanced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I might add another to the list of alternatives which the Parliamentary Secretary has just given. That is, to ask the people who promised that they would reduce taxation by £2,000,000 to bring forward their proposals for that reduction.  We are faced at the moment with a Government which got into power on the basis that it was to have less taxation, lower rates and better times for all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no time limit imposed and if Deputies had gone to the country with the statement that in some Budget in the future&mdash;before they would go to the country again&mdash; they would effect the economies which they promised, they would not be in the seats which they now occupy.</P>
      <P>The alternative is the one glossed over by the Parliamentary Secretary, People hold office in this country at present by this precise pledge to the electorate: £2,000,000 reduction in taxation, according to the advertisement; £3,000,000, according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce; and that under the further pledge, without hardship to the Civil Service. without impairing social services and without impairing the machinery of Government.  Have we got that?  There can be only one answer to that question. We have not.  That is the other alternative that has to be faced.  We are told this Budget is introduced in the interests of the unemployed.  It is against the employed, and there is no better witness to evidence that statement than the Parliamentary Secretary. Every particle of income tax demand and of sur-tax, according to him, is passed on.</P>

      <P>If there is too much taxation, it is going to limit what every man has to spend, in the useful way in which men spend it.  The only possible ground upon which a large amount of extra money can be taken from taxpayers would be in conditions which do not obtain here.  Have we many of the idle rich who have money locked up that is not irrigating industry, or even if it is so irrigating industry, is irrigating industry of a luxury type, and the transfer of which to the State would mean that the money was going to be flooded out again in industry, or in some type of work which was going to give employment of a useful type?  Have we that case made?  Has the case been made that the State is a better controller of the people's property and money than the people themselves?  Have we the case made that money, which is going to be taken from individuals for income tax and super-tax, is not being usefully spent for the benefit of people who otherwise would be unemployed in the conditions that hold at present? Have we any contention, even though the Budget is founded on a slavish imitation of what is happening in England, that conditions here are comparable to England? There is a big superstructure in England, and a load can be put upon industry in that country, if industry can afford it.  The same load in this country is only going to mean that that money is going to be spent in wasteful ways, certainly in comparison with the ways in which money is spent at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment there can be no contention that there is any number of idle rich in this country.  There can be very little contention that there is money in the country which is being used mainly for the benefit of luxury trades, which give little or no employment. There can be considerable contention, accurate contention, that people in this country at present are not so much in the enjoyment of great wealth, as that some of them happen to be the controllers of a certain amount of money which goes into business and filters back into that <Col N="186" /> business, and constantly through the year gives employment, and gives employment in the only way in which employment can be considered useful, in normal occupation.  Instead of that, the whole trend of the Budget, particularly in the first part, is to take money from people usefully employing money in industry, and putting it into what? Relief works, and if anything putting it into further subsidies to people about whom at present there can be no clamour raised that they are worse off than they were five years ago.  The cost of living having gone down, the old age pensioner is certainly in as good a position, without the Bill discussed last night, as he was five years ago.  Money is being taken for these people.  Money, we are told, is going to be taken for other purposes.  It is a whole jumble.  One does not know where money which comes from a particular source is going to go.  Money which should be spent by way of giving employment is to be spent on old age pensions and the making of roads. After the election I think the first appearance made by any member of the Government on any public platform was made by the present Minister for Justice, who accompanied the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  One of the sapient remarks of the Minister for Justice was that there was to be no question of employing the unemployed by building roads out of borrowed money.  That was his prophecy after the Government took over What do we find?  What is money being collected for?  What are the useful ways in which money is to be employed?  Old age pensions to people who, in comparison with the cost of living, are better off than they were five years ago, and the provision of roads, to some extent out of borrowed money, and to some extent out of money collected.</P>
    <P>Industry in this country is new. There is no great tradition of industry here.  It has been laborious work to get established a certain number of industries for the last ten years&mdash; it has been a difficult process.  One had to have conditions which would engender security.  One had to have a certain period of years in which <Col N="187" /> workers could be trained, and in which people who control money got to learn what the lucrative application of money meant, what the proper investment of money in Irish industry meant.  What is the situation that faces us in future?  That people who have put money into industry see themselves singled out for attack if the State finds itself in difficulties.</P>
    <P>That leads me to another point. Did the State find itself in difficulties? The State was in the position that last year the taxes were not yielding the revenue necessary to keep up the State on its old-time basis.  Then there is something to be said for sharing the burden round, if the economy campaign is really abandoned and the economies cannot be achieved.  But these are not the conditions with which we are faced.  The conditions are that new imposts are being added, new methods of expenditure are being sought, and in these conditions we have this very damaging burden put upon the backs of any such people who have been supplying industry in this country.  I said previously that we had a type of economy in the country; that it might not be the best; that it might require change.  It was going to be subjected to a process of change over a period by methods which enabled one either to slow down or to speed up, according as the primary producer was able to bear more or to bear less in the way of an extra burden.  These were the conditions. That economy does support, in some stage between luxury and abject poverty, three millions of people, minus those who found themselves out of work, and they are supported by the community in some state.</P>
    <P>This strikes at the foundation of the new part of the superstructure which was being added to the State. There is no encouragement to any man arising out of the Budget to put money into industry here.  He sees himself picked out, in the most casual and light-hearted fashion, as the person who is going to bring most into the State when money is being looked for, and that is being done, as I <Col N="188" /> say, through this sudden impost of three extra sixpences in the pound without any advertence to the fact that it hits at industry which employs people in the country.</P>
    <P>The alternative that I suggest the Government should adopt is to go back to their own speeches.  Let them read all they said about the necessity for economy, all they said about the ease with which economies could be adopted, the precise pledges about economies, and the amount which could be achieved.  The Minister for Finance said that it would require careful combing out and the Minister for Industry and Commerce said it required a certain amount of ruthless conduct.  Let us have the ruthlessness and the careful combing-out.  That is the alternative I suggest, instead of saying that it is the duty of the Opposition to direct the Government as to how they are to find money without being allowed to direct them as to the burdens which the Opposition do not consider to be essential at present.</P>

      <P>I think there is no necessity to remind any member in this <Col N="189" /> House of the depressing effect that income tax has on industry.  Those of us who have been some years in this House know that that particular fact has been stressed year after year when these financial resolutions came forward and again when the Finance Bill was before the Dáil. It has been stressed and agreed on all sides and I do not know that the depressing effect of taxation was ever more strongly stressed in this House than when the present Ministers occupied the Opposition Benches.  They were eloquent at all times on most subjects, but particularly eloquent on the depressing effects of high taxation. One of the most extraordinary things we find at the present moment is that these representatives who were so eloquent on these occasions, now when they come into power themselves make the burden infinitely heavier than ever their predecessors had thought of.</P>
      <P>To develop for a moment this question of the injurious effect of taxation on industry, the Minister is well aware that as soon as one increases the income tax, the first thing a man does is to look round to see where he can effect economies in order to meet this additional burden.  One of the first reductions he makes is probably in connection with household expenditure. The effect of that is that the business through which that expenditure filters, suffers.  When you multiply the amount of that reduction by the number of individuals in a city or town one can see that it has a very serious effect on the business of that particular city or town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine this question a little bit further.  We have in this community here, as will be found in most cities, three classes of people who will be very seriously affected by this particular tax.  First of all, as Deputy Blythe has stated, we have a number of people here living in some cases on small pensions and in other cases on investments which are yielding a reduced amount.  These people are compelled when they have to meet this additional tax further to reduce their expenditure.  Many of us know the unfortunate position of many of these people at the moment.  For a <Col N="190" /> considerable number it means practically what amounts to starvation.  A number of people have come to me and have complained over this taxation. They said to me: &ldquo;Can anything be done?  We have been only able to struggle in the past; there is no hope for us in the future.&rdquo;  There is a number of people in the country in that unfortunate condition at the moment.</P>
    <P>Take another class of persons badly hit at the moment.  That is the people who are known as middle-class people, who occupy positions of respectability with every nominal salaries.  There are quite a number of them in our city, and, as happens frequently, these people have large families.  These families have to be fed, clothed and educated.  The cost of living is bound to go up as a result of the policy of the Government.  The cost of clothing has gone up as a result of these increased tariffs, and so these people are hit from both sides.  They have to meet these additional expenses in bringing up their families.  On the other side they have to meet them out of reduced incomes, so these people are finding this burden an almost intolerable one in the circumstances in which they find themselves.</P>
    <P>Take another class, which unfortunately is a small class in this country, that is, the very well-to-do people, the people in our cities and towns who spend considerable sums. Some of them we know in parts of the country keep up large establishments and spend their money in employing a large number of workmen and servants about the place.  We could all quote instances of that.  What has been the result of this taxation?  We have heard that in some cases since the Budget was introduced that ten or fifteen hands have been discharged. We have known that in other cases wages have been cut down by ten, fifteen or twenty per cent.  If the Minister is anxious to get instances of this particular effect he will get instances in almost every town in the country.  That means additional unemployment, and as has been pointed out the object of the Ministry appears to be to find additional employment. <Col N="191" /> Could they adopt any policy that would have been more calculated to defeat the object which they had in view than this policy of increasing taxation?</P>
    <P>Of all the taxes which have been imposed that to which one can offer the strongest objection is, firstly, the increase in income tax.  As pointed out by Deputy Blythe, I think it is a most unfortunate thing that it should happen at this particular time when peoples' minds are unsettled.  We have already known of families who have left the country.  They have left the country the poorer because whatever they may have had is spent elsewhere instead of being spent in this country. One might also be permitted to refer to another form of taxation, while it does not arise in this particular Resolution, which is another serious burden&mdash;the corporation profits tax. We will discuss that however at a later period.  When you take these two taxes together in connection with industry, particularly the corporation profits tax, and consider its retrospective incidence, it is a very serious burden.  I would seriously urge that something might be done to lighten this burden in the interests of the country.</P>
    <P>I know that the particular industry with which I am connected has given employment to a very large number of workmen, not alone in our cities but throughout the country.  That particular industry is in a state of depression at the moment in which I have never known it to be for the last thirty years.  Unemployment is rampant and we have not felt as yet the full effects at all of this taxation.  I would impress, I would in fact implore, the Minister to try to do something to relieve the burden in order that the full effect of the unemployment which it undoubtedly causes may not be felt too keenly.  This question of income tax and its incidence has been stressed by one of the Parliamentary Secretaries in this House.  One was hopeful when the discussions were taking place in the Government that that particular influence would have borne more fruit than it has unfortunately with <Col N="192" /> the Minister for Finance.  While I would not go the whole way with that individual in his views I certainly say that of all the taxes there is none that is more likely to cause widespread unemployment than this heavy burden of income tax in connection with the various industries in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the increase in income tax by 1/6 in the £ were imposed purely for the purpose of increasing the social services of the State, I would not rise to oppose it.  If its sole object was to give more extended benefits to old age pensioners, to remove the difficulties of getting a pension, I would not oppose it.  I will give one instance of how this increase in income tax operates in regard to employment on the land.  I have in mind now cases in which a considerable amount of labour is employed on certain large holdings.  I know one man, an employer of 30 regular hands; he is a very good employer. The moment the Budget came out three of these men were given notice to leave and the remainder, who were paid at the rate of £2 6s. 6d. per fortnight, were reduced to £2 per fortnight.  That is an example of the direct effect of the increase in the income tax.</P>
      <P>Take the other side of the question. If income tax were increased without imposing any extra burden on the poor, without, by tariffs, increasing the cost of living, we could more or less justify it.  But here we have the case of 30 people in regular employment. Their numbers are reduced to 27 and the wages are reduced by the incidence of this increase in income tax.  These 27 labourers have their wages reduced by 6/6 per fortnight, and at the same time, by reason of the tariffs, they are going to find it far more difficult to balance their budgets each week.  Their wages are reduced 6/6 each fortnight, and the cost of living is going to go up at least by another 6/6 per fortnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister should reconsider this question of income tax.  If I had my choice I would press upon him to remove the tariffs.  This Government, however, is avowedly a tariff Government, a protectionist Government, as they call themselves&mdash;putting <Col N="193" /> on tariffs to protect industries that are non-existent and that, in the ordinary course of economics in this country, will never be a success.  I would prefer if the Minister said: &ldquo;We are going to recast the whole tariff system and allow the income tax to stand.&rdquo;  If he is not going to recast the tariff system I would ask him to bring the income tax down to what it was before he came into office.  It is not absolutely necessary for a new Government to change every headline left by its predecessor, but that seems to be the policy of the present Government.</P>
    <P>There are many things in the Budget which are excellent.  There is, for instance, the promise of a Housing Bill, and then we had the statement of the Vice-President in relation to housing. I hope the Bill will be on all fours with the statement that the Vice-President made in the House.  I hope there will be no snags in that Bill.  If it is going to be produced in accordance with the Vice-President's statement, it will be a very excellent thing for the country.  Special facilities are going to be given to farmers in rural areas to build houses.  Inducements are being held out to start utility societies in rural areas.  The farmers, by the tariffs, are going to be pared to the bone; so much so that, so far will it be from their minds to build new houses, they will instead be wondering how to make ends meet in the hovels in which they now exist.</P>
    <P>We are dealing particularly with income tax.  If the Minister cannot give us a promise, when we are dealing with the Financial Resolutions relating to tariffs, that he will recast at least some of them, then I would ask him to bring the income tax back to the old level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with Deputy O'Hanlon in asking the Minister to give some reconsideration to this tax.  I feel that although he approached the putting on of taxes with unconcealed joy, this particular tax gave him more joy than all the others.  I feel that any appeal to the Minister will be pretty useless. To any appeal of that kind, however much it may be based on past statements, and not very long past statements, <Col N="194" /> of the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary, I feel he will turn a deaf ear and that Deputy O'Hanlon is a little optimistic in thinking that the Minister will reconsider the disastrous effects a tax of this kind is going to have, not on the rich, but on the wealth of the country as a whole and on industry.</P>
      <P>It is very little comfort to the House and the country to know that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, and possibly the Fianna Fáil Party in general, have a lot of good maxims.  Of course, from what they once say they never withdraw; at least, so far as words are concerned.  It is very poor comfort to the country to know that and yet to find that the whole action of the Fianna Fáil Party runs quite counter to the maxims they preached and that, so far as one can judge from interruptions, they still hold strong and, if possible, more strongly than ever.  That divorce between preaching the doctrines that they profess and the actions they indulge in is quite characteristic, I am afraid, of the policy of the Government in this and in various other matters.</P>
      <P>This tax is quite characteristic of the whole Budget.  There are many things in the Budget that one will have to condemn.  We condemn, as I pointed out already when dealing with the Minister's Budget speech, the Budget itself, not merely on account of its details, but on account of its general tendency.  In this tax we see precisely the general tendency of the Budget clearly illustrated.  This Budget professes to be an effort to deal with, amongst other matters, the unemployment situation.  When you come to examine, not the general professions of sympathy with the unemployed, but the details of the Budget, you find that the Budget is calculated to cause a great deal more unemployment than it makes provision for employment, directly by the State or indirectly through the tariffs it is imposing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is particularly so in the case of the tax we are now discussing.  I am not objecting to this tax on the ground that a certain number of people have <Col N="195" /> a certain amount of their incomes taken from them.  I am objecting to it, as others have objected to it, and as the Parliamentary Secretary ought to be the first to object to it, because it is calculated to cause unemployment all over the country.  We know perfectly well there have been cases in which people have found it necessary to cut down their establishments. This is not a threat.  There is no use in losing one's temper with those people.  You do not get over the economic effects of bad economic action by losing your temper or abusing people.  People have had to cut down their establishments because of the action of the Government in interfering with their incomes.</P>
    <P>What I protest against in this tax and in the Budget is that indirectly it will cause a great deal more unemployment than it will make provision for employment.  We know from what has occurred and from the sheaf of amendments submitted to us to-day in the name of the Minister for Finance, that when representations are made to him by strong bodies, when people go before him and point out the bad effects of certain taxes so far as employment is concerned, he gives way, particularly if the people coming before him are strong enough or if the organisations they represent are strong enough.</P>
    <P>As I have asked already, who is to speak for the one person or the two or three persons that are thrown out of employment in different parts of the country as a result of this tax?  They are not organised, they are not vocal. They have no one to speak for them, and the only thing that is left to them, in the long run, is State employment or, as I have said, in one of the industries to a certain extent fostered by the State or ultimately perhaps, as is foreshadowed in some of the speeches by Ministers, controlled by the State.</P>
    <P>That is the prospect before this country.  The whole tendency of this tax, and I speak of it because it represents the whole tendency of the Budget, is to substitute State employment <Col N="196" /> for private employment.  It is on that score, and on that score particularly, that I object to it: to substitute less State employment for the more private employment that it gets rid of. That is bad.  I object to that on economic grounds, and I object to it altogether on other grounds.  The tendency is altogether too prevalent in modern times&mdash;we had it emphasised here in the space of the last couple of months&mdash;for the State to step in and take the place of private enterprise and of private individuals.  The Budget as well as the tax that we are now discussing is bound to increase that tendency, a tendency which can have nothing but a deleterious effect on the whole economic life of the country. It is a tendency that can only lead to the disappearance, as I have already indicated, of the ordinary employing class as distinct from those employers who have the benefit of tariffs.  The time chosen, with a full consciousness of what he is doing, by the Minister to introduce this tax is when there is a slump in investments from dividends. Already the private individual has his income seriously cut down as a result of the slump all over the world.  This is the time that the Minister for Finance comes and gives a last kick, so to speak, to those who still give a certain amount of employment by increasing this tax up to 5/- in the £.</P>
    <P>There are certain people, whom possibly it is unpopular to speak for in this House.  There are widows, for instance, with comparatively small sums got from investments.  They have certain commitments, and their position undoubtedly will be made extremely difficult.  For them very little sympathy will be forthcoming in this House.  After all, they live by investments, and therefore they are a prey for the Minister for Finance.  If people, merely because they get money from investments, are on that account to be regarded as very often in this House they are regarded, and denounced practically as public enemies, as people whose income is to be gradually nibbled away or cut away by large chunks, in the manner the Minister is now indulging in, what inducement is there for anybody to put money into industry in this country or <Col N="197" /> elsewhere, to save up and invest their money with a view to maintaining themselves and their families as a result of these savings?  Those who give the matter consideration must see that all that is bound to have a bad effect.  There is the two-fold policy, marching different ways, of the Fianna Fáil Party: on the one hand, trying to run industries by means of tariffs, and on the other, increasing income tax, whereas if the Government were sincere, clear-sighted and one-minded in the protection of industry, their tendency should be not to increase but, if possible, to reduce taxation as the Minister so readily and clearly pointed out in a speech that he made in this House as late as last November, as well as in various other speeches throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I have really nothing more to say except that it is quite clear that a tax of this kind will cause a great deal more unemployment.  It will certainly cause more distress than is likely to be relieved by some of the other provisions in the Budget with regard to employment on roads, etc.  As Deputy Blythe pointed out, one must have grave doubts as to whether it was necessary to raise the money that it was proposed to raise here in this particular year.  It is, of course, a question of estimating receipts.  We need not go into that, but certainly there is a doubt about it.  I object to this particular method of raising money.  I also object to it because I feel that it is portion of a very deliberate policy announced by the spokesmen of the Government, by more than one of them, practically speaking, to kill one particular class in the country, and that is the employing middle class.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the rate of income tax proposed in this Resolution were immutable and were to obtain in this country for ever, I would be entirely with the speaker who has just spoken.  But if, as I believe to be true, the rate of income tax is fixed at five shillings because we are in a period of considerable difficulty, because a wide social programme requires to be financed in order to meet the situation of a great emergency, and because the financial <Col N="198" /> condition of the whole world is as it is and has its repercussions in this country, the Minister for Finance here is obliged to meet the situation which he finds himself confronted with. He has to find the money to carry on the country during the next twelve months while we are consolidating our position, and, therefore, impose a rate of five shillings in the income tax.  I do not like it, but I conceive it to be my duty and the duty of everybody else upon whom the tax falls to tighten our belts, to make up our minds to do our best to pay this tax without dislocating employment or without doing anything calculated to aggravate the difficulties that confront the country.</P>
      <P>If I believed that it was the permanent policy of the Government to maintain income tax at the highest possible figure that they could possibly squeeze out of the people who are liable, then I would oppose this, because I know and they know that such a thing would be impossible.  It would mean that industry and employment in this country would virtually cease, except such industry and employment as was provided by the Government itself.  But if I have the assurance, as I believe I have, that the Fianna Fáil Government does not believe in piling on income tax simply for the purpose of blistering one section of the people, while deeply deploring the necessity for increasing it in the conditions that exist here, then I take courage because I believe that at the end of this year an attempt will be made not only to reduce income tax but every other imposition which is being made on the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is great force of course in the statement of Deputy McGilligan that it is not our business to instruct the Government how to make economies, but there is also great force in the Parliamentary Secretary's contention, while it may not be our business, if you propose to find fault with the way that we are going to raise revenue are you not going to propose any alternative?  If you cannot propose any alternative are we not legitimately entitled to assume that you do not know of any, that <Col N="199" /> with the position we are called on to face, there is, in fact, nothing but to do this thing, and I believe that the imposition of the 5/- income tax, while regrettable, if it is accompanied by an emphatic statement by the Minister for Finance, that the policy of his Government is to reduce taxation, and that their anxiety is to reduce income tax, super-tax and any other tax which directly hits those who provide employment and who help industry in the country, will not have the appalling consequences that Deputy Good, and the leaders of the Opposition, anticipate will flow from it.  I do believe, however, that if the impression got abroad that the policy of the Minister for Finance was to keep piling the burden on men of property in this country, what the leaders of the Opposition foresee would actually happen, and that is that people who foresaw nothing but a long chapter of impositions being put on them for their enterprise would simply pull up their stakes and clear out of the country. I know I would be forced to do it. I employ 50 people at the present time, and I will go on employing them, in the earnest belief that relief will come later on, but if I felt that every penny made was going to be taken in income tax, and in a steadily increasing income tax, every year, I would feel, as the leaders of the Opposition say that business men are now feeling, that there was no use in trying to carry on.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it, however.  I believe that I, in common with every other business man, am expected to make sacrifices and to submit to a period of difficulty in this year, in the confident anticipation that relief will come as soon as circumstances permit, and that, at no far distant date, and, in that belief, I believe that the vast majority of employers in this country will do their best to carry on.  It is no use disguising the fact that it will be a strain, but they will bear the strain and will carry on until relief is available.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with Deputy O'Hanlon that it would be far easier to defend this tax, as I am now defending <Col N="200" /> it, if we had not in the offing the second financial resolution.  When circumstances demand it, I think the people of this country, as well as the people in England, are prepared to face the music and to bear whatever burdens they are called on to bear, but there is nothing more disheartening than to be getting blows from the right and left, from behind you and in front of you.  If you can face the clear burden and make ready to bear it, well and good, but where you are faced with a tariff schedule which inevitably is going to raise the cost of living, in all sorts of unexpected ways, it introduces an element of uncertainty into your own personal budget for the future, and it makes the situation far more difficult.  I do not like the income tax but, under the circumstances, I can see why it is necessary to raise it at the present time.  I believe it will greatly mitigate the difficulties that people will suffer under that tax, if the Minister will take this opportunity of saying that it is the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government to reduce that tax, as it is also to reduce every other tax, at the very earliest possible moment, and to relieve the burden that that tax places on a certain section of the community.</P>
    <P>Somebody spoke of the pathetic feature&mdash;I think it was Deputy Good&mdash;of the family man, suffering heavily and trying to find income tax and to educate his children, clothe them and so forth, but it should be borne in mind, as it is only fair to do justice, that income tax, under this Budget, for the family man in modest circumstances, is lighter than it has ever been before in recent times.  It is one of the things that commends it to me, that people who would otherwise have suffered more severely, have secured from this Government a substantial measure of relief.  It doubles my income tax, which is not a pleasant experience, but if there be, in the offing, a prospect of a reduction in that tax, and a prospect of a declaration from the Minister that he is conscious of the severity of the burden, and that he is resolute to reduce it at the earliest possible moment, I believe that, onerous as this tax may be for the time being, the <Col N="201" /> people who have to pay it will willingly pay, when they know that the interests of the State demand it, and that they have every prospect of a reduction at an early date.</P>

      <P>I would like to address myself to this Resolution from a wholly different point of view, personally, from the point of view which the last speaker has taken up.  He spoke as one whom this Resolution would hit very hard and he supported the Resolution with certain reservations. I can afford&mdash;I suppose that is the proper phrase&mdash;as one whom it will not hit at all, to oppose it strongly. The Deputy who has just sat down is prepared to vote for this tax if he could have an assurance from the Minister for Finance that it is the policy and anxiety of the Minister, and his Government, to reduce this tax, and to reduce every other tax.  I think, on behalf of the Minister, I can give the Deputy that assurance at once.  It is the policy and the anxiety of this Government, and of every other Government when it is imposing taxation, to reduce it in the future.  It always is.</P>

Of that there can be no doubt whatever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>No shadow of doubt whatever.  We have been asked, on several occasions in this debate, to suggest alternatives if we oppose this tax.  I think, sir, that you yourself have already pointed out that to suggest alternative taxation on this Resolution would be out of order, and I <Col N="202" /> do not think we could do it.  If we could, we could discuss taxation on this Resolution until midnight.  The point I had in mind to make, before I heard Deputy Dillon speak at all, was, that it is the policy of this Government to fleece a particular type of citizen, and a particular type of taxpayer, and for a wholly political purpose and not for the good, either of the poor or the working classes.</P>
      <P>The keynote of the Budget is to be found in this Resolution, which increases income tax by three sixpences in the pound, and that keynote is, that you place the burden on the rich, that you fit the burden to the back&mdash;you can phrase it in a great many ways, each way more effective at a cross roads meeting.  I want to put it that it is a complete fallacy, from the economic point of view, and each one of us, in his own particular circle, and, more particularly, those of us who have the advantage of being intimately and closely acquainted with the working classes, know, and nobody knows better than we do, that no greater fallacy could be enunciated than that you can effect permanent improvement, particularly in this country, in the lot of the poor, in the lot of the working classes, by fleecing the rich, or the so-called rich.  You cannot do it, and I doubt if it can be done in any country. I am not setting up as an economist, but I doubt if even in a highly industrialised country like England, that particular theory can work out in practice to the benefit of the working classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country where there are no rich at all, practically speaking, the notion, no matter how effective it may be for vote-catching purposes, that you can arrange taxation so that you will get from the well-to-do, a fund out of which you can effect permanent improvement for the poor, is a false notion.  When it is put forward, it is put forward for the purpose of deluding the people, and for the purpose of catching votes, and not for the purpose, as Deputy Dillon has suggested, of reducing taxation ultimately, at all. The Minister's reference to this particular <Col N="203" /> tax in his Budget speech would go to show that that is his ideal.</P>
    <P>He spoke about allowing people to rub shoulders with the rich all the year round by making those with an income of £1,500 a year liable to sur-tax.  The fact is that the people who have incomes over, say, £1,000 a year, the people who will be hit by this particular tax, are the people who give employment, domestic or otherwise. They are the people who, in the main, support Irish manufactures in this State more than any other class.  They are the people who buy the type of clothes and keep the type of house which give a good type of employment. By placing upon them this particular burden and, as Deputy Dillon said, by placing it upon them in a time of economic stress, employment will not be increased but it will be reduced. That will be a reduction of employment of a very good type.  The people in possession of these incomes will be compelled, as Deputy Dillon said, to tighten their belts.  That tightening of their belts will have inevitable repercussions upon employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister, and the Party for whom he speaks, want the public to believe that there is in the possession of a certain class of people a fund that is not being used at all.  They want the public to believe that one can dip his hand into that fund any time he likes, that a benevolent Minister for Finance, in framing what he calls a poor man's Budget, can take out of that fund money which will help the poor.  I repeat that that is not the position.  That doctrine is quite wrong.  What the Minister is actually doing is: In a time of social stress, he is collaring for the State the money of people who are employing that money in natural channels and we do not know how he is going to spend it. If he does spend it, he will spend it in the manner which he thinks most suitable for the policy and anxiety of the Government.  The Government's policy and anxiety is to win an election and to do nothing else in particular.  I suggest that this imposition of 5/- income tax for the purpose, <Col N="204" /> as the Minister has said, of increasing social services is a deception of the people, a deception of the poor and the working classes, because it will not ultimately have the effect of increasing employment, but it will have the effect of decreasing employment and making social services more and more necessary.  For that reason, as one who is not affected at all by this tax, I intend to oppose the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few remarks on this motion, not because I am thinking of elections, but because I am thinking of the heads of households, who are the great majority of income tax payers.  I think Deputy Dillon, along with those who proposed this resolution and along with the Labour Party, who have supported it, completely fail to realise not only what the position of the householder is at the moment, but what it has been for the last eighteen years.  I ask Deputies what they know as to what has been happening to families in the Free State for the last eighteen years. Do they not know that war taxation has been going on for the whole of that time?  Do they not know that, year by year, the unfortunate head of a family has been asking himself can he hold out and can he make ends meet, and assuring himself that this year some relief will surely come?  Has he any margin left over when he has provided for the needs of his family, and met the heavy taxes he has been called upon to bear each year?  If you could get figures from the heads of families in this State, you would see, I think, that instead of their being an appreciable margin from which such a contribution as this might be made, instead of savings being added to year by year, there has been a mere hanging-on, so to speak, by the skin of the teeth by the great bulk of the income tax payers in this State.  It is not, as Deputy Dillon says, that they are being asked, at a single emergency, to pull in their belts now.  They have been doing it for years.  Since this enormous income tax was imposed in the time of the Great War, it has continued practically on a war level without intermission. Who would have dreamt <Col N="205" /> of a 3/- income tax being anything but a war tax prior to 1914?  Along with that, you have the knowledge that the cost of living has been higher all the time, and that in many cases very little corresponding increase in incomes or profits has taken place.  I think it is an incontrovertible fact that the number of people in the State who have been able to do more than make ends meet, and put aside a portion of their savings for future days is exceedingly small, and that this 5/- income tax, when they had been just managing, and no more than managing, on a 3/6 income tax, has come practically as a knock-out blow to thousands of families.  The country cannot stand it.  That is my convinced opinion. That is particularly so when you have another portion of the Budget, admittedly, tending to make the cost of living higher all round.</P>
      <P>There was another alternative to the list given by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, and added to by Deputy McGilligan.  I think it was that alternative that Deputy Blythe had in mind in his opening remarks.  That is, that you must consider when you are increasing a tax whether you are going to get from the increased tax a yield at all comparable with the damage which must flow from that increase of tax.  I use those latter words designedly.  I think it will be admitted that an increase of taxation in any country, but particularly in a country like this, must do harm.  I think it was Deputy Blythe's argument that the necessary consequence of this increase in the tax would be that the yield from it would be nothing like what might be expected from ordinary methods of calculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I honestly believe that the Government have been induced to put forward this taxation because they had their minds centred on unemployment.  I think their minds have been centred on that to such an extent that they have utterly failed to realise the need and necessity of maintaining in employment those who are at present employed.  I think it follows, of necessity, that this tax must increase unemployment.  It is not a case of choice on the part of the person who employs, it is sheer <Col N="206" /> necessity.  He has just been making ends meet with difficulty.  He is faced with this increase in the cost of living, and with this increase in income tax. If he is in any way prudent, he will suit his budget to the circumstances, not of wish but of necessity.  He will curtail the expenses of his household and the money he spends in giving employment.  That will be a widespread thing, producing effects the extent of which it is quite impossible to calculate at this moment, but which will be serious.  He will not do that of wish; he will be forced to spend less.  His spending less will mean a falling off in trade and a lessening of employment.  He can curtail his expenditure very simply in the giving of employment and in charity.  One of my great objections to this Budget is that it is cutting at the roots of what has been a most valuable thing in our Free State life.  That is, the desire of those who may be better off to help those who are poor. I know from experience that many who have been generous in that respect have been obliged to curtail seriously the help they were able to give to poorer fellow-citizens.  It is a matter of necessity. If you put a burden on a man who can just make ends meet, he must make his expenses less.  To an extent which we are not able to calculate at present, the effect of a tax like this, combined with the increased cost of living, is going to produce unemployment. You are going to employ a certain number and disemploy a number that you cannot estimate.  In doing so you are starting, have started I fear already, on what is the worst vicious circle on which you can start.  You are cutting at the roots of the efforts already made to mitigate unemployment by those who had a little money to spare, and who had done their best to mitigate it.  You are increasing their liabilities, and therefore causing more unemployment.  You are also cutting at the root of what was the very best way of meeting the unemployment difficulty, and that is through the steady expansion of businesses which have been steadily progressing in the past.  I ask you to consider how they have been progressing <Col N="207" /> They had a little margin of profit, and they put that margin year by year into an increasing business.  Now you are going to take away, by this heavy tax, to a very large extent, that margin of profit, and you are going to prevent the little business which has been doing very well from extending itself any further.  You are going to spend the money which would be very much better spent in each case by that business which has been on the upward grade.  I think it is difficult, perhaps impossible, for this House to estimate the amount of damage, of a very permanent character, which would come to this State by the imposition of this 5/- rate of income tax, even for one year.  It is coming as the apex of taxation which has been endured from year to year with the greatest difficulty by the great bulk of the people of this State.  It is coming to them as a regular knock-out blow in many cases, and, as has already been pointed out, many men have got to the state when they say: &ldquo;We cannot stand it, and whether we want to or not, we shall have to leave.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasPatrickDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not very conversant with the rules of the House.  I understand this is a motion dealing with the increase of income tax, but practically every Deputy who has spoken has referred in some way or other to the Budget and unemployment. I take it, therefore, that I am permitted to pass some remarks with regard to the Budget generally, as well as income tax.  If I might make a little personal reference, I should like to say that I am here under duress and, taking some words from Deputy Norton on the first or second day of the sitting of the Dáil, I shall say that I would leave without regret and I have no desire either for an early or late return. Deputies who have spoken with reference to income tax seem to think that they are paying income tax.  As a matter of fact the bulk of them are not&mdash;at all events people who are in trade.  I do not know into what categories taxpayers are divided, but I imagine the largest contributor to the Revenue Department, so far as income <Col N="208" /> tax is concerned, is the trader, but the trader simply is the assistant of the income tax inspector who collects the tax.  He puts it on to the price of his goods and endeavours, at all events, to see that he gets sufficient money to pay the tax.  I have no sympathy at all with people on the 5/- income tax. Naturally, when you do not expect it, it gives you a bit of a jar when you have to pay anything excessive.</P>
      <P>Dealing with the Budget and the position in this country, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that we would have to go back 700 or 800 years.  I shall give a quotation which I read in a book called &ldquo;The System of Land Tenure and Emigration in Ireland,&rdquo; published in 1867, and written or compiled by the late Lord Dufferin. I commend the quotation particularly to the attention of Deputy Morrissey, to the Executive Council, and particularly also to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The quotation is: &ldquo;From the time of Queen Elizabeth until within a few years of the Union the commercial confraternities of Great Britain never for a moment relaxed their relentless grasp on the trades of Ireland.  One by one, each of our nascent industries was either strangled at its birth or handed over, gagged and bound, to the jealous custody of the rival interest in England, until at last every fountain of wealth was hermetically sealed and even the traditions of commercial enterprise perished through desuetude.&rdquo;  We have Deputy Morrissey expecting that we are going to overcome that tradition, which has continued right down through the whole of these years, and particularly since 1846.  We have had the imposition in England of an economic policy which, while it may have benefited England up to a certain time, had a most damaging, even a devastating effect on the trade and commerce of this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that in the debates that have occurred in this House there has been a tremendous absence of any appreciation of the realities of the situation.  One would think that we were dealing with normal times and normal conditions, and that we had not to undergo, or had not undergone, <Col N="209" /> the state of affairs brought about by the older British confraternities in our trade and industry, and the losses which came into existence in 1845 and 1846; that this country had not been going down into a period of desolation and decay, particularly for the last century.</P>
    <P>Any member of the House, who is acquainted with the history of the country for the past 60 years, knows that the population has gone down by over a million since he was born and the mere fact that you had these people going out of the country meant that there was less business for the people who remained.  I shall perhaps come back to that again.  The Budget has been described by some Deputy as a revolutionary Budget, I think it was the Minister for Finance who so described it.  It was described by Deputy Mulcahy as a pre-revolution Budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>It is accepted by the Ministry for Industry and Commerce as such.  I am in perfect agreement with him in that.  The fact of the matter is that we have now since this Government has come into power, adopted a complete change in the state of affairs which brought about the condition of decay and dislocation of which I have spoken.  We have come round to what is practically a policy of endeavouring to be as self-contained as possible.  In order to foster industries we have to put on tariffs.  We have come round altogether to a new economic policy so far as this country is concerned.  It is the first time in 130 years or so that we have had an opportunity to do that and we certainly must expect to have some sort of trial to see how that policy is going to work out.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will please give me a moment.  The Deputy in his innocence put me a question as to the permissibility of reference to the Budget on the resolution which is now before us.  I deliberately refrained from replying as naturally I did not want to give sanction <Col N="210" /> to a departure from precedent or the usual rules of order.  The Budget has been referred to by previous speakers incidentally and perhaps at some length in certain instances.  As the Deputy is a new member I have refrained from pulling him up sooner, but he might now bring his references to the Budget into relation to income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasPatrickDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  With regard to income tax Deputy Dillon has referred to it and he has said that it is affecting him.  Of course it is affecting everybody who has an income over and above the modest sum required to keep a person alive.  So far as the 5/- income tax is concerned I think we are merely in the position of tax collectors with, of course, the assistance of the tax collectors in the inland revenue offices.  The tariffs contained in the Budget will have such an effect on the total revenue that one tax will ultimately more than nullify the other.  That is the expectation and the anticipation of the Minister for Finance.  Otherwise he would not have put on these tariffs to try to improve the position of the country.  If I may not say anything further in reference to the Budget I shall now sit down after saying that there is one justification for this taxation and that is that undoubtedly there was a deficiency on the estimated revenue from the old taxes.  In the circumstances the money must be found.  If the money cannot be found otherwise than by fresh taxation then I think the income tax is one of the fairest means of making up that deficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Dillon's theory is all right then the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Finance are all right.  It is very hard however to know how the farmer is going to do what he suggests. The income tax with which the country is faced to-day has been treated by members on this side of the House in each and every one of its aspects &mdash; industrial, individual and commercial and from practically every single angle from which income tax affects the general community.  At times the discussion tended towards classification and Deputies were all <Col N="211" /> agreed that so far as the excessively rich in this country were concerned, there was very little hardship in that direction and that the effect of income tax was really felt most by the ordinary member of the community in the country.  An air of gloom has passed into many households, not only in the suburban residences of cities, but in the ordinary households throughout the country wherever they may be.  Whether they be the few farmers who are paying income tax or whether they be residents in the towns the fact remains that that wonderful Chancellor of the Exchequer, the woman of the house, is at her wits end to know how she is going to contribute this extra impost which income tax will undoubtedly mean in balancing her home budget.  It affects country towns and villages where there are small organisations which hold collections for charitable purposes and for sports and for all those things that very often arise where hardship has fallen on some families and where one is called upon to contribute something. These small householders, who are the small income tax payers, are the people who contribute to an enormous extent without the rest of the country knowing anything about it to charities throughout the country.  If income tax is levied to a large extent these people who in the past made such extraordinarily generous attempts to help social services in the country will not be in a position to continue that help on the same liberal scale.  Their reduced purchasing power will also affect business in the shops of the various towns.  It will affect the whole standard of living inasmuch as they will have to curtail very considerably the family expenses.  I may say that I am as sincere on the unemployment question and in my desire to alleviate the condition of those on whom hardship falls in this country as Deputies opposite are, but I believe this legislation will not have that effect.  It may help to relieve some unemployment for a short period but its ultimate result will be to the detriment of the country and to increase the economic depression with which we <Col N="212" /> are faced to-day, whether it be in industry or in any department of activity that affects the life of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>After the statement made by Deputy Dowdall to the effect that income tax is passed on, I think this debate might very easily be brought to a close.  The Deputy made an admission such as was made some years ago when discussions connected with the policy of income tax were very popular, at any rate in the city of Cork and particularly in an organisation that Deputy Dowdall and I happened to belong to.  There is no question that business men pass on every form of tax.  Just as they pass on the tariffs, they pass on their income tax to the people who buy goods from them and pay for them; these people pay the tax ultimately. It is a very popular thing in this country, and perhaps also in other countries, to make the rich pay as much as ever can be got out of them. That would certainly be a just proposition if there were no very serious reactions.  The rich man is usually a spending man.  He gives very large employment and his employees also spend money.  If you put additional impositions upon a rich man his capacity to spend will be reduced to the extent of those impositions and even beyond them and you must take into consideration that the spending power of his employees will also be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The publication of the Budget, and especially the increase in income tax, has caused a very large number of employers to curtail employment. Some of those who were induced to come to this country by the prospect of reduced income tax and lower taxation are now thinking of leaving it.  Probably some people may say that is a good riddance, but the people employed by those persons, and who will be idle if they leave the country, will not say so.  In the case of officials upon whom the income tax levy will fall, it will be made an additional excuse, not alone for not reducing their salaries, but probably for increasing them.  There will certainly be a claim for the continuation <Col N="213" /> of the cost of living bonus.  There is also to be considered the reduced purchasing capacity of these people. It must be recognised that these people who spend largely, and also their employees, will have to bear a big share of the tariffs imposed. Those are facts which the Minister should bear in mind when proposing an imposition of this size.  Anything which reduces the wealth of this country or reduces the power of the citizens to spend money is undoubtedly going to hamper the ultimate success of the nation.</P>
    <P>There is a country where the advice given by one of the Ministers was to encourage the people to spend as much as ever they could.  Spending undoubtedly is one of the means whereby the wheels of commerce will be set going.  The thrifty man, while he is an advantage to himself, is not a great advantage to the people of the country because he is not spending money.  He is putting his money aside and probably the banks will get some good from it.  The man who spends money is much more useful to the country.  That is one of the reasons why workmen's wages are such an enormous value to any country; the workmen spend their money and the country benefits.  While employment is given money is spent and everybody gets the benefit of it.  A country without rich men or without men who give employment must be a very poor country indeed.</P>
    <P>I think we are wise in asking the Minister to reconsider the imposition of this tax.  I dare say there would have been a temptation to the last Minister for Finance to increase that tax if there were not serious reactions to be considered.  The wisdom of not having increased it must be apparent by reason of the fact that industries were started and wealthy men came to this country simply because of the superior advantages which we were able to offer them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneJOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are merely beating the wind in talking on this Resolution at all.  I am quite confident the Minister is not going to be influenced one way or the other. Several Deputies have spoken about <Col N="214" /> taxes being passed on.  The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that. Deputy Brasier said that all taxation, including income tax, was passed on. I regard that as a childish fallacy. How is a salaried man to pass on his income tax?  How is the farmer, the grocer, the person who sells eggs or the person who deals in ploughs or plough parts to pass on his income tax?  Income tax cannot be passed on. A tax on beer is passed on to the publican, but the publican cannot pass on his income tax.  Can he charge more than 6d. for a bottle of stout?  The same applies to every trade.  Income tax has to be borne by the merchant or the salaried man.  So far as income tax is concerned, we all know it stifles enterprise; it is a burden on industry; it gives no encouragement to the younger people of this nation to interest themselves in new enterprises. When this Resolution was before the House last week Deputy Davin made a speech which was certainly most uncalled for, and I think I should be given an opportunity of replying to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Davin said had relation to industry and industry has relation to income tax. Deputy Davin last week made reference to an industry in Edenderry.  He said £184,000 had been spent in wages and certain traders in Edenderry were not prepared to put a penny into that industry.  I want to tell Deputy Davin that these three traders paid as much as £107,612 in wages during the same period.  Deputy Davin, in the course of his statement, when he mentioned that these three traders would not put a penny into the industry, said that if that represented the mentality of the business men of to-day in so far as <Col N="215" /> industry is concerned, it was a poor look-out for the country.  I think it is no harm to mention the amount those particular traders paid in wages over the very same period.</P>
      <P>The increased income tax, coupled with statements such as that made by Deputy Davin, do not offer much encouragement to young men anxious to engage in industry.  We know there are several people who have money invested on the far side of the Channel and they derive incomes from their investments. These people will be very hard hit.  We realise that the Government will not have very much sympathy for them.  We recognise a good deal of the money coming here is invested in Irish industries and is used to give employment.  This tax, instead of being a help to unemployment, is making the unemployment policy of the Government rather like a tubercular policy.  If we keep on injecting serums like what is now suggested, that will not help unemployment. It will give a certain temporary relief, with which we must all be in agreement, but what we really want is something productive.  If the Government would look after our foreign markets instead of increasing income tax they would be doing far better for the country.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance stated that there were three things we should concern ourselves with in connection with this tax:&mdash; (1) that if we objected to it we should provide an alternative; (2) that we would have to make up our minds that we were going to balance the Budget, and (3) that we should submit information regarding the particular items in the nature of a reduction of expenditure which would save the amount.  I do not subscribe to the view that it is quite in order to discuss these three items on this particular Resolution.  The plight in which countries that have not balanced their Budgets have found themselves is much the same as the plight of the individuals who live beyond their means.  It spells disaster and <Col N="216" /> brings disaster in its train; it promotes unrest, causes a rise in unemployment, and has placed the majority of these States, in fact all of them who indulged in that particular orgy, in a very bad position financially, industrially and politically.  Nobody that I know of in this country has suggested that it was undesirable to balance our Budget. Everybody, I think, has subscribed to the proposition that the Budget should be balanced.  But just as important an item as balancing the Budget is the question: At what price and cost of expenditure is the Budget going to be balanced?  In that connection, one is faced at once with the necessity of raising a particular sum of money. This Budget has reached such a height of expenditure that the Minister has been forced to put a tax upon industry, upon the professions, and upon every phase of commerce and income in this country, a tax which, in our opinion, is beyond the capacity of the people to bear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the yield from income tax in this country amounted to about £4,600,000.  I believe that the yield from income tax in England was something like half the entire amount of the Budget.  It may be a one hundred million short of it, but at any rate it was in that neighbourhood.  The main point is, that the revenue in respect of that particular service is very dissimilar in the two countries.  It is fairly obvious from that, that we are not in a comparable position with regard to the British people in that respect. Still we are seeking to impose a tax here which has the same weight as the British, namely, 5/- in the £. As other speakers have said, there is, in addition to that tax here, another one which we will discuss later on.  It has all the evil influences and bad effects of income tax.  It has not even the single virtue that there is in the case of income tax, that is to say, that if a person has not an assessible income then relief is given.  It scarcely matters who it is that pays the income tax, whether it is the customer, the trader, or the manufacturer.  So far as the industry, commerce and business of the country is concerned, that sum of money is going to be arrested from <Col N="217" /> oiling the wheels of industry or helping the course of trade.  It is going to be taken from industry and commerce and other activities in the State.  It is going to be interrupted from State activities at a time when conditions in the world, and I should say now in this country, are by no means promising, when prices are falling, when dividends are falling, and when the value of stock is diminishing, when even the Minister himself is forced to admit that the total income is much lower than it was in 1927, '28, '29 or '30.  This certainly is not the time to increase expenditure, and in consequence to increase taxation.</P>
    <P>We have been witnessing, within the past twelve months, something that people never thought they would live to see, and that was the flight of capital from Great Britain.  What occasioned it?  High taxation and, to some extent, the impression that gained ground that the Budget was not balanced, but one certain conviction was before not alone the minds of the people of England but before the minds of all the financiers who were concerned with the security of their cash, and that was that they were living beyond their means.  That is the thing that we have got to consider here, whether or not this tax is going to put us in the position of living beyond our means.  Take this tax and three or four different classes in the community that it affects.  In the first place, there is industry.  It does not affect, no matter at what high price you put it, any foreign firms operating here or registered outside the country.  It affects our own citizens and residents subject to taxation here.  It affects business concerns here that are competing for trade in Great Britain and in other countries, and there are many of them. They are not confined to any particular class or commodity of manufacture.</P>
    <P>Within the last twelve months I had a deputation from a certain industry in this country.  They presented information to me that certain goods were going to be brought in here at a price with which they could not possibly compete.  Those at one end of the table concerned themselves with the importance of this new offensive on <Col N="218" /> their business, and when the whole case had been made with regard to that, then those at the other end of the table began to perform.  One man said that 25 per cent. of his trade was with Great Britain and he did not want that hurt.  Another man said 50 per cent. of his trade was with Great Britain and he wanted to be assured that in any steps that we took to correst this new offensive no inroads would be made on the export of his goods, while the third man said that 75 per cent. of his trade lay there.  What is the position of these three men or of all the other people who are exporting goods out of this country in connection with this 5-/ income tax?  For five years, until November last, they were competing with British manufacturers at an advantage to themselves of 2/- in the £.  How do they stand now?  Now they are on the level.  Are we industrially as well developed as they are in Great Britain? So far as our manufacturers and industrialists are concerned they are certainly now at a disadvantage in meeting competition on the other side. Further, we find that there are some firms in this country which have branch establishments in Great Britain.  What is the position of those firms at the moment?  I am aware that it would be out of order to discuss the corporation profits tax on this Resolution, but in essence these firms are competing at a disadvantage with their own branch establishments in Great Britain at the moment.  That is not good business. Some Deputy mentioned, a moment or two ago, that this Budget was correcting all the imperfections of the last 130 years, and that we are now getting to be a separate, self-contained, self-supporting entity.  Let us examine, for a moment, what the attractions are to business men, industrialists and manufacturers to come in here.  Leaving aside for the moment any levity there was in the speech of the Minister for Finance, in introducing these various proposals, the fact is that a steep rise has been occasioned, since the introduction of this measure, on industry and on manufacturers.  This steep rise occurs at a time when world depression was never more <Col N="219" /> pronounced.  What is the lesson to be learned by a manufacturer or an industrialist in connection with that matter?  It is this: &ldquo;By jove, if they have the courage to put on these taxes when things are bad, what will be their courage when things are good?&rdquo; That is the invitation that is issued now to all the various people who are involved in the enormous anticipated revenue of £910,000 from the tariffs that have been imposed.</P>
    <P>It was the policy of the late administration when they imposed tariffs to get employment here, and not to take revenue.  Revenue was not the main consideration.  Revenue was a consideration to this extent, that, if one particular line of taxation were removed, we were entitled to make what might be called governmental speculation on the success of the tariffed industry, but here in this present instance, industrialists and manufacturers are invited to come in with income tax at 5/- in the £.  It has been stated that people will have to reduce their establishments and contract their employment.  One business man I know in the City, who is identified with quite a number of public utility and other commercial activities, informed me this morning that one firm alone has definitely decided on a saving of £20,000.  How is it going to be done?  There is only one way to do it and no matter in what direction it is done the business of this City is going to be lessened by that £20,000.  Where is it going?  Into the pockets of the Treasury.  It is the same way with the smaller people, in no matter what walk of life.  This taxation is going to hit that much money which is going to be erased from whatever source into which it flowed before.  The various philantropic societies, charity organisations and other such people must suffer by reason of this big increase, and no possible explanations of our ultimate intentions to reduce this tax will satisfy people who intend, or who had intended, to invest money here.  It ought not to have come at this time, above all others, when, if the Ministry's <Col N="220" /> own pronouncements can be taken at their face value, they intended, and wished for an industrial expansion.</P>
    <P>Looking over the events of the last ten years, I find that there has been a steady increase in the sums of money coming in here from unemployment insurance and the persons in insurable occupations.  There has been a steady increase all along, and what other country is there that could show such a condition of affairs during these ten difficult years?  The number of people in this country engaged in gainful occupations is given somewhere about 1,300,000; and the number of unemployed, large and important as it is, is certainly not either as important, or a matter of such consideration to the Government or to the Parliament as that 1,300,000 people.  If the other nations of Europe, and America, had kept their concentrated attention on this one figure during the last ten years, you would not have the present depressed condition of affairs, and we are now invited to embark on practically the very same downward path, in these experimental arrangements, in order to give some improvement to the 80,000 people, losing sight of the fact that our main consideration ought to be the 1,300,000 people who are engaged in gainful occupations in this country.</P>
    <P>This ought not to be a matter of political debate at all.  It is a matter of business and ought to be dealt with on a business basis, and I would certainly say that the Ministry will get every assistance and co-operation in dealing with every and any economic problem, if they deal with it on purely business lines, apart from political considerations.</P>

      <P>I rise to reiterate what I said on the Budget debate in regard to this tax.  I wish to say that I would not perhaps have risen to speak on this were it not that the Minister did not consider it his duty, when replying to the Budget speeches, to deal with the matters that were raised in those speeches.  We were treated as if there was not, in these various speeches in criticism of the Budget, a solitary constructive suggestion.  I <Col N="221" /> think it is necessary for the House, in order to visualise the consequences of this tax, to envisage the entire Budget&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  We have the Government setting out to create an industrial arm.  That undoubtedly is its first policy and that involves a high tariff wall.  In addition, you have the 5/- income tax and you have the amount for assessment in respect of sur-tax reduced from £2,000 to £1,500, and the assessment sum in respect of corporation profits tax reduced from £10,000 to £5,000.  In what I have got to say I would like that entire picture to be kept in view. On the Budget debate, I protested against this tax, and I would protest against a 5/- income tax in this House while I am in it, irrespective of what Government imposed it, because I consider it to be a direct handicap to initiative and progress.  I would like to know from the Minister how he justifies any hope for the policy they have set out upon, of increasing income tax to 5/- in this Budget.  How, in the name of Providence, can it be suggested that the Government of this country is, by any act, going to develop industries in this country with a 5/- income tax, and with a corporation profits tax that does not exist, especially in our chief competing country in relation to industries, and by reducing the assessable amount from £10,000 to £5,000?  In my opinion, that is sheer folly, and so far as that part of the structure is concerned, this tax shows that the Budget itself is a sheer ramshackle, thrown - together arrangement, regardless of its results.  I submit earnestly and seriously that this tax is going to be a serious and permanent handicap to any industries that exist in this country, and that it will prevent the development, to any extent, of the other new industries which our high tariffs are designed to create.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with amazement to the repeated &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo; from the Parliamentary Secretary when some <Col N="222" /> Deputy suggested that all income tax is passed on.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this aspect, I desire to speak on behalf of the major number of income tax payers, who have been referred to by Deputy Professor Thrift as householders.  I heard it stated repeatedly from the Government Benches during the Budget debate that there was approximately £200,000,000 worth of Irish investments in Great Britain and that it was the policy of the Government to repatriate those investments.  Where do those investments come from and to whom do the dividends go?  As everyone knows, the dividends come to the individual householders, to the people known as the middle classes, the people who are referred to in this country as the wealthy classes but who are, in fact, the poor class.  Owing to their early training and discipline, they have been able to bear for the last ten or fifteen years this crushing, grinding burden of taxation.  They have got no recompense or reward. They are ground down, on the one hand, by the increased cost of labour and, on the other hand, by the increased demands of the Government. These people are the backbone of society in every State.  Into the houses of these people go, for all practical purposes, the fruits of this £200,000,000 alleged to be invested abroad.  The Parliamentary Secretary repeated &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo; whenever it was suggested that taxation was passed on to the consumer.  How could the Parliamentary Secretary contend that the tax on these dividends is passed on to the consumer? The suggestion is ridiculous.  I thought that such a fallacy would be so obvious that it would not be submitted to this House.  We have got to consider the effects of this tax on existing industries and on projected industries.  Let us consider the competition to obtain a share of the British market for our products as against the British manufacturer. What is the relative position of the parties?  As Deputy Cosgrave said, the tax in both countries is the same. But that is not the point.  The corporation profits tax has been abolished in Britain.  The British <Col N="223" /> industrialist is not assessed to sur-tax until he has earned £2,000 and he has to pay no corporation profits tax. Here, the corporation profits tax is 7½ per cent.  The Irish industrialist will pay 25 per cent. in income tax and 7½ per cent. corporation profits tax&mdash;that is 32½ per cent. to the Saorstát Eireann citizen as against 25 per cent. to the citizen of Great Britain.  Under those conditions, our people are asked to invest money in industry and capture the British markets!  The proposition is impossible. The worst aspect of this tax is that when it reaches a certain point it has a psychological effect on the community and kills initiative. Deputy Dowdall referred to business people being mere agents for the income tax collector.  That was quite a simple matter.  I understood that Deputy Dowdall was a business man. I do not know whether he is or not. Does not anybody with experience of business know that when taxation reaches a certain point the business man puts on the brake?  He says that there is no use in making money to go into the pocket of the tax collector. There, you have the brake applied to initiative.  When the citizen feels that he is paying a legitimate and fair tax, you have open and unfettered action.  When he finds that he is being crushed, he attempts with all his power to resist.  Deputy Dillon went to some trouble to direct attention to the benefits received under this Budget by the small income tax payer.  That was also extensively elaborated by the Minister. I am not particularly concerned about the logic of Deputy Dillon.  Earlier in his speech, he said that tariffs automatically increased the cost of living in a hundred and one ways which were not perceived.  If tariffs are going to increase the cost of living, is not that a tax on people with small incomes?  It is immaterial to the person of small income whether the tax be income tax or any species of tax, if it is a tax.  It is admitted that in a hundred and one ways which we cannot perceive at the moment tariffs will increase the cost of living.  Added to that, we have <Col N="224" /> 6d. per lb. on tea.  We are told that that has been taken off sugar.  But the middle classes are very small consumers of sugar and it is forgotten that a substantial tax remains on sugar all the time.  Here you have the person of small income hit by tariffs and the tax on tea as against the exemptions that are spoken about. There is no advantage at all to him. I submit that this is a tax that should not be increased, having regard to the policy of the Government to industrialise this country in so far as it is possible to do so.  It might have been different if the tax had been fixed at 4/-.  It may be said that there is not a great deal of difference between 4/- and 5/- but in a case like this there is an enormous difference.  It is the last straw that breaks the camel's back and this is one of the straws that will break the back of the middle classes and handicap and paralyse industry.  I am not going to be an alarmist with regard to the effects of this increase in minor and obscure ways.  But we do know that, already, very large numbers of people have lost their employment through this tax.  The wages of chauffeurs have been reduced.  If they were not prepared to accept the reduction, they were dismissed.  Maids who are receiving good wages have been dismissed.  Gardeners, who were also well-paid, are being dismissed. These people become a charge on the unemployment fund.  Assuming the best intentions on the part of the Government in what employment are they going to assimilate these people? It cannot be done.  They are incompetent for any other employment, except that for which they were specially trained.  I submit that this 5/- is a figure which the Government only had a shot at at the last moment, and I would ask the Minister to reconsider it and reduce it by at least 1/-.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the fact that there were three ways of dealing with any item in the Budget, if we wished to make an alteration.  Deputy McGilligan showed that there was a fourth way.  I wish to mention a fifth way, which, in my opinion, is the line <Col N="225" /> upon which the Government ought to proceed, namely, to reduce the cost of living.  If you look at the circumstances of this country you will find that we are mainly exporting agricultural produce.  While we would all like to see that position improved and altered, that is the situation we have to face.  That main article of our exports, namely, agricultural produce, has to be sold at the world price.  You can look on the farmer as a manufacturer. What really matters to him is that at the present time he is getting pre-war prices for his produce, and when he goes to buy anything he finds that he cannot get what he wants at pre-war prices.  What is to remedy that?  I suggest that a determined effort ought to have been made to reduce the cost of living.  If you look around the world, what have the nations done? Germany, for instance, knows all about inflation.  She passed through a period of inflation and saw the effects it produced. When she was faced with dire necessity, what did she do?  She saw that she was faced with exporting her manufactured products.  A parallel can be drawn between Germany exporting her manufactured products, and Ireland exporting her agricultural products.  They both have to be sold at the world price.  What did Germany do?  She reduced the cost of living right through the whole country. What are we faced with here?  I suggest that if some of the beneficiaries under the Budget were asked what they would like&mdash;if they do not see it at present they will see it before 12 months are over&mdash;they would say to the Minister: &ldquo;Give me as much as you can as quickly as you can, but do not take anything from me.&rdquo;  I suggest that in the Budget a number of beneficiaries have been given a number of things, but, on balance, they have had more taken from them than they have been given.  I suggest to the Government that in increasing the cost of living, as they are undoubtedly under this Budget, they are not going the right way about remedying conditions in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of giving way to anyone over there.  I was long enough at it.  We have heard so many amusing statements from the opposite Benches that it is about time we found out where we are exactly.  Deputy McMenamin has opposed every single item of taxation put on this year.  He wants no taxation at all.  Deputy Minch told us about the charity of the big people with money.  They give a crust of bread to the poor and put 10/- in the St. Vincent de Paul box at Christmas. That is good enough for those without employment.  We had Deputy Brasier complaining about the poor rich men, who have his sympathy.  Deputy Brasier also said that several of these people in his constituency were dismissing their employees.  I wish to reassure him on that point.  They have been.  I can guarantee that these employees will, in a very short time, be the owners of the land on which they were getting a very miserable pittance from such an individual for a long period.  He will no longer have 2,000 acres of land when he is going to dismiss the few whom he employed. We will see to that portion of it.  All sides of this House yesterday, with the exception of the die-hard Deputy Mulcahy, and his die-hard colleague, Deputy Good, welcomed the Old-Age Pensions Bill.  The alternative suggested by those on the opposite Benches to the taxation being imposed is that the old-age pensioners should go without their pensions and that we should have no new social services. They dared not go into the Division Lobby yesterday against the Old Age Pensions Bill and face their constituents afterwards, after what happened to them the last time they did it.  Under that measure, we are <Col N="227" /> finding £300,000 for the poor old people who have worked on the land for 70 years and who have no income to fall back upon.  It is only right that these people should get that, not as a measure of charity, but of justice, and that it should come from those who can afford to pay income tax.</P>
      <P>Then we give also this extra £250,000 for the relief of rates.  Where was that going to come from, if not from those who can afford it?  I consider that it is far better for those people to get a measure of rights and a measure of justice in this way than to be getting it from the St. Vincent de Paul Society or from the charitable people about whom Deputy Minch speaks.  I think it is far better that those people should be made to contribute in that way.  We heard all about the curtailment of industry and of employment and the terrible hardship that it is going to be on some industrialists here.  I know some of those industrialists.  I know industrialists in this country who had effected a veritable corner in one agricultural product and who have used the fact that they have been the only buyers of that agricultural product to reduce the price from 52/- to 14/6.  They reduced the price they paid the farmer from 52/- to 14/6.  They are paying 35 per cent. dividend on their shares and have not passed on any of the reduced costs to the consumer.  I know of these people and I think it is only right that these people should pay a little more in income tax and sur-tax.  We have them robbing the farmer and it is only right that we should take this share of their profits and pass it on to the farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole thing turns on this position&mdash;what is the alternative?  The alternative put up by the Opposition is to do away with social services, to give no grants for housing, no grants for unemployment, to give no pensions to the old age pensioners, to give no further relief in derating to the farmers.  That is the alternative offered by the Opposition.  Of the two alternatives I, at least, would stand for making those who are rich pay rather than starve out those who cannot <Col N="228" /> pay and give a measure of relief to the unfortunate poor people.  I am glad that the dice has turned, that we on the Government side are here to-day, that we are not afraid and that we are not dependent on the votes of the few Independents who kept the last Government in office for the last five or six years and to whom alone this small income tax was due.  We are no longer dependent on the Masonic votes and we are going to see that those who are rich are going to pay their share.</P>

      <P>After listening to the debate this afternoon we can understand the confused financial mind that is displayed in this Budget, when we consider that it is formed with Deputy Corry as an adviser representative of agricultural interests on the one side of the Minister and on the other side the Parliamentary Secretary and Deputy Dowdall representing would-be business interests.  The business interests who some years ago stood for no income tax told us this evening that they have no sympathy with people who are called on to pay 5/- income tax in the £.  I think when the Minister for Finance has much more experience of the effects of his proposals he will agree with Deputy O'Brien rather than with Deputy Dowdall as to where the incidence of income tax lies.  Deputy Dillon runs to accept a promise from the Minister for Finance that taxation will be reduced next year and that employment will be increased as a result of having to suffer high taxation this year.  He points out the excellence of the proposal by which relief is given to certain sections of the income tax paying community by some exemptions of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Cosgrave referred to the fact that the policy pursued by the late Government had increased employment and was able to build up a foundation of employment for our people in that particular way, the Minister looked rather askance, but if the Minister will turn to the figures that have been made available for him in the Statistical Abstract and if he will examine the figures brought under <Col N="229" /> his notice by Deputy Cosgrave in respect of the payments made for unemployment insurance he will see that from the year 1925-26 to 1929-30&mdash;the last year for which figures are available&mdash;the total number of people in insurable occupations had increased from 240,000 to 282,000 in these four years.  That is 40,000 additional persons were put into insurable occupations. The Minister shook his head at that and no doubt he will say that that was brought about by better compliance with the Unemployment Insurance Act and because of better supervision.  If he will look further down the Schedule he will see that the payments for unemployment insurance during these years were reduced from £662,000 to £453,000, a reduction of some £210,000 or of about one-third. Therefore, while the number of persons put into insurable occupations increased by one-sixth there was a reduction in the amount of the payments made on foot of unemployment insurance by one-third in the same period.  This was brought about in a period during which we had reduced income tax from 5/- to 4/- and then to 3/-.</P>
    <P>I submit to the Minister and to Deputy Dillon that the position that is revealed there of increased employment for a very large number of people and of reduced income tax for the people as a whole, gave very much more relief even to the section of the income tax-paying community that are being specially relieved by the Minister than the reliefs he is now giving in that narrow short-sighted way which Deputy Dillon approves.  A person who has some facility for understanding the policy enshrined by the Fianna Fáil Government in this income tax proposal, points out that it is an attack on the middle classes, and of course the middle classes have not many votes, which the lower classes have and that this policy cannot succeed.  This policy can succeed only by the destruction of the middle classes who are the employing classes practically at the present moment. They are the people upon whom income tax both on the trade side and on the ordinary side bears most <Col N="230" /> heavily.  They are the people who are the givers of employment in so far as anything like handicraft and that particular class of personal work in which the Fianna Fáil Party pretend to be particularly interested, are concerned. In so far as handicrafts in the clothing line, the furniture line, the boot-making line, the house decoration line or the type of handicraft endeavoured to be encouraged in the Gaeltacht, are concerned, it is the middle class who are the supporters of these crafts and who have kept these crafts alive in days when you had either poverty and no development on one side or mass production on the other.</P>
    <P>As Deputies have indicated, we have, no doubt, to suffer the imposition of these taxes because the Minister must pursue the line upon which he is driving, the line of providing employment through the State rather than by fostering employment through ordinary private employers.  Like lots of lessons the Minister and his colleagues have learned, they are bound to learn this too, that this tax is going to increase unemployment while at the same time creating greater expectations on the part of the least responsible sections of the community &mdash;greater expectations of employment from a State which cannot provide them with that employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As I sat listening to this debate I wondered if income tax was an innovation in this Budget.  It seemed to me that part of the arguments adduced against the increased tax could only have been based upon the supposition that we never had income tax here before.  We are told about the evil effects of the tax.  I do not deny that, with certain qualifications, except where taxation is necessary to provide essential services, taxation is an evil, and that any Government and any wise Minister for Finance would be much better off if they were to allow incomes on property and the incomes of individual citizens to remain in individual hands, and to fructify only for the use and benefit of the community as a whole.  Undoubtedly when the tax-gatherer visits the household the process of collecting the taxes must <Col N="231" /> be accompanied by a certain economic loss.  For that reason, when we did come to consider the whole Budget structure one of the things to which we gave the most careful consideration was whether we could, in any possible circumstances, avoid increasing income tax or imposing an increase in any one of those taxes which are generally classified as property taxes.</P>
      <P>We could not consider that proposition <i>in vacuo</i> as if we were living in some ideal Utopia where there was no expenditure to be met, and no deficiency to be made up.  We had to relate the Budget to the circumstances in which we found ourselves.  Within that Budget, and on the estimates of income and expenditure which we had prepared, and which we had carefully checked and examined, we had to find in some one way or another at least £3,500,000.  The question, therefore, was whether we were to find it by what I will classify as direct or property tax, or by indirect taxation.  I am not going to accept the proposition that the whole of the burden of income tax is passed on, just as I would not for one moment attempt to contend that none of it is passed on.</P>
      <P>There must be, in all these tax matters, a certain fluidity of movement. You put the tax on in the first instance, but it is a series of consequential incidences after that.  The shop-keeper will undoubtedly endeavour in so far as competitive conditions allow him, to make provision in the current year for the income tax assessed on last year's income.  I admit that, but, in its first instance, and for a period of time at any rate, the income tax confines itself to the individual upon whom it is first imposed. That is possibly the great justification for imposing it, because it is the one tax that can be regulated to the resources of the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not matter whether a man is poor or rich, he pays the same price for his sugar and possibly the same price for his milk, and therefore, to that extent, indirect taxes are inequitable. They do not fit the burden to the back, and one of the justifications for an increase in the income tax rate <Col N="232" /> is that it does to some extent do that. It does it, in so far as the limits of human ingenuity can ensure that that will be done.</P>
    <P>As to whether it was necessary to increase the tax to 5/-, that increase is going to bring us in £1,000,000 a year.  It has been said that it is going to decrease purchasing power.  It is said we are taking away the purchasing power of individuals.  To some extent that may be true, but we are taking the purchasing power of individuals away in one limited section in order that we may maintain the purchasing power of a much wider section. If we did not increase the income tax to find the extra million, there is one thing which we could have done, one thing which has been suggested and hinted at from the opposite benches, one thing which those now in opposition would have done had they been the Government.  That would have been to reduce the old age pensions. In order to find £1,000,000 by a reduction of the old age pensions it would be necessary, I believe, to have reduced pensions all round by a sum of four shillings per week.  That would have been accompanied by a considerable decrease in purchasing power.</P>

      <P>It has been customary to take Votes 10 and 11 together because they are practically the same.  There is a reduction in Vote No. 10 of about £1,300 on a total of £95,000, and a reduction of about £100,000 on the Vote for public works and buildings.  This reduction is very largely accounted for by the practical completion of all the big works in Dublin; the Four Courts and the rest.  I do not know that there is anything more to be said on that.  There is just one other matter: that a certain portion of the total reduction in Vote No. 11 which is under new works, alterations and additions which have been reduced from £385,000 to £284,000 is due to the putting off of the doing of certain works, all of which are regarded as desirable as and when the opportunity is available.  Token votes are taken for these, so that these matters can be raised as desired.</P>

      <P>I wish to direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to a grievance that local bodies have in connection with the hiring of dredgers.  Under the Department crews are insured, but when a local body hires a dredger they have to take out an insurance on the crew for thirty days.  In the case of Wicklow, for instance, if the local body hires a dredger it may only require it for seven days, but it has to take out an insurance on the whole crew for thirty days.  The dredger goes on to Arklow, say, in the following week.  The local board there has to do what has been done in Wicklow, and the same course is followed if the dredger goes on to Wexford.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that some method should be adopted of insuring the crew during the whole of the period that they are operating in outside centres and charge the local boards a reasonable sum.  It is hardly fair to local boards to have this duplication of insurance of the crew by a number of public bodies.</P>

      <P>Referring to what Deputy Brasier has said, I am aware that the Office of Public Works is in possession of various plots, suitable building plots, which they could most usefully let or dispose of if the Government is serious in its views about reducing unemployment.  If these plots are disposed of, private capital will come to the assistance of the Office of Public Works, and moneys will be expended without any cost to the ratepayers. Work of that kind would add not only to the beauty of many districts, but would help to reduce unemployment.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into that matter.  It is quite true that the Department have some sites which they cannot so easily get rid of: sites held on short leases.  These sites, for that reason as well as for others, are unsuited for building purposes unless negotiations can be carried out with the owners in fee.  There are legal difficulties I know to be got rid of, but there are some sites which have been purchased by the Commissioners of Public Works themselves since the Treaty was passed, and there can be no difficulty in getting rid of them either on lease or by sale.  I would urge on the Parliamentary Secretary to look into these cases and either turn these plots into money with as little delay as possible, or as an alternative, lease them on a building lease and procure much-needed employment in various districts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to a practice which prevails, in so far as his Department is concerned, of permitting contractors to ignore the fair wages clause.  I do not know whether it is the intention of the Board of Works to insist, for the future, that where a contract is entered into between that Department and a contractor, for the building of a school or a barrack, or anything of that sort, a living wage shall be paid to the workers employed by the contractors.  I have in mind a case in which a contractor was brought from, I think, Co. Leitrim, into Co. Wexford, within the last twelve months.  He was competing with local contractors, and, in one case, a local contractor was a few pounds less than the man brought in.  Notwithstanding the fact that the local contractor was prepared to pay the standard rate of wages, as agreed on between the contractor and the trade unions concerned, the other contractor was given the job, and I have since found out that he is paying a wage altogether less than the wage which prevails in the district, and which the other contractor was prepared to pay.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that that is a procedure which ought not to be tolerated so far as his Department is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would look to this Government at any rate to try to secure that, for the future, when a contract is being entered into a living wage will be paid to the workers employed by the particular contractor.  It is certainly detrimental to the best interests, not alone of the workers, but of the contractors in the various areas of the State.  It will be quite easy to secure contractors of that kind from any part of the country, I am sure, but it is not fair to the worker or contractors in one district that people should be imported into their area to do the work that should in all fairness be given to them, and I would ask the Parliamentary <Col N="238" /> Secretary to secure that this does not occur in the future.</P>

The necessary surveys, and so forth, have been taken, but nothing has been done up to the present.  Last year, that river flooded the church at Crossboyne, and several persons had to leave their houses owing to the floods, which rendered the road between Claremorris and Ballinrobe impassable. The Minister for Industry and Commerce was down there and saw the condition of affairs then, and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give the matter his attention as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>With regard to the matter raised by Deputy Everett as to dredging, I believe that the Board of Works is in possession of very efficient machinery, in the form of dredgers, particularly for use in tidal harbours.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he might revise the charges made to local bodies for the hire of these dredgers. There are many small harbours around the coast that are very sadly in need of dredging, to enable the ordinary trade of these little ports to be carried on, but their revenue is not sufficient to warrant getting a dredger of their own or hiring an independent dredger.  I would submit to the Parliamentary Secretary that matters of this kind should be made a national charge, rather than a charge on the small, and necessarily restricted, revenues of these harbours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to touch on the question of the old drainage boards, but it is exceedingly difficult to get the old drainage boards under any heading.  I am informed, however, that the drainage boards under the Drainage Acts of 1846 and, I think, 1863, have a kind of general persuasive supervision at the hands of the Board of Works, but they are in the anomalous and peculiar position that they do not seem to be absolutely controlled by any Government Department. The only Government Department <Col N="239" /> that has a connection with them is the Board of Works, and while I am not free to suggest that there should be legislation to bring them directly under the control of the Board of Works, I want to suggest, by implication, that something more drastic should be done than is at present being done.  The suggestion I have to make to the Parliamentary Secretary is, that he should exercise his powers of persuasion more emphatically, and more frequently, than has hitherto been done.  I believe he will find on investigation that many of these Boards are doing their best to discharge the work, but it is so long since their terms of reference were settled that many of them have really lost all cognisance of what their duties are, and they are not in a position to check up on their own gangers or contractors as to what is the minimum that should be done, and, while suggesting no new legislation, all I can say is, that if the Parliamentary Secretary should find his powers of persuasion failing, he should look around him for some additional weapon to fortify his own persuasive powers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will, in the course of the coming year, be able to increase the activities of his Departments with regard to the rebuilding of police barracks.  Very little has been done for the last few years, although very large sums have been voted, and he will notice from the Estimates that very little money was expended last year although large sums were voted. I do not know, of course, what the policy of the Government will be with regard to the number of Gardá barracks in the country districts.  They may have a change of policy which will render unnecessary the rebuilding of a number of these barracks, but I think that some effort should be made to see that the Gárda are properly housed.  I have raised the question of the town of Gorey on the Estimates for the last seven years, I think, and nothing has been done.  It is a big expenditure, undoubtedly, and I think that, at one time, the Minister <Col N="240" /> for Finance objected, because it was an expenditure for which it was not suitable to borrow.  I think, however, that was a pessimistic attitude, based on a view that we were going to have a revolution every year and that these premises would be burned down.  At any rate, I think an effort should be made to provide proper accommodation for the Gárda.</P>
      <P>I suppose it is useless for me&mdash;although under the new administration. I hope it is not&mdash;to raise the question of the improvement of the surroundings of Leinster House.  I have raised this matter with two predecessors of the present Secretary.</P>

In this year, particularly, it is very unsuitable that this Oriental potentate, first Empress of India, should be displayed in front of our legislative assembly, and particularly, in view of the situation in India to-day, and certainly, if the Parliamentary Secretary wished to have a monument, he could have no better monument than the removal of that one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few things to which I would like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary on this Estimate.  They come under three headings, military barracks, the Rampart River drainage scheme and the Glyde Drainage Scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the military barracks, I understand that Dundalk Urban Council has made application to the Board of Works to have the barracks handed over to them for housing purposes.  The Minister for Defence, in a letter read at a meeting <Col N="241" /> of the Council about a month ago, stated that his Department had handed over the barracks to the Department of Public Works.  A letter was sent on 14th of last month to that Department and no reply has yet been received to it.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to say if, in the immediate future, he can come to a definite decision as to the ultimate disposal of the military barracks.  At present the Urban Council, of which I am a member, is proposing to erect 80 or 90 houses in the middle and south end of the town.  The barracks are located in a part of the town in which very few houses have been built for the past 20 years.  They consist of married quarters and some very fine blocks which could, at very little cost, be turned into nice, little, self-contained dwellings for the people of that area.  I may state, for the information of the Parliamentary Secretary, that there has been recently established in that area a very successful boot factory.  Many of the skilled workers in that factory have come from England.  They find it very difficult to secure housing accommodation. Most of them are married men.  It is generally agreed by the members of the Council and by the townspeople that the barracks would be an ideal spot in which to house people of that type.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will see his way to have these barracks handed over to the Urban Council.</P>
    <P>The question of the drainage of the Rampart River is in the same position as the question to which Deputy Dillon referred, but it is so long since the question of the drainage of this river was introduced that the terms of reference have been quite forgotten.  I understand that at the inquiry held certain objections were put forward by, amongst others, the surveyor attached to the Urban Council.  Largely as a result of his evidence, I think, the Board of Works were somewhat dubious about proceeding with the scheme they had outlined.  Certain engineering difficulties presented themselves, and a question also arose as to the effect which the proposed deepending of the river would have on the sewer known as the Rampart River sewer.  I understand <Col N="242" /> that an alternative scheme was put up by the Board of Works, and two months ago a new survey was made of the river.  At present, we are waiting for the report of the engineer who made that survey.  The flooding of this river has caused great damage to property adjacent to the river and also to sewers.  It is a great annoyance and a danger to the health of a large section of the people who live adjacent to the river.  Many houses have been flooded during the abnormal rainfalls. There was also the question of the working of the Cambrieville Brewery as affected by the flooding.  In company with the manager, I inspected the damage done to the brewery by the continuous overflowing of the river. Unless it is checked, I am afraid that it will have a very serious effect on the future of the business run in connection with the brewery.  I should like if the Parliamentary Secretary would look into the correspondence and come to some definite decision in connection with this river.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the River Glyde, which, so far as I know, also presents great engineering difficulty. There, again, an inspection was made quite recently by one of the Board of Works engineers, Mr. O'Flynn.  I am not in a position to state whether or not he has yet made a report.  The Parliamentary Secretary is, I am sure, aware that the flooding of this river caused enormous damage to the crops last year in Tully area. That was, again, due to abnormal flooding, but this flooding is becoming too frequent.  Last year, I think, the river overflowed its banks on three occasions and many of the farmers had to re-sow their crops.  It is suggested that the original scheme was, more or less, responsible for this flooding, that the cleaning of the upper reaches of the river caused the water to flow down so quickly that it was not able to get away from this area, which serves as a sort of basin, with sufficient speed.  It was with a view to relieving that flooding that the inspection was recently made.  I should like that the Parliamentary Secretary would intimate to Louth County Council when the report of the engineer will be available.  I <Col N="243" /> understand that it is not the intention, at the moment, of the Board of Works to let the County Council have that report. They are anxious to have it, because they think they may be able to give some valuable information as to the real causes of this flooding.  Those are the three things to which I would like to call attention&mdash;(1) the military barracks, (2) the Rampart River, and (3) the Glyde River.  Those three things are of very great importance to the interests concerned, and I hope to have a statement from the Parliamentary Secretary with regard to them.</P>

      <P>On the Post Office Estimate, I raised the question of the rebuilding of a central sorting and postmen's office in Dublin.  I was assured by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that something tangible in that connection would be done this year.  As I understand the work will be carried out through the agency of the Board of Works, I shall be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary will say what is doing in that connection, when the contract will be placed and when the work will be undertaken. The provision of a new office of the kind mentioned is absolutely essential to the smooth and efficient distribution of mail traffic in Dublin.  An early decision to proceed with the erection of the new office would do a good deal to provide employment in Dublin in skilled and unskilled trades in which there is at present a considerable amount of unemployment.  There is another matter which I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to take note of.  I do not think he will be able to give me any information to-day.  In the southern portion of Kildare, which is in the area of the drainage of the river Barrow, there is a river called the Greise, which causes a considerable amount of flooding in a district where unemployment is extremely bad at present.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into that matter with a view to seeing whether it is possible to undertake the drainage of this river in conjunction with the drainage of the Barrow.  If he would do that it might be possible to have <Col N="244" /> the work carried out comprehensively over the whole area, and the provision of work in the drainage of that river would provide employment in an area which is particularly badly hit by long-continued unemployment.</P>

      <P>There are two matters to which I wish to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary, and to which I am sure he will give a satisfactory reply.  The first is in connection with a matter somewhat similar to that which Deputy Norton spoke of.  It is the necessity for the immediate erection of a post office and telephone exchange at Rathmines. I can understand that the matter is not entirely one for the Parliamentary Secretary, because I addressed a question to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs a few weeks ago, and he told me that everything was in train and it was only a question of tenders being sought at an early date.  Deputy Good intervened after the answer, and said that the Minister's predecessor had given a similar answer 12 months ago.  I should like if the Parliamentary Secretary would tell us if anything definite has been done.  The particular want is not one which the Parliamentary Secretary deals with, but I should like to hear from his point of view what is the possibility of an early start, especially as now, with the desire to reduce unemployment in Rathmines and surrounding areas, an excellent opportunity would be afforded, if the work were started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter is a very small one, but it is a serious one.  It arises out of an answer given by the Parliamentary Secretary on 21st April last, as reported in column 332 of the Official Reports.  The Minister for Finance was asked, &ldquo;If it is a fact that residential quarters are being provided in Government buildings for the President of the Executive Council, and, if so, if he will state (a) what is the estimated cost of the necessary adaptation and furnishing; (b) the number and salaries of the staff who will be employed there, and the estimated cost of maintenance.&rdquo;  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister replied: &ldquo;The quarters provided <Col N="245" /> are a reception room for visitors, and a study for the President which can be used as an occasional bedroom, and a similar room for the President's aide-de-camp. The total cost of adapting and furnishing these bed-sittingrooms is £110.  No extra staff will be employed, nor will there be any increase in cost of maintenance.&rdquo;  I do not suggest that there should be any diminution of the facilities afforded to the President of the Executive Council in receiving visitors from at home or abroad, but during the term of office of the late Government, the then Opposition availed of every opportunity to sneer in the House and to jeer in public, at what I call the dignity which should be attached to the office of President.</P>

      <P>I do not want to raise anything which is out of order. Perhaps, when I put the question you will see that it is <i>apropos.</i>  From the question and answer, it is quite apparent that there is provided for the President two public rooms which were not available to the late President and which were not sought for by him.  I take it that the cost of these and the upkeep of them will be on the Vote of the Office of Public Works.  I understand that there is what is called a &ldquo;let-down&rdquo; bed.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell me if any bachelor Deputy were seeking a flat from the Office of Public Works what rental they would want for a flat consisting of two rooms, a study to receive visitors with an occasional bed in it, plus another room similarly furnished?  I raise this because the reply given on that occasion did not say what it has cost.  I invite the Parliamentary Secretary to say at what rental he would be prepared to let a flat in Merrion Street consisting of two rooms sumptuously furnished?</P>

      <P>I am sure it would be well done.  I should like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary what the Office of Public Works would be prepared to accept from any business firm or professional man for a suite of rooms in that particular place. Having asked that question, I want to say that it is in order, because there is no doubt that these rooms have to be kept.  They are the property of the Office of Public Works, and have to be maintained.  I take it they are carpeted, or possibly they are not, in view of the &ldquo;hair-shirt&rdquo; policy here. I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary for what he would furnish a similar suite for some bachelor Deputy in exactly the same style, not in the same place, but in an equally suitable position in the City of Dublin?  There is no doubt that a good deal of, I do not want to say dishonest, but I will say, unfortunate propaganda was made out of the expenditure which the ex-President of the Executive Council undertook in the matter of entertaining visitors here. If he did entertain them he did not entertain them at the expense of the people of this country and at the expense of having a special suite of rooms in Government Buildings and a special let-down bed.</P>

The Minister for Education in correcting me asked when did the late President pay for everything. I do not want to give details, but the new Government has in its desire to help employment suppressed the use of the one article of head apparel which we can wear at functions and which is made in Ireland&mdash;the tall hat.

      <P>There are a few points which I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to answer.  The first point has reference to the disused military barracks in Cavan.  I understand that negotiations have been going on with the Ministry of Defence for the acquisition of these barracks for building sites.  As in the Dundalk case, the Cavan barracks have been handed over to the Board of Works.  Now that we are going to have a Housing Bill, I think that some steps should be taken by the Board of Works to give these barracks over to the Urban Council at whatever figure would be arranged.  The difficulty which the Urban Council in Cavan has in dealing with the housing question arises out of the formation of the ground around <Col N="249" /> the town.  It is very difficult to get proper building sites.  A very large space is occupied by the disused barracks and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take the matter up at once and try to get the barracks handed over to the Council.</P>
      <P>I should also like to have from the Parliamentary Secretary a statement of policy with regard to drainage.  If it is the intention of the Government, as I believe it is, to do their best to give productive employment to 80,000 unemployed people, I think the Parliamentary Secretary will find in his office sufficient drainage schemes lying there for the past six or seven, or perhaps ten, years that would absorb the 80,000 people in employment at once.  I could spend an hour speaking about schemes that are in County Cavan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going into the question of spending.  The Parliamentary Secretary can deal with the question of policy afterwards.  We should like to know in Cavan whether it is the intention of the Government to devote any money at all to the drainage of the water-logged land in Cavan.  I should also like to know, hinging on the minor schemes in Cavan, whether the present Government have taken up the question of the Lough Erne drainage with the Government of Northern Ireland. Many minor schemes were held up by the late Government for the reason that they depended on the larger scheme of the drainage of Lough Erne.  I have reason to believe&mdash;it is my opinion whether I am justified in it or not&mdash;that the late Government and the Government of Northern Ireland adopted a go-slow policy and that they were in perfect agreement that neither Government would do anything at all with regard to the drainage of Lough Erne in order to avoid expense.  I want to know is that to be the policy of the present Government and if they are going to allow the people in these areas of County Cavan to be <Col N="250" /> at the absolute mercy of every shower of rain, which last year for instance destroyed the crops in June.  I want to know first of all is it their policy that they are not going to spend money on drainage?  If that is not so, if they are going to spend money on drainage are they going to take up the question of the drainage of Lough Erne?</P>
      <P>I was at a very large farmers' meeting last Saturday and one of the principal complaints they had to make was that there was no particular policy for drainage adopted by the present Government.  I want to have a definite statement of policy from the Parliamentary Secretary so that I can go home to my constituents and tell them exactly what is going to be the policy of the present Government in providing employment for these 80,000 people and if drainage is one of the things that they are going to include in their programme.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary for a definite statement as to what his policy on drainage is going to be.</P>

      <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity in order to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to a very important work in County Mayo.  I refer to the drainage of the River Moy.  I do not think it will mean any great endeavour on the part of the Board of Works because their engineers have already been engaged for two or three years making investigations and devising schemes to ensure that the river can be properly drained.  The drainage of this river will bring relief to thousands of people who live along its banks.  It will make available some of the very best land in the county.  The expenditure as estimated originally was fairly substantial, but possibly the new Government, with the many means at their disposal that they are only too anxious to utilise, will be able to effect economies.  Possibly on further investigation this work might be carried out on a more economical scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people are looking to this Government, as they looked to the Government previously in office, to effect an improvement in the drainage of this <Col N="251" /> river.  I hope the investigations already made will form the groundwork of a new scheme.  I am sure it will not entail any great effort on the part of the Board of Works.  The drainage of the river will confer great benefit on the people living along its banks.  Many thousands of acres of the very best land in Mayo will be made available.  I think this matter should receive earnest consideration from the Government.  Mayo has many congested areas with very limited valuations.  Most of the people who live along the River Moy earn their livelihood mostly as migratory labourers.  It is well known to us all that just now there is no great opportunity for employment across the the Channel.  In these circumstances a drainage scheme along the Moy would be greatly appreciated.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will give us ample proof that it is their desire to alleviate the lot of the people there by giving them much-needed employment and by carrying out drainage that will be highly beneficial and that will be of a lasting character.  The land at the moment is practically useless.  I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to give this matter his very earnest attention.</P>

At its meeting to-morrow the Kerry County Council will have those schemes under consideration. The people there are anxious to bring matters to a head because the conditions existing in several districts are such as need very urgent attention.  The schemes I have particularly in mind are those affecting the districts of Fermoyle, Castlegregory, Cullinagh, Beaufort and Castlemaine.  The full details connected with those drainage schemes will be gone into at the County Council meeting in the hope that the schemes will be expeditiously carried out.  I might mention to the Parliamentary Secretary that these schemes have been held up for two years or <Col N="252" /> more.  It is very essential that they should be carried out immediately and I will ask him to give his earnest attention to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Conlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the work carried out on the River Suck. This matter concerns large areas of the counties of Roscommon and Galway. The reason I raise the matter now is because of a reply to a question given recently in this House by the Minister for Finance.  The Minister stated: &ldquo;Under the Drainage Maintenance Act, 1924, restoration works were carried out by the Commissioners of Public Works in the Suck Drainage District between 1926 and 1929 at a cost of £18,806, towards which a free grant of 30 per cent. was made by the Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When the work was about to be carried out originally the Office of Public Works sent a letter to the County Councils of Roscommon and Galway.  In that letter they outlined what was proposed to be done.  The letter was dated 3rd May, 1926, and it contained the following passage:&mdash;</P>
      <P>We are advised that the River Suck District is now in a neglected condition, and we propose to carry out a general restoration of the main river and its 73 tributaries within the district at an estimated cost of £16,000, of which the Minister for Finance will make a free grant of 30 per cent. of the actual cost of the proposed works, independent of any contribution which your County Council may make.  Apart from such contribution, repayment of the cost of the works, less the Government grant, in 20 years will involve an annual charge of about 1s. 2d. per acre on the Drainage District.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimated cost was £16,000.  We now find, according to the answer given to a question in the House, that the total cost was £18,806, almost £3,000 more than the estimated cost. If that be so, it means that the occupiers of the benefited land will have to pay something like £2,000 more than they were expected to pay originally when the £16,000 estimate was made.  What was the actual cost of the <Col N="253" /> maintenance work which was completed in the year 1929?  Does the amount include interest which possibly may have accrued?  If not, what was the actual cost at the time of the completion and what was the amount of the interest which has accrued since then?  Will the occupiers, the owners of the benefited land, have to pay interest since 1929?</P>
    <P>From 1929 to 1932 is a very long stretch and I am of opinion that the Board of Works ought to have made the charging order, to which the Minister referred, long before this.  If that had been done the amount of interest would not have mounted up. The people would not be called upon to pay such an amount as they will probably have to pay now.  I do not know what the amount per acre will be when the charging order is issued.  I would like to know whether an opportunity will be given to the County Councils of Roscommon and Galway, before the charging order is made, to have it revised if necessary.  Once it is made I understand it will become statutory and there will be no opportunity of revising it in any way.</P>
    <P>Will the county councils be given an opportunity and will the occupiers of the land affected be given an opportunity of knowing what the whole scheme is going to cost them?  Can we have some idea now how much more, if any, than 1s. 2d. per acre will be required from those people?  This matter, to my mind, is being dealt with in an exceedingly slow fashion by the Department.  I would like if some effort were made to bring matters with regard to the River Suck to a conclusion. I may say that the whole position seems to be in a muddle.  I beg to report progress.</P>

      <P>When the debate was adjourned at 6 o'clock I was asking whether the Opposition really apprehended the nature of this tax and the purpose for which it was used.  It seemed to me, judging by the speeches which we <Col N="254" /> listened to from the Opposition, that there was a great deal of mental confusion among them: that they really thought we were discussing this as a mere academic issue without any relation whatsoever to the conditions which prevail outside this House.  We had Deputy Blythe stating that we were taking away the purchasing power from the individual.  We had Deputy McGilligan saying that we were limiting what a man is spending on himself in the useful way he is spending it on himself, and then he adverted quite casually to the fact that among the three million people in this little State of ours there are the extremes of great wealth and abject poverty.  He thought, judging by his speech, that that was merely an irrelevant consideration, that we should pass away from it.  The whole purpose of the Budget is to ensure that those who are living in abject poverty, who are a liability on this State and community as a whole, who because they are living in abject poverty and below the subsistence level and because they are unemployed are fast approaching a condition of chronic unemployability that we have made up our minds to do two things: first of all, to relieve them in their misery, to revive in them the habits of industry which are going to be wealth-producing, and, secondly, to ensure that they will not be driven to that state of desperation in which the extremes of wealth&mdash;not merely the extremes of wealth in this country but all opportunity for producing wealth in this country&mdash;might well be destroyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had Deputy O'Sullivan saying that income tax is calculated to cause unemployment.  I should like to consider that a little further.  As a matter of fact, when I was interrupted I was dealing with that particular point, and I did ask the Opposition to consider this: that if we had not increased income tax but instead had reduced the old age pensions by four shillings per week, what would be the reactions of that particular policy upon the state of employment in this country? If we reduced old age pensions by four shillings per week we would, first of all, be imposing a very much greater <Col N="255" /> hardship upon a considerable section of the community.  We would be imposing upon those whose total income is £26 per annum if they are enjoying pensions at the full rate, an income tax equal to almost 50 per cent. of their income, and we should be reducing their purchasing power by a very much greater proportion than any imposed upon the income tax paying class which any Government could conceivably impose.  We should be going further, because we should be reducing the purchasing power of a section of the community which spends whatever income it may have mainly upon articles which are made or grown in this country.  The old age pensioners' 10/- per week is spent mainly, as I have said, upon the elemental necessaries of life: upon vegetables, milk and the simple things of life, the things which I repeat and emphasise again, are made or grown in this country.  If we limited or curtailed in any way the purchasing power of that section of the community unemployment would be created in a much greater measure than could possibly be done by any increase of income tax which we imposed.</P>
    <P>Even if we did grant the contention of the Opposition that this does mean a curtailment in purchasing power of the very rich, in what way after all is a large part of that purchasing power utilised?  It is used to buy motor cars and to import silks and furs.  It is spent on the sumptuous livery of the well-to-do, most of which is not manufactured in this country, and in so far as the incidence of this tax upon the very wealthy classes in this country could create unemployment at all, it would create that unemployment not here in the Saorstát, but elsewhere where these things are made and in the countries from which we import them.  There is, therefore, in short so far as income tax is concerned no destruction of purchasing power inside this community.  There may be a transfer of purchasing power but it is, I repeat again, a transfer within the community and a transfer which will ensure that a much larger proportion of that purchasing <Col N="256" /> power is utilised in the creation of employment within the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>I am not going to say that such a transfer can always be made without a certain amount of economic loss and, therefore, should not be made unless there is a great social necessity for it, and there is such a necessity here.  I quoted, on the last occasion, the words of a clergyman who, as I said then, moved about among the people.  Every story that we have heard in this House, in the debate on Deputy Morrissey's motion, emphasises the necessity in the present circumstances for making such a transfer, in order to ensure that there will be much less abject poverty in the Irish Free State than there was under the régime of the late Government.  It is not permissible to segregate this tax, and to consider it wholly apart from the general scheme of the Budget.  If we did not get the £1,000,000, which we hope to derive from the increase in income tax, where were we going to get the money which we propose to spend on works of national reconstruction? Where were we going to get the funds which would enable us to carry out the schemes for the relief of unemployment outlined in the Budget, the schemes for the improvement of roads and for the assistance of public health works and for the execution of drainage schemes?  We should either have to forego these schemes altogether, or we would have to get the money in some other form of taxation which would be much more detrimental to the interests and welfare of the community as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every penny piece of this money is going to be spent on providing employment. It is going to be spent on permanent, health-giving, reproductive improvements of the national estate, and the issue which we have to weight up for ourselves is this, on which side does the balance of advantage lie? &mdash;allowing it to remain in the hands of a comparatively small class, because, as I shall show later, the great bulk of the middle-class taxpayers will be <Col N="257" /> better off under this scheme than they were under the income tax proposals of the late Government&mdash;allowing it to remain in the hands of the select few to be spent mainly on imported luxuries. Now, I do not want to say that every man is not entitled to enjoy, to the fullest, the amenities of life that his position, social or financial, will enable him to secure for himself, but I do say this, that when we are in the midst of a grave social crisis, as we now are, the people must come first, and the relief of the poverty of the many is a consideration to which any Christian Government must give precedence, rather than to the maintenance of the luxury of the few.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave said that we had 1,300,000 people in gainful occupations in this country, and 80,000 unemployed.  We have had 80,000 unemployed for, at least, the last four years.  The figures which were withheld from the community, the figures gathered in the Census of 1926, indicate that we had 80,000 people unemployed then, and we have 80,000 <Col N="258" /> unemployed to-day, and 80,000 people who, for four years, have been living in misery and starvation.  This Budget is an attempt for the first time to relieve these people in their desperate plight.  Deputy Cosgrave says that we cannot think of them&mdash;they have been starving for four years and they can continue starving for a little longer.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Let us think,&rdquo; he said&mdash;and he begged the question&mdash;&ldquo;of all those who are in gainful occupations.&rdquo; The income tax is not going to deprive a single man of employment. It may be made the excuse for reducing wages, as, apparently, it was in Cavan, but if we were to reduce the income tax by one shilling, do you think that that landed magnate, who took the opportunity to reduce the wages of his workers would increase those wages by one 6d. per week?  We have heard a statement from Deputy Brasier about certain employers who have been driven by income tax to curtail employment.</P>

I think it is time that business men of that type, who take that sort of short-sighted view of things, of biting off their own noses to spite their faces, followed some of the bankrupt landed magnates out of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Taxation is not a help to business, except in so far as it will contribute to the maintenance of stable conditions in this country, and in so far as it will create, among all sections of the people, a feeling of ease and security, and a perception that the Government is going to do its duty to them, as a whole, and is no longer going to be the instrument of the privileged <Col N="259" /> few in this country.  But if the people can see that there is going to be in this country not government for the classes but that there is going to be government for the people and that the people are going to have their interests apprehended by the Government, then taxation is a help to business, because it is going to produce those stable conditions in which, and only in which, business can flourish. Deputy Cosgrave spoke about the 80,000 unemployed and he made a most generous offer for Deputy Cosgrave. He said that we will have every assistance and co-operation from the Opposition in dealing with the unemployed. If Deputy Cosgrave was sincere in that offer, let him let this Resolution pass without a division, because it is designed to help us to deal with the problem of the unemployed.  It is designed to help us to find a peaceful solution of that problem.  If Deputy Cosgrave continues his bitter opposition to this Budget, which is the first real attempt to do anything for the unemployed, then we can understand what lies behind Deputy Cosgrave's offer of assistance.  It is not to relieve the unemployed that he is ready to assist us but, if we would attempt to do so, to keep them down.  Shoot the unemployed!  That would be Deputy Cosgrave's solution, as I indicated in the debate on the Budget. He had already taken time by the forelock in that regard and provided himself for the new Government which he hoped to head after the General Election, with the necessary legal authority to enable him to keep down the unemployed as they are being kept down under many a dictatorship in other countries.  The alternative, in the present circumstances, to an increase in the income tax is to put machine guns on the streets in order to keep back the unemployed.  I hope that that position will pass.  I am sure that it will pass if the Government is given an opportunity&mdash;an unobstructed opportunity&mdash;to get on with the constructive problem which it has in mind. When that position does pass and when we see that the necessities of the people have been relieved.  I have <Col N="260" /> no hesitation in saying that taxation will be reduced to the lowest level, compatible with the maintenance of a proper standard of life among all our people.  We never intended that the 5s. income tax, or any other tax in the Budget, should be a permanent feature of the fiscal system of this country. If it were not for the fact that we were driven to it by the mess which the late Government left behind, that they left us no alternative but to face up to the situation and to have the courage, which they had not during their whole 10 years, to balance the Budget out of taxation and out of revenue&mdash;if it had not been for that, we would never have ventured to impose the heavy load of taxation which we have had to do in this Budget.</P>
      <P>To leave that over for a moment, it is quite clear that many members of the Opposition do not really grasp what is meant by this Resolution.  They are talking as though the 5/- rate would be universal, as if every taxpayer were suddenly to have his income tax increased by 1/6.  That is very far from the truth.  Deputy Cosgrave, apparently, is one of those who believe that.  He said that the tax here has the same weight as the British tax.  That is not true.  On an income, mainly earned, of £800&mdash;that is not a small income here&mdash;a married couple with three children would only pay in tax £66 5s. here as against £68 2s. 6d. in Great Britain.  If the income were derived from investments, they would have to pay only £93 15s. here as compared with £108 2s. 6d. in Great Britain.  The more you study the scale, the more you realise that this tax has not the same weight as the British tax, and the more you realise how little they know about the matter which they are discussing who say that people will leave this country if the increase which we recommend is accepted by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, there are one or two details which I should like to discuss. Deputy Thrift referred to the 3/- income tax as a war measure.  I remember the days of the Great War, I remember how willingly not merely 3/- in the £, but 5/- in the £ was paid in order to sublimate national hatreds, <Col N="261" /> to gratify national pride, to destroy life and property, and to loosen upon the earth every terror that human intellect, perverted from its true purpose, could devise.  Income tax of 5/- was paid willingly in order that life and property might be destroyed, and the people who did that pretend to be aghast when income tax at the standard rate of 5/- is imposed in order that life and property in this country may be preserved.  But, for the great majority of the people, there is no such thing as a 5/- income tax.  In regard to the family which has an income of £800, if that income is all earned in this country, the effective rate of tax in respect of it is 1/7?&mdash; about 20 pence in the £ out of their £800.  That is what the income tax on this scale amounts to.  I am sure that such a contribution in the present circumstances is not too much to expect from a family that, all things considered, is comfortably circumstanced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has completely missed the point which I made, which was the length of time for which this taxation had continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In that regard, there has been a complete change in the social outlook of all Governments since income tax was instituted.  They have found that the imposition of income tax is a much better preventive of crime than hanging a starving man for stealing a sheep. Again, the pathetic case was made about the poor little business man whose profits were re-invested every year in his little business.  Since the profits are derived from a business, the income of that little business man must be earned income, and he must be a little business man.  We shall take a typical example of the man who was drawing last year, and we hope this year will draw, an income of £550 out of his little business.  What is his position under our proposal, and what was his position under the system which we are amending?  Last year, under Deputy Cosgrave's Government, that little business man, for whom Deputy Thrift was rightly concerned, would have paid on his <Col N="262" /> income of £550, £15 15s.  This year, under a Fianna Fáil Government, that little business man will only pay £11 5s., if he happens to be a married man with three children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>How much of the £550 can be put back into his business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how much, but under a Fianna Fáil Government he will be able to put more back than he could have under a Cumann na nGaedheal Government. That is our justification for the proposal. Not only that, but if he is engaged in a manufacturing enterprise in this country, he will be able to cast his bread on the waters with the hope that it is going to come back to him a hundredfold.  Again, we had Deputy Minch, whose concern, I think, was to direct this discussion towards the ordinary household.  He talked about the difficulty of balancing the little home budgets.  I am sorry he is not in the House, because I would have invited him, on the basis of his own speech, and in order that he should be consistent, and that he should give practical effect to his own words, to follow the Fianna Fáil Whips into the Division Lobby in favour of our proposal. In the case of the little farmer's household, with which Deputy Minch was so concerned, it is the normal and ordinary thing to find a large family. I am going to take a family that is possibly below the average; again a married couple with three children.  I find that, whereas under Deputy Cosgrave's Government, if the total income of that family had been £400, they would have paid £3 18s. 9d., under the Fianna Fáil Government that family is going to be relieved of income tax altogether.  If they had been paying income tax on a £450 income, under Deputy Cosgrave's Government his tax gatherers would have collected from the family £7 17s. 6d.  Under this Government, that family will know the income tax gatherer no more, because there is a complete remission of tax in their case.  The fact of the matter is that income tax is one of these things that it is very difficult to talk about unless you know a little about it.  Most of the speeches we have heard in the <Col N="263" /> debate would not have been made if the Deputies who made them had taken the trouble to study the whole of the income tax scheme which we have placed before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Now to revert to what I said, that it is not possible to consider our proposals without relating them to the circumstances in which they are made. We had either to reduce expenditure or we had to increase taxation, in order that we should balance the Budget. Deputy Cosgrave used to talk very eloquently about the advantages of a balanced Budget.  He told us to-day of the evils which follow from an unbalanced Budget.  He cited the case of Great Britain.  I think he cited it in the absence of his colleague, Deputy McGilligan, who stated that this Budget was a mere imitation of the British Budget.  Certainly, I am sure Deputy McGilligan could not consistently allow Deputy Cosgrave to quote the British position in this House as an example of the evils or of the advantages which ensue upon pursuing a certain fiscal policy.  At any rate, he talked about the flight of capital in Great Britain, and asked what occasioned that flight.  The feeling, he said, that the Budget was not balanced. What brought it back?  The feeling that the Budget would be balanced and that economies would be undertaken. Deputy Cosgrave knows as well as I do that, for a considerable period of years, there have been grave doubts in the minds of well-informed sections of the community as to whether the Free State Budget has been truly balanced or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No one knows better than Deputy Cosgrave that, in the circumstances in which we took office, and in view of the constructive programme which we have in mind, it was essential that our Budget should be unchallengeable from that aspect.  If there has been such a steep rise in the cost, why is it?  Because the late Government, every year, failed to make the necessary provision, and we are now faced this year with the position <Col N="264" /> in which every company or undertaking is placed, if it has for years been producing a balance sheet which is questionable, and which will not stand the closest investigation and examination.  The auditors have been brought in.  The position can no longer be concealed from the creditors, and there has to be a drastic revision of the whole financial position. Deputy Cosgrave said that when they were considering the Budget they were entitled to make governmental speculations. Why, all their Budgets were governmental speculations of the same sort that has brought down many a financial king in other countries.  It does not matter whether you are playing with pretended match companies, whether you are dealing in forged bonds, or whether you are pretending to balance your Budget.  Sooner or later you will be overtaken, the truth will out, and the truth has come out now.  That is why after a decade of years in which a Government evaded its every obligation and every responsibility, you are faced with a steep rise in cost.  We have had the courage to face this steep rise in cost, because we wish to ensure that when we do go to borrow, as we shall have to borrow for our constructional schemes, we shall present to those whom we are asking to underwrite our issues, a Budget in which neither they nor anyone else can pick holes.</P>

The Minister told us earlier, when he began his statement, that when he faced the deficiency in the estimated yield of proposed taxation and the expenditure that had to be met, he came to the conclusion that he had to find at least 3½ million pounds.  The Minister is making provision, in this Budget, for the raising of extra taxation amounting to £3,950,250, an increase over the estimate he gave us of £450,250, or more <Col N="265" /> than one-third of what he proposes to raise by these three extra sixpences.</P>

    <P>(2)  That Section 3 of the Finance Act, 1928 (No. 11 of 1928), shall, in relation to the sur-tax for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1931, have effect subject to the provisions of this Resolution.</P>
    <P>(3)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>In existing circumstances very much the same arguments that were used against the first Resolution apply to this Resolution.  It is a fact that these people, just as other people, have been living during the last couple of years on incomes that were reduced and they are obliged, as matters stand, to reduce expenditure. With the passage of this particular Resolution they will have to reduce expenditure still further and that reduction in expenditure will inevitably be reflected in immediate unemployment. There is absolutely no sense in the Minister saying that people who have to pay additional taxation, if they have to cut down expenditure as a result, merely cut down expenditure out of cussedness.  They cut down expenditure because their personal and family budgets must be balanced.</P>
      <P>The Minister suggested, when speaking before the Vote on the last motion, that the money of the relatively well-to-do is spent to a greater extent out of the country than the money of the poor.  I do not think that would bear examination at all.  I think perhaps equally the moneys are spent out of the country.  The money of the poor is spent on tea, sugar and bread.  The money in respect of tea and sugar practically entirely goes out of the country; the money in regard to bread, in so far as the main part of the cost is concerned, goes out of the country.  In the case of clothes the money goes out probably to a greater extent.  You may take it that it may safely be said that the expenditure of those who are well-to-do gives employment here to the same extent as expenditure by the poor.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, as regards the class affected by this Resolution, a good proportion of their money goes directly in giving employment here.  There are household servants, gardeners, chauffeurs; then there is the decoration of houses and the giving of other work of that nature, the cost of which goes almost entirely in employment.  Consequently, it must inevitably follow from taxes like this and the previous tax that people will in very considerable numbers be thrown out of employment immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>And furthermore, as the purchasing power of these people is reduced we have indirect unemployment caused. If they are not able to buy to the extent that they were able to before, then there is less business going to be done in the shops, less employment, and less money going to the factories which supply the shops and so on.  The best that can happen a tax of this sort is that the Minister will be able to give some employment to the people that he would like to give it to at the expense of throwing out people already in employment.  The position was stated correctly by Deputy Cosgrave when he said that we should keep our eye on the people employed. There is no use concentrating on the unemployed if we do it in such a way as to have just as many thrown out of employment as we succeed in getting into employment either by new taxation or similar methods.  There is absolutely no use at all in throwing John out of employment to get James into employment.  That is the best that can happen from this Budget, that the Minister or some of his Departments will get the spending of the money and <Col N="271" /> will be able to use it in the way they think to be electorally best; taking it out of the hands of the people who would spend it in the ordinary way without any electoral object in view. The Minister did not make any attempt in his speech to stick to the financial or economic side of the matter at all. Deputies heard him talking nonsense about the hanging of people for stealing sheep.  I do not know how the Minister thinks a question like that arises on this unless he brought it in for the purpose of electioneering as a great deal of this Budget is.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that this taxation is necessary to produce stable conditions. After we had listened to him a week ago one would have concluded that the Oath Bill was all that was necessary to do that, and that we were not to have a does of taxation on top of it.  The question of stable conditions does not arise.  It is all a question of doing the best that can be done for the whole community, those who have the misfortune to be unemployed at the moment, and no less those who have the good fortune to be employed. The Minister, in the existing circumstances in this country, will not by this tax be able to do what I said was the best that could happen; to put one man out of employment for the purpose of putting another man in, because undoubtedly a tax like this, coupled with the previous tax, is going to drive people out of the country.  I said already that by his new taxation he was going to get an extra 1s. 6d. for State expenditure and by doing that he was going to lose 15s. to the community, because the 15s. that was spent here was going to be taken out of it by the person entitled to that income going out of the country.  The Minister is going to carry that further by this particular Resolution.  He is going, both by the actual pressure that the taxation will exercise and by the menace that this taxation carries&mdash;by the menace that the whole Budget carries&mdash;to drive people, whose incomes are a direct gain to the country and are spent in the main in giving employment here, out of the country and cause them to <Col N="272" /> give the employment which their money makes possible in another country.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the net result of this tax and of the previous one is not that the Minister is going to succeed in getting anyone into employment by putting another out, but he is going to get some people in Great Britain employment by putting people out of employment here.  There is not a shadow of doubt, I think, that that is what is going to happen.  The Minister could have taken another line.  The Minister, in the circumstances, would have had to impose some little increase in taxation, but he could have had regard to the circumstances of the time.  He could have made every attempt to keep the taxation as small as possible.  That attempt has not been made.  As, a matter of fact, the Minister is, I think, deliberately putting on taxation that is unnecessary having regard to any circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said a lot, I do not want to traverse it at the moment, with regard to lack of balancing in the Budget.  One has only to look at the debt figures and to have regard to the costs of the Civil War and all the enormous special costs; the cost of reconstruction and so on, to realise that not only was the Budget balanced so far as all normal expenditure was concerned, but that great sums of abnormal expenditure, which might easily have been met by borrowing, were actually met out of taxation. That the Budget in the past has been balanced the Minister knows perfectly well, but he is repeating that it was not balanced solely because he is carrying out some obscure manoeuvre in connection with taxation for some electioneering purpose.  I do not know but that he is even deliberately, by this particular tax, putting it on with a notion of salting those who are regarded as rich, while appealing to certain ignorant electors, because there are electors undoubtedly whom the Minister could mislead into the belief that the Party that salted those who were better off than themselves ought to be supported even although that particular salting process is going to drive national income away&mdash;that it <Col N="273" /> is going to cut off community income. With that cutting off it is going to reduce employment and to cause additional hardship.  It is going to leave the question of stability exactly where it is.  There is no use in the Minister talking about hanging men for stealing sheep or bringing sentimentality into this.  This is a matter of business.  It is a matter of economic cause and effect, and the putting of it in any picturesque way will not alter the ill results that are embodied in this particular Budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few questions that I would like to put to the Minister in connection with this tax. As we all know, sur-tax is paid by a comparatively small number of people in this country, people who would be looked upon by most of us as more or less well-to-do.  Therefore, they are a class of people who can easily change their abode or domicile.  I would like to know from the Minister if he is really anxious to retain this particular class in the country, or is the object of his tax to drive them out of the country?  With that view before us, I would like to know what is the level at which this tax starts in Great Britain. Is there any change in the level at which the Minister is starting it here? In the scale of taxes that is proposed in this Resolution, is there a variation from the scale in operation on the other side?  Would the Minister also tell me the number of people in this country who pay sur-tax, the present level and the number who would pay it at the new level?  Would he also say what is the amount received from sur-tax at the moment, and what he hopes to receive in the future under the revised scale?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On an earlier motion this evening Deputy Dillon indicated that he was prepared to bear, although grudgingly, an increase of three sixpences in the income tax if he could only get an assurance from the Minister that the tax was not intended to be permanent: that, in fact, the Minister for Finance had the view that this particular type of taxpayer was a person to be cultivated or was regarded as being of some value.  I cannot understand how Deputy Dillon could ever <Col N="274" /> have consoled himself with an assurance to be received from the Minister for Finance if he had sat through his Budget speech and had heard what he said, and had seen the particular gestures with which that speech was accompanied.  In relation to this particular impost which we are discussing, the Minister introduced it this way, in Column 1505 of the Debates on 11th May, 1932:</P>
      <P>I am anxious to pass on from income tax to sur-tax.  We shall have to make changes there also.  It is a well-established fact that many folk in comfortable circumstances are quite prepared to pay a good deal to rub shoulders occasionally with the rich.</P>
      <P>Even now the Minister can hardly refrain from smiling at his own ludicrous comments.</P>
      <P>We propose, by reducing from £2,000 to £1,500 the level above which sur-tax is payable and to give&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister had better prepare for a laugh at this point&mdash;</P>
      <P>a few who are in the top section of the income tax scale, the opportunity of rubbing shoulders with the rich all the year round.</P>
      <P>That is the way that a tax which affects industry is dealt with.  That is the comment, that is the clownishness with which this particular matter was introduced.</P>
      <P>For wealthier individuals, the principle of co-equality must be given effect to, otherwise the possession of an inferiority complex might be imputed to us.</P>
      <P>That was the mind of the Minister for Finance breaking out in spite of himself. The inferiority complex was evident right through the whole speech.</P>
      <P>The imputation is one which no self-respecting citizen of the British Commonwealth could for a moment endure, so we propose to raise the rates of sur-tax throughout the rest of the scale to something like the British level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would anybody seek an assurance from a man who introduced a serious business which affects industry in the country with that type of puerility, <Col N="275" /> that type of fatuity and that clowning? What is the value of an assurance? There is the text, and that is the atmosphere in which this thing is introduced. Quite clearly, the mind of the Minister for Finance has not passed beyond the stage that very immature minds might have been in 25 years ago, when there was a sort of belief that there was a big number of wealthy people who could be mulcted without any reaction on the community. Whether or not that type of immaturity was even a proper thing in the circumstances of 25 years ago, it is quite out of place in relation to the circumstances that hold within the Free State to-day, and although those remarks have less point on this particular Resolution than on the last, they are still not without point in respect of this particular tax.  When the &ldquo;No-Income Tax&rdquo; agitation was as its height some years ago, a pamphlet was written by Professor O'Rahilly, of Cork, on the matter, and he said:</P>
    <P>The really democratic view of taxation is to regard it not as a means of hitting certain classes but rather as the assertion of the community's claim to all surplus earnings, whether of Capital or Labour, which can effectively produce only with the help of organised society.</P>
    <P>He goes on then to ask what this surplus income is, and says:</P>
    <P>It is not an amount which can be theoretically and generally calculated by a theory applicable to all countries; it varies with conditions and national circumstances.  This surplus is that portion the withdrawal of which will not here and now injure the necessary supply of Capital and Labour in any given country.  When taxation trenches on this necessary minimum, there occurs a shrinkage and transfer of the productive agent concerned, whether Capital or Labour, in the trades or country concerned.</P>
    <P>I say that the Minister should have got his Parliamentary Secretary to read portion of that to him and cut out the puerile stuff we were served with on the Budget.  That is sound, and in the circumstances that hold here in this <Col N="276" /> country at this moment, there is not the slightest doubt about it that even this attack, by way of super-tax on big incomes is going to have its reactions, and going to have its reactions almost immediately, on employment and upon that occurring there will certainly follow what Deputy Blythe has referred to&mdash;there is going to be, instead of the certainty of employment given at the moment, merely a possibility of reduced employment because in the transfer there is going to be a certain amount of wastage, and secondly, there is no possibility, and no certainty, at any rate, that the State is going to make any more effective use of this money by way of employment which it gathers in from the people who own it.  I might be asked, at this point, what is the alternative, and I come back again to the alternative which the Minister for Finance and his Party promised us before.  In a speech on the Supplementary Resolution, on 6th November last, in Column 1146, the present Minister for Finance said:</P>
    <P>Every retrenchment that can be made in the public service could have been made at the beginning of the year or it could have been made last year, or in 1927, 1928 or 1929.</P>
    <P>Had he any alternative in view?  We must, however, come back to our advertisements. &ldquo;Fianna Fáil has a plan.&rdquo;  I do not know if the Minister ever read these things, but he is going to know about them before we are finished with this Budget.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has a plan, for the worker, for the farmer, for the shopkeeper, for the manufacturer, and for all; it means less taxation, lower rates, better times.... it means security.</P>
    <P>Apparently his Parliamentary Secretary does not believe that that advertisement was meant to apply to this year.  We do not know whether it is to apply even to next year, but, according to himself, it is to apply before he next goes to the country&mdash;a wise precaution. But the advertisement was rather precise, the advertisement that was put in and which promised us</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> Here is what a Fianna Fáil Government can and will do for you.  More employment, more factories, more tillage, more houses, less extravagance, the end of destitution and a stop to emigration.</P>
    <P>The economy matter was set out in a special paragraph of its own.  The heading is &ldquo;Economy&rdquo; and all that I am going to read is contained in that:</P>
    <P>Economy means the elimination of waste&mdash;the getting of 20/- value for every pound of the taxpayers' money spent on the public service.</P>
    <P>The economy was going to be related to the public service.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is satisfied that substantial economies are feasible without reducing social services, inflicting hardship on any class of Government servants, or impairing in the slightest degree the efficiency of the administrative machine.</P>
    <P>Then we get more precise still:</P>
    <P>It has examined with minute care the estimates of supply services for the current year and is convinced that a saving of many hundred thousand pounds can be made, not including such items as the sum of £1,152,500 paid to the British Government in respect of R.I.C. pensions and other similar payments not required by the Treaty.</P>
    <P>And then we get the crescendo:</P>
    <P>The burden of taxation can be lightened by not less than £2,000,000 per year.</P>
    <P>After a minute examination of the estimates for public services for the current year, Fianna Fáil is convinced that £2,000,000 can be saved.  If we had that £2,000,000 saved, we could wipe out a lot of these Resolutions. Why have we not got them?  There was a minute examination.  There was care shown about it.  It was not something thrown out in the dark, because we had had all the talks there had been in the Dáil for years previously.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should come back to the question of sur-tax that is before the House, and realise that if we were to have on each of these Resolutions, a debate on the election policy of Fianna Fáil, and <Col N="278" /> the general Budget policy, there would be no finality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;that if we proceeded to criticise any resolution which brings in taxes this year, to suggest an alternative.  On this Resolution which is to bring in £77,000, according to the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement, I am suggesting that a very small saving of the £2,000,000 economies which they promised, would obviate the necessity for this Resolution.  I am speaking precisely to Resolution No. 2 in relation to sur-tax, and I have almost finished.  I want to repeat, in case the necessary interruption may have distracted the attention of the Minister from what I was saying&mdash;&ldquo;It has examined with minute care the estimates for supply services for the current year and is convinced that a saving of many hundreds of thousands of pounds can be made.&rdquo;  There is then added: &ldquo;The burden of taxation can be lightened by not less than two million per year.&rdquo;  I suggest that that is this year.  Why cannot we get that two million pounds and cut out these Resolutions about income tax and sur-tax?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see why Deputy McGilligan should be alarmed if I sometimes find even his repeated witticisms amusing.  I cannot help it. If the appearance of the front bench opposite be so mock melancholy on a discussion of this sort, I am compelled to smile.  I am, I confess, of a somewhat optimistic nature.  When I see the good humoured face of Deputy O'Sullivan, I cannot help reciprocating the happiness which I see portrayed there&mdash;particularly, when he knows as <Col N="279" /> well as I do that the whole of this debate is a hollow sham.  We have heard Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Blythe waxing eloquent about the amount of unemployment this increase in the sur-tax is going to cause.  We will throw away the fiction and get down to the facts.  I shall take what I think is the most typical case of sur-tax payer here&mdash;the £2,000 man, who earns £1,500 a year and derives an additional income of £500 from investments.  He would have paid last year, if he had a wife and three children, £271 13s. 9d. This year he will pay £298 10s. 0d. Last year, under Deputy Cosgrave's Government, the effective rate of income tax and sur-tax on that individual would have been 2/8 in the £.  This year, the effective rate will be 2/11. What is the conclusion to be drawn from that?  If a single word of the speeches we have heard from the opposite benches be true, then they had taxed that man up to the limit of his capacity and they are just as blameworthy as we are, that, in the present circumstances, we have to impose an extra 3d. piece of taxation on him. That fact blows sky high the whole case which the Opposition has striven to make against this Resolution.</P>

      <P>Deputy Good wanted to know the number of taxpayers at the old rate and with the reduction of the sur-tax level to £1,500.  We are not able to give those figures because they have never been taken out.  I pressed for them on many occasions and I was not able to get them from my predecessor.  The figures are not in the possession of the Revenue Commissioners and, consequently, I am not able to give them to the House.  The British level of sur-tax is £2,000.  We are reducing the level to £1,500.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Professor Alton Professor Alton">

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1. Before sub-section (3), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That an individual who makes, in the manner prescribed by the Income Tax Acts, a claim in that behalf and makes a return in the prescribed form of his total income shall, for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of his assessable income for the purpose of income tax, be allowed a deduction from the amount of that income such sum or sums as he pays in wages to domestic indoor or outdoor employees.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister was not able to help me in arguments with the Revenue Commissioners.  Perhaps he would be able to give me the figures later on.  However, I am trying to help him now.  I have spent some thought on this amendment and I am putting it forward in a non-controversial way, as an honest amendment that will be of social import.  It is one that should commend itself to every member of the House.  It is to the effect that payers of income-tax would be allowed to deduct from the assessable total of the income such sum or sums as they paid in wages to domestic indoor or outdoor employees.  In spite of the assurance of the Minister that income tax payers are suffering no hardships, that the burden he has put on their backs is <Col N="286" /> only a straw, I can assure him that many of those income tax payers&mdash; decent, honest citizens who are as much interested in the welfare of the country, in the social uplifting of the country, as any Party, Government, or Opposition in the House&mdash;find it a very serious hardship and they will, as Deputy Dillon said, have to tighten their belts this year.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, a private citizen differs from a Government.  He has to cut his coat by his cloth.  He is not allowed the luxury of a deficit.  That is forbidden by his bank account or, in the case of many, by his bank overdraft. He has to look round and deny himself in all directions.  I am speaking of people who are in that position, people, as I say, who are trying to do their duty as citizens and yet pay this extra income tax and carry on during a year of emergency, people who only wish to see their country out of trouble and are willing to pull their weight and pull it honestly, but they will have to make curtailments in all directions.</P>
    <P>This amendment of mine was designed to relieve them of what would be a very unpleasant prospect for many of them, a curtailment in the way of getting rid of some of their domestic indoor or outdoor employees.  I think the last thing a decent man would like to do is to let down a faithful servant, his best friend, but unfortunately many people will be reluctantly obliged to do it this year.  I do foresee that unless some relief of this sort is given there will be a very considerable number added to the roll of the unemployed from the field of domestic labour.  My amendment is designed to meet such a contingency, and it is one that should commend itself to all Parties in the House, particularly the Labour Party, of which there is one representative present&mdash;I mean the official Labour Party.  This principle is not a new one.  It is a principle which is recognised and has been recognised by all of us in business.  What shop or factory, what kind of business could be carried on if it had to pay income tax on money disbursed in the way of wages or salaries?  It would be quite impossible.  If they were obliged <Col N="287" /> to do that they would find immediately that they would be compelled to face a very thorough reduction of staff or bankruptcy.  I do not see any difference between domestic employees and employees in other fields.  Domestic service is as honourable, is as essential and as useful to the State as any other form of labour.  It is only a Hyde Park orator, as I heard one once, who would refer to domestic servants as instruments and parasites of luxury. I do not think we will hear that in this House.  What would be the position in many homes if such employees as domestic servants were not available? One can visualise the Minister for Finance having suddenly to retire in order to prepare the family dinner or, perhaps, put the children to bed. The Dáil could not sit from 3 o'clock until 10.30 were it not for the benevolent industry of this class of employee.</P>
    <P>I commend this amendment to the serious consideration of the Minister. I observe he is smiling.  It is a smile not of sympathy nor of benevolent neutrality; rather is it a smile of sinister significance.  That is the smile he had when he enumerated the various straws that he was laying on the backs of those least able to bear them.  The Minister's smile is like the moonlight on a tombstone.  I hope that my arguments in favour of this amendment are sinking into the Minister's heart.  I am putting them forward seriously, though I may appear to be talking lightly.  This is really an important thing and it would be a great concession if the Minister accepts the proposal. I hope the matter will be discussed in a non-party, non-controversial way and ultimately it should be left to an open vote of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that because of the great anxiety the Minister professes for employment and his determination to see that there is no one thrown out of employment by this Budget, he will be grateful, as Deputy Alton suggests, for this opportunity of honouring at least one particular pledge.  I am sure he will have the support, not merely of the Independent, <Col N="288" /> but also of the dependent Labour Party.  I am not going into the figures that the Minister gave us.  I do not wish to refer too much to the past, but I have a vague idea that last so, the experience we had of his calculate about income tax.  Candidly, if the Minister does not mind me saying so, the experience we had of his calculations in regard to income tax and tax matters generally on that occasion were not such as would induce any of us to accept, without more ado, all the various calculations and the results of calculations that he gave to the House this evening.  However, that is a matter especially concerned with super-tax and into that we need not go now.</P>
      <P>So far as I am personally concerned, I would like to be assured that these figures are not the mere creation of the Minister's own brain but that they come from responsible Departments at his back.  Leaving these figures aside, whatever they are, there is one thing that cannot be got over, and this amendment draws attention to it. There is a large number in this State employed out of the incomes other people have.  The Minister may say it only make a difference of 2d., 3d. or 1/- in the £, but the fact remains that between the increased income tax, sur-tax and corporation profits tax, together with what he is taking out of the banks, he is taking out of the employment fund nearly £1,500,000.  Half-pennies, shillings and even pounds&mdash;if the Minister makes a difference of £20 or £100, a little confusion of that kind does not matter&mdash;all go to make up the employment fund and that fund is being diminished.  The result will be felt especially by the class that Deputy Alton, in his amendment, refers to. That is the class that will feel it first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That class will not be vocal.  They will not go in deputations to the Minister; they will not threaten him that at the next election their votes will be cast against him in an organised fashion.  They have no method of getting themselves heard. Therefore, I fear although there is an excellent opportunity offered now by Deputy Alton, that the Minister will be deaf on this occasion again to the <Col N="289" /> voice of reason.  By income tax, sur-tax and other taxes of a similar nature we are taking out of private hands nearly £1,500,000 and I suggest we are going in the wrong direction. We are going in the direction by which employment will be taken out of the hands of the private individual and put into the hands of the State.  It is obvious that large classes, especially those referred to in this amendment, will suffer right through the country if the Minister remains deaf to Deputy Alton's appeal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am supporting this amendment for two reasons.  In the first place, I believe it will negative very largely, and tend to dispel, the rather gloomy forebodings entertained by many Deputies who voted against Resolutions 1 and 2, dealing with income tax and sur-tax.  My second reason for supporting the amendment is that I feel it will encourage many who have courage enough to engage in Irish enterprise and to employ Irish labour.  Many of the income tax payers in this country circulate a good deal of their money in the way indicated in this amendment.  It gives employment through the engagement of domestic servants.  They are, as Deputy Alton says, a very necessary class in the community.  Their employment, though sometimes derided, is as necessary to the community in general as is the employment of even the most prominent Ministers in the State.  The class mainly affected comprises people who, like some income tax and sur-tax payers referred to by Deputy O'Sullivan, do not make themselves vocal.  They are rarely, if ever, heard of on political platforms or at political meetings.  They include chauffeurs, gardeners and domestic servants.  If the super-tax and income tax payers circulate money in this way it is a good thing for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel if this amendment is accepted it will very largely dispel any doubts there may be in the minds of many people in the country as to the Government's intentions towards those people who give a good deal of employment in this way.  It has been suggested that the number of super-tax <Col N="290" /> payers in the Free State is very small and that we could do with a lot more.  We might make it more attractive for those people who reside amongst us and this is one of the gestures by which we could make it attractive to those people who have money to spend.  That money would find its way through various channels. It would encourage industry and would be otherwise a great advantage. I am speaking as one who supported the present Government in their first two Resolutions because I felt the arguments were all on their side.  I feel that here is a case where the Government can make at least this gesture to those people, that they do not intend to drive them out of the country altogether.  I ask the Minister to take serious note of and to consider sympathetically the amendment moved by Deputy Alton.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment against which, I think, a strong theoretical case could be made.  This Budget is a peculiar one and it is going to cause much hardship.  We hear from the Minister that these imposts are temporary.  I think that in all the circumstances, in order to avoid unemployment, or at any rate to mitigate the unemployment which will certainly follow the imposition of all these taxes, the Minister ought to accept the amendment.  The Minister is very seriously wrong in the calculations which he gave to the House.  He has a habit of making very hasty calculations about the effects of income tax. On a famous occasion the Minister discovered that an increase of the 3/- tax to 3/6 would double the income tax payable by a large number of people. On the present occasion he seems to have made a similar calculation.  I was not in for the Minister's statement on that point, but I gather that he was dealing with the case of an income tax payer with £1,500 earned income and £500 investment income, and he indicated that as between the present scale and last year's scale there would be a difference of only £27.  The difference in fact would be over £112, so that the statement the Minister made in the House was quite misleading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>This appears to be a meritorious amendment.  I want to put it to the Minister that he might regard its acceptance as a measure of emergency unemployment relief.  I want to put it to him moreover, that it seems to follow logically from the concession that he has made with regard to people who put money in the new issues of capital in this country. He has done that to encourage new industries here.  I suggest that if individuals can be found to start new industries, small or large, there is no reason why something should not be done to encourage them as well as to encourage public companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the amendment.  I opposed the Budget when it was introduced largely because I thought that the effect of it would be to lead to the disemployment of many more person than it would secure employment for.  I am satisfied from my experience and from what I have learned during my visits down the country since the Budget was introduced, that many persons, particularly domestic servants, male and female, who have been in employment which they had come to look upon as permanent will, as a result of this Budget, be disemployed.  I feel that if the Minister were agreeable to give the relief asked for in the amendment he would probably save many of those persons from being thrown out of the employment in which they are to-day, and in many cases have been in for a number of years.</P>

    <P>I do not know what case the Minister can make against this amendment, or whether he proposes to make any case, but I put it to him that he ought to look at it not merely from the point of view of the income taxpayer but from that of the person who is employed by the person who is called upon to pay this increased income tax.  I ask him to look at what the effects of his refusal of this amendment will have not upon the income taxpayer but upon the unfortunate domestic servant.  I am not particularly concerned with the person who has to pay income tax or sur-tax.  As Deputy Anthony has said, I think we have shown that in <Col N="292" /> the vote we gave to-day on Resolutions No. 1 and 2.  We have voted for the Minister's proposals because we realise that if the Minister is to go ahead with the proposals that he has made to the House for social services he must get money somewhere.  I suggest to the Minister that if his Government and himself are sincere in their statements with regard to finding employment for people who are unemployed, and keeping those who are employed in employment, this is an amendment which he ought to accept. I again take the liberty of emphasising that he ought not to look at this amendment from the point of view of the income taxpayer, but from the point of view of the unfortunate domestic servant, because if the Minister insists on his Resolution and refuses to accept this amendment I am satisfied that the income taxpayer will pass on the imposition, and that the person to suffer will not be the income taxpayer but the person employed by him.  I suggest that the amendment is a reasonable one and ought to be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment that I welcome.  I think it is conceived in a most admirable spirit and I trust it is one that will commend itself to the Minister.  The incidence of this income tax, in the case of a large number of people, may I think be received in a spirit of panic, and in that spirit I can conceive that the first people likely to suffer would be those who are in domestic service.  Deputy Anthony has said that they are a defenceless class.  Very largely they are people who had good reason to hope that they were in permanent employment.  I believe that if income tax payers viewed the matter calmly that class would not suffer.  But human nature being what it is, I think it very possible that, of all classes, domestic servants may be in the greatest danger of experiencing unemployment as a result of increased income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that if the Minister were to accept this proposal of Deputy Alton's it would be one means of effectively averting that.  I do not believe that the concession asked for would be very <Col N="293" /> costly, because I imagine that a considerable number of domestic servants in the smaller households would be the servants of persons who might not be liable to income tax at all.  In the larger, wealthy households the proprietors of which go on Mediterranean tours and take half-a-crown off their labourer's wage lest they go into bankruptcy as a result of the increase in income tax, something in the nature of this proposal might serve to still their panic.  Though one may argue that the State is ill-employed remitting taxation in order to soothe somebody's ruffled nerves, I think that Deputy Morrissey hit the nail on the head when he said that the Minister should look on this remission from the point of view of the person threatened with unemployment rather than from the point of view of the people who are actually going to enjoy the remission. I have very little doubt that if he can see his way to accept the amendment, he will have removed what I think is almost the only serious danger of undesirable repercussions resulting from the temporary imposition of the substantial income tax that he intends to put on in this Budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment, if accepted by the Minister, will be taken, I think, as a gesture that would do much to minimise the effects of the increased tax which has been imposed on those who pay income tax.  It is not always the amount that would, perhaps, be saved by curtailing employees that will have the effect on the income of a person paying income tax, but a gesture of this description would allay, as Deputy Dillon has said, the fears of these people.  When you look on the number of employees of this class in the country, those who, perhaps, may cater for the amusement or the taste or even the ordinary requirements of people who pay income tax, I think it would have a most desirable effect.  There are those in what I might call the middle-class life, in country districts, who employ a fair number of people, and it will have a very good effect in promoting such employment, when they see that they would not have to suffer.  I support <Col N="294" /> the amendment, and I hope the Minister will see his way to adopt it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment also, and, like Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Dillon, I would ask the Minister to look at it from the employer's point of view, that there will undoubtedly be, as a result of the increased tax, a considerable lessening of indoor and outdoor employment, in relation to gardeners, chauffeurs and other such people.  I got up mainly to say that I do not believe that the fact is, as Deputy Morrissey said, that income tax payers will definitely pass on this tax, even though they could afford to refrain from doing so.  I know myself very many instances where taxpayers of the class mentioned, who are heavily taxed. have been maintaining their employees for a number of years, even though it is almost impossible for them to bear the expense, but they are hoping against hope that the period would arrive when their expenses might be lessened, and they would be able to keep on the employment of men and women on whom they looked as friends, old retainers of their families for perhaps twenty or twenty-five years. Every Deputy knows these types of servants who have spent the greater part of their lives with these people, and who are more friends than servants of their employers.  I know of cases where some of these particular employers have had to approach their employees and tell them that the time had, at last, come, when it was impossible for them to meet their expenses, and they were forced, by necessity, to get rid of some, or reduce the wages of all.  I can give the Minister instances of such cases, if he likes, and I would appeal to him to accept the amendment of Deputy Alton.  It will be a boon to a great lot of employees, who will lose their employment if it is not accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two remarks to make, and the first is, that anybody who examines the volumes of the census report, recently issued, will find that the class of female labour in which there was most unemployment shown was that of domestic servants.  It was rather hard to understand that figure when it was brought to the public first, because it seemed to coincide with a considerable demand for domestic servants, which had not been met, but I understand that the explanation was that a considerable number of people who had been in domestic service, and who, because of the failing incomes of the people who supported them in service, had been removed from domestic service, with the consequent result, as I have explained, that that type of female employment was the one which showed the greatest number of people unemployed, so far as 1926 was concerned.  The other matter which, I think, is relevant to this particular amendment, is this, that domestic service is exempted from the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance code, and, consequently, if any domestic servants, that is, domestic servants as properly defined, are thrown out of employment, their cards will not have been stamped, and there is no unemployment insurance for them.</P>

From the Minister's own point of view, and to show that he is interested in trying to avoid this unemployment which is going to come to a certain extent, whatever he does, I would suggest it is very desirable that he should accept this amendment.

      <P>I was going to suggest, when I thought the debate would be prolonged, that the proper place to consider this would be on the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  The amendment was handed in late last night, and we have not had time to look on the practical effect if it.  I do not wish to hold out very much hope, at this stage, because Deputy Blythe himself admitted that there was a sound theoretical case against it, and he knows as well as I do, that the basis of it is that the income tax code does not take into consideration, the manner in which income is ultimately spent.  The manner in which the individual chooses to dispose of his income could not, at all, affect his liability to taxation.  Apart altogether from that, which is the basic principle underlying opposition to it, there is this fact, that this is likely to be most expensive amendment if one were to give effect to it.  It introduces an allowance never before considered, and which no person, even in the happiest times when the Exchequer might have had money to give away, would have had the hardihood to put down.  I do not wish to enter into any extended argument against it, because I do not want the discussion, which, if Deputy Alton withdraws the amendment now, will inevitably take place on the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>

We have had a statement about one or two isolated cases, but we have not had any facts which would show that, because income tax is being increased, there is going to be general unemployment amongst domestic servants.</P>

Whatever attitude the Opposition are going to take, they are taking it in the knowledge that the practical effect of the amendment has not been examined and investigated, and that they are going into the Lobby without having any estimate, without the foggiest idea of what the whole thing will cost the State.</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary stated the other day that income tax in theory was an abominable tax, but in practice it was the only expedient we could resort to this year.  For the sake of consistency, we should be either theorists or practicalists, one or the other.  Do not try to ride two horses at the same time; do not speak with two voices.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Dáil agree with the Committee in the Resolution.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the Resolution in which the bachelor discrimination is being made.  I understand that that arises under Section 2 of the Resolution.  The way the Minister introduced that particular novelty into the Budget was as follows:</P>
      <P>The fact that I am to make an allowance in respect of children fills me with pity and concern for all the forlorn bachelors among us.  How can a Minister for Finance do anything for a bachelor?  You cannot, for instance, grant him any relief in respect of children.  The problem has caused me earnest cogitation because since I am in this mood of beneficence, I should like&mdash;I am afraid I cannot long maintain it&mdash;to be beneficent towards everybody.</P>
      <P>It was a serious contribution this time:</P>
      <P>Unfortunately circumstances will not permit me, by increasing the marriage allowance, to gild the bonds of holy matrimony, but possibly by making the drear loneliness of bachelordom more repellent I might drive many an eligible young man to take the plunge.  Accordingly I propose by reducing to £125 the personal allowance made to unmarried persons to add a gold tipped arrow to Cupid's quiver and to make matrimony the refuge of bachelors and spinsters with taxable incomes.</P>
      <P>I want to point out that, so far as we know, we have not got the matter quite clearly before us.  So far as we know, the Minister is not going to succeed in making matrimony the refuge of certain bachelors.  So far as we understand, Ministers' salaries are to be free of income tax, so that a bachelor, for the future, has either to take refuge in matrimony or become a Minister. I understand that is the position. We have not yet got clear what the ministerial salaries are going to be. Apart from the ministerial salaries, we do not know whether other officers of the Government are going to have their salaries free from income tax or not, or whether they will be exempt in the matter of this reduction of allowance from £135 to £125.  Is there any question of this matter being in order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I may assure the Minister that it will not be any joke when the country gets to know the difference between promise and performance. What is the effect of Resolution 3 upon whatever are the proposals with regard to Ministers?  We used to be told, when the income tax stood at 3/- in the £, and when a certain allowance now being made was not made, that a particular salary was sufficient salary for anybody in the country.  That was never phrased as &ldquo;£1,000 free of income tax.&rdquo;  It was a sum obviously to be computed in relation to whatever the taxation was at the time.  We understand that a certain sum is now proposed free of income tax.  I would like to know if that is so, because if it is, a calculation will arise as to what is the effective salary it represents on a 5/- income tax, with everything else added in that has to be added in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that in this Resolution it is an unfair thing to have one class in the community alone exempted from particular imposts, particularly when they are the people who are going to put those imposts upon other folks in the country.  They do not feel the full effect of what this particular tax <Col N="307" /> amounts to in the case of ordinary people.  It is certainly not encouraging a proper sense of responsibility in regard to taxation proposals, especially in the matter of income tax proposals, if Ministers are to have their salaries entirely free of income tax payments.  They should be subject to all the vicissitudes of bachelordum or marriage, and the changing amount of the income tax rate, the same as other people, if they are going to give serious consideration to the taxes imposed on others.  Is it a fact that whatever remuneration is proposed for members of the Executive Council, and for members of the Government other than members of the Executive Council, is to be free from income tax, and are they to be exempt from making the returns other people in the community have to make, in order to enable tax officials to find out exactly what their position is in relation to State finances? That is a thing we should get information upon.  So far as I know, until the law is changed, Minister will be subject to income tax, and will be subject to the indignity of getting a salary equal to what Ministers previously got.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will they be subject to taxation upon the old sum until it is changed, and at the present rate of 5s., and will the bachelor members of the Ministry be subject to this particular bit of beneficence that the Minister for Finance thought he ought to bestow on the community generally by taxing bachelors?  These are points that arise and we should have some answer upon them so that we can test again the difference between the old promise and the exact performance which these people, so full of promises, now put up when they become a Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister left somewhat in doubt the position of a widow or widower.  So far as I remember, he said that anybody who was not in the married state would have to conform to the £125 allowance. That is a thing that ought to be made clear.  Let us take the case of a widow who has, say, two, three or five children. They may be young, of school <Col N="308" /> age.  The widow, apparently, is to be regarded as a single person and will get only the £125 allowance.  The same would apply in the case of a widower similarly circumstanced.  Is it to be taken that a widower, with a family, is better off than when his wife was alive?  Is it to be taken that he has less charges on his income?  It is generally understood that the cheapest housekeeper is a man's wife.  If a widower has to hire a housekeeper there are certain additional outgoings and he certainly cannot be regarded as being better off.  Although no amendment has been tabled, I will ask the Minister to give serious attention to the desirability of treating a widow, or a widower, as a married person, provided there is a family.  They certainly should be put on the same basis as a married person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to associate myself with Deputy Gorey's request that some remission should be made in the case of widows and widowers.  Very many people are deeply concerned about this matter. If the present proposals are applied, any other benefits given will be wiped out.  Deputy Gorey has emphasised the cases that might occur.  Looking at the matter casually, one might say that a peasant once married is no longer a bachelor or a spinster.  It would be a very great hardship on people who have been married and who are left with children and all the responsibilities of married life, with the additional responsibility caused by the death of one of the partners, if they were not regarded as married for the purpose of retaining the allowance made under the income tax code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If my recollection serves me correctly, I think the Minister indicated that these people would not be exempted. I would like to have that matter definitely explained now.  We know that there are people who marry and, if one dies, for sentimental reasons, to honour the memory of the one who has departed, the survivor will not get married again.  I would like to know from the Minister whether he proposes that such people should be exempted <Col N="309" /> in the matter of the allowance.  It might save an amendment being tabled later on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with certain points submitted by Deputy McGilligan.  Some of the matters he raised were quite irrelevant. He referred to certain allowances and salaries.  The position as it existed in the last Government was that members of the Executive Council with the exception of the President were paid an amount by way of salary and allowances of £1,700.  As Deputy McGilligan knows, not all of that £1,700 was subject to income-tax. The ordinary Deputy's allowance was first of all deducted and that left the Minister for the discharge of his Ministerial duties a salary of £1,340.  Is that right, Deputy McGilligan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  It is the first correct calculation you have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly, but it is correct anyhow.  The present position is that Ministers are receiving a salary of £1,000, free of income tax.  They are making a voluntary surrender of the balance, and I would like the House to understand what it means&mdash; a thousand a year from which we deduct a Deputy's allowance of £360, leaving Ministers a salary, free of income tax, of £640 for the discharge of their ministerial duties.  We will add, if the Deputy likes, what would approximately be the income-tax on a salary of £640.  In the case of a married man with three children it would amount to £30 per annum, making the gross value of that income to that married man of £670, and that has to be contrasted with the £1,340 subject to income-tax which Deputy McGilligan received when he was a Minister, or if not precisely Deputy McGilligan at least some of his colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that during some part of the period that Deputy McGilligan held ministerial office he was an unmarried man.  In the case of unmarried members of the present Ministry the value of the allowance for income tax amounts to something like £57 or <Col N="310" /> £58.  That would bring the gross value of their salary to £697 or £698.  Now I have not time to go very minutely into the figures on the basis of the old position, but I want to be perfectly fair and candid in the matter.  A Minister in the last Government in receipt of a salary of £1,340 would, under our present taxation scheme, pay income tax of about £248, if he were a married man with three children living with him.  He would have a net income of £1,092 as compared with a net income in the case of a married man, with three children, in the present Ministry, of £670.  No matter how Deputy McGilligan may endeavour to misrepresent the position it is this: that so far as 90 per cent. or 80 per cent. of the present Ministry are concerned, so far as every member of the Ministry is concerned, they are kept as closely as possible to the £1,000 limit. That is all I have to say.</P>

      <P>(1)  That, where a person has ceased to hold an office or employment and a pension, annuity, or other annual payment is paid to him or to his widow or his child or any of his relatives or dependents by the person or the heirs, executors, administrators, or successors of the person under whom he held such office, or by whom he was so employed, then such pension, annuity, or other annual payment shall, notwithstanding that it is paid voluntarily or is capable of being discontinued, be deemed to be income for the purpose of assessment of income tax and shall be assessed and charged under Schedule D of the Income Tax Act, 1918, or under Schedule E of that Act, as the case may require.</P>
      <P>(2)  That to remove doubts it shall be declared and enacted that the word &ldquo;annuity,&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;pension&rdquo; in the charging provision of Schedule E of the Income Tax Act, 1918, shall include and be deemed always to have included respectively an annuity which is paid voluntarily or is capable of being discontinued and a pension which is so paid or is so capable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the House wants me to explain the purpose of this Resolution.  It deals with a case that was heard in England recently. The House of Lords recently decided, in the case of an annual pension of £500 paid to a retired headmaster of a college which under the college statutes the warden and council had power to pay in their discretion and which they might if they chose discontinue, was not assessable to income tax.  The clause here is designed to remedy this position.  The case for it is that the pensions in such cases are paid in respect of past services and the clause merely gives effect to the practice which has been in force for very many years and which up to now <Col N="312" /> has not been challenged in the Saorstát.  Sub-clause (1) deals with the case of ordinary pensions payable voluntarily by private employers, commercial concerns, schools, etc.  It is not in any way retrospective.  Sub-clause (2) deals with pensions and annuities payable out of public funds. While the decision which I have quoted above, which, of course, is not binding here, did not deal expressly with public pensions it raises doubts as to whether pensions payable by the State which, in a technical sense, are capable of being discontinued, might not be held by the Irish courts to be exempt from income tax.  The declaratory clause is intended to remove these doubts and is expressly made retrospective to obviate any possibility of claims for repayment being put forward in respect of tax deducted from public pensions in past years.  It will be noted that the clause merely declares the law to be what it has always been understood to be in the Saorstát.</P>

    <P>(4)  That the words &lsquo;who is chargeable with or liable to be assessed to income tax as&rsquo; contained in sub-section (2) of Section 7 of the Income Tax Act, 1918, shall be repealed.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 1 deals with Rule 18 of the General Rules of the Income Tax Act of 1918.  It provides that where any person dies, without having delivered a statement of all his profits or gains, an assessment in respect of such profits or gains may be made on his executors.  A case recently arose in which a person having an income of over £2,000 a year made a complete return and died about a week before the assessment was signed.  The Special Commissioners, on appeal, held that the existing rules did not enable an assessment to be made on the executors.  The resolution substitutes a new rule which enables an assessment to be made on the executors, whether a return has been made or not.  Some questions have been raised in other cases as to whether the Acts create any charge on executors, and words are introduced in the new Rule expressly providing that the executor or administrator shall be assessable and chargeable.  The new Rule is so drafted as to enable <Col N="315" /> assessments to be made for past years, subject to the time limit in sub-clause 2, but does not operate to validate any assessments already made.  It merely enables assessments, including assessments for certain past years, to be made after the passing of the Act.</P>
    <P>Sub-clause 2 of the new Rule provides that assessments made under the preceding sub-clause shall be made not later than six years after the expiration of the year of assessments, but any such assessments must be made not later than three years after the expiration of the fiscal year in which the deceased died.  There is no change in the law in regard to this time limit.  The existing provisions embodied in Section 8 of the Finance Act of 1925, as amended by Section 2 of the Finance Act of 1921, are to the same effect.</P>
    <P>Sub-clause 3 of the new Rule provides for the making of returns by executors, to the best of their judgment and belief, in respect of profits or gains which accrued to a deceased person for any year for which an assessment could be raised under sub-clause 1.  At present, there is no power to require an executor to make a return in respect of the income of a deceased person.  It is to be observed that, under the law as it stands, if an executor desires to make a return, he may be faced with the position that he could be challenged in respect of any expenses being incurred in the preparation of the return.  As the sub-clause imposes a statutory liability on the executor, the executor will, in future, be entitled to have any expenses which he incurs borne by the estate.</P>
    <P>Sub-clause 4 of the new Rule is designed to exclude from the operation of the new Rule, cases of the profits of a trade, profession or vocation carried on in partnership.  A partnership is assessable in one sum on the whole of the profits and it would obviously be unreasonable to require the executor of one partner to make a return of the profits of the partnership business concerning which he might have no information.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2 of the Resolution deals <Col N="316" /> with the position which is being created by Section 10, sub-section (3), of the Finance Act, 1929, which enacts that, in the case of a person ceasing to possess certain investment income, the provisions of Section 12 of the same Act relating to the permanent, discontinuance of a trade or business, shall be applied.  These latter provisions are to the effect that the proprietor of the business shall be assessed for the year in which the trade is discontinued, on the actual profits of that year up to the date of discontinuance, and may also be assessed for the preceding year on the actual profits of that year if such profits exceed the amount of the assessment for that year.  The Revenue Commissioners are advised that Section 10 of the Act is not applicable in the case of a deceased person, unless he ceases to possess the income or profits before his death.  The new paragraph is designed to remedy that defect.  In the case of paragraph 3 of the Resolution, the point is the same as in paragraph 2.  It arises under Section 12 (2) of the Finance Act, 1929, which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>In the case of the death of a person who, if he had not died, would, under this section, have become chargeable to income tax for any year, the tax which would have been so chargeable shall be assessed and charged upon his executors or administrators, and shall be a debt due from and payable out of his estate.</P>
    <P>As the law stands at present&mdash;I am sorry that Deputy O'Sullivan is bored, but the general public may take more interest in this than he does&mdash;the Revenue Commissioners are advised that it is necessary that two independent things should happen in order to enable this paragraph to operate. First, that the trade should have been discontinued during the lifetime of the person chargeable, and that the person should subsequently die during the year of assessment.  The paragraph is designed to make the 1929 section applicable in a case in which the trade, profession or vocation is discontinued on the death.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 4 of the Resolution provides <Col N="317" /> for the removal of certain words from Section 7 (2) of the Income Tax Act, 1918, relating to sur-tax.  The present position is that an executor who is chargeable to income tax in respect of the profits of a testator is liable to make a return for sur-tax. Owing to the fact that sur-tax is assessed and charged after the end of the year of assessment, and payable a year late, this position gives rise to difficulties in certain cases.  For instance, a person dies on 31st March, 1931, having made a return, and having been duly assessed for income tax, in relation to the year 1930-31.  The sur-tax for the year 1930-31 would be assessed during the year 1931-32, and payable on the 1st January, 1932.  The executor of this particular person would not be assessable for income tax for the year 1930-31, and, therefore, could not be called on to make a return for sur-tax for that year.  The paragraph is necessary to enable sur-tax-assessments to be made in such cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister a few questions arising out of this.  Under paragraph 1 he seeks power to make an assessment for income tax on the executor after a person has died.  I would like to know whether or not the Revenue Commissioners will take the sum of which the person died worth, less the income tax, for the purpose of death duties?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>The second point arises on this new Clause as to the allowing of executors' expenses.  That seems to me to open a very wide door, and some extra provision will have to be made.  It will require some provision for the auditing or taxation of these expenses, because, if it is left in this omnibus way, it will open the door to perhaps serious demands by these men on the estates of deceased persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That point might more profitably be dealt with on Committee Stage, because we cannot have question and answer, but I would say <Col N="318" /> this, that we would have no power to interfere with the executors like that. The heirs would be the people who would be bound to ensure that the executor kept within reasonable limits. The only thing we are entitled to do is to make the executor responsible to the Exchequer for making a return. The expenses he would be called to bear, in that case, would, I presume, relate to the size of the estate, and the difficulty of making a return, and the Revenue Commissioners would be reasonable in a matter like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Prof. Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>From the point of view of the executor, I want to put a question. It seems to me that this Resolution may make the executor's position in distributing the estate very much more difficult and that it may be necessary for him to go back over the last six years of the deceased person's affairs and find out, so far as possible, whether full income tax has been paid on the receipts for those six years before he can safely distribute.  Would the Minister tell me what margin the executor will have to allow, in time, before he can secure distribution of the estate so as to safeguard himself, after distribution, from a charge for income tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The executor will be, I suggest, fully secure three years after the year of death.  We are making no change in the law in that regard.  One of the effects of sub-clause (2) is that <Col N="319" /> the executor will be entitled to charge the expense of making the return against the estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Prof. Thrift Prof. Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Prof. Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned with the question of expense at all. The Minister's answer, so far, suggests to me that it would not be safe for an executor to distribute the estate of the testator completely until three years had lapsed.</P>
