      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will have learned with very deep regret of the sudden death, in Dublin this morning, of Deputy Frank Carney, one of the members for the constituency of Donegal. Deputy Carney was a devoted soldier in the struggle for Irish freedom. During his time in Irish public life he was ever mindful of the interests of the people he represented and, though in ill-health, he was assiduous in the performance of the duties attaching to membership of this House. I would ask you, a Chinn Chomhairle, to convey to Deputy Carney's family an expression of our sincere regret and sympathy: Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

    <Title>Control of Manufactures Bill, 1932&mdash;From the Seanad.</Title>
    <P>The following Message was received from the Seanad:&mdash;Seanad Eireann does not insist on amendments Nos. 1, 4 and 25 to 28 inclusive made by it to the Control of Manufactures Bill, 1932, with which Dáil Eireann has disagreed:</P>
    <P>It disagrees with the amendment made by Dáil Eireann consequential on its agreement to Amendment No. 11 made by Seanad Eireann, in lieu of which it has made the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Section 2, sub-section (2).  The letter and brackets &ldquo;(b)&rdquo; deleted in <Col N="8" /> line 45 and the letter and brackets &ldquo;(c)&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>
    <P>It has made the following further amendment to the Bill, consequential on the agreement of Dáil Eireann to Amendment No. 10 made by Seanad Eireann:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Section 2, sub-section (4).  The word, letters and brackets &ldquo;(g) and (h)&rdquo; deleted in line 27 and the word, letters and brackets &ldquo;(g), (h) and (i)&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to recommend that the Dáil agrees with the Seanad in respect of the amendment in lieu of amendment 11 and also in respect of the further amendment made by the Seanad to amendment 10.  In respect of the two main amendments on which the Seanad insisted, amendments 15 and 16, I have decided to recommend to the Dáil that these amendments should be accepted in principle.  Some alteration in the wording was necessary because the actual amendment inserted by the Seanad is meaningless and if passed, would have no effect whatsoever.  I am moving therefore that these amendments be accepted:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Amendment in lieu.</P>
      <P>1.  That the Amendment in lieu made by Seanad Eireann be agreed to.</P>
      <P>Further Amendment.</P>
      <P>2.  That the further Amendment made by Seanad Eireann be agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 15.</P>
      <P>3.  That Seanad Amendment No. 15 to which Dáil Eireann has disagreed and upon which Seanad Eireann has insisted as amended by the deletion of the words &ldquo;contained in regulations made under this Act&rdquo; and the substitution of the words &ldquo;to be prescribed&rdquo; be agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make the point as to whether it is possible to accept at this stage amendments in paragraphs 3 and 4 which are being phrased as consequential amendments. We had a discussion on this point on 5th August; the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was in charge of this Bill.  The Minister described himself as having taken considerable interest in it having had control of the Bill.  In the end he accepted the amendment proposed in this House as a necessary and substantial one.  He accepted really as a consequential point what had come from the Seanad, namely, paragraph (b).  It is now proposed to wipe out the reference to paragraph (b) though the discussion previously on the Bill had proceeded on the basis that certain relaxations applied to Section 2 (1) (b).  It is now proposed to cut that out.  I suggest that it is much more than a consequential amendment and one that should not be accepted at this late stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting the matter as a point of order.  May I put my point again?  The Bill comes to this House and contains certain restrictions on manufacturers coming into this country.  Section 2 (1) (b) of that Bill allows certain conditions of control, but by a later section these are considerably relaxed in relation to that paragraph.  Through the Report Stage of the Bill in this House and right through the Seanad where paragraph (b) was very often mentioned and back again to this House that paragraph was the subject of discussion for at least a half hour of the time.  It is now proposed as a consequential amendment to remove the reference to paragraph (b) and have this relaxation applied also to paragraph (c).  As I say, that matter was already discussed in the Dáil and at that time the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said:&mdash;&ldquo;I agree that it does apply to (b) and (c) as the section comes in.&rdquo;  The Minister in charge of the Bill said that there was never a Bill which had been so definitely considered by the Executive Council as this Bill had been; he said he had taken the Bill under his own charge and that he knew what he was speaking about.  He goes now and says that this section should apply to (c) and (b); but as a consequential amendment it is now proposed to wipe out (c) and (b).</P>

At least, I presume that is what the Seanad desires. They passed an amendment deleting the words &ldquo;at his discretion&rdquo; which were the words in the Bill and inserted the words &ldquo;subject to the provisions contained in regulations made under this Act.&rdquo;  They did not say who was to make the regulations, and, in fact, the Bill gave no power to make regulations to anybody.</P>

      <P>The Minister may by order make regulations in relation to any matter or thing referred to in this Act as prescribed or to be prescribed.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that the section does not give the Minister power to make regulations of the kind contemplated by the Seanad, but if the amendment which I suggest to the Seanad amendment is carried, namely, to insert the words &ldquo;to be prescribed,&rdquo; Section 12 comes into operation and the obvious purpose of the Seanad is given effect to.  It is a mere drafting amendment.</P>

      <P>Where you have a clause saying that the Minister may make regulations and the Minister is a specifically defined Minister, I think there is going to be a link between the two.  The principle is <Col N="13" /> accepted that these matters are to be subject to regulations and these matters are therefore to come before the House.  Is that now proposed by the alteration that the Minister moves?  The Seanad did move that these licences should not be given in the absolute discretion of the Minister but should be given &ldquo;in accordance with provisions contained in regulations made under this Act.&rdquo; And the intent was definitely to tie that up with what is in the copy of the Bill that we have as passed by the Dáil&mdash;Section 11.  The Minister now cuts out the phrase &ldquo;provision contained in regulations made under this Act&rdquo; and puts in &ldquo;in accordance with provisions to be prescribed&rdquo; and when we turn to Section 11 we find that &ldquo;the Minister may, by order, make regulations.&rdquo;  Is that &ldquo;may&rdquo; equal to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in that context?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I want to ensure but I cannot yet assume that that is so.  These licences are to be given &ldquo;in accordance with provisions to be prescribed.&rdquo;  There is no obligation to prescribe.  We turn then to the regulations section and it says &ldquo;the Minister may by order make regulations.&rdquo;  If that &ldquo;may&rdquo; is not compulsory, then the purpose of the Seanad amendment is not being met.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

What the Seanad wanted, and what those of us here who moved much the same amendment, wanted, was not that regulations should be prescribed but that regulations when prescribed would come before this House.

      <P>It is not a question of helping anybody to understand.  It is a question of explanation and the Minister must know what he is moving. I am going to suggest to the House, in the absence of a definite assurance from the Minister, that we adhere, despite the suspicion which has been cast upon us by the Minister, to the Seanad phraseology, which, to my mind, is stronger and better to effect the purpose of getting matters, in accordance with regulations which may be made in the Minister's office and hidden there, brought before the House.  It is publicity we want and not the order of things in a secretive way, and, unless some assurance is given in regard to these regulations, I am going to suggest to the House that it should not accept the amendment by the Minister in lieu of the Seanad amendment and that they should disagree with this proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is just the type of suggestion I would expect from the Deputy.  The Seanad amendment concerned does not require regulations to be made by anybody in particular and the Seanad presumably did not care whether they were made or not.  I take it that that is his attitude&mdash;let us have regulations but it does not matter a rap who makes them or what is in them, so long as we carry our point. This is probably what is known as constructive opposition in the columns of the &ldquo;United Irishman&rdquo; but it sounds like sheer nonsense to anybody on this side of the House.</P>

    <P>Whenever an application is made to the Minister under this Act for a new manufacturer's licence the <Col N="15" /> Minister may, in his absolute discretion,</P>
    <P>do various things.  It is proposed to delete the words &ldquo;in his absolute discretion&rdquo; and insert the words &ldquo;in accordance with provisions to be prescribed.&rdquo; It is quite clear from that, that no licence can be issued except in accordance with provisions to be prescribed.  Section 12 says that the Minister may prescribe these provisions. The Minister may not do it, but if he does not do so, the Bill is held up and no licences can be issued. Section 12&mdash;Section 11 as it is in the printed draft&mdash;says that the provisions prescribed shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the various tariffs which were introduced in the Budget were under consideration we found ourselves up against applications for protection from various industries on which it was impossible to arrive at a decision in the time then available.  All such applications were postponed and examined in detail later, when more time was available.  It is as a result of that detailed examination of applications which offered elements of particular difficulty that these Resolutions are being submitted to the House.  Most of the duties imposed are of minor importance in so far as the articles to which they relate are not articles consumed in very great quantities in the country.  Some of them, however, can be considered of considerable importance, in so far as they are likely to afford considerably increased employment in the industries affected.  In addition to the duties imposed in consequence of that detailed examination of the difficult applications to which I refer, it is also proposed under these Resolutions to effect some minor changes in the duties which were imposed in the Finance Act in consequence of our experience of the working of that Act during the intervening period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will, perhaps, be information for Deputies if I indicate the particular category under which the various duties arise.  I presume they will desire to have an opportunity of examining them in greater detail and ascertaining information relating to the industries affected before discussing them at length.  Any particular point of information desired will be <Col N="42" /> supplied as far as it is possible to do so.  The first Resolution contains the Schedule.  The duties imposed by it are on coloured knitting yarns, 22½ per cent. with a Preference of 15 per cent. The second is upon any metal which is subject to another duty, and which is imported with an inscription engraved.  It is subject to an additional 15 per cent. and 10 per cent., the purpose of the duty being to have increased engraving done in this country.  The third relates to date stamps and marking stamps made wholly or partly of rubber or containing parts of such the duty being 50 per cent. with a preference rate of 10 per cent.  Resolution 4 concerns springs for mattresses, cushions, settees, and light articles of furniture. The duty applies only to single springs.  Assembled springs are already subject to duty.  Number 5 deals with spectacles, monocles and other eye-glasses, the duty being 50 per cent. with a preference rate of 33? per cent.  Number 6 refers to cuff-links, studs, hinge pins and ear-rings and component parts thereof made wholly or mainly of brass, bronze, or gun-metal, or a combination of any of those metals the duty being 30 per cent. with a preference rate of 20 per cent.  Number 7 deals with certain specified articles of gold, silver and electro plate.  Number 8 relates to glue and size, the duty being 50 per cent. with a preference of 33? per cent. with a licence clause.  The necessity for the licence clause is on a certain type of size not produced here, and which it is necessary to allow to come in.  It is not possible to get a definition of that particular size which will permit of its being distinguished from other classes of size which it is desired to make subject to duty. Number 9 relates to fillers and flats for egg boxes imported separately, the duty being 30 per cent. with a preference of 20 per cent.  Number 10 deals with pipes made wholly or mainly of clay.  Number 11 relates to picture frames wholly or mainly of wood, and pictures in frames made wholly or mainly of wood, excluding pictures which are imported temporarily for exhibition or which are <Col N="43" /> imported for a public picture gallery. Picture frames were heretofore subject to duty as furniture.  It is necessary to have this Resolution because certain difficulties arose out of pictures being imported as such, the frames being imported with the pictures and consequently evading duty as picture frames.  Number 12 relates to coffin plates of metal.</P>

      <P>Number 13 deals with sheet lead and lead piping.  It is proposed to delete the relevant reference in the Finance Act and to substitute the reference here, 15 per cent. and 10 per cent.  Similarly it is proposed to delete from the Finance Act the reference by which a duty was imposed on certain articles of brass and tin.  I mentioned when the section was being discussed that we had considerable difficulty in procuring what we desired to have, a specific list of brass articles which it was desirable to make subject to duty.  Consequently we went the other way; we imposed a general duty at a low rate exempting articles which should be exempted.  That did not work satisfactorily.  In any case, during the adjournment we have had an opportunity of going into the question with much greater care, and, as a result, we are able to produce a specific list of brass articles which are and can be made here, and which it is desired to protect.  It is intended to increase the duty on these articles in the case of church brasswork to 75 per cent with a preference of 50 per cent., and in the case of other articles to 50 per cent. with a preference rate of 33? per cent., and to remove the duty from other articles of brass.</P>

      <P>No.  Number 15 is inserted in consequence of what I have said.  The relevant reference in the Finance Act will be deleted, but it is necessary to re-enact in the Resolution the part of the Bill dealing with articles made of tin or tin plate.  Number 16 is a duty on articles of manufactured woodwork which was imposed in the Finance Act.  With certain changes, the entire reference in the Finance Act will cease to operate, and the new section will operate instead. This duty will apply to all plain and dressed timber.  It will also apply to mouldings and to margarine boxes, egg boxes and in fact to all types of boxes except pyramid butter boxes.  It will also apply to butter kegs and casks, and, in addition, one or two minor exceptions have been made.  These are specified in the list in the fifth column, but are of no particular importance.</P>

      <P>Yes.  No. 17 imposes a duty upon the component parts (excluding road springs) of all wheeled vehicles which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, are designed, constructed and primarily intended to be drawn by an animal or by two or more animals, and to be used for the carriage of persons or for the carriage of goods or for the carriage of both persons and goods.  Under the Finance (No. 2) Act we imposed a duty on unassembled parts.  It is now decided to bring unassembled parts under the duty.</P>
      <P>No. 18 imposes a similar duty on unassembled iron and steel parts for bodies of motor omnibuses, motor charabancs and commercial motor vehicles.  These were exempted under the Finance (No. 2) Act and it is now decided to make them subject to duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No. 19 doubles the duty on worked stone.  That has been made necessary for a few reasons, the principal of which is that information has reached the Department that exporters of <Col N="45" /> worked marble, who also control to a large extent the supplies of unworked marble, have countered the duties imposed by us by increasing the price of the unworked marble.  This duty will operate as a protective measure.</P>

      <P>Flock is a substance used for filling mattresses.  No. 21 increases the duty on roof felting and similar substitutes.  The small duties imposed by the Finance Act were countered by the importers reducing their prices and it has been decided consequently to increase the amount of the duty.</P>
      <P>No. 22 similarly increases the duty on cordage, cables, ropes and twines, which industry has been making considerable progress.</P>
      <P>No. 23 imposes 22½ per cent. full, and 15 per cent preferential duty on undyed jute yarns.</P>
      <P>No. 24 imposes a duty of 37½ per cent. full and 25 per cent. preferential upon jute piece goods exceeding 4½ ounces in weight per square yard, but excluding jute piece goods of the following descriptions:&mdash;bleached jute piece goods, dyed jute piece goods, carpets, and jute piece goods imported with goods of which they form packing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No. 25 imposes a duty of 50 per cent. full and 33? per cent. preference on heel plates, of horseshoe shape, made of iron or steel or of both iron and steel for boots and shoes.  The necessity for that duty arises out of the fact that a factory for the manufacture of these heel plates is about to commence, but as we have good reason to believe that the announcement of the establishment of this factory would result in very substantial importations of these goods into the country to such an extent as would be sufficient for three or four years' supply and that consequently the factory project would fall through, it has been decided to impose this duty with a licence provision.  Under this licence provision, we will permit the normal <Col N="46" /> quantity of these goods to come in until the factory starts production and is able to supply the needs, when the duty will come up for reconsideration.</P>
    <P>No. 2 Resolution differs only in so far as the duties imposed are specific and not ad valorem.  On vinegar there is a duty of 2/- per gallon full and 1/6d. per gallon preferential. The duty on custard powders of 60/-per cwt. full and 45/- per cwt. preferential is not a new duty but a transforming of an emergency duty into a permanent duty.  On filled Christmas stockings, snowballs, Easter eggs, and similar articles there is a duty of 3d. each full, and 2d. each preferential, in addition to any other duty that may be chargeable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a duty on sausage meal of 1½d. per lb. full and 1d. per lb. preferential. The duty on compositions made of plaster of paris in sheets or slabs is doubled.  There is a duty upon sparking plugs of 1/6d. each full and 1/- each preferential rate.  There is also a duty on empty sacks and bags made of jute.  The full duty is an amount equal to 37½ per cent. of the value of the article or 1½d. on each sack or bag whichever is the greater. The preferential rate is an amount equal to 25 per cent. of the value of the article or 1d. on each sack or bag whichever is the greater.  It is intended to permit the importation of unconditioned secondhand sacks where such importation is done by a conditioning firm in the Saorstát.  It was found impossible to provide for that in specific words because of drafting difficulties, and consequently the licensing provision is here.  It is also intended to exercise that licensing provision to ensure that no firm utilising sacks and bags will be left without supplies.  There is in this country one very large and highly efficient jute <Col N="47" /> factory but it is not at the moment fully equipped to supply the whole requirements of the country.  A type of machinery is being installed there to produce goods which in the past and at present are mainly imported. Arrangements to supply the full requirements of the country are at present being made.  In the meantime there might be a shortage in which case the licence provision will be operated to meet the shortage.</P>
    <P>Section 3 increases the duty upon shirts and collars and the component parts and accessories of same, on silk embroidered handkerchiefs and the component parts and accessories of such handkerchiefs, on all underclothing of silk including crêpe de chine, spun silk and Japanese silk intended for use by women, girls or children.</P>
    <P>The Fourth Resolution deals with harness, and leather manufactured into harness.</P>
    <P>Resolution Five deals with the imposition of duties which were announced in July last on bread, biscuits, buns and cakes imported into Saorstát Eireann.  When the announcement of the intention of imposing those duties was made reference was made to the fact that there was some possibility of the supply of bread in Donegal by the bakers existing there proving inadequate. We satisfied ourselves that in every other part of the Saorstát a supply of bread was available, but there was considerable doubt as to the position in Donegal.  The position in Donegal has not substantially altered in the meantime, A new bakery is being constructed and some extensions are being made in others in respect of existing bakeries, but there is a deficiency in the productive capacity. Consequently to put a duty or an imposition on bread immediately in Donegal might mean that there would be a shortage of bakers' bread. That might not be a serious thing in itself unless it came suddenly because in Donegal a large part of the bread is home baked, and, more than likely, the people would be able to supply their needs from home baked bread. <Col N="48" /> It is proposed to impose the duty there as from next Wednesday, and in operating it to take power to issue licensing provisions to enable importers in Donegal to secure whatever quantity of bread may be necessary, while arrangements are being made to meet the requirements of the county from other parts of the county or from other parts of the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>These are all the main changes that are being effected.  I explained the circumstances and the necessity for changing the words.  If Deputies desire any additional information or to discuss the proposal at greater length the opportunity will arise upon the General Resolution which can be postponed to a date which may be considered convenient to the main Resolutions when they come before us on Report Stage.</P>

That applied particularly in the case of cellulose, which is a paint used in manufacture.  It is impossible to get a definition that will include every object.  We have a duty on paints.

He protested that they were not.  They are a commodity used very much by the very poor.  The Minister overlooked the fact that in the next section of the Budget he put a substantial duty on sheets.

The definition which we are using seems to meet that.  We are excluding from the scope of the duty yarn on bobbins because it is only imported in that form by woollen manufacturers.

      <P>I do not think there is any likelihood of that.  The goods exported are of a different class to the ones imported.  The point is that the factory might devote its attention in future to supplying the requirements at home rather than interest itself in exports.  The volume of goods imported exceeds the volume exported in value.  If you take second-hand bags into account, it will be found that the excess is considerable.  If the factory decides to alter its organisation, its equipment and its method of business so as to supply the home trade with its requirements, it would have a much larger market under the new circumstances than it has at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say so. This did operate in the case of marble. The price of marble was undoubtedly increased and the protection which we gave to the stone-cutting industry was seriously diminished.  There is only one supplier of raw marble.  I am quite prepared to admit that a further increase might follow, but if that further increase should take place, while it might diminish the protection we are giving to the stone-cutting industry, it will also operate as a non-legislative tariff in favour of the production of marble.  It will, I believe, tend towards the development of the marble quarries in this country and the utilisation of this marble in preference to the imported article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on the Resolution generally, I must say that I regard this list as almost the height of insanity, but that does not mean that I do not welcome it.  The whole tariff policy as it had been proceeding up to the end of last year was more or less balanced.  We had, at any rate, got to the position in which there was no outcry in the country against tariffs by reason of high costs. Even some of the articles tariffed under the Finance (Customs Duties) (No. 2) Act might have been accepted with good grace and goodwill in the country&mdash;I believe they would certainly have been accepted&mdash;if there had been some limitation put upon particular charges there imposed upon the community.  If there had been a recognition that the duty upon a dear class of goods, say on woollens, was being increased and a remission made in consequence on a type of cloth not likely to be made, and if there were indications that the necessary changes could apply to the boot and shoe tariff&mdash;if those things had been done, there might have been a chance that a tariff policy would not be made the subject of violent Party disputations and would not be made the subject hereafter of a compaign in the country which is bound to develop into anti-tariff and pro-tariff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This means that we have actually crossed the line.  The last Budget brought us across the line but this nonsense to-night definitely puts us across the line.  It means the end of a tariff policy which would otherwise have operated with goodwill on everybody's part, with tariffs operating under some sort of supervision and in a selective way.  That chance is gone and the country is going to be faced with a very bad situation.  There is not going to be any appreciation of tariffs properly used.  This ludicrous use of tariffs will put people entirely and definitely against them and it is only right it should.  I do not believe that there is going to be any talk made by the Minister himself or any evidence produced other than his usual <Col N="72" /> recital of assurances as to the employment to be given in the manufacture of these goods.</P>
    <P>The truth is, and it has been stated by a Labour authority in this country, that there are more unemployed in this country to-day than ever before, and that there are more people in receipt of home assistance than ever before.  A great deal of that is due to a tariff policy which ran amok.  Even if the tariff policy had been kept within bounds, it would, owing to the time at which it was introduced, have had bad results for the country.</P>
    <P>This is camouflage.  We are to tighten up the whole thing.  We are to have our own heels made in the country; we are to have our own pipes made in the country and we are having all these miscellaneous things flung at us.  We have had things flung at us that look well on paper and which, repeated to people who are not very careful about the statements they hear, will convey the meaning to them that there will be more employment created in the country.  We have a state of general camouflage.  We are to have all these things tariffed here. We are to have a grand tariff policy proceeding industrially in a short space of time.  And these statements are made at a time when we have the returns from the tariff policy announced by the Minister.</P>
    <P>We were told that a sum of £910,000 was to be brought in from the tax on the new tariffed goods.  We were told that it was not possible to have made any better estimate than that because the development of home manufacture was to be taken into consideration. That estimate of £910,000 was the considered estimate of the Minister as to the sum that the tariffed articles would bring in to the Treasury.  But we have seen 80 per cent. of that sum collected in six months.  Now the difference between the estimate and the assurance given by the Minister and the actual fact in the way of levies made on the people is exactly the difference between the Minister's assurance as to the industries that were to be started and the actual fact.</P>
    <P>All this addition to the taxation of the people certainly means very little <Col N="73" /> indeed in the way of employment.  It means a little bit extra.  We will find out how much by practical experience, but it means a great deal extra in the way of costs to the community.  It certainly means this that a great many more people are getting sick and tired of the tariff policy.  More people who were prepared to give tariffs a chance when properly applied are now turning away from them in disgust.  We gain very little in these tariffs and we lose a great deal.</P>
    <P>Of course there are bigger things toward, and this is one of the things that has to be weighed in front of the people who are gradually getting involved by what is happening.  Here is a matter which, whether you are expending your energy either on being enthusiastic about it or vehemently opposed to it, will be found to be a preparation for the economic war that is going to be announced. We are going to be a much more self-contained nation making our own pipes and our own heels.  It is put forward now and the House has been given an opportunity of discussing the tariff policy in the Finance Customs (No. 2) Act or the Budget that was introduced last April.  Over 80 per cent. of the £910,000 has been levied in the first six months.</P>
    <P>It will be found instead of that £910,000 levied under these tariffs that something in the region of one and a half million pounds will be levied. The fact is that instead of that £910,000, a sum of one and a half millions is to be taken from the community and that in spite of the assurances that had been given that factories would spring up and that home goods would be made to replace the articles excluded.  All these things that were to come from the tariffs, the promises and hopes expressed by the Minister, have not materialised.  The hopes have been disappointed.</P>
    <P>For myself I always felt that this country could not get on without a tariff policy.  Tariffs had to be tried. I also knew that the impositions caused by the tariffs would be very severe upon the community at this <Col N="74" /> particular time, and therefore I believe that tariffs ought to be brought in with very great care and very slowly, and with some appreciation from time to time of the costs that were to be placed on our main producers in the country.</P>
    <P>That policy was tried and it had been found successful, having got 15,000 additional people into employment. That placed a fairly heavy extra charge on the community at the beginning, but that charge was lessened year by year.  You had a policy which was under your control, and one that could be closed down when the farming community found they could not bend their backs to any further burdens.  It was proper and right that a chance should be given to a tariff policy.  What is proper and right about the present tariff policy at this moment when farmers are ground down, when they cannot get any prices, when the Government attitude has landed them in difficulties and when the hopes that were held out of other markets have been falsified?</P>
    <P>The farmers are put in the position that they must sell and cannot get any remunerative price.  These tariffs mean large extra cost to them and to the townspeople as well, but particularly to the farmers.  The impression that the people will get of this rather futile piece of work at this time is that they are not getting a right tariff policy or a policy on right lines.  They have a policy that means nothing in the way of extra employment, but it is a policy that means a great deal in the way of extra cost to the community and a great deal in the way of people hardening their minds in the future against any tariff policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give you the proper ones.  The Deputy referred to the unemployment situation.  He gloated over the fact that there is more unemployment in the country to-day than ever there was.  To some extent, that may be said to be correct. There are 87,000 people registered as unemployed. I do not think there are 87,000 people actually without work but there are 87,000 people registered under our new system of registration at the Exchanges as being available for work.  Let the Deputies get that figure straight into their heads&mdash; 87,000.  That figure is justification for this policy, because if we are going to <Col N="76" /> find work for those people we cannot find it by adopting a tariff policy which will please everyone, including the importers.  If the unemployment situation is worse here than it was this time last year it is due to the fact that 24,000 young people who went out of this country in every single year of the ten years that the Deputy opposite was Minister did not go out this year.  They stayed at home this year and are looking for work, and we cannot get them that work unless we revive the industries of the country.  That is the purpose of this policy.  That is the purpose of these tariffs.  That is what we have been aiming to do, to exclude from this country every article that we can make for ourselves.  All the articles which have been specified in this list are articles capable of being manufactured here, that were in the past manufactured here, and in the future we are determined that in the production of these articles Irish people are going to be employed in this country.  The policy on which we embarked has been successful.  It has been more successful than I dared hope at the time.  I remember Deputy Hogan rising up and saying that in eight months this policy would be discredited. I took him on that, and I said that if at the end of eight months we could not show a substantial increase in industrial productivity and a substantial increase in the numbers of people engaged in industrial manufactures we would admit failure.</P>

We have that now.  There is no figure in relation to the figure of six months ago capable of comparison with the figure we have now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any attempt to prove that the unemployment position is worsened as a result of comparison between the number of registered unemployed before and the registered number now is deliberately false and misleading. Let me say simply this.  The tariff policy has been successful in every branch.  In respect of every industry to which it has been applied there has been substantial development, increased productivity, and increased employment.  We are going ahead <Col N="78" /> with the policy.  We are quite convinced as a result of our experience and as a result of any theories derived from text-books that it is by that policy we can deal with the very serious unemployment problem we have.  I have no desire to diminish that problem in the mind of anybody. If we cannot get a clear realisation in all quarters of its magnitude, a clear realisation of the seriousness which attends it, we will not get behind this policy and the other measures the Government has adopted to deal with it the necessary enthusiasm.  It is because the public are beginning to realise now that there is a problem of great magnitude, it is because they are getting now information deliberately kept from them before that we are getting behind this policy a growing measure of support from the people. The duties imposed by these Resolutions may not be of first class importance.  Nevertheless they are capable of providing work for a number of people who are now without it and on that ground alone they are worthy of acceptance by this House.</P>

      <P>Oh no.  That will be a different resolution, sir.  Arising out of the statement that the tariff policy of the Government, which is now intensified, has been successful in every branch, it has been successful in one branch, namely the Revenue branch&mdash;£910,000 to be collected, 80 per cent. to be lifted in the first six months and no signs of it diminishing.</P>

      <P>In June and July the Minister was certain of all the factories that were going to spring up by magic from the manufacture at home of these goods.  He expressed himself at times as being doubtful if we would get £910,000, that we are going to get a million and a half.  That is the test of the policy.  The home manufacture of goods has not filled the bill to the extent of the difference between the £910,000 estimated and the million and a half that may come in.  Taking unemployment and the challenge about eight months made here by Deputy Hogan, Deputy Hogan never made any statement so foolish as that it was not possible to get people into employment if you prohibited goods from coming in.</P>

Will they be sold at such a rate that people in other employment will lose that employment?  Will you find at the end of eight months as a result of your tariff policy that there are more people in employment or more people out of employment?  The Minister denies about his figures and what they mean.  He will not go to any meeting, unless he goes like the great Sequah long ago, with two or three bands to hide the groans and the agony of the people who are suffering from him, and say there are less people out of employment at the moment than there were when he came in.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The test is the number of people out of employment at this moment, the number of people on Home Assistance, the intensified feeling in the country about unemployment and the agitation that is rising in the country about the people who are losing employment day by day.  The figures have been quoted, 86,000.  I suppose what is quoted is 80,000. 80,000 did not represent people who were looking for work, who were available for work and who depended for their livelihood upon the wages they get for work.  It represented people who answered the question were they or were they not working.</P>

The 87,000 figure is equally capable of explanation.  It would be quite foolish for anybody to over-estimate or to estimate wrongly or inaccurately the 87,000 figure.  Let <Col N="81" /> nobody follow any mistaken belief in what the Minister has said that because there is a new system of registration the figure is swollen.  At the moment the Minister says the great change is that anybody can walk into the nearest police station and register.</P>

Has the 2,000 a week&mdash;say 8,000 a month&mdash;has that been going on for four months?  So there are 32,000 vacancies filled in four months and we have still 87,000 registered.  I wonder have we anything more than 87,000 registered at this moment, and the home assistance bill is certainly higher than it ever was before&mdash;and our tariff policy is a success&mdash;and the people are being mulcted to the extent of 80 per cent. of the £910,000 in six months.  They have been mulcted in six months to the extent of 80 per cent. of the £910,000 that was to be covered in a year&mdash;and the tariff policy is a success.  That is the sort of success that breaks the Government.  It is unfortunately going to break the tariff policy, and that is what I regret.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When I came into office I was faced with a figure of unemployment which had no significance.  I said to myself if we are going to tackle the unemployment problem we must get a real picture of the size of it.  We must get some figure which will indicate exactly the number of people available for work and get a list of names and addresses with their qualifications.  I set out to get that.  I knew quite well when setting out we would have little whipper-snappers coming deliberately and misrepresenting the result, saying that the increased figures we secured were representing a worsening of the situation instead of a bettering of the situation.  We knew these misrepresentations would be made.  We knew members of the late Government <Col N="83" /> concealed the position for ten years by publishing faked figures, and continued to publish these faked figures as against the figures now available in order to pretend the situation had got worse.  Has it got worse?  It is not easy to say whether it has or not.  If we had put into employment in protected industries or any other industries 16,000 people this year the situation would be still the same as last year.  I want the Deputies to appreciate that this year the population of this country is going up and instead of having an annual drainage of 27,000 per annum as we had while the Deputies opposite were in office we have people coming back into this country seeking work, and we have got to find that work.  We have not altogether been successful.  We have not provided them all with work, but we have provided work for very large numbers directly on relief labour of one kind or another and indirectly through the operation of this policy. There were 87,000 people registered&mdash; that is a big number.  It does not represent 87,000 people unemployed, because as the Deputies opposite know throughout this country the people available for work on the roads or other public works are men who are not labourers in the ordinary sense&mdash;they are small land-owners, not people who would be reported as unemployed. They are farmers in poorer districts who support the livelihood they get from their lands by doing occasional work on the roads or work of some other kind.  Probably 50 per cent., certainly 40 per cent. of the total of our registered unemployed is represented by such people.  The number of registered people unemployed in the County Mayo when the new system came into operation went up from about 200 to something over 12,000.  Is any Deputy opposite pretending that 12,000 people became unemployed in that period? The number of unemployed in Donegal increased from a few hundred to something well over 12,000.  The same situation applies in Galway and all the western counties, and in so far as the allocation of relief fund was based on the number of registered unemployed <Col N="84" /> in the different districts there was a direct inducement in every district for every person who was seeking work to register for work.  The larger the number of registered unemployed the greater the amount of the allocation of the relief fund made.</P>
      <P>I am rising to make sure that no Deputy will misunderstand the position as a consequence of the statements made by Deputy McGilligan. We had a serious problem but the situation has not become worse as a result of the tariff policy.  It has been considerably eased as a result of the tariff policy and any proof anybody wants of this can be produced. The figures of people in protected industries are being prepared and will be published.  The total number of people engaged in insurable occupations are being prepared and will be published.  Figures for the output of the protected industries are being prepared and will be published, the market statistics are available already up to the end of August.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy says, hear, hear, and they show conclusively there has been a steady decline in the importation of all or nearly all the protected articles&mdash;a decline which in some cases was much more substantial than I thought would be effected within the period of three months, and Deputies should remember these tariffs and this protective policy had been in operation only for three months up to the end of August. Now as that policy has worked out in a period of great hardship, in a period of world depression, in a period when every country in the world has unemployment trouble as big if not bigger than ours, we can safely assume that we can deal with the unemployment situation best by continuing that policy, by continuing to afford to Irish industries the protection they deserve and by fostering the growth of new industries in the country.  That is what these Resolutions are intended to do and we will not be prevented from doing that by any tactics of misrepresentation based upon faked figures as the Deputy opposite stated.  I would not like <Col N="85" /> the Minister to be misled by any figures supplied to him by his Departmental officers or from local exchanges in the towns and cities. I have been making inquiries as a result of continuous communications which I have been receiving from parts of my own constituency and, particularly, from one county, Leix. I was informed, on 26th September, by a Government Department, because I made inquiries arising out of the very small grant given to the county, that the number of registered unemployed was 950, and that in one registration area, Portlaoighise, there were 425 out of the 950 registered.  I would like to point out to the Minister that if those who are really unemployed in rural areas saw any real hope of getting employment in or near their registration areas there would be a considerable increase in the number of registered unemployed over those actually looking for work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a matter in which the Minister will join.  He referred to this matter of prices being kept down with regard to these slabs of a particular composition, and we got the old reason trotted out that somebody has given him a guarantee that there will be no increase in price.  In the end, as a result of the questions <Col N="93" /> asked by Deputy Brodrick, it is discovered that the number of people who are giving a guarantee is limited. Certainly, whatever about the number of people who may engage in the manufacture of these compositions, the Minister accepts some guarantee given to him by a limited number of people, and his supreme test is that if somebody produces a slab of this type at a particular price nobody is going to pay any higher.  Is there a guarantee that it is the same stuff or the same quality of stuff?  That is where the price guarantee fails.</P>
      <P>I notice&mdash;I do not know whether he was pretending to quote or not&mdash;that the particular phrase he used was that he had a guarantee that the price would not be raised by reason of this duty.  That might mean that it will not be raised by the amount of the duty or it might mean that it will not be raised at all because of the duty. Nobody says that that will occur, but it may be raised because there is no competition against the home article. Has the Minister any guarantee that prices here will be kept as low as the prices of articles of this type manufactured on the other side and sold to people who want to buy them on the other side?  Has he a guarantee of that type?  If he has a guarantee of that type he can justify his tariffs. But if he has not such a guarantee, then there is no evidence at all that what Deputies Brodrick and Good fear is not going to take place&mdash;that the cost of building is going to be increased. Then, again, we come back to what was discussed here on a previous occasion.  Nobody here will attempt to deny that if you stop certain articles from coming in here, and it is at all possible to manufacture them here, you can get people to manufacture them here.  That does not finish it, however.  If, by reason of the price of building materials going higher, certain buildings are not proceeded with, unemployment will result. The real question is, have you more people in employment than previously, and that is what he entirely leaves out of consideration in all this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the question of the guarantee is the main thing on which <Col N="94" /> I rose to speak.  We have heard a lot about these guarantees and we know that there is going to be an attempt to control prices, but the Minister himself has not given us any statement as to what he means by the enforcing of these guarantees.  The guarantee has varied from time to time.  When we were talking about agricultural implements there were certain provisos as to various costs going up, and I think even freight was brought in.  Anyway, we did not have it from the Minister, and I think he would not assent to the idea that you could get a guarantee that those articles would be made, and sold to the customer, at the same price as articles manufactured of the same type on the other side would be sold. Unless you get a guarantee of that sort it is not worth anything, and even if there was a guarantee there would be insurmountable difficulties in enforcing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not worrying about the question of guarantees because I do not think that that is the real difficulty at all.  I want to know whether the Minister is in a position to tell us from whom he would get the guarantees, or whether he has any guarantees at all.  I am quite satisfied that, as a result of the tariffs, the cost of the articles will go up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>You would be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister pretend that he is satisfied that the guarantees, or attempted guarantees obtained from some potential manufacturer would be worth anything?  I am rather surprised that Deputy McGilligan, late Minister for Industry and Commerce, criticises the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, in the reply he made when he said that prices would not increase as a result of the tariffs.  As far as my recollection goes Deputy McGilligan often made use of that statement when he was Minister.  I think, also, he knew something about guarantees being given as to prices not being increased as the result of tariffs.  I would like to get from the Minister what I think is very much more important, <Col N="95" /> and that is, as to how many of the rapidly increasing number of unemployed are to be absorbed as a result of the tariffs.  If there are to be a fairly decent number of unemployed absorbed, I am prepared to stand over the tariffs, even though they lead to an increase in the cost of living&mdash;that is, supposing there is not an undue increase in the cost of living.  But it seems to me, and I think it will be borne out by results, that those duties are imposed more for the reason of raising revenue than for protecting industries.</P>

      <P>This was to prevent this duty bringing in increased revenue from it.  We have had all this before.  We have had these same arguments every time that a tariff was brought before the Dáil.  Deputy McGilligan attacked them in his intricate way trying to prove that prices would go up, and Deputy Morrissey says that he had no reason to believe that prices would not go up.</P>

      <P>We put certain duties on plaster slabs, and we believed that the prices would not increase on these plaster slabs, and Deputy Morrissey said he would leave it to Deputy McGilligan to prove by all sorts of abstruse theories and figures that the prices would go up.  Yet the facts were, that since we proposed the duties the price has gone down by 25 per cent.</P>

      <P>The actual fact is that the price has dropped 25 per cent. There is nothing more prejudicial than that beautiful theories should be killed by actual facts and that presentation of actual facts should kill beautiful theories.  It is an actual fact that the price went down, quality for quality, by 25 per cent. as a result of the duties that we imposed and in spite of the fine theories that have been put forward by Deputies opposite.</P>

      <P>Not merely quality but cost of raw material.  If the cost of the raw material fell 50 per cent. and the article is tariffed 25 per cent. obviously it is increased in price if the price remains the same.  Relatively it is an increase in price.  That type of petty quibble does not stand as fact to destroy theory.  The Minister's theory is thus destroyed by the fact which is within everybody's knowledge that all this nonsense of guarantee cannot be carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have said it with regard to specific articles.  I would have said about specific articles in 1925, in the case of the manufacture of shirts, for instance, that, every relation of quality and cost of material taken into consideration, it was just as good as the manufactured article on the other side.  It is that that keeps the price low, not any guarantee by the manufacturer.  But if the manufacturing capacity of this country is more than enough for the needs of the country and they have to look to the export trade you do not get prices lower until you get such intensive home competition as will keep prices down.  And even that could be nullified by the formation of a ring. If you have an industry where the home manufacturing capacity is more than the home consumption and where no ring has been formed you are on the way to keeping your prices low. I have not made myself responsible for stating that prices must be higher because of a tariff, but that the effect of a tariff is to make relative prices higher.  And there you have not merely a question of quality, but where the cost of the raw material has gone down, the price of the manufactured article will fall.  The Minister's example is that these plaster slabs have fallen 25 per cent. since the duty was put on.  If that were so why is it they did not think of producing these things in the country before now?  If they were capable of reducing the price by one-fourth what was the necessity for protection? Could they not have lowered the price? What do they need a tariff for at all? It is a thing that does not require protection and, therefore, some other circumstances must have been necessary. If that is the fact I think it is so ridiculous that it cannot be accepted without some more precise details by the Minister; there must be some explanation.  The thing is so ridiculous I do not believe it.  I would suggest the explanation is what <Col N="98" /> is given.  Certain things that go to the composition of these particular slabs have been reduced in price at a time when there is a fall in price in everything.  The raw material is reduced and consequently you get the drop in price.  If there has been a 25 per cent. reduction it absolutely does away with the necessity for a tariff.  If the Minister would waive the thing, let him face up to the details, quote the prices from particular areas, and comparisons made, and then give a specific case.</P>

I should like to ask the Minister what he means by compositions made of plaster of paris in sheets or slabs.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister <Col N="99" /> to go into that very fully because, remember, plaster slabs as the trade understand them, are one thing and they are very extensively made in this country, but there are also what I might call boards&mdash;I suppose the technical name would be emulsified wood fibre&mdash;in which plaster would be partly incorporated.  These sheets or slabs are not made at all in this country, and this simply means that you are adding the amount of the tariff on to the cost straight away.  I should like the Minister to consider and tell us when he can give us an answer to this&mdash;Is there anything more than plaster slabs covered by this Resolution?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to raise the point to which Deputy Dockrell referred. There is a very much wider application of this tariff than that which the Minister suggests.  As far as I know the importation of ordinary fibrous slabs is comparatively small. In fact I do not know that any slabs&mdash; and I have a knowledge of the trade&mdash; were imported for some time past, even prior to the tariff.  What the tariff does hit is the other board to which Deputy Dockrell referred, and which is largely composed of plaster. It is also very largely used in the building industry.  If that particular board is tariffed, it is not manufactured in this country and the tariff would be no advantage to the country, but would increase the price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is trying to represent that only plaster slabs are subject to the tariff.  I suggest that emulsified wood composition in which plaster is incorporated might conceivably come under the definition and that is what I want to be made clear <Col N="100" /> upon.  If Deputy Good and myself are correct in our contention, there is no point in the contention of the Minister that the price of the article will not be increased because the amount of the duty will be added on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I say with all due respect that the Minister's contention that this tariff will not increase the price of the article will not hold, because these articles are not manufactured in this country, nor is there any likelihood of their being made in the country.  The Minister has made a contention which I rather challenge. However, that is beside the question as against the bigger and wider issue of the enormous quantity of these slabs which are used.</P>

It is mainly desired to protect the hand-embroidery industry, which is affected by the exportation of linen, which is embroidered abroad and re-imported and sold here as hand-embroidered Irish linen.

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The manufacturers made application for an increase of the duty on the ground that there was a small import trade carried on for other considerations than value&mdash;because of trading connections or reasons of that sort.  Certain firms engaged in the distributive trade were also drawing supplies from parent houses outside the country.  It was desired to stop that business and to secure that small amount of additional trade for the Irish factories. As the Deputy is aware, the Irish factories are supplying a very large percentage of our requirements, and have an export trade as well.  They are capable of supplying all our requirements. But there is an import of certain highly-advertised brands of goods by firms which have association with firms in other countries.</P>

      <P>So far as I know, the situation with regard to shirts and collars was&mdash;if we leave out certain special articles, of which the Faulat shirt and collar are the main ones&mdash; that we were, in fact, meeting the home demand so far as shirts and collars of the ordinary type were concerned. There might, of course, be special items which were not being met.  I do not know whether or not the manufacture of dress shirts has got to the point where we could say that the home demand is being met from within the country.  I do not know whether or not a difficulty which used to exist with regard to the finishing of some of these articles has been got over.  The finishing of some of these goods for shop window-dressing purposes had to be done outside the country.  These articles were manufactured here, exported for finishing purposes and re-imported.  Are these articles now to be charged this extra duty on the value of the articles themselves, or only on the value of the addition to them by whatever process takes place outside?  Take the question of laundering, so far as certain types of shirts are concerned. Some firms assert that they cannot get <Col N="105" /> that done inside the country.  The practice is to get it done outside the country.  Is the 90 per cent. going to be applied to articles exported for a particular process and imported again?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only 45 per cent. in this case.  That question has been under examination, and I think it is no longer the case that that particular process cannot be done here.  That concession was given in the past because of certain difficulties, but I think those difficulties have ceased to operate.  The question whether that concession can be continued is up for consideration, apart altogether from the amount of the duty in operation. If it were decided to continue the concession, then this new duty would operate upon the value added by the laundering process done outside the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to one component part&mdash;the band.  Certain manufacturers in Deputy Dillon's constituency felt that the cutting or shaping of the band, the <Col N="106" /> trouble in sending it out to be laundered in a particular way and the sending of it back again caused so much trouble and expense that it was better for them to import the bands. A very successful industry was built up in Donegal in these circumstances.  It is a pity to spoil the most successful, to my mind, of the tariffed industries by putting on a tax of 45 per cent. in relation to bands which, in certain localities, are better brought in. Compared with the trouble and expense, the number of people who will be put into employment will be quite negligible.  As I consider this to be a successful industry, I should like to see it getting whatever slight remaining portion of the home market it has not got.  Again, the 15th November is the fateful day for this industry, which has a good export trade.  It is likely to lose that if the 10 per cent. duty goes on in Britain, and the signs are that the 10 per cent. duty will go on.  If this duty is mainly directed against the Faulat shirt and collar it is very welcome.</P>

      <P>It may be either hand-work or machine work.  Firms in the Saorstát have installed machines for doing embroidery in that way.  One of the main difficulties is that Irish linen is sent to Madeira and China, embroidered there by very cheap labour and sent back and sold here as Irish linen, hand embroidered.  That embroidery work was mainly done in Donegal in former times and the purpose of this duty is to secure that embroidery business for the hand-workers in Donegal.  The firms engaged in machine embroidery are quite capable of protecting their own interests.</P>

      <P>Yes.  This new duty applies to underclothing made of silk which is usually sold at a very high price, and, in fact, upon articles of that kind the operation of the tariff was of little effect, because the difference in price which operated did not in fact influence the purchase of articles made here as against those imported. They were being imported by certain firms which engage in this very high-class trade, and the duty is being increased to secure that the work will be done here, where it can be done and done excellently, as several people who are competent to do so have certified. It is only by making the price of the imported article substantially higher than the price of the native article that the attention of the customer will be drawn to the fact that <Col N="108" /> an advantage is to be secured by buying the native article.  In view of the high price that rules for these things, the difference in price which has operated heretofore has not been sufficiently effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not understand what the Minister said when running through the Resolutions.  It is clear, however, that there is going to be a duty of ½d. per lb. charged on all bread, which includes certain other things, brought into the Free State after 27th October of this year.  This, in the main, affects the cross-land frontier trade.  It is going to affect <Col N="110" /> Donegal and County Louth.  It is going, possibly, to affect the town of Letterkenny, as a distributing centre, and Dundalk more than any other two places in the country.  The Minister, however, went on to say, as far as I understood him, that Section 2 was included because, up to date, the situation had not very much changed for the better from what it was in the summer time with regard to the baking of bread in Donegal.  I wonder has it changed at all for the better as far as Louth is concerned?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, there is going to be permission given to the Minister for Finance, in consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to authorise or to license people to import articles chargeable with the duty without limit as to time or quantity, and that provision was explained as due to the fact that the situation was not satisfactory so far as Donegal was concerned.  I wonder could we get that in a more precise way.  What was the value of the bread, including these other things, imported into Donegal across the land frontier for two years past, or the first six months, or any period at all comparable, in 1930 and 1931, and what has been imported over a comparable number of months in 1932, so that we can get some idea how far the situation is better from the angle of getting Donegal people supplied with home-baked or Donegal-baked bread rather than the imported stuff?  There was a promise of more than one bakery in Donegal if certain things were done. I want to find out how far they have fructified and where we are with regard to what passed across the frontier and what will pass hereafter subject to the duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no separate figures available which would show the importation into Donegal.  The total importations last year were valued at £225,000 and the amount of that which went into Donegal, so far as we have been able to discover, is substantially less than one would assume to be the case on the population of that county and the population <Col N="111" /> of the other counties into which bread was sent; mainly, we deduce, for the reason that a much larger amount of the bread consumed in Donegal is home-made bread than elsewhere.  The position as far as Louth is concerned is that there are some excellent bakeries, in fact bakeries in sufficient number and of sufficient size to supply not merely the requirements of the County Louth, but also the requirements of neighbouring counties.  I do not think there need be any doubt as to the ability of these bakeries to supply the needs of that part of the country.  One bakery has such a reputation for a certain class of bread that it gets orders from the City of Dublin in competition with the Dublin bakers.</P>
      <P>As far as Louth, Monaghan, Cavan, Sligo, Roscommon and Longford are concerned, they have an adequate supply of bread from the existing bakeries.  The Belfast bread has been going into all these districts.  As far as Donegal is concerned, the position is definitely unsatisfactory.  I had hoped that those engaged in the bakery business in Donegal would have shown a little more enterprise in preparing themselves for the period when this duty would be imposed, as the intention to impose it was definitely announced.  It is difficult to know what precisely is the position there. Conflicting statements have been made. Clearly, the existing bakeries could not supply half the ordinary requirements of the county.  Of course, developments will take place.  There is a new bakery being established in the northern end of the county and certain proposals in respect of another bakery are in my Department.  From personal conversation with persons engaged in the business there I know the intention is to extend or to establish bakeries in other districts in the county.  Of course that will take some time.  In the meantime it will be necessary to ensure that a supply of bread will go into the county.  That supply comes at present from Belfast.</P>

      <P>A big lot of it comes from Belfast.  Personally, I can see no reason why it should not be possible to send bread to Donegal from other Saorstát counties by rail, just as it can be sent from Belfast to Donegal by rail.  That is a matter which will have to be examined in more detail.  The position will be that for the present we will permit into Donegal whatever quantity of bread is required, and we will reduce or stop that supply only when we are satisfied that the bakeries within the county or other bakeries in neighbouring counties can meet the needs of the people.  The imposition will confer substantial benefits on the bakers in the other parts of the northern counties who have suffered by reason of assisted competition from the Six County bakeries, and it will help to increase employment substantially in the industry.  We hope that the position in Donegal will rectify itself in a short time.  The matter will have to come up for review in the event of that not taking place.</P>

      <P>I would like, on a special item like this, to get some of these theories tested.  I know the situation with regard to Louth is very much as has been described.  I know there is in County Louth a number of excellent bakeries, as far as one can judge.  Yet these people found themselves for a long time subject to a competition from Belfast bakeries that they could not stand up against. They were being undersold.  The Minister stated that there was unfair competition and, to some extent, assisted competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the words &ldquo;assisted competition&rdquo; came in. What is the allegation this time?  Is it cheap Belfast labour?  We would, of course, expect to hear about cheap Japanese labour and cheap Madeira labour.  Is it cheap Belfast labour this time, or is it that the railway system is so much better managed so <Col N="113" /> far as the Six County part is concerned that freights can be reduced so that bread from Belfast can be sold in County Louth at a rate less than at which the bread manufactured in County Louth itself can be retailed? We have what would appear to be excellent bakers in the county, and they advertise; they do not find themselves limited, in the way of capital. They have been in business for a long time and are provided with good machinery and a fairly good system of distribution.  Yet these people have found themselves undersold in their own county by Belfast bakers.</P>
      <P>The situation in Donegal is a different matter.  There has not been a great deal of manufacturing there and, in the main, Donegal used to be supplied from Derry.  Belfast bread came into Donegal against the competition from Derry.  I had not thought the Belfast competition was so successful that it could now be said that the main bulk of the Donegal requirements were coming from Belfast, and not from the city of Derry.  It used not be so.  There must have been some examination of this matter before the Minister decided on a tariff.  What is the situation?  What is the explanation of the peculiar situation in Louth which has forced the Minister to come to the aid of these people?  What is the nature of the assisted competition?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Special assistance in the matter of railway freights.  Special facilities are given to Belfast bakers, as a result of arrangements come to with the railway company, to import bread into the Twenty-Six Counties at special rates.  Special fast services are also supplied.  That is an ordinary business arrangement.  The main reason why the Belfast bakers have been able to compete so successfully in the Twenty-Six Counties is because of the fact that night baking is permitted in bakeries in Belfast.  The trade unions will not allow night baking in bakeries here, and I think there is an International Convention at present going round having in view the abolition of night baking altogether.</P>

      <P>I know, but there is a volume of international opinion in favour of abolishing night baking.  The fact is that night baking is permitted in Belfast, and it makes a substantial difference in the cost of production of bread.  The Prices Tribunal which operated some years ago stated that it represented the difference of ½d. in the 4 lb. loaf.  That difference has enabled the Belfast bakers to compete in the Twenty-Six Counties against the Twenty-Six County bakers.  I am not at all sure that there may not be other reasons.  It is quite possible that the organisation of the Belfast bakeries and the size of their operations have also enabled them to reduce costs and to compete with the bakeries existing here.  There is and always has been some doubt as to whether the price which prevailed for bread in the Twenty-Six Counties was as low as it might be.  The Food Prices Tribunal gave that matter very careful attention, and reported that in a number of districts the price of bread was higher than the price of the materials and labour appeared to justify.</P>
      <P>However, the position is that no increase in the price of bread is anticipated or should take place, and there can be no question of the adequacy of the bakeries in the particular counties to meet the requirements of the people. If there is an increase in the price of bread or a failure to effect a reduction when a reduction is due to take place, we would have to reconsider the position in respect of this duty if it were not possible to take action under other legislation which may be enacted.</P>

      <P>I would like an assurance from the Minister that in case there is a new bakery established in Donegal immediate assistance will be given by way of licence in regard to flour supplies.  I take it that the men who will indulge in this venture will be new to the flour trade, and any handicap in that direction would tend to embarrass them.  If they were assured of a licence in respect of flour supplies it would be a source of encouragement to them.</P>

      <P>Quite definitely the flour situation will have to be taken <Col N="115" /> into account.  As regards the volume of flour, the requirements of our people are calculated by taking the output of the Irish mills and the volume of flour imported.  There has to be added the flour content of the bread imported and, consequently, the amount of flour to be imported to assist the production of the Irish mills will have to be increased by an amount equivalent to the flour content of the bread now excluded. In the event of bread being produced in Donegal in lieu of being imported it will be necessary to permit into Donegal the volume of flour represented by the volume of bread excluded.</P>

      <P>That, apparently, has been lost sight of.  It was on the advice of the bakers concerned that this tariff on bread coming across the Border was put on.  It will be understood that the quality of bread in the Saorstát will decline in proportion to the extent that we cannot buy the more high-class patent flours.  It was felt that the Belfast bakers, being able to buy their flour in an unrestricted market, where they would be able to pick the world's wheat, would be able to undersell in competition with the Saorstát bakers.  I think that was the problem as far as Louth and the <Col N="116" /> eastern counties are concerned.  The same things applies to Donegal.  The Minister has given the matter a very sympathetic hearing, and the trade agrees, on the whole, with the action the Minister has taken in the matter. I quite understand that in the event of any baking industry being started in Donegal that the necessary facilities and the necessary licences will be given.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister in regard to Donegal whether he has given any consideration as to the method in which he will permit the imports of bread pending the establishment of adequate baking facilities? Will he issue licences to Hughes' and English's and other outside bread manufacturers or will the individual purchasers in Donegal get licences? Will he see that no undue hardship is suffered by any man who is in the bread distributing trade as a result of these restrictions?  Will he see that neither Hughes' nor other outside bakers will be able to use their powers of allocation of bread to bring pressure on any particular distributor, and will he see that the distributors in Donegal will be protected in the interregnum between the imposition of this tariff and the setting up of adequate plants in Donegal for producing the necessary supplies of bread?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said in explanation of the phrase about existing competition that there are two or three items to be taken into consideration:&mdash;First, the railroads of the Six Counties give special arrangements with regard to freights.  It seems to be peculiar that this is done in the Great <Col N="117" /> Northern Line, but that it cannot be insisted upon as far as the Free State portion of that line is concerned. Would the Minister find out how much of the bread is carried by motor vans along the road?  So far as there is the motor distribution by road that would negative the distribution by railways. I suggest that matter immediately falls for consideration.  The railways in Northern Ireland get certain advantages which are not very much, but they will certainly be small as far as consignments of bread are concerned. They are not subject to the duty on coal to which the Free State railways are subject.  It is hardly proper to impose what is likely to be an extra charge upon the community.  The second item was night baking.  I have not the reference by me at the moment, but I will be surprised if the Minister's statement is found to be accurate as to night baking in Belfast practically reducing the price of bread sold in Louth by a ¼d. in the 4 lb. loaf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A ½d. in the 4 lb. loaf.  That is the report of the Prices Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder does it. Does it come to this&mdash;that night labour in Belfast is cheaper?  I would be surprised to hear that that is a fact.  Is it not possible that the Food Prices Tribunal found that the taste of the people lay towards fresh bread, and that the Tribunal thought that that taste quite possibly accounted for ½d. in the 4 lb. loaf; in other words that the people would pay more than ½d. for a night loaf as against the loaf baked the day before?  I have not looked at the reference, but I would be surprised to find that baking done by night is cheaper than baking in the ordinary hours.  I cannot imagine a trade union letting that go.  These are the items which the Minister gave in what he described as the assistance given to the Belfast bakers which enabled them to compete against and knock out the highly equipped and well-managed bakeries in Louth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is considerable doubt as to whether the price of bread had been sufficiently low in the Saorstát, but it was a peculiar way of meeting that by <Col N="118" /> putting an extra ½d. on the 4 lb. loaf.  If the price of bread is too high now it will still remain too high.  The Minister's claim is that these schemes of control are going to do what competition has not been able to do, and he puts a tariff against the competitive factor.  Is he going to succeed in getting the price of bread lower or in keeping the price as it is?  If these firms have been complaining that they have been suffering economic hardship by reason of the competition from Belfast, is it not a most reasonable thing to think that they will recoup themselves now by raising the price of bread? Why should they continue to sell bread at an uneconomic price once the competitive factor is removed?  They have got to recoup themselves for certain losses for a certain period. Even if those who are in the trade feel peeved with this I think they will have to take whatever scant comfort they can from the fact that the price of bread per the Minister's Prices Tribunal has been too high. Presumably the attention of this new Commission will be directed to bread as one of the special articles of food reported upon by the Tribunal.  Still the first move in all this is to put ½d. per pound impediment on the competitive bread which comes in.</P>

      <P>I move the Second Reading.  The purpose of this Bill is to establish machinery for the examination of complaints that excessive prices are being charged, either retail or wholesale, for articles of common necessity and for certain other articles, <Col N="119" /> and to enable action to be taken if these complaints are found to be justified.  The machinery established by the Bill is, I think, easily understandable. In the first place there will be a body which will be known as the Prices Commission.  It will be a permanent body with certain defined powers and composed of five members, of whom two may be women and of whom one shall be nominated after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and shall be representative of agricultural interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Two must be women?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, two must be women.  The Commission thus established will have at its disposal whatever staff is necessary for its work and will be empowered to make regulations concerning its procedure.  It will also have conferred upon it powers vested in the High Court for the summoning of witnesses, administering of oaths and the procuring of evidence. The Secretary of the Commission will be a person who will be styled the Controller of Prices, and who, apart from his function as Secretary of the Commission, will have certain other defined duties and powers set out in the Bill. As far as the Commission is concerned it is intended that whenever a complaint is submitted to it by any person or whenever the Minister requests the Commission to examine the prices charged, either retail or wholesale, for a particular commodity of common consumption, either generally or in specified areas, that Commission will have power and will have the duty of carrying out the necessary investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That part of the Commission's work relates to the investigation of the general price levels.  It will consider whether the prices charged for a particular commodity in the whole of the Saorstát or any particular area are excessive or otherwise.  If as a result of their investigations they come to the conclusion that the prices were unduly high they may serve notice to that effect upon the parties concerned, and it is intended they should take <Col N="120" /> whatever action they consider necessary by negotiation to effect a reduction in these prices.  If, however, they fail in their efforts to secure a reduction in prices by these means they are required to report to the Minister setting out all the facts ascertained by them in relation to the prices, the reasons why they are unduly high, their opinion as to what the proper level of prices should be and also their opinion as to the best method of securing a reduction in the prices.  But behind all that lies the power conferred upon the Minister upon a recommendation of the Commission to, in the last resort, fix the maximum price of the articles specified by order and to make that maximum price compulsory on all those engaged in the sale of the article in question either retail or wholesale as the case may be.  I think that most Deputies will admit that in any price investigation there are two conditions which are essential to the success of the investigation.  One is that the investigating body must have power to compel attendance of witnesses and get whatever evidence they require. We have conferred that power upon the Commission.  They must have some authority in the last resort to fix the maximum price.</P>
    <P>In the absence of either of these powers the investigations of the Committee will be of little value, and it would be possible for those who are guilty of charging excessive prices for articles of common necessity to flout the authority of the Commission. A part altogether from the fact that the general level of prices of particular commodities may be too high in the Saorstát or in any particular areas there is also reason to believe and numerous complaints have been received that particular retailers and particular wholesalers sell to particular individuals articles of common necessity occasionally at excessive prices.  We have got to distinguish between a general price which is too high and the particular price charged by a retailer to a customer which is too high, because the retailer thinks he can get away with it on that particular occasion, even though the <Col N="121" /> next customer comes into the shop and gets the same article at a low price.</P>
    <P>For the first problem, the problem of the general prices level we have established a Commission.  It is the function of the Commission to investigate complaints in that regard, and to take whatever action is necessary, and report to the Minister on its findings, and when we come down to deal not with general price levels but particular prices charged on particular occasions, we have got to get another type of machine, and it is here that the control of prices comes in.  Now we were anxious in drafting this legislation to devise a method by which we could deal with the profiteer&mdash;the profiteering shop-keeper&mdash;while at the same time we would not place an undue hardship upon or create new difficulties for the genuine and honest trader.  I think we have devised such a method; the procedure to be followed under Part 4 of the Bill is that a person who has been charged, or from whom there has been demanded a price for a commodity which he believes to be excessive, may make a complaint to the Controller of Prices in the manner set out in Section 27 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>When the Controller gets that complaint he may, if he considers it frivolous, disregard it entirely or proceed to carry out an investigation.  It is clear, of course, that if the article in respect of which a complaint has been made in this case is an article in respect of which a Price Fixing Order has already been made in consequence of a report from the Commission that the proper course to take in such circumstances would be to prosecute the offender for a breach of that Order. Consequently, if the Controller on getting a complaint finds that it relates to an article in respect of which a Price Fixing Order has already been made, he proceeds no further with the matter.  There are two grounds therefore on which the Controller may disregard the complaint.  One is that in his opinion it is frivolous; the second is that it relates to an article for which a Price Fixing Order has already been made.  If he does not disregard the complaint on either of those grounds and gives it an investigation, he uses <Col N="122" /> for this purpose an inspector appointed under the Act.  The inspector, by personal contact with the complainant and with the shopkeeper against whom the complaint is made, endeavours to ascertain all the facts, and his efforts are enforced by certain powers conferred upon him.</P>
    <P>Section 29 (3) enables a person who refuses to give information to an inspector, in relation to a matter which is being investigated, to be punished. If, when the inspector has reported to the Controller, the Controller is of opinion that an excessive price has in fact been charged, the Controller sends to the seller a notice to that effect, telling him that in his opinion he has charged an excessive price for this particular article, including the price which in the opinion of the Controller would have been a fair price for the article, and requiring the seller to give to the Controller an undertaking in writing not to charge an excessive price for that article again, and if a sale has taken place to refund to the purchaser the amount by which the purchaser was overcharged.  If the seller does that, if he refunds the amount of the overcharge and gives an undertaking not to overcharge in future, the matter drops.  If the seller, however, refuses to give the undertaking or to act in accordance with the wishes of the Controller in that respect the Controller issues a certificate which is called &ldquo;A Price (Retail) Certificate&rdquo; or &ldquo;A Price (Wholesale) Certificate&rdquo; as the case may be, in which is set out what, in the opinion of the Controller, would be a reasonable price to be charged for that article in the particular district in which the sale took place.  A copy of that certificate is sent to the shopkeeper or to the wholesaler and the terms of it are published in a newspaper circulated in that district.  If, subsequent to the issue of the certificate, and while the certificate is in force, the same seller again commits the same offence&mdash;the offence of charging an excessive price for that particular article&mdash;he then becomes liable to prosecution.  It is clear, therefore, that there are three steps. If a sale has taken place at what in <Col N="123" /> the opinion of the purchaser is an excessive price the purchaser makes a complaint to the Controller and the Controller then proceeds, in accordance with this Act, through the three processes I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>First of all he investigates the complaint. If he finds that the complaint is well founded he notifies the seller to that effect, requires him to refund the amount of the overcharge and to give an undertaking not to overcharge in future.  If the seller agrees to that course the matter ends.  If the seller does not agree to that course a certificate is issued by the Controller and published in the Press, to the effect that this particular person on a particular occasion sold a particular article at a price which was in excess of the reasonable price, and including what in the opinion of the Controller the reasonable price should have been. That is an attempt to bring the force of public opinion to bear upon the shopkeeper in question, and induce him to charge a reasonable price as a result of the publicity given to his action.  If he fails to do that, if despite the publication of the certificate and the representations of the Controller he persists in charging for the particular article a price which is excessive, he becomes liable to prosecution and, in certain circumstances at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment. Now the third purpose of this Bill is set out in Part V.  I have explained that the function of the Commission is to investigate complaints concerning the general level of prices for particular commodities, either the retail or the wholesale price, in the whole of the Saorstat or in particular areas.  I have explained that the purpose of the Controller is to exercise control over the particular prices charged in particular places in any part of the Saorstát.  There is a third type of investigation that is necessary and that is in relation to manufacturers' prices for protected commodities. We have had discussions here from time to time&mdash;we had them only this afternoon&mdash;as to the effect of tariffs on prices.  We have had allegations made that the imposition of <Col N="124" /> tariffs always leads to a rise in prices. We have had our experience and there are facts and figures available to show that, in particular cases at any rate, the imposition of a tariff had the opposite effect, but be that as it may, there is no doubt that in this country, because of the smaller number of industrial units which we have, it is always possible for those industrialists who enjoy the benefit of a protective tariff to combine amongst themselves to exploit the market.  I do not suggest that any evidence that such has happened to any extent is available.</P>
    <P>In one or two cases there are circumstances which would indicate to me that the necessity for getting this Bill through quickly exists, because the information available is such that I would like to have it investigated. Clearly there is a danger there, and clearly it is a danger against which we must have some power of taking care of ourselves other than the very drastic power of destroying the market.  At the present time if we found a group of manufacturers combining to exploit the market we have only one weapon against them and that is the removal of the tariff, which would undoubtedly have serious consequences for those manufacturers, but would also have very serious consequences for the large number of workers employed by them, who are not guilty of the attempted profiteering.  This Bill is designed to give us that other weapon.  Part V. of the Bill empowers the Minister at any time to require the Commission to carry out an investigation into the manufacturers' prices for a particular protected commodity, and enables the Commission on its own initiative to carry out on its own behalf a continuous investigation into the prices charged in respect of protected commodities. The intention is that there should be this continuous investigation into the prices of protected articles, and that from time to time the Commission would report to the Minister on all the articles set out in Section 33. &ldquo;(b) The movements of the prices of such commodity over a specified period; (c) whether in the opinion of the Commission such prices are or are not unreasonably high, together with <Col N="125" /> the reasons for such opinion; (d) their opinion as to whether such prices are influenced by any agreement or combination for interfering with free competition.&rdquo; And, if the Commission are of opinion that unreasonably high prices have been charged, they report, as in the previous case, what a reasonable price would be and the steps to be taken to secure it, and whether, in the last resort, a price-fixing order should be made.  In this case, as in other cases, if no other method can be found of securing a reasonable level of price, there is power conferred on the Minister to make a price-fixing order. I am inclined to think that, when the present circumstances, which are, to some extent, abnormal, in so far as the economic policy of the country is undergoing a period of transition and a number of new tariffs have come into operation in a short period, have passed, one of the main functions of this Commission will be in relation to the sections of this Bill which deal with the investigation of the prices of protected articles.  It is, however, desirable that we should have, at all times, machinery available for examining complaints in relation to articles and power to deal with those responsible for profiteering, in the event of the complaints being found to be justified. That is why we recommend this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, quite clear that there is necessity for this legislation.  Even if all the complaints which have been made from time to time, made either in letters to my Department or voiced here in this Dáil, are found on examination to be without justification, it is a good thing, from the point of view of maintaining public confidence, that an investigation should be made and that some body with the powers to carry out that investigation should exist.  That is the main justification for the Bill.  We think that in a modern State, and, particularly, in a State in which a protective policy is in operation, some such machinery should exist.</P>
    <P>I am not really in a position to offer any solid opinion as to whether there is real foundation for some of the complaints which have been made. <Col N="126" /> In so far as we have been able to carry out investigations, we have found that undoubtedly in a number of cases particular shop-keepers did charge excessive prices.  I do not say that we have found that the general level of prices has been unduly high.  I mention the fact that there are one or two of the protected industries in respect of which I would like very much to see the position examined, because, even though we are unable to say that excessive prices have been charged, I am, nevertheless, not satisfied with the information in my possession which goes to show that excessive prices are not being charged, and I would like to see some body with power to compel the production of evidence going into the matter.  It is possible that they will find that my suspicions&mdash;if I might use even so strong a term as that&mdash;are completely without justification, but, in the event of their finding the reverse to be the case, I want to have the facts clearly stated and, in the last resort, power to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>The main reason why the Bill has urgency, however, arises from the fact that there is undoubtedly need for the exercise of the powers which it is proposed to confer on the controller under this Bill.  It is undoubtedly the case that, here and there throughout the country, there are shopkeepers who trade on public ignorance in order to charge excessive prices for articles which are imported either free of duty, or subject to duty, or which are produced here by protected industries. Some very glaring examples were brought to my notice, and, although we had no power to procure evidence, and no power to take action if the evidence showed that profiteering was, in fact, taking place, such investigations as we have carried out, did undoubtedly show that profiteering was taking place.  We have had glaring examples in which it was proved that shopkeepers actually removed the ticket that was affixed to an article by the manufacturer indicating the price at which that article was to be sold and substituting for it another ticket indicating a higher price and securing that higher price in particular <Col N="127" /> cases until a complaint was made. Consequently, it is desirable that a controller should be appointed and that he should have these powers to investigate these cases in the manner I have indicated.</P>
    <P>I will admit that it is not at all unlikely that the number of cases which may come to the controller for investigation may be few.  That will be due to the fact that the very passage of the Bill, and the appointment of a controller with these powers, will in itself exercise a deterring effect on any profiteering instincts which individual shopkeepers may have.  I would like to say this, that our experience has been that, in the majority of cases, profiteering is not taking place.  So far as we have been able to discover, by far the majority of our shopkeepers are honest people who are trying merely to make a reasonable profit on the articles they have to sell, but, here and there in the country, in different towns and in different cities, there are undoubtedly people who take advantage of some special circumstances, or some special advantage possessed by them, in order to secure excessive prices, and we want to get at these people, and to induce them, in the first instance, if possible, to mend their ways, and, if they will not do that, to expose them to the public, and, if that is not sufficient, to put them in jail where some of them should be.</P>
    <P>Part 6 of the Bill is merely consequential on the other provisions.  It is designed to secure that where an employer is prosecuted for an offence under the Bill, he can make a good defence to the charge if he establishes any of the things set out in paragraphs a, b, c. and d, or all of the things so set out, namely, that he used due diligence to prevent the commission of the acts alleged to constitute an offence; that the acts alleged to constitute such offence were not done by him personally; that the said acts were done without his consent, connivance or wilful default; and if he gives all necessary information to the officer investigating the matter. Similarly, if an employee is charged, <Col N="128" /> it will be a good defence for him to show that he was acting in the employment of another person, and that the acts alleged to constitute such offence were committed by him in the course of and for the purpose of such employment, and that they were committed by him in obedience to the express orders of the employer. Section 38 deals with contracts.  It is intended to secure that, where a price-fixing order comes into operation, during or immediately prior to the operation of a contract, the order shall be deemed not to operate in respect of the contract.</P>

The scope of the Bill, as at present defined, includes every commodity which is used for food, clothing, material for clothing or fuel, and, of course, under Part 5 of the Bill, protected commodities.  It is provided, however, that the Executive Council may by order extend the Bill to include within the Schedule any other article in respect of which it is desired to have an investigation carried out, but, of course, such order has to be submitted to the Dáil, under sub-section 3 of Section 3.  I have every confidence in recommending this Bill to the House, and I am quite sure that most Deputies will agree that there is necessity for legislation of this kind.  I cannot imagine that any person could seriously argue that, if there is reason to believe that profiteering is taking place on the part of individual shop-keepers, or that excessive prices are being charged by wholesalers or manufacturers, we should not have power to deal with people of that kind.  This Bill gives us that power.  Such power did not exist before.  The Prices Tribunal established in 1925 carried out elaborate investigations and reported. The making of this investigation had a good effect.  The fact that the Prices Tribunal was in existence at the time had, during its period of existence, a deterring effect on any excessive prices being charged, but when the tribunal reported, and went out of existence, the moral effect it had created disappeared with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the new circumstances that have <Col N="129" /> been created I do not think any useful purpose could be served by appointing periodical temporary commissions of that kind, if we are going to ensure that profiteering of any kind is not going to operate in this country.  We have to have a permanent commission, one with the powers proposed to be conferred on the commission appointed under this Bill.  It may be that in the course of a year or two, or in five years, circumstances will change, and we may find ourselves in a position to repeal this legislation without incurring any danger.  I hardly think that will arise so long as we are operating a protective policy, or so long as present circumstances continue.  I think a necessary corollary to a protection policy is the introduction of legislation of this kind.  Even if we were not operating a protective policy, and by reason of some of the complaints we have received, that individuals or organisations have been indulging in excessive profit taking, I think we should pass this legislation, and consequently I recommend the Bill to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister finishes I would point out that he has told us a good deal about what is in the Bill and explained why he wants certain machinery in respect of Part V to correct the rather slobbery approach to the Minister's tariff policy, but he did not make any case for Parts I, II, III and IV.  The Minister has told us what the machinery is to be.  Will he tell us what is the reason for setting up that machinery?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this measure, and I think the Minister is to be commended for the attempt he has made to devise machinery to control prices in this country.  There are parts of the Bill with which I do not agree.  In the main, I agree with the principle, and I think that most people, whether consumers or traders, who want to make an honest profit, who do not want to profiteer, as it is <Col N="130" /> commonly called, will also welcome the Bill and its machinery.  We hear a lot of charges made loosely, both in this House and in the country, about profiteering.  There might be, as the Minister stated, a case where there is profiteering, but it is very hard to define what profiteering is.  I know where there were individual cases of overcharging.  I am afraid that, very often when we talk about profiteering, the word is used, as we use many words in this country, in a very loose fashion.  The Minister mentioned, and I agree with the statement so often made both inside and outside this House, that the natural corollary to a protection or tariff policy is price fixing, or the control of prices.  No matter what the Minister may say we know, as a matter of fact, that when a tariff is put on, and particularly when you have very high tariffs as we have had in this country in recent months, the natural tendency is to increase prices to the highest point within the tariff.  Therefore, if this House decides to increase the existing tariffs or to impose new tariffs, it is bound, in fairness to consumers, to devise some machinery to control the prices which will have to be paid by consumers. It seems to me that this measure is not going to settle matters. The trouble seems to me&mdash;and I am sure it appeals to every Deputy that we have too many distributors; that the country in that respect is economically lop-sided, as the number of people engaged in distribution is out of all proportion to the number of people engaged in production.  The result is that the turnover of the retail distributor in city, town and village is very small, and we know that the smaller the turnover the higher the percentage of profit required.  It seems to me that that is, perhaps, what is at the root of most of the allegations of profiteering, and that what at first sight appears to be profiteering or overcharging, on examination is found not to be profiteering in the ordinarily understood sense of the word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am concerned I would like to see this House passing legislation to ensure that, whenever any person, <Col N="131" /> just as the whim takes them, opens a shop, a position would be brought about where that person could not do so unless some proper authority was satisfied that there was a necessity for such a shop in order to meet the demands of the locality. Of course that policy could be carried too far.  I do not want it to be carried to the point where a monopoly would be created, but that is a matter that could be guarded against.  I do not agree with the Minister where he pointed out that if a retailer is caught, or if a purchaser gives information to the proper authority that there was overcharging, and if it was proved that a shopkeeper succeeded in getting a higher price than that to which he was entitled, he is &ldquo;let off&rdquo; provided he gives an undertaking not to offend again.  I would not agree with that at all.  In effect, that means that the dishonest trader can go on overcharging until he is caught, and then if he gives an undertaking that he will not do it again, no charge will be brought against him.  By putting that provision into the Bill I think the Minister is simply playing with the whole problem.  It seems to me that the greatest difficulty the Commission to control prices will have to contend with will be the apathy of the public&mdash;the apathy of the consumers&mdash;and that it will be found even where there was overcharging&mdash;perhaps gross overcharging&mdash; while the consumers will grumble and grouse, they will be very slow to come forward to give evidence.  That was the experience of the Food Prices Tribunal which was set up by the late Government.  The members of that Tribunal travelled over the Free State and invited the public to come forward and give evidence.  In their report I think the Tribunal stated that there was overcharging but that they could not get people to come forward to give evidence.  I am afraid the Minister will find that while people will grumble locally about overcharging and profiteering they will be very slow to come forward with evidence.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to Part VI of the Bill.  The Minister told us that it <Col N="132" /> will be a good defence for the trader if he can show that the offence was not committed by himself.  I object very strongly to that provision.  We have too much of that kind of business where, when an employer or trader is charged with an offence, he throws the onus on the employee, and the employee, if he is to retain his position, must shoulder the blame.  Of course, we are told that it will be a good defence for the employee to show that he overcharged as a result of instructions from his employer, but we know &mdash;and particularly under present circumstances in the country with regard to employment&mdash;that the employee who makes that statement before the Commission or before the controller, will very soon find that his employer has no use for his services.  Therefore, that is a section which I would like the Minister to consider carefully between now and the Report Stage.  I realise, and I think we must all realise, that it is a very difficult matter to frame or to set up machinery that will deal adequately with this very difficult and complex matter, and that no matter what machinery you may set up it will be largely dependent for its success on the co-operation you are going to receive from the public and, in particular, from the consumer.  It seems to me that some such machinery is necessary, and I am only sorry that this machinery, or machinery somewhat similar to it, was not introduced before this.  Perhaps it is more urgent and more necessary now than ever.  I believe that it is more urgent and necessary now.  I believe that it is necessary over and above all others for the protection of the poor, particularly because the heaviest tariffs, the tariffs which will fall most heavily on the poor people, have been imposed during the lifetime of the present Government.  We know of many cases where articles costing a penny have cost threepence as a result of the tariff. We know that in many cases the retailer is not satisfied to add the amount of the tariff to the pre-tariff price, but that he adds considerably more, and we know that in the end the persons who suffer most by these matters are the very poor.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" /> We know also that the greatest profiteering, in so far as there is profiteering, is inflicted upon the very poor.  They have to buy in very small quantities, and the smaller the quantities in which they are compelled to buy the larger and heavier the price falls on them.  I would ask the Minister, therefore, to pay particular attention to that aspect of the case, and if he does, and if the body set up under this Bill get the co-operation which they are entitled to get from the consuming public, it will do a great deal of good.  I welcome the Bill, and I believe it will be welcomed by the consuming public of the country, and by the ordinary decent trader in the country who does not expect to get an extravagant profit for his business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most extraordinary Bill that I ever listened to, introduced into this House.  It is a Bill introduced without a scintilla of evidence to support it.  We have been listening for quite a period of time to charges of profiteering being made against the commercial community. Here in this House when this Bill is being introduced, the first thing that anybody interested in the general welfare of the country expects is at least a putting forward of some evidence to support these wild charges that have been made in the country. Deputy Morrissey, belonging to the Labour Party, referred to profiteering and by the very nature of his speech showed that he knew nothing at all about it.  The Minister, in introducing the Bill, also referred to profiteering, and wound up by saying that his Department had received quite a number of complaints, that these complaints had not been inquired into, that he did not know in essence whether they were true or false, and on the face of that evidence the country is treated to this Bill&mdash;treated to a Bill for the fixation of prices. There is not a word at all about the fixation of prices for labour or about the charges that labour involves in the cost of materials.  Anybody who has read the report of the Commission set up to inquire into the profiteering <Col N="134" /> charges made against the business community in this country must have been forcibly struck with the absolute injustice of introducing a measure of this kind into this House, fixing the retail and the wholesale prices for commodities while those people who made these commodities, especially the manufacturers of foodstuffs, such as the bakers and so on, can charge a price for their labour without any let or hindrance from the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are going to have a Bill of this kind introduced, let us be fair to all sections of the community.  Let us deal with labour just in the same way as we deal with the distributors of the commodities with which this Bill is intended to deal.  It is quite clear to the Minister that there is justification for this Bill, because a manufacturer's price ticket has been removed off the article to be sold.  I had an idea that the Minister for Industry and Commerce had some training as a business man.  I want to say this&mdash;that if in every instance where the price that a manufacturer marks upon an article for the retail price at which it was to be sold, if it were not sold at that price to please the manufacturer, what would it amount to in essence when the commercial community were in business for the benefit of the manufacturer and not for the community.  The idea that the removal of a price ticket was profiteering shows complete and absolute ignorance of the subject on which the Minister held forth for the past half hour.  This is a most important departure with private enterprise.  For years before we were born&mdash;for centuries one might say&mdash;this country has been well served by the distributing public and the distributing public is one of the poorest sections of the community if one analyses their actual financial position to-day.  Did any of the members read this 1926 Report and realise that in that Report it was estimated that there were 44,000 retailers in the Irish Free State, and only something like 10,000 of these were able to pay income-tax?  Is there any evidence of profiteering in the face of statements of that kind dealt with by the Commission set up to inquire into this <Col N="135" /> subject?  Is it not a fact that this particular section of the people are very poor?  Is it not a well-known fact that the business community is one of the best subscribing communities to the State?  If you take business premises they are rated at anything from four to five times that of the ordinary residential holding.  Is it not a fact that an occupier of a business premises pays four or five times the amount of money to the State than a man living in residential holdings such as I have mentioned may pay, although the latter may have ten times the income?  In Dublin to-day we realise the load that has been thrown upon the commercial community by the passage of the Dublin Poor Relief Bill.  I think I might say accurately that at any rate, roughly speaking, almost 50 per cent. of the money for poor relief comes from the business premises of the business community. And these are the people taxed.  It is only part and parcel of a general scheme to go further and deal further blows at the community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey referred, a moment ago, to profiteering, and said it was difficult to give a description of profiteering, and that what might be called profiteering by some people, for example, was, in reality, not profiteering at all.  Everyone in business knows that to be true.  If we are to introduce a measure of this kind we must have evidence to justify its introduction, and before it passes into law.  As I said, it is only part and parcel of a general plan evolving at the present time in the heads of the Government.</P>
    <P>We know that a Commission has been established to inquire into the licensing of shops.  I think, speaking without any animus, that it is almost a foregone conclusion, looking at the personnel of the Commission, that licensing of shops will be recommended as the result of the labours of the Commission. Looking at the personnel I only see the name of one businessman. If anybody knows anything about the matter surely he knows this is a business Commission, and surely it is in the interests of businessmen that they should seek to have a larger number <Col N="136" /> of the representatives of their interests upon that Commission.  I have met beneficent gentlemen who sit upon the bench and go to learned societies and discourse there upon shops, but I would like to put them into these business premises and ask them to make a living out of them.  Then we would see what their views were worth.  The whole essence of this thing can be summed up briefly.  It is an attack by the Government upon the second line of trenches.  The first attack was made upon the farming community. Now the commercial community are being attacked, and if the farming community and the commercial community are to be wiped out of existence and this scheme passes in addition to the licensing scheme of shops, there is no doubt that the commercial community will follow the way the farming community are going at the present time.</P>
    <P>I read the evidence at the 1926 Commission. I would like to quote one statement made, with regard to various matters that came before that Commission. Mr. Johnstone, a Fellow of Trinity College, a most learned man&mdash;I had the pleasure of being one of his pupils at one time and I know his brain and ability&mdash;said this: &ldquo;It is axiomatic that the State should interfere as little as possible with the management of business by the private citizen.&rdquo;  But the first thing we get here is the introduction of this Bill for the fixation of prices to the individual, but having nothing whatever to do with the value of the commodities concerned.  Another pleasant prospect we have to look forward to is the question of the sufficiency of shops.  Deputy Morrissey referred to the fact that there were far too many shops in the Free State.  No man in business will deny the truth of that statement.  There are certainly far and away too many shops, but if there are numerous shops in the country, what portion of the people should get the benefit of the surplus?  The general community.  If I am told that numbers do not lead to competition, that the fact that there are a good number of shops engaged in various lines of business, and that I am told that does not <Col N="137" /> lead to competition, I say God help the shopkeeper who has to deal with officials set up to administer an Act of this kind.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly plain to-day that the circulation of money in this country was never smaller.  It is a well-known fact that the business community in the Irish Free State, especially in Dublin, owing to the burden of taxation at the present time, are unable to meet their overhead charges and expenses. And we have now a Bill brought in for the fixation of prices and we are threatened, in addition, with a Bill for the licensing of shops. It is plain from the evidence in the Report of the Commission that one of the objects is to expedite the exit of influential businessmen as quickly as possible, and that these men will have to pay a license duty of £5 per shop upon their business premises and will provide, in that way, an income of £200,000 for the State.  I think that when we have elicited this piece of important information set down in the Report of the Commission to deal with this particular subject, we have the true and real reason why this Bill is introduced.  An income of £200,000 is to come to the State on the plan of this Bill as it stands.  We are naïvely informed in further evidence given to the Commission that it is a simple matter to increase the sum of £5 per shop if the State desires such an increase. They can increase the £200,000 to £400,000 or £600,000 if they wish. That will be income to the State.  The question I want to ask is this: Is that giving equitable treatment to the people who are distributing goods in this country?  Are they not equally entitled to receive the same treatment at the hands of the State as other sections of the community?  I have pointed out that there may be powers to reduce taxation if the taxation of the one is not undertaken at the expense of the other.  I want to ask this question: If people are put out of business and thrown upon the labour market at the present moment, what means exist for them to find new means of employment?  How are they to support themselves and their families if <Col N="138" /> thrown upon the labour market at the present time?</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>When I last reported to the House on the matter of the dispute between Great Britain and ourselves on financial matters the position, Deputies will remember, was this: There were two directions in which it might be possible to find an amicable settlement.  One was by way of arbitration. As regards arbitration, the British Government had signified its readiness to arbitrate on the question of the land annuities provided the Tribunal was of the character outlined in the 1930 Imperial Conference Report.  They wanted to restrict the personnel of the Tribunal to persons who were citizens of the States of the British Commonwealth. They made that a matter of principle. We, on our side, could not admit any such restriction.  It was no less a matter of principle with us that our nominees should be selected without restriction, that there should be no limitation of our choice.  An amicable settlement by way of arbitration was, therefore, practically ruled out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remaining way was by negotiation. When I met Mr. MacDonald, just on the eve of the imposition of the special tariffs, I made it clear that we were prepared to seek a solution by way of negotiation, but urged that if negotiations were at all to be protracted, it was desirable that they should be carried on in an atmosphere of peace rather than in the atmosphere of hostility which would be undoubtedly begotten by the imposition of tariffs by them, and by the counter measures which we would necessarily have to take.  The British Prime <Col N="139" /> Minister agreed, provided that we handed over the annuities which, as you know, we had put to a Suspense Account.  I pointed out that we could not do that, that the moneys were in the Suspense Account, and that they were immediately available the moment a settlement was arrived at. The conversations on that occasion resulted, as you know, in no agreement being reached, in the British imposing next day, or I think it was that night, their tariffs and later in our taking our counter measures.</P>
    <P>The position remained like that for some time until some time during the recess a proposal was made to me that, as a difficulty had arisen with regard to the land annuities, we should be prepared to show our good faith by putting the disputed moneys in the Bank for International Settlements during the progress of the negotiations. I signified acceptance of that proposal and my acceptance was conveyed to the British Government.  This happened whilst the Ottawa Conference was still going on.  Nothing came of it, and on Mr. Thomas's return from Ottawa I brought officially to his notice that we had accepted that proposal.  I got a reply indicating that the British would not accept the proposal.  But there was, in a summary of the position, an indication that another way was still left open, namely that of negotiation directly on the basis of the present position without any preliminary tariff truce.  In order that no way of trying to secure an amicable settlement should be left unexplored I consented to negotiation on that basis.  That was about the time I was going to Geneva. When in Geneva I was informed that the British Government was prepared to enter into negotiations on that basis and the suggestion was made that I might avail of the opportunity which would be afforded by my passing through London on my return to have a preliminary conference with British Ministers.  That conference, as you are aware I am sure, was held and it was decided that representatives of the two Governments should meet in London if possible on the 14th October, &ldquo;in order to see whether it is possible to <Col N="140" /> arrive at a comprehensive settlement of the future financial relations between the Irish Free State and the United Kingdom.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In order to see whether it is possible to arrive at a comprehensive settlement of the future financial relations between the Irish Free State and the United Kingdom.&rdquo; I promised also to let the British Government have a memorandum indicating the basis of our claims to withhold the payments that had been made up to that time.  We prepared that memorandum and it was handed in just before the negotiations, I think, the day before the negotiations began.  As the purpose of the negotiations was, as I have indicated, &ldquo;to see whether it was possible to arrive at a comprehensive settlement of the future financial relations between the Irish Free State and the United Kingdom,&rdquo; we put forward the claims that would be put forward, and should be put forward, whenever there was a question of what might be called an ultimate financial settlement between the two countries.  Both of these memoranda were discussed in detail at the conference.  Both sides argued on the various items and the discussion lasted, as you know, for a period of two days.  In the afternoon of the second day, October 15, both sides admitted that there was no possibility of arriving at an agreement and that further negotiations were not likely to yield any fruit.  It was agreed, therefore, that a public statement to that effect should be issued, and that our memoranda and the British replies to them, which were also to be in the form of memoranda: that these four documents, together with our final reply, should be published as a White Paper to both Parliaments, our reply to come roughly within a week or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the negotiations themselves <Col N="141" /> were concerned&mdash;the discussions &mdash;my view is that they could hardly be called negotiations at all; that they were really discussions, and that negotiations, in the proper sense, could hardly be applied to them. They served one purpose which was to show to each side what the other point of view was if that had not been known already, and they confirmed us in the belief that the British Government are not prepared, the present British Government at any rate, to admit the claims of this country to simple justice.  It is possible that if we were prepared, as they seemed to wish, to go in the role of beggars, hat in hand, asking for consideration and charity there might be a disposition to make minor modifications and some mitigation of their claim, but simple justice they were not prepared to concede.  They took their stand on the supposed inviolability of the secret documents of 1923 and 1926, and they refused to budge from that position.</P>
    <P>There is one matter perhaps that I should refer to so as to avoid misunderstanding of a passage in Mr. Thomas's statement in the British House of Commons yesterday.  I want to say that the Conference dealt solely with financial matters, but the British Government were aware that arising out of the position created by the Treaty this Government had assumed office as the Government of one of the States of the British Commonwealth, and that we were bound by pledges which precluded secession without an express mandate from the electorate.  I have come to the conclusion that the present British Government, pressed forward as it is by certain anti-Irish feeling in Britain and supported by the attitude of a minority in this country, is not prepared to examine this position on its merits or to yield to claims of simple justice.  Whilst they are playing the part of Shylock as regards this country, they are pleading as petitioners with the United States, and they are playing the rôle of Lady Bountiful on the Continent.  They are petitioning for relief themselves of debts which nobody denies are morally <Col N="142" /> and legally due.  They recognise that on the Continent&mdash;the whole world recognises&mdash;if there is to be a restoration of economic life in the world at all these huge inter-Governmental payments must cease.  We are not prepared at any rate to bind our people, to commit them to the continued payment of these huge sums which have been extracted in the past. We are not prepared to put the future of our country in pawn in that respect. We believe that these payments are neither legally nor morally due and in that belief we propose to defend our rights.  I have never denied that the tariff war, which is evidently going to continue, is bound to impose considerable hardships on our people, but I believe that the re-ordering of our economic life which the necessity for meeting this war is going to bring about, will in the long run relieve us from the position of dangerous dependence in which we have been in the past, a dependence on the British market which was the result of British dominance in the past, a position which the British now think Britain can use to compel us, or try to compel us, to bow to her will.  This Government at any rate does not propose to bow to her will. We propose to defend our rights and to make the economic adjustments which may be necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any particular point in going further into the matter. The White Papers will be before the House in a short time.  The arguments on both sides will be before Deputies and when that information is available, if members on the opposite side wish to discuss the matter further I am perfectly certain that an occasion for doing so will be found.  I simply want to repeat that we do not propose to surrender our just claims in this regard. The position is as it was, and I think the country will be the better for a realisation of what I think has all the time been the fact that the British, under the present conditions, are not prepared to deal with this case justly.</P>

      <P>It is correct to say that every claim that it would be right to bring forward, if there was going to be a final adjustment of the financial relations between the two countries, was brought forward.</P>
      <P>Our opinion was that that final adjustment, which was provided for in the Treaty, was being undertaken, and that the ultimate financial settlement was really at that time being gone into. Every claim that Ireland would be entitled to put forward under these circumstances was put forward, including the claim for over-taxation in the past, which was a claim provided for by the Treaty as a counter-claim or set-off to the British claim with regard to our liability for any part of the National Debt.  It is also true that we put forward a claim in regard to the damage suffered by our people by Britain's going off the Gold Standard, in the same way as other Governments have made representations to Britain and as, I think, Britain herself made representations to France on a previous occasion on a similar basis.</P>

      <P>A serious claim for £400,000,000 was put up on account of over taxation in the past and a serious claim was put forward for an unspecified amount arising out of Britain going off the Gold Standard?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>As serious a claim as Britain's claim that we should bear portion of the British debt.  The British debt represents the accumulation <Col N="144" /> of a number of years.  Why should not our claim over a number of years also be put forward?</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact, I do not object to answering questions. It may not be the proper way of conducting a discussion, but I have nothing whatever to fear from any questions that are put.  If there are any questions which I regard as impertinent, I shall refuse to answer them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We were informed that the speech to-night would last for half an hour.  I should say that at least half the time devoted to it now was taken up with a recital of the various events that led up to the negotiations. In the course of the latter part of his speech, the President said that there were certain documents contained in a White Paper which would be shortly issued.  When is it proposed to issue the White Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I indicated that already&mdash;in the course of a week or two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is not contended that we can debate this question in the absence of the information contained in those documents.  Surely a speech of ten minutes in describing what I presume was described in another <Col N="145" /> place and&mdash;according to the answers given just now to Deputy McGilligan&mdash;accurately described, does not provide adequate information for discussion. One other point arises out of the speech to which we have just listened.  There was a statement to the effect that the President had come to the conclusion that the present British Government was pressed by anti-Irish feeling in England, supported by the minority in this country.  What exactly is the meaning of &ldquo;the minority in this country?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first point, if Deputy Cosgrave desires to have the debate postponed, I am quite willing.  The Government arranged for this time so that there might be no sense of grievance on the other side and no feeling that we tried to preclude any sort of discussion on this question at this particular time. I am quite willing to admit that this discussion can best take place when the White Paper is circulated.  That would be, I think, the natural course. Our desire simply was not to give any opportunity to anybody to feel that we were precluding discussion at this stage.  We are not.  We are giving all the information that is essential for an understanding of the situation as it exists.  With regard to the second point, a minority is a minority, and those whom the cap fits can wear it. (Applause.)</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether or not the last statement the President has made is intended to be offensive.  There is a great deal of silence about that.  We have at least an advantage over the opposite side <Col N="146" /> nationally and genealogically.  There is a majority here and in our support throughout the country there is a majority.  It is nothing short of a slander to suggest here that a minority in this country is against a settlement. There is no such minority.  Not even the Die-hards of this country are against a settlement.  Some of them have much more Irish blood than there is in the Front Bench opposite.  They are just as good nationals as those on the opposite side even though, at the moment, they have a greater respect for the Government on the other side. Their whole lives have been spent here and their wealth has been spent here. They are citizens and they are entitled to a citizen's rights.  I deprecate very strongly any statement such as has been made here.  It is a gratuitous insult to people who cannot defend themselves.  I hold no brief for them, but they are citizens and I have always followed and accepted as the true teaching the words of Davis and Griffith in regard to all the citizens of the country.</P>
      <P>This debate cannot go on.  It would be a farce if it went on in the absence of the White Paper.  We want to know all the circumstances.  We are not in the position that the present Government was in when in Opposition&mdash; opposing everything simply for the purpose of showing their originality or indulging in nonsense.  There is nothing to discuss here.  There is something to discuss outside with the people owing to the serious economic situation that exists.  Unemployment is growing, markets are diminishing and the opportunities for getting Imperial Preference are disappearing.  These are the things that we want to discuss in the cold light of the full facts.  It is ridiculous to bring us here for a few hours' discussion in the absence of necessary information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Thomas, in concluding his remarks in the British House of Commons, left the impression in the public mind that the Irish delegation had raised the question of an Irish Republic in association with the British Commonwealth of Nations as a relevant question at the negotiations <Col N="147" /> which were proceeding in England. Did President de Valera and his delegation raise that question as an issue at those negotiations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already given the basis on which the negotiations were held.  I have already pointed out that Mr. Thomas in suggesting that we raised that question as a relevant issue was wrong, that we did not raise it as a relevant issue.  My own personal attitude was known to the British Government long before that.  My attitude in private was the attitude I have maintained in public.  There is no secrecy whatever about it.  If he wished to have that in the background, he could.  In answer to Deputy Dillon's question, I obviously did not raise that as it was not pertinent to the negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the implication conveyed by Mr. Thomas's words is not true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not correct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did that question arise, whether raised by the President or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have given an answer now sufficiently explicit for anybody.  Anybody who is not prepared to take the answer I have given is not going to get anything further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it did arise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The President will believe that I raised that question for no purpose of embarrassing the Government here.  I raised it simply to afford the President an opportunity of telling the Irish people exactly what happened, so that they would not have to depend exclusively on the statement of a British Minister.  If he can elaborate or explain it to any Irish citizen, surely he will take this opportunity of doing so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to anticipate any such questions, and because I believed that that statement might give rise to a misunderstanding, I went to the trouble of writing this part and <Col N="148" /> what I said to the House was: To avoid misunderstanding of a passage of Mr. Thomas's statement in the British House of Commons yesterday I should say that the Conference dealt solely with financial matters.  The British Government was aware that arising out of the position created by the Treaty this Government had assumed office as the Government of one of the States of the British Commonwealth and that we were bound by pledges which preclude secession without an express mandate from the electorate.  Is that definite and explicit enough?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Provided the President is prepared to say that the clear implication of Mr. Thomas's words is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said already that what I take it is the clear implication that Deputy Dillon has in mind &mdash;and I agree in what Deputy Dillon calls the clear implication of Mr. Thomas's speech, as I understand it&mdash; is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I put to the President of the Executive Council a question?  Might I ask if the attack made by the Irish delegation on the, rightly or wrongly, so-called secret agreement proceeded on the basis that a gigantic swindle had been carried out by the British Government and the Cosgrave Government in collusion at the expense of the Irish taxpayer, and that, in fact, Deputy Cosgrave and his colleagues had acted very much as the late lamented Leonard McNally, alluded to by the Minister for Finance, and if that was the basis on which the attack on those agreements proceeded? Does the President of the Executive Council think that such an attack held out any hope of agreement with the British?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy who has just spoken is not going to outline for us our line.  Our line was taken and it will appear on the White Paper, and then if the Deputy wishes to misconstrue it in any way he chooses he can do so.</P>

I think it is about time that these secret agreements were discussed by this <Col N="150" /> House after ten years.  Let us have the whole thing out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say that that White Paper will be confined to five documents, the two memoranda submitted by us, the two memoranda in reply by the British Government, and our final reply.</P>
