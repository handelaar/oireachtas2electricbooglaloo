      <P>asked the President if he will state (1) if reports have been received by him or if he has, otherwise, reason to believe that the landing of arms on the coast of the Saorstát, or their transfer across the land frontier, has been successfully attempted or is likely to be attempted; (2) if instructions (whether of a special or general nature) regarding attempts to bring arms into the Saorstát have been given by him direct, or through the Ministers more particularly concerned, either to the Gárda or the Army; (3) if any steps have been taken to prevent arms destined for associations in this country acting without the authority of the State leaving foreign countries, or to effect their seizure before being landed here; and (4) if any requests for collaboration in the matter of prevention or seizure have been made to any other Government, or if any offer of collaboration has been made by any other Government and, if so, how such requests and offers have been received.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>No information has reached me that any landing of arms on the coast of the Saorstát or any transfer of arms across the land frontier has taken place or been attempted.  In fact, the reports received by the Government are to the effect that there has been no such landing or transfer.  With regard to parts (2), (3) and (4) of the question, I can only state that, in view of representations received, the Government has <Col N="166" /> taken all the precautions that would be warranted if those representations were well founded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

      <P>I have asked further if instructions, whether of a special or general nature, regarding attempts to bring arms into the Saorstát have been given by the President directly or indirectly? The answer given to me has been of a general type, to the effect that all the precautions warranted have been taken?</P>

      <P>Arising out of the answer, I want to ask the President whether, in fact, reports have come in that a coal boat unloading at Ross-carbery Pier was suspected of having arms and that it was searched for arms. Were there instructions issued by the President's Department to the Gardá to search that boat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely in a serious matter of the type of landing of arms, whether it be merely a case of reports or not, I ask the President whether, in order to allay the public anxiety on this matter, we should be told in fact that the President does know that boats were searched at his request and on his authority, as representing the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say there is any public anxiety.  I have stated that the Government have taken all the precautions that were deemed essential to meet that or any cases that might arise if the reports were well-founded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state if the Saorstát Army team was entered for the Connaught Gold Challenge Trophy competed for at Olympia on Wednesday, June 22nd; if so, why the team did not compete, and if it was not entered, why not.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be obvious to the Deputy that a number of considerations would cover the selection of entries on a sports programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter that relates to our external relations and, although the President might not have been present at the selection of the team, surely he is able to get information if he cares to give it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what considerations might govern the selection. If I were selecting a team for a number of competitions on a programme my selection would be subject to a variety of considerations, such as the team, the nature of the competitions and so on.  I could not ask to be informed any further in regard to the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>My answer is, I think, sufficiently explicit.  I say that a certain number of competitions on the programme were selected for our team to compete in.  This particular one was not included in the selection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:</P>
      <P>1.  That a duty of customs at the rate of five shillings the two hundred and eighty pounds shall be charged levied, and paid on all goods of any of the following descriptions imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 7th day of July, 1932, that is to say, wheat flour, wheat meal milled wholly or mainly from wheat, and preparations (other than bread, biscuits, buns and cakes) in the manufacture of which wheat flour or wheat meal milled wholly or mainly from wheat has been used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  That whenever the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is satisfied that wheat flour or wheat meal milled wholly or mainly from wheat is not obtainable from manufacturers <Col N="174" /> in Saorstát Eireann in sufficient quantities, or in suitable condition, or at all, or whenever the Minister for Finance, after such consultation as aforesaid, considers it desirable, the Revenue Commissioners may by licence authorise any person, subject to compliance with such conditions (if any) as they may think fit to impose, to import without payment of the duty mentioned in this Resolution such wheat meal or wheat flour as aforesaid either, as the Revenue Commissioners shall think proper, without limit as to time or quantity or either of them or within a specified time or in a specified quantity.</P>
    <P>3.  That if any person does any act (whether of commission or omission) which is a contravention of a condition imposed by the Revenue Commissioners under the next preceding paragraph of this Resolution, he shall be guilty of an offence under the Customs Acts and shall for each such offence incur a penalty of fifty pounds, and the goods in respect of which such offence is committed shall be forfeited.</P>
    <P>4.  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7. of 1927).</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Resolution is to bring the imports of flour under control and to provide that no person shall import flour into the Saorstát except under a licence issued by the Revenue Commissioners or subject to a customs duty of 5/- per 280lbs.  It is intended that the 5/- rate shall be prohibitive and that in future only such flour will be imported as has been licensed in the manner prescribed in the Resolution. This is the first stage in the bringing into operation of a scheme for the regulation of flour-milling in the Saorstát.  It is intended that the scheme shall commence to operate as from 1st September in this year; in other words, that during the months of July and August the normal quantity of flour will be imported but that these importations will be restricted in quantity as from 1st September to <Col N="175" /> such amount as is necessary or will be then necessary to supplement the produce of the existing Irish mills.  The necessity for the two months' postponement of the operation of the scheme arises out of the situation now existing.  As most Deputies are aware, the Irish flour millers have entered into an association with the English flour millers for the regulation of the output of flour in this country and also the importation of flour into this country.  That association has been in operation for some time and will presumably now be terminated.  The accounting year of the association expires towards the end of August.  It is desired to allow the present accounting year to expire and the termination of the association to take place at the same time.  The postponement would also facilitate the operation of the licensing scheme.  Definite information has been secured; lists of importers have been prepared; and the Department of Industry and Commerce is in a position to issue all the necessary licences at once.  These licences will, as I said, operate during the present month to allow in the normal quantity of flour.  They will also operate during August to allow in the normal quantity of flour.  In the month of September the quantity of flour imported will be restricted in quantity, and in that month we hope the existing flour mills, which are at present, roughly speaking, working only to something like a little more than half of their capacity, will go on working to full capacity, so that the output of flour here will be increased and, consequently, the necessity for importation diminished.</P>
    <P>The Government will submit to the Dáil in the Autumn Session proposals for legislation for the future regulation of the flour milling industry, and it is considered desirable that some indication of the nature of that legislation should be given at this stage.  In order to ensure that all the flour required by our people will be produced in mills situated here, and to ensure that the organisation of the industry will be such as to provide adequately for the requirements of the country, it is necessary to take certain <Col N="176" /> powers of control.  It is proposed that every person operating a flour mill in the Saorstát will do so under a licence issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Such licence will be issued automatically in respect of every mill in which flour was produced in the year 1931, and any such licence when issued will not be subject to withdrawal or cancellation except for certain specified reasons, and may be transferred from one owner to another on the sale of the mill, or bequeathed. Where a mill is wholly or substantially owned by nationals of Saorstát Eireann, such licence may not be subject to any conditions other than certain conditions which will be specified in the proposed Bill and which I shall indicate.  The only circumstances under which a licence could be withdrawn, or any variation of the terms of the licence take place, would be where the interest, or any part of the interest, in the mill concerned is sold to a person who is not a national of Saorstát Eireann, or where the quantity of flour produced is substantially less than the quota fixed for the mill under the Bill, or where the person owning the mill refuses to supply any information to be required and which is deemed to be essential for the proper operation of the scheme.  Where a mill which was in operation in 1931 is not wholly or substantially owned by nationals of Saorstát Eireann, it is proposed to issue the licence subject to these conditions and also subject to such other terms and conditions as may be considered necessary.</P>
    <P>It is intended to allocate to each mill a quota in respect of output of flour, and that quota will be fixed at the flour-producing capacity of the mill.  In other words, each mill in operation in 1931 will be authorised to produce in any one year a quantity of flour representing its capacity to produce flour.  A licence may also be given in the case of a mill which was in existence in 1931 but which did not produce flour in that year, subject to such terms and conditions as may be considered necessary; and also to any new mills that may be established in the <Col N="177" /> Saorstát subsequent to the passing of the measure.  It is not proposed to prohibit any person from producing flour in excess of the quota, although it will be remembered that the quota in respect of each mill will be fixed originally at its capacity to produce. But, if any miller should decide to increase the capacity of his mill, and produce in excess of the quota allocated to him, a fine of 3/- per sack will be levied on the excess.  In other words, if any miller thinks that it is an economic proposition for him to mill and sell flour subject to that duty, there will be nothing in the legislation to prevent him doing so. If any mill produces flour in any year to an extent which is substantially less than the quota allotted to it, the quota for the subsequent year may be reduced to the actual amount produced or the licence may be revoked. It is intended to take power where a mill is, in the opinion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, suitable for the production of wheat flour, but is not so engaged in the production of wheat flour for any reason, to acquire the mill at a price to be agreed upon, and to carry on or dispose of the acquired mill.</P>

      <P>The State if necessary. The licence which will be issued under this motion will be issued from month to month, but the licensed flour importers will receive an indication from the Department of Industry and Commerce over a longer period as to the probable amount of flour likely to be licensed for importation in any particular month so that they can make their purchasing arrangements with full information as to what the situation is likely to be when the flour comes to be delivered to them. For a limited period, and to a limited extent, it is intended to pay a subsidy on flour produced at inland mills.  The subsidy will be a small amount, and it will operate only until such time as the disadvantages which these mills at present suffer have been wholly or partly removed as a result of the production of wheat within the country, following on <Col N="178" /> certain proposals in that connection which will be introduced to the Dáil at a later stage.  The subsidy payable to any one mill will be definitely limited in amount.  An Advisory Committee will be established to advise the Minister for Industry and Commerce in all matters relating to the performance of his functions under the proposals.  It is intended, also, when the Dáil resumes for the Autumn Session, to introduce a Finance motion imposing a customs duty on imported bread.  It is not possible to introduce that motion at this stage, because in some parts of the country, and particularly in Donegal, there is some reason to doubt whether adequate supplies of bread would be available from existing bakeries.  Certain steps are being taken, however, and it is anticipated that in the course of two or three months that situation will have been remedied and that bakeries will have been established in these areas in sufficient number and of sufficient capacity to supply all the requirements of the people, and this announcement of the intention to impose that customs duty is made now.  It is not anticipated that there will be any forestalling of the duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am giving this general indication of the proposals which the Government propose to submit to the Dáil at a later stage, so that all parties concerned will understand what the position is.  Certain discussions have already taken place with flour millers and others, and a general indication of the nature of the Government's policy has been given.  It was hoped at one time that the legislative proposals might have been ready for introduction in the present Session, but that hope had to be abandoned. We are, therefore, proceeding in the manner indicated by the introduction of this Finance Resolution.  The licensing provision in respect of flour imports will come into operation straight away, but the first steps to bring the scheme into effect will not be taken until the beginning of September.  The remaining steps will follow from the passage through the <Col N="179" /> Dáil and Seanad of legislative proposals in the month of October or early in November.  We have examined the position of the flour-milling industry very carefully. There is no reason whatever why all the requirements of our people in flour cannot be produced here, and there are, for a variety of reasons, strong arguments why steps should be taken to secure the development of the industry.  As Deputies will remember, the flour millers, a number of years ago, made an application for the imposition of a customs duty on imported flour.  That application was rejected by the Government in office at the time on the recommendation of the Tariff Commission.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, other proposals were made by the flour millers, and were considered by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  No action was taken, however, and the position of the flour millers was getting more and more precarious, until this arrangement with the English millers was made, fixing the output of flour from Saorstát mills at in or about 1,500,000 sacks per year, the balance to be made up of imported flour.  The intention now is to bring all the existing mills into full production as rapidly as possible and then to endeavour to reopen the silent mills as quickly as possible.  There are some of the silent mills which can and will be re-opened almost immediately.  In the case of certain other mills, there are financial and other difficulties which may delay their restarting.  There are certain proposals for the establishment of new mills.  If all the mills in the country, both those now working and those silent, were producing flour to capacity, the quantity that would have to be imported would be comparatively inconsiderable.  Even if we get the existing mills only working to capacity, the quantity to be imported will not be substantial, and, altogether, there seems good reason to believe that, at the end of three years at the outside, we should have removed completely the necessity for importing any flour except certain comparatively small quantities of <Col N="180" /> special grades required by biscuit manufacturers or people of that kind.</P>
    <P>There is no reason to believe that the operation of this system will necessitate any increase in the price of flour.  On the contrary, there is some reason to anticipate that a reduction in the price of flour may take place.  As some Deputies are aware, the trend of flour prices has been upward for some time past, but if any mill working to 50 per cent. or 55 per cent. of its capacity is able to carry on profitably at present flour prices, it is, I think, obvious that it should be able to effect a reduction in prices, if its output is increased to 100 per cent. of its capacity, except in so far as a reduction in the price of flour might be arrested by a reduction in the price of offals.  The increase in the output of the mills and the coming into operation of the mills now silent or new mills will, of course, mean very increased production of offals in the country, and, consequently, there is some reason to believe that a substantial reduction in the price of offals will take place.  In so far as a reduction in the price of offals takes place, a reduction in the price of flour will be arrested, but so far as the country as a whole is concerned the products of the mills should be available, certainly at a price no higher, and probably substantially lower, than the flour and offals are available at the present time.  I recommend this motion to the Dáil.  By itself it imposes no new restrictions. But as from 1st September it will give us power to regulate the importation of flour only in such quantities as may be necessary to supplement the output of the existing mills, allowing a certain margin for elasticity to ensure effective competition between the home mills.  I move the Resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Resolution we have the advantage in discussing this Resolution that the matter was previously, although not in this form, brought before the Tariff Commission and the Tariff Commission produced a report for the House.  It is possible now to compare the optimistic view of the Minister with his assurances and the exact facts found by the Tariff Commission which had power to examine witnesses on oath and which in fact did examine some of them in that way.  It is very difficult to discuss this Resolution that we have here because the elastic phrasing of Section 2 may mean that there will be no tariff on flour at all, or it may mean, according to what is the Minister's view of what is the home milling capacity at a certain time, that there is going to be a considerable imposition on the people of the country.  At any rate the first thing that jumps to our eyes is that whereas previously the applicants, making their case for a tariff on flour, considered that 3/- per sack would be sufficient, this time we are asked to agree to a tariff of 5/- on a 280lb. sack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say, of course, that we are left in some doubt as to how far that 5/- is going to be imposed on whatever amount of flour the Minister is going <Col N="184" /> to allow into the country on account of the very loosely drawn paragraph 2. I was not very successful in getting any more precise information from the Minister in the questions I addressed to him.  We are told that at the moment the consumption of flour in the country is about 3,000,000 sacks and that the output at the moment, as I understand the Minister to say, is about one and a half million sacks. That is to say we have only 50 per cent. of the total consumption produced in the country at the moment.  If there is no increase in production by the month of September&mdash;and there is not likely to be very much&mdash;unless there is a licence given for the importation of one and a half million sacks, we are going to have some impost put on the community.  The precise question that has to be asked and it should be answered before we know what we are facing in this: what is the Minister likely to determine in the month of September as to the milling capacity of the country, so that we shall know what he is going to determine in respect of the amount to be imported under licence in the month of September?  Without precise information on these points no debate of a proper type could take place on this. We see at any rate that the aim is, by degrees, to lessen what is the free licence amount, the free quota, as the home capacity increases.  When we get to the point, if ever we do get to the point, when the whole 3,000,000 sacks which we use in the country will be produced in the country, the free licence system will come to an end.</P>
    <P>If I am wrong in that I have completely misunderstood the scheme. I did understand that the aim was to allow in free, month by month or period by period, such amount of flour as has not in fact been manufactured or is likely to be manufactured in the country at a particular time.  If that scheme were going to be carried out in a moderate way then it would be a good scheme, but if, on the other hand, we are to have the Minister acting on the usual type of assurance that would be given as to the milling capacity of the country; if the Minister is to act on the <Col N="185" /> type of thing that Deputy Moore has talked of, namely, that there are so many silent mills in the country as will make up the production to a certain figure, and the actual production of any one of the particular flour mills and the flour imports into the country, then that is another question. If that sort of thing is relied on, and if the flour imports into the country are to be reduced in keeping with the rosy estimate as to what some mills will do, then the position will be that there is going to be a big amount of the flour that is coming in taxed, because the flour will not be produced here up to the requirements.  Then we will find what the cost on the consumers will be.  There will be an increase in cost to the consumer of flour and an increase in the price of bread is certain.  That was admitted by the Tariff Commission.  It was admitted, not merely by the Tariff Commission, but by the applicants who came before the Tariff Commission.  The Tariff Commission in page 42, paragraph 65, of their Report said:</P>
    <P>This circumstance, combined with a natural desire of the millers to make the best profits possible, would result in an increase in the price of flour to an extent, in our opinion, little short of the full amount of the proposed duty.</P>
    <P>Previously they stated, in page 41, paragraph 64:</P>
    <P>The applicants admit that they themselves will take advantage of their monopoly of the protected market to raise the price of their own flour to a point higher than the price now prevailing.</P>
    <P>The conclusion of the Tariff Commission in the whole Report was briefly this: that bread was such a definite necessity, and it was so clear that that tax on flour was going to be passed on to the consumer of bread &mdash;they estimated that what would be passed on would amount to something more than £300,000, and their further estimate was that as a result of that tax 153 people extra would be employed&mdash;that they turned down the application for a tariff.  Under the proposal then before the Tariff Commission <Col N="186" /> they were to have £300,000 passed on to the consumers of bread.</P>
    <P>Under the present measure we do not know what the cost to the consumer will be, because we do not know what is the amount of flour that will be allowed in free.  We do not know how much will be allowed in free and how much will be taxed, but so long as there is a monopoly of a certain amount given to the millers in this country, then, undoubtedly, the millers are going to raise the price of flour on the consumer.  No doubt all sorts of play are going to be made with the offals, how the price of offals go up and how that should be accompanied by a corresponding variation in the price of bread.  That play may be made, but the thing that matters is what it will amount to in the end. The applicants stated some years ago that they would take advantage of the situation to raise their prices, and the Tariff Commission came to the conclusion that if 3/- a sack was put upon flour almost the full amount of that 3/- a sack would be shown in the price of bread.</P>
    <P>Remember that at that 3/- a sack £300,000 would fall on the consumers, and there was an estimate that 153 extra people would find employment in the flour milling industry.  Here we have a different situation.  The proposal is to put on 5/- a sack, and then we have the whole situation rather clouded by the fact that we do not know how much flour is to be imported free.  But no matter what is imported, so long as there is a monopoly or a very restricted competition from abroad, amounting to almost no competition with the flour that is going to be manufactured at home, I think we are going to see a bigger increase in the price of bread stuffs than was previously admitted.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not the optimism of the Tariff Commission that 153 people extra would be put into employment. That is what we are faced with now.  One would have expected that the Minister, when speaking on Section 2, would tell us the amount of flour that would be allowed in free and that he would advert particularly <Col N="187" /> to the case of Jacob's.  That firm was considered worthy of special notice, and of being asked to supply evidence when the application for a tax on flour was previously before the Tariff Commission.  In the end the Tariff Commission came to the conclusion that the only thing to be done in regard to Messrs. Jacob's was to allow them to import free, and without any customs difficulties, all the flour that they required for any purposes of their own.  It should be mentioned here that the firm did make very definite representations that any system of rebates or remissions should put them in the position in which they felt entitled to be placed.  In the end it was felt to be clear that the firm of Jacob's were to be allowed to bring in, free of duty, whatever flour the firm said it required.  It is interesting to know whether that paragraph of the Tariff Commission is going to be implemented in this section.</P>
    <P>In the closing portion of his remarks, the Minister was far from frank about the situation as it had developed.  I do not know whether he felt he could not be frank because there was some matter of confidence in the information he had.  But once this matter is open there is no question of confidence involved.  There was no precise or accurate statement given about the progress of this industry.</P>
    <P>I propose to make a statement as far as my memory will allow me to make it as to what did happen regarding the industry.  There was a report by the Tariff Commission turning down the application as it was then presented.  After that report we had a few debates in the House here.  After that there was a newspaper agitation got up by the flour millers in the country.  In the course of that debate I announced that I was in consultation with the Flour Millers' Association. I do not know whether I was right in saying that, as they somewhat mystified me as to what this Association was.  But I did say I was in consultation with the flour millers so as to get something from them upon which we could build.  I said to <Col N="188" /> the House that I hoped some schemes might be found suitable, and that we would be in a position to bring proposals before the Dáil afterwards. Those proposals did not come, not for the reason implied by the vague statement made by the Minister, but because the Flour Millers' Association turned down these proposals and said that they preferred to join in the Association with the Millers Mutual of England.  They said they preferred it. Any statement that was made that that was because the industry was in a precarious position and that nothing was done for them, and that they had to have recourse to the Millers' Association should not be brought before this House by the Minister. He should not do so on the files which he has in his possession.  I do not think the millers announced that. There was a scheme put before certain millers for their consideration to place a tariff on a certain amount of imports into this country and a free quota, that free quota to be reduced as the home capacity increased until it reached the point where there was no free quota at all or else where they arrived at the point where there was to be no further increase in production in the country.</P>
    <P>While that scheme was under consideration it was represented to me that I was merely having dealings with certain individuals and not with the association.  The only answer I got to my demand for enlightenment was that the association preferred, to any of the schemes that were being discussed, a junction with the Mutual Millers' Association of England, which they effected.  That is how the present situation arose, not because there was not Governmental touch with these people, and not because there was not a scheme put before them for consideration; it was just because they said they preferred the other thing.  If they preferred the other thing, then I want to know have they changed their minds?  Has this scheme been hammered out in conjunction with them? Is it suitable for the purpose of meeting their requirements?  Has it been evolved after consultation with them <Col N="189" /> and after ascertaining their requirements superimposing, of course, what the Minister considers are national requirements, because that is a consideration that should always be brought in?  If there is any history to be given those points should be attended to.</P>
    <P>We are told that in the autumn we are going to get legislation to secure production in the mills situated here. That was the phrase that dropped from the Minister.  I then listened to the conditions that are to be imposed on millers milling in mills situated here.  A licence will be given to them. I waited to see the great distinction that would be made as between national and non-national.  When the old ramp was at its height the great question then agitating the people was not the amount of milling to be done in the country, but the amount of milling done in the country by firms nationally owned in opposition to firms not nationally owned.  The Minister indicated that licences would be given to all people milling in this country.  In the case of firms nationally owned the Minister indicated certain conditions that would be imposed. For instance, there would be a deprivation of licence to manufacture on account of breach of conditions, or something like that.</P>
    <P>In the case of the non-national we were told there would be a little distinction. The licence, for instance, would be granted subject to such terms and conditions as the Minister might like to impose.  Has the Minister anything definite in mind in the way of making a distinction between mills here, segregating them into mills-nationally owned and mills not nationally owned?  Has he given any thought to the terms and conditions he will specify for the non-national mills in opposition to the mills nationally owned?  We would like to have some information on those points.  The old controversy apparently was not so much the amount of milling that was being done here, but the amount of milling that was done by firms that did not come under the control of Messrs. Rank.  What is to be the restriction imposed on Ranks <Col N="190" /> as opposed to anybody else?  They stand as the main non-national firm in the country at the moment.  On that matter the Minister has been silent.</P>
    <P>The items he discussed with regard to licences in the autumn really follow the scheme that has been already established by the Mutual Millers' Association.  There is the idea of a pool of flour production in the country and then there is the idea of a person being allowed to mill more on condition that he pays a fine of so much per sack.  That is an idea borrowed from the Mutual Millers' Association scheme.  Then again, it is intended to take power, where a mill in the Minister's opinion is suitable for the production of wheat flour but is not engaged in that production, to acquire that mill at an agreed price and to carry on or dispose of the acquired mill.  I await with interest the day when the Minister will acquire his first flour mill.  He will have power to acquire a mill not functioning at a certain time but that is, nevertheless, potentially productive.  Having acquired it, he may carry on business or otherwise dispose of the mill.  I suppose such mill will be subject to the same conditions as will be imposed on other mills with regard to the disposition of property.</P>
    <P>This is the merest nonsense in the way of a threat&mdash;this State power to acquire.  There is no miller of any substance who would consider for a moment that that threat has any weight.  He knows the Minister cannot run a flour mill.  The Minister's civil servants cannot run a flour mill.  If the Minister has to run the mill he will have to get people who are interested in flour milling.  Where will he get them?  Will they be people who are laid off from other mills?  Will they be people who have made money in milling and gone out of the business? Will they be skilled people from outside? What will the Minister do if he has a real white elephant in the shape of a mill on his hands?  I do not think that requires much thinking out, because it is never going to happen.  It is like the previous threats we heard about the State taking over the buying <Col N="191" /> of corn and the many other things that the Minister, in a moment of exasperation, says he will do if he is put to it. He can always recede from these things if they come near him.</P>
    <P>The silent mills do arise for some consideration.  We are told a licence may be given to mills that were producing in 1931, to mills that are now in existence or to mills that may even later be built.  Of course these will be subject to the same conditions as the others, or perhaps there may be some difference made.  Does the scheme look to something like a statutory ring for those at present engaged in milling or are new entrants going to be allowed into the milling business subject only to the same conditions as those imposed on mills already functioning here?  If there is to be any distinction it should not be made with regard to new entrants until we have reached the point that at least three million sacks are being produced in the country.  I can see no justice in imposing any conditions on new entrants until we have reached the point where home production is equal to home consumption.</P>
    <P>We are told further that for a limited period a subsidy will be paid on flour produced in inland mills.  The words &ldquo;for a limited period&rdquo; attracted my attention until the Minister said that this period was going to be such as must elapse until the disadvantages under which these mills suffer are removed.  They are to be removed by a wheat scheme.  Limited period is a misleading expression in that connection. Limited in the literal meaning of the word means that it will not last for ever.  If it is meant to be employed, as I think it was, for a relatively short period, then I think the Minister is again deluding himself.  If he believes there is going to be a wheat scheme run so successfully that it is going to remove the disadvantages that inland mills suffer from, he is definitely deluding himself.</P>
    <P>There is one other point about which nothing has been said.  It is with regard, not merely to silent mills, although more particularly with regard to those, but with regard to all mills in the country.  It is easy <Col N="192" /> enough to establish at the moment the ownership of most of the mills in the country, but it is clear that the moment a scheme like this is announced every mill becomes more valuable. It has a better sale price immediately. There is a better chance of transfer to other hands, because it is going to have better business, more lucrative business, a better chance to make money&mdash;a better chance to make money, the applicants having said previously that they intended to make use of that chance to make more money. Any mill which is either inactive at present or may qualify for a quota under this scheme to be brought forward in the autumn or a mill producing at present but not to its full capacity, or even any mill which is producing to full capacity at present, can see under this scheme a chance to raise its prices.  Every mill in any of these three categories immediately has an enhanced price for sale purposes. Does the Minister intend to put any prohibition on the sale of these mills?  In other words does he want to see that people are not in fact going to traffic in tariffs, because that is what this would amount to?  Will he put any brake upon people selling? There is a danger in doing that because the free disposition of property privately owned is one of the characteristics of the economy that we have at present.  I do not know how the Minister is going to perform in that dilemma, because I may say that I was impressed not at all by the majority of the flour millers whom I met, but with regard to some of them their anxiety about a tariff in flour was founded on nothing more or less than an anxiety to get rid of mills that they had at a profit to themselves.  That sort of thing should be certainly watched. There is going to be a great transfer of mills at enhanced prices because of what the Government are doing. Undoubtedly it is allowing nothing more or less than a traffic in certain tariffs.  That is going to lead to still more confusion, still more persecution by way of lobbying, and still more chance of corruption than there is at present.</P>
    <P>I come back to what I started with. As I said, I do not know what is going <Col N="193" /> to be allowed in under paragraph 2 of the resolution.  I cannot estimate from one angle what this is going to cost the country.  Supposing we are at the point, and do remain at the point for some time to come, that about 50 per cent. of the requirements have to be brought in from outside, and are going to be brought in free, then because of the comparison there is likely to be between the free importation and the home-produced flour there may be no great increase, but once that fifty-fifty situation changes and we get to the point where, say, we are producing or pretending to produce about two-thirds of what is consumed, and that there is only one-third, or something less, coming in under licence, and coming in freely, then undoubtedly there is going to be an increase in price&mdash;an increase in the price of flour at any rate.  I know the Minister has hopes that an increase in the price of flour should not mean an increase in the price of bread. That is another problem.  It will require more than a Commission on Prices or an Advisory Committee to check that.</P>
    <P>We have, as I say, given a better colouring to the statements the Minister makes here, just founded upon assurances.  We have what the Tariff Commission reported after examining people on oath and quoting some of the statements these people made when under examination.  We have a definite statement that the applicants stated they were going to use the somewhat monopolistic position into which they would get to increase their prices and they estimated themselves that the price would increase by something not very much short of the tariff that was being applied for.  They estimated that that would cost the people somewhere about £300,000 per year and they thought we might get 153 people into employment for that.  In the end, we are going to have that situation or something like it.  It may be lessened from the point of view of employment given, but it is not likely to decrease very much from the point of view of the extra cost to the consumer of bread. If people think it is worth while having that, I suppose they can hope for this. <Col N="194" /> But it is a serious thing to contemplate that, after raising the price of butter upon the community, we are now taking a definite step which will raise the price of bread on them also.  We have raised the price of a variety of other things they use.  They are not so definitely in the region of necessity as bread and butter.  Yet, that is what we are doing, and, as far as the bread is concerned, it is for the possibility of getting 153 people into employment.</P>
    <P>I think that £300,000 will be an under-estimate, because we are going to have this subsidy, or whatever it is, given to flour manufactured in inland mills, and there it is not going to be a question of extra employment but the retention of employment in small centres.  I suppose there we have the idea that the distribution of industry means that every industry is to be distributed.  I could imagine a policy for the distribution of industry by seeing that mills were located at ports and that other projects had their sites in different places from the ports.  But that each industry in itself is to be distributed is an idea that, I think, occurred to nobody except the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Yet for the sake of that, we are to have some further imposition, some further subsidy to be paid, in flour manufactured in these places, and that is going to be an addition to the £300,000.  However, the Resolution in itself may mean nothing.  We do not know what is going to happen under paragraph 2. But when the autumn comes, and we have the legislative proposals, and when we know, in fact, not as an estimate, what the Minister has decided upon, and the amount that may be let in under conditions or freely, we will be in a better position to judge this.  I view the whole thing with the foreboding of a very big increase upon a necessity of life, with no adequate return in the way of employment, and no adequate return in other ways, because this scheme does not hit at what was thought to be the great defect in the milling industry heretofore, that is to say, the passing of mills from one ownership to another.  This does not interfere with the existing situation which was supposed to have been deplorably <Col N="195" /> bad.  It leaves that as it was. It is going to put a further increase upon the people with a very small return for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>When one comes to regard a Resolution like this it is not quite possible to regard it entirely by itself as an isolated transaction. One must look upon it with all the surroundings.  We must bear in mind that this suggestion, which I think beyond doubt means an increase in the cost of living of the citizens of this country, is not by any means the only measure which this Government has introduced increasing the cost of living.  It may be possible to come with one, two or three particular suggestions before the Oireachtas, and say, &ldquo;We are asking you to increase the cost of living of a certain number of items because we believe that though we are asking a sacrifice from the consumers, that sacrifice is one which we are justified in asking in the national interests.&rdquo; That is the attitude which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has repeatedly been taking up, but when you come to ask not one sacrifice, but to ask sacrifice after sacrifice from the consumers in this State, you are asking the consumers in this State to bear a burden which they cannot bear.  I would like to point out to the members of this present administration that one of the great difficulties which is now world wide, is not that there is, in the various countries which are suffering from depression, a too small amount of home production.  The evils from which the countries that are suffering from economic pressure at the moment are suffering are not due to a shortage of home production, but to an excess of home production, and the real need of all the manufacturing and producing countries at the moment is for demand.  Supply is more than ample, and the need everywhere is a need for demand.  Where is the demand to come from in this State?  The demand can only come from the consuming public and when you are crushing down that demand by offering article after article at a higher price, it means that you <Col N="196" /> are breaking down your whole system and that you are not going to add to employment or to production, but really going to stop production, because you are making profitable production impossible.</P>
      <P>As I say, I regard this particular tariff, as it must be regarded, in the light of conditions that, at present, obtain in this State, and whatever might be said for a tariff imposed for the purpose of regulating flour production in this country, I certainly think that, coming as it is coming on the heels of all the other duties, which are increasing the cost of living here, the present administration is inflicting serious injury on the entire of this community and inflicting serious injury on the agricultural community more than on any other.  I know that there is a sort of idea rampant in Ministerial circles that if you tax imported wheat or imported flour, you are going to help the farmers.  I am not going to discuss that question now, as I think it would be rather irrelevant on this particular motion, although the Minister for Industry and Commerce did fore-shadow that such a scheme was in his head.  But I definitely state that, so far as nine-tenths and possibly, a great deal more than nine-tenths, of the agricultural community in this country are concerned, they cannot gain by any taxation on wheat, and that it would be entirely unprofitable for an over-whelming number of the inhabitants of this country, who live by agriculture, to attempt wheat production at present, or at any time that is likely to occur, certainly, for generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has put forward the very strange thesis that this will not increase the cost of flour.  He gave us no argument in support of that and it seems perfectly obvious that it must. Deputy McGilligan has already quoted what the applicants before the Tariff Commission said and what the findings of the Tariff Commission were, and, here, I would like to remark for a moment, that the whole question was gone into by the Tariff Commission. They called witnesses and examined them; they deliberated and they made up their minds, and yet, without calling <Col N="197" /> any witnesses, without any enquiry, but simply acting, so far as we can gather, out of the plenitude of his own knowledge, if I will call it knowledge, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has taken on himself to brush completely aside these entire findings founded on evidence carefully weighed and sifted.  That, in my humble judgment, at any rate, is not the way in which the affairs of the country ought to be managed, and, certainly, it is not the way in which the affairs of any State can be successfully managed.  If we are going to have hot-headed, enthusiastic Ministers like the Minister for Industry and Commerce, without any thought or consideration, or, so far as we can gather, any consultation, rushing head-long into measures of vital importance to this State, the State is going to suffer severely from his action.  Here, without reason or argument of any kind, we are told that the findings of a very competent body of men indeed are to be completely swept away, and the arguments on which their findings were based are not to be considered at all by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I do not intend now, because the matter will come up later on, to go through the arguments which compelled the Tariff Commission to come to the conclusions to which they came, but I will just point out one of them to the Minister and it is this, that flour milling in other countries can be carried on under circumstances very different to flour milling in this country, and that, in other countries, they can get a market for their second grade flour.  In this country, we cannot, because the people of this State want a good class flour.  They will not be satisfied with a second-class flour, whereas in other countries either a foreign market, an Asiatic market, in many instances, can be got for second grade flour, or else a market at home, and that differentiates the condition of flour production in this country from the condition in other States.  If we had the entire monopoly, except whatever might happen under paragraph 2, as this would give the flour millers here, not only would they be free, but, <Col N="198" /> I think they would be justified, in running up the price to the full amount which the Minister permits them, that is, the sum of 5/- per barrel.  The price of flour must go up because the Minister tells us that inland mills are not economic and cannot be worked economically.  The Minister shakes his head, but if they can be worked economically, why are they not working? There are, at the present moment, uneconomic mills in this country and these are going to be opened and put to work.  How?  They are going to receive a subsidy, but it is a temporary subsidy, and if these uneconomic mills are going to be made economic, and are going to get a small temporary subsidy, it stands to reason that the price of flour must be very much higher when produced by them than when produced by up-to-date mills working with fully up-to-date machinery.  That follows completely and you are not going to have two prices for flour in this State.  You may be sure that it is the price of the article most costly to produce which will regulate the price of the whole. It can go up to the whole 5/-.  There is nothing to prevent it and if it is necessary for the least economically situated and the worst equipped mill, as it will be necessary, to take advantage of the whole 5/- to produce its quota, then every other mill is going to take advantage of that also.</P>
    <P>As I said, representing as I do an agricultural constituency, I say that this measure is going to add, and add very considerably, to the cost of living of my constituents, and of the constituents of every other Deputy who represents an agricultural community, and I say that whatever justification there is, if there is justification, for this measure, there really is none for the bringing forward of it at the present time. There may be justification, and I will assume for the sake of argument that there is justification for certain measures which the Ministry have introduced, but there is no justification for bringing them forward in a lump.  There is no justification for putting an unbearable burden all at once on the back of the community.</P>
    <Col N="199" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to add very much to what Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney have said on this motion. Both of them have put the case fairly and clearly, and anything that I might add in repetition would be superfluous.  One thing is certain, to my mind, and I believe will be universally accepted as certain, as a consequence of this Resolution, and that is, that the price of flour will go up, and, consequently, the price of bread.  The Ministry seem to have over-reached themselves in their anxiety to sacrifice the people, as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney so well put it.  We have had one tariff on top of the other until the capacity of the people to endure tariffs is almost exhausted.  On top of the tariff on tea, imposed on the poor people within the last few weeks, we now have an imposition on their daily bread.  The Minister, in speaking to the motion, said that the price will probably not be increased, but I do not think that he said it certainly would not be increased.  All the evidence that he could give us, or that we can produce ourselves, would tend to lead us to decide otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure, and the measure that the Minister proposes subsequently to introduce, will have the effect of prohibiting the economic expansion of the milling industry.  It will have the effect of putting the production of flour into the hands of numerous small mills, and, as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said, it will have the effect of putting production into the hands of the uneconomic milling units which existed here before throughout the country and which cannot be expected, as will be found in practice, to produce as economically as some of the larger mills already in operation. The Ministry introduced this in their anxiety to sacrifice certain persons, and they appear to have a particular antipathy to a certain city in the Southern part of this country, to wit, Limerick.  Every conceivable piece of legislation that they could bring forward to cripple that unfortunate city they have brought forward.  Those of us who are <Col N="200" /> interested in the South, have already on four or five different occasions had to refer to the effects of various pieces of legislation on the City of Limerick and the surrounding districts.  If there is one city more interested than another in the flour milling industry it is Limerick.  We have had in that city for centuries flour milling carried on as efficiently and economically as in any other portion of this State. We have had for nearly a century the firm of Messrs.  Bannatyne carrying on milling in that city. They carried it on efficiently and successfully until a few years ago until, perhaps, a combination of circumstances changed the name of the firm.</P>
    <P>A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.  It does not matter to me whether it is called Bannatyne's or Rank's.  It is still Bannatynes in effect.  It may be Ranks in name.  It still remains to provide for the city of Limerick and the surrounding districts good flour at an economic price, and it has been producing this. Now the Minister comes along and says he is going to deal fairly and honestly with the milling industry of the State.  How does he propose to deal fairly and honestly with the milling industry of that city?  By leaving out one firm, the firm of Bannatyne and Sons of Limerick, from the advantages which he proposes to offer, if there are any advantages that will accrue from this measure to the other milling units in the country.  The Minister said he proposed to introduce a quota in respect of the amount of flour that will be allowed to be produced according to the existing capacity of the mills.  There was to be no discrimination between mills.  They were all to be allowed to go on as they were, and in certain circumstances they were going to be allowed to advance themselves. Limerick alone was to be sacrified, because the Minister said while mills in other places might be allowed in certain circumstances to expand themselves, certain mills which were in the position that they could rapidly increase their production&mdash;<Col N="201" /> possibly there are only one or two such as in Limerick&mdash;would be prohibited because while the Minister said they may increase their production he will charge 3/- per sack on it.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, speaking on another matter in the House, I referred to a certain project in Limerick which would employ 500 hands for the next three or four years, and which in addition to employing these 500 hands on constructive work would provide necessary work in other ways for many people in that city.  In consequence of certain proposals that scheme was prejudiced, but in consequence of this proposal it is killed definitely and finally because one of the conditions that the people in Limerick considered when they were bringing up the proposals for connecting the docks and the railway system, was the possible extension of Messrs.  Bannatyne's mills.  There was a proposal that this firm would build a new mill and it was on the assumption that the revenue would be increased rather than diminished that it was eventually agreed that the proposed connection between the railway and the docks should take place.  If there is to be a limitation of their output, or if there is to be any fear in their minds as to their exact position, as there must be a fear in their minds, this firm will not proceed further.  In fact they have definitely intimated that they will not proceed further.  I will not go so far as to say that it is a certainty that certain schemes that would have materialised in Limerick and that would have provided work for 500 men will not now materialise, but that is the probability.</P>
    <P>Labour members, two of whom I see present, will probably eventually go into the lobby with the Ministry on the legislation that will be introduced to give effect to this Resolution, mindful of the rapid increase in the milling industry and the 150 men who will be possibly employed if this is given effect to.  I hope they will not forget the number of people who will be sacrificed by these measures and the number of people who will have to pay somewhat heavily for their flour <Col N="202" /> and bread.  In any debate that may take place on the ultimate Resolution the Minister brings in, nobody can make a case that flour is going to be cheaper or even that it will remain at the present price.  After all the examination that has been given to this scheme as Deputy McGilligan pointed out, in the report of the Tariff Commission, and all the evidence they could collect from millers and other people, they had to come to the conclusion that the one certain effect of the measure would be that the price of flour must go up willy nilly, and until there is more definite evidence produced to us than there has been produced either to us or to any other people as to the assertion that this will not be injurious to the people at large, we must assume that the price of flour will go up.  I do not believe that any further remarks of mine will have any great effect.  It is a pity that the Ministry should concentrate all their efforts on the extinguishing of a very old city because nine-tenths of the tariffs that have been proposed will fall more heavily on that city than on any other portion of this State with perhaps one or two exceptions. Two or three of the principal tariffs the Minister proposes are apparently specially designed to injure the people of that city.  I said that the Ministry were over-reaching themselves in their attempts to sacrifice the people.  I am reminded of a very old story.  A bull was once bitten by a warble fly.  To escape the pain the bull ran away, as bulls do.  The nearest object to him was a hay rick, and in the endeavour to brush off the fly he proceeded to run and run around the hay rick until at last he overtook himself, and pucked himself out of the way.  I hope the day is not so far distant when the present Ministry will succeed in getting themselves out of the way in the same manner as the bull did.</P>

      <P>It is rather amusing to see the efforts made by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party to justify their action during the last few years in handing over the flour milling industry of this country to a foreign <Col N="203" /> firm.  Deputy McGilligan, when he stood up here a while ago reminded me of Satan making a case for the damned.  The manner in which the exMinister for Industry and Commerce dealt with the flour milling industry of the country was sufficient not alone to create a dread of unemployment in this country, but to create a dread in this country that we were going to be left teetotally in the position that every mill in this country would be closed down within a short period.  It reminded me very forcibly when I heard the Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies talking about reasons of one of the reasons given in this House.  A circular was read in this House which was sent to one of these particular milling combines which stated that &ldquo;there are special reasons why you should subscribe to the Cumann na nGaedheal fund.&rdquo;  My mind was brought back to that very forcibly to-day when I saw a Deputy getting up and making the case he was trying to make for his inactivity in preventing our flour mills from being strangled at birth.  When Deputy Bennett spoke a few minutes ago he forgot mentioning one thing, and that was the advice which he gave a short time ago to Messrs. Rank, who now work under the name of Bannatyne's, in Limerick. He told Ranks to sit tight, that within three months the Fianna Fáil Government would be out of office and that they could then continue their actions in getting control of the few mills that were left.  I had very terrible evidence of that in my constituency.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacDermot is getting nervous.  I hope he holds no brief for those people.  The Clondullane mills in Fermoy were closed down early last year.  After some discussion here lately with the Department of Industry and Commerce the portion of the machinery of the Clondullane mills which had been shifted to Midleton, and the other portion which had been <Col N="204" /> shifted to Mallow was ordered to be cleaned up and transferred back to Clondullane.  That order was counter-manded a fortnight ago owing to the advice given by Deputy Bennett and, I would not be surprised to hear, by Deputy McGilligan as well.  I hope that the Minister to-day will finish any hopes that Ranks have of holding up and closing down our flour mills here. What was the attitude of the previous Ministry?  They allowed the British Mutual Millers to control the amount of flour to be produced in this country. A mill could only produce so many sacks of flour.  If they produced any more they were fined, not by the Government or by tariffs, but by the English millers.  Under that system one mill in Midleton in my constituency worked half time.  Sixty men were brought in there and worked for a fortnight and were turned out for another fortnight being left idle for that fortnight.  The same state of things pre-vailed in Mallow.  A short time previous to the last General Election Messrs. Hallinan who were the only firm that were holding out in Cork County against being absorbed in the ring by Messrs. Rank had a visit from a very plausible gentleman.  They were under the impression at the time that Fianna Fáil was going to win and thought they were going to get some protection for their products here.  They were called on by Mr. Burke, a very plausible gentleman, who informed them that Fianna Fáil had not a dog's chance and that the very best thing they could do was to make the best of it and be absorbed by Ranks.  Unfortunately, they believed this plausible gentleman and they were partly absorbed by Messrs. Rank.  The result was that we had three gentlemen from Messrs. Rank in Midleton looking for the machinery with a view to transferring it to mills that were being extended in Cork City.  All the clerical staff in Midleton were transferred to Cork and there was definite notice that the Midleton mill was going to be closed down.  The 67 hands could then go to Deputy McGilligan looking for employment and they could put themselves on the unemployment register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fortunately, that condition of affairs <Col N="205" /> has ended.  The mill is now working every day, not every second fortnight for a period of eight hours as heretofore. Under the last Government the position was created that the right of a mill to mill a certain number of sacks of flour could be sold.  In Buttevant Messrs.  Oliver employed 47 hands in the flour mill.  Their mill was burned down and there was no question of re-opening it.  Their right to mill so many sacks per year was sold to Messrs. Johnston, Mooney &amp; O'Brien of Dublin. The result was that the 47 employees had to walk the streets and all that took place under the benevolent administration of Deputy McGilligan.  We have had enough of that kind of thing, and I am very glad the Minister is taking steps to see that those mills are put in the position of producing not what any English millers would like, but sufficient to meet the needs of the country.  I am not surprised at the anxiety of the Opposition for Messrs. Rank.  I have no doubt Messrs. Rank took the tip when they were told that there were certain reasons why they should subscribe to Cumann na nGaedheal funds.</P>
    <P>There is another matter underlying this and it is of far greater importance to us even than the milling industry. The Minister mentioned that the mills are not producing the quantity they are capable of producing.  At present, some of the mills controlled by Messrs. Rank, particularly Bannatyne's mill at Midleton, are being used for the purpose of crushing out the small mills engaged in making Indian meal. Indian meal ground at Bannatyne's mill is sold around Cork City actually at the cost price of Indian corn.</P>

      <P>I am giving reasons why the Minister should insist on seeing that the mills produce the full quantity of flour they are capable of producing. I am showing how the mills which could produce flour are being used by Messrs.  Rank for the purpose of crushing out other industries.  Are we going to be all the time dependent on the foreigner for our daily bread? We believe that under the Fianna <Col N="206" /> Fáil Government only a few years will elapse until we are completely independent of the foreigner in this matter. At one period in this country we grew 400,000 acres of wheat.  Last year, only 26,000 acres of wheat were grown. The land in a large portion of my constituency was valued as wheat land and, despite several appeals to the late Executive Council, they took no steps to alter the high valuation put on the land as wheat-producing land.  I believe that that land will go back to wheat producing.  I hope to see next harvest at least 150,000 acres of wheat. Even if we had that quantity of wheat at the moment there would be little use in going to the miller and telling him to put 25 per cent. of Irish wheat into the production of his flour.  There would be little use in asking that when you were faced with the position that 50 per cent. of the flour used in the country must be imported.  You have first of all to see that there are sufficient mills in the country to produce the flour needed for the population. Then we will be able to go to the Irish flour millers and tell them that they have to put a certain percentage of Irish wheat into their flour.</P>

He said there was no fear that the Minister would acquire any mills; it was never going to happen. I believe that when the Minister makes a statement he intends to carry it out. I believe, too, that any mills we have to acquire will not be acquired at such a price as was paid for the creameries by the last Government.</P>

      <Col N="207" /> Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney told us about the Tariff Commission and the increase in the price of bread to the poor.  What did these ex-Ministers do for the last ten years to prevent the price of bread being increased? Did they ever make an attempt to put into effect the Report of the Food Prices Tribunal?  Talking of Commissions, I could get a Commission in the morning to arrive at anything.  I have no doubt Deputy McGilligan found a Commission to report in any way he wanted it.  I could pick out three men and put them on a Commission with the full knowledge of what they would report to me.  They would report that black was white if I told them to.  There is no doubt that Deputy McGilligan's Commission was picked for some object.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Taken in its entirety the scheme outlined by the Minister, I think it would be difficult to find anything more foolish or ill-advised. There is going to be a very heavy burden cast on the community and no result for the community obtained as a result of that burden.  There is no reason why in this country flour produced by efficient mills, situated on suitable sites, should not sell as cheaply as imported flour.  Previous inquiries in my opinion have shown that quite clearly.  If the Government's plan was simply the imposition <Col N="208" /> of a tariff there would be less objection to it, because we would have as a result of the tariff, a development of the flour-milling industry along efficient lines which would make it possible, if necessary by the removal of the tariff at a later date, to secure a supply of flour for the people at a cost no greater than the world price, if you like, of flour at the particular time.</P>
      <P>Of course, I think, that even such a tariff would mean a temporary increase in the cost of flour.  It would mean, probably, an increase in the cost of flour for the people as long as the tariff remained.  The argument against imposing a tariff simpliciter is that the amount of employment that would be given as a result of grinding all the flour required for the Saorstát here would not be sufficient to justify the sacrifice that would be demanded from the people.  Under the Minister's scheme, we are going to have, in addition to the tariff, a compulsory cartel organised under Government auspices within the tariff ring and without any reference to an export policy.  There is nothing to justify that sort of cartel.  It amounts to one thing only&mdash;it amounts to the subsidising and the preservation of inefficiency. The whole scheme as outlined by the Minister is a scheme to prevent the flour-milling industry developing along efficient lines and providing the people with flour at the cheapest price that flour could be supplied to them.  I think there is no doubt that as long as the scheme lasts flour is going to be roughly 3/- per sack higher than it otherwise would be.  The fine of 3/- per sack that is proposed to be levied on any firm that exceeds the quota, seems to me to indicate that even the Minister and those who propounded the scheme believe that it is going to cost the community that 3/- per sack more than the economic price of flour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister put on a tariff the efficient mill could extend, and it could extend without any penalty.  The inefficient mill that was not able to supply the article to the public at an economic price could go.  In that way you would soon have an adequate milling capacity to supply the whole <Col N="209" /> requirements of the country of an efficient and economic kind, so that if the tariff, when that point had been reached, were taken off, there would not be anything to prevent the mills that would be in existence supplying the whole requirements of the country in open competition with any other flour millers who cared to enter into this market.  That position cannot be reached under this.  The economic mill, the good mill, the mill that will give the cheapest flour, is going to be prevented from developing.  If it goes beyond the quota that the Minister lays down for it, it will have to pay a fine of 3/- per sack, and that, I presume, is regarded as being sufficient to prevent the economic mill developing, to prevent the natural process that ought to go on in all industries from taking place.  You cannot have efficiency in any industry unless you let the good concern grow, even if it is to grow at the expense of the ill-managed, inefficient or unsuitable concern.  The Minister is preventing that.  I think it is certain that 3/- per sack will be what the public will have to pay for this process of bolstering up inefficiency.  It is perhaps nothing to the discredit of the owner of a particular mill that his mill is inefficient. The site may be bad now, though it may have been good enough in other times.  There may be other circumstances, which convey nothing in the way of a reflection on those managing the mill, which make it inefficient. But it does not matter to the ordinary consumer why the mill is inefficient. It seems to me to be clear that the particular &ldquo;John Citizen&rdquo;, as the Minister for Finance would say, should not be asked to pay for some other person's mistake or some other person's inefficiency.  He should be allowed to get any particular commodity as good and as cheap as the industry in this country, at any rate, could supply.  The Minister has fitted up a scheme to prevent that happening.</P>
    <P>This scheme is going to benefit some small group of individuals, who happen to own mills, at the expense of the consumer.  We have heard of the man who was boasting that he bought a mill for £4,000 and that if a tariff was <Col N="210" /> put on flour it would be worth £40,000.  The Minister is going to present that particular gentleman with £36,000, at the expense of the general consumer, and he is going to convert properties that are quite useless now, and that have become useless in the ordinary course of trade and economic development, into valuable properties. To try to save everything that exists simply because it exists is just the same as the old policy of not allowing the introduction of machinery or new methods.  The world must go on, and economic changes must take place, and, for that reason, economic change ought to be allowed to take place freely.  If it is not allowed, what we get is dearer living for our people than need be the case.  There is no difference between saying that an uneconomic and badly situated, or badly equipped, mill must not be allowed to die out, and saying that machinery must not be used for the manufacture of boots, that they must be hand-sewn, and that all the processes must be carried out by hand. You could do that, but the public would have to pay.  You are now doing the same thing.  You are preventing better machinery being used, or a better situated mill being employed, and you are making the public pay and you are doing it for the benefit of a handful of people.</P>
    <P>When the matter was previously examined, it was certainly the opinion of those who examined it, and who had an opportunity of knowing that a 3/- tariff would mean practically a 3/- increase in the cost of flour, and that that would ultimately go on bread.  It might not go immediately, but, in the course of the shifting of prices of bread, 3/- would be paid by the consumer, and it was the opinion of, I think, all, or practically all, who were in a position to understand the matter and who examined it previously, that that 3/- tariff would increase the price of flour by 3/-.  A 3/- tariff must mean a similar increase in price, and the fact that that fine for over-production is fixed at 3/- means that those who propound the scheme believe that the cost of flour is going to be 3/- beyond what it might be.  It seems to be safe enough to say <Col N="211" /> that if the price goes up even 2/-, not to speak of 3/-, on three million sacks, when the scheme has worked itself out, and we are not having free imports of any quantity, it is going to cost the general consumer £300,000 per annum and the consumer is going to be charged £300,000 per annum in order to give work to 150 more people.</P>
    <P>For every man employed, the general consumer is going to pay £300,000.  I would suggest that it would be far cheaper, and far better, in every way, for the Minister, by some process, to select out 150 people who will get employment as a result of this scheme, and give them £500 a year and not ask them to do any work.  They would be better off and the public better pleased, and it would be cheaper to the public, and the only people who will suffer will be the group of people who have got these inefficient or derelict mills.  The Minister could afford to give them something&mdash;to buy them all out&mdash; and scrap this scheme, or, at least, reduce it.</P>
    <P>Let us have the cost to the public, a temporary cost.  Let the Minister simply impose a tariff, and there is no doubt that, if he does that, he will find himself in a position at a future date to remove the tariff, and to have the flour ground here, and to have these 150 people employed, and to stop the charge to the consumer.  But he is proposing unnecessarily to make this charge a permanent one, and I think, as I said at the beginning, that no more ill advised or foolish scheme could be brought before any assembly than this proposal by the Minister. There is no regard to economics, and no regard to the interests of the community. It is all based on prejudice, and a sort of electoral flagwagging.</P>

      <P>On a point of information, an agreement was made and announced to the House which would permit the rising of the Dáil on tomorrow week.  That agreement involved a certain time table and the passage through the Dáil of this motion to-day, the leather proposals, the Shannon Bill, and the Committee Stage of the Control of Manufactures <Col N="212" /> Bill.  These particular proposals are of some importance, and, particularly the Shannon Bill, and it may be desired to discuss it.  If the discussion on this motion to-day is prolonged, very little time will be left to debate these other measures, so I would suggest to Deputies that they should curtail their speeches on this motion, particularly in view of the fact that the whole matter will be again before the Dáil, and no great changes will have taken place in the meantime.</P>

      <P>I guarantee to speak for only three minutes.  There are two facts about Fianna Fáil economics that develop more and more clearly as our deliberations proceed. One is their horror of international trade, and the other is their unlimited belief in governmental interference. I hear Deputies asking from the Fianna Fáil Benches: &ldquo;Are we to remain dependent on the foreigner for this, that and the other?&rdquo;  My answer is &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;  I want to be dependent on the foreigner for certain things and I want the foreigner to be dependent on me for certain things, and that is international trade.</P>
      <P>There seem to be four convincing arguments against this particular motion.  The first is that it is a tax on the food of the people.  Secondly it is an addition to the already excessive powers which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is taking upon himself. He is becoming every day more and more a dictator.  Thirdly this particular proposal has already been examined and rejected by the Tariff Commission after careful consideration. Fourthly, the Minister has confessed that he introduces this motion as a step towards the fabulously expensive folly of turning Ireland into a wheat growing country in a world that is already glutted with what and although we can get wheat produced in countries that are far more advantageously situated climatically for the purpose.</P>
      <P>This motion again brings home the Government's lack of ordinary common sense and their utter failure to take account of world conditions or to learn from the experience of other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to trespass very much on the time of the House.  In his opening statement, the Minister candidly admitted that the imposition of a tariff is not likely to relieve unemployment.  That is an important consideration and it is as well that we should know it at the outset. If not what is it going to benefit?  That is what I would like to know.  Prior to this an effort was made to lead us to believe that the relief of unemployment, the employment of very many more than are at present in employment, was uppermost in the mind of the Minister and the minds of Deputies on his side of the House.  Now that we have an acknowledgment from him that this tariff is not introduced for the relief of unemployment I think it is well that the Minister should realise that it would be very difficult, if he adopted any other attitude, to convince people because we know that with modern flour milling machinery, such as we find to-day, there is very little employment given in flour mills. We have very few efficient flour mills in this country and the employment given in these flour mills is very small indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister says that the tariff is not likely to relieve unemployment I wonder has he investigated, to his own satisfaction, the circumstances surrounding the proposition that he now puts before the House?  Is there any danger of creating further unemployment? What is the position of our ports and harbours which depend greatly upon the importation of flour at the present time?  Further, is there any likelihood that there may exist at any time in the future what we might term efficient flour mills with modern machinery to produce flour to meet the tastes of the people such as they are to-day, tastes created by the class of flour they have been using in the past?  I know of my own knowledge that this tariff will be a very serious blow to many harbours all over the country in districts where there are not any efficient flour mills, where no modern machinery exists and where there is no likelihood of its being installed at any time in the near future. A very few flour mills properly <Col N="214" /> equipped would be sufficient to meet the requirements of the people as far as flour is concerned.</P>
    <P>With these prospects starting us in the face what is going to be the net result of this imposition?  We have a proposal to levy 5/- per sack, that is, £2 per ton.  There may be other manipulations by which the Minister may try to explain that the tariff is not likely to amount to that but there are other considerations which have to be taken into account.  When one realises that there are only a few flour mills properly equipped in this country, one must conclude that the consumer is going to bear the extra cost of freight say from Dublin to the town of Ballina.  Contrary to the view expressed by Deputy Bennett, I venture to say that this is heading towards creating a monopoly and certain mills will as a result try to fix their own prices.  Deputies must remember that the freight from Dublin to Ballina by rail would be about five times the freight from Liverpool to Ballina by sea.  Who is going to bear that difference if we have to get our flour from Dublin?  Who is going to meet it but the consumer?  The consumer has to shoulder the responsibility and he has no means of saving himself from the extra burden that has to be endured in this matter.  How are you going to compensate him?  The Minister acknowledged that this tariff is not going to relieve unemployment.  Therefore, who is going to benefit by it?</P>
    <P>It was impressed on us from day to day whenever a tariff was introduced here that it had only one object&mdash;to create employment and to relieve unemployment. Now we have the acknowledgment that here is a huge impost that will have no effect with regard to unemployment.  I say it will have one effect and that is, that it is going to create considerably more unemployment than you have to-day.  A large number of men are employed at all the large harbours along our coast-line in the unloading of flour and the reloading of it and a great many carters are employed in taking that flour from one place to another.  What is going to happen as a result of this?  All that handling of the flour is going to be a <Col N="215" /> thing of the past.  I wonder where those who have been engaged in that work are going to find employment in the future?  How does the Minister propose to remedy that situation?  Of course, he may suggest that it may be remedied in this way, that men at the moment engaged at one port may be engaged later on at another port. That might hold a few years ago before you had machinery, elevators and suction plant utilised for the purpose of taking cargoes from one ship to another or into the railway wagons.  The result of utilising that machinery is that it dispenses with the necessity of employing people for carrying sacks from one place to another.  All these considerations have to be borne in mind.  If I could see that there was any prospect of anything being done in the way of relieving unemployment, if I could see anything but the inevitable result of this tariff&mdash;that the consumer will have to carry the whole responsibility in this matter without any corresponding benefit&mdash;then I would feel inclined to say that it was a matter for consideration, but until I hear something further from the Minister that would convince me or any business man of experience that there is some advantage to be gained or that some advantage is likely to accrue as a result of this tariff, I must oppose the Resolution.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is to be congratulated on the introduction of this motion.  The one thing that strikes me very forcibly about all the arguments put forward by Cumann na nGaedheal is that not one of them has been put forward with any sincerity. Deputy MacDermot, of course, wants us to sell what we have to sell to the foreigner at his price, and to buy our flour from him at his price also.  That is Deputy MacDermot's idea.  He will find it very hard to get the farmers of Co. Roscommon to agree with him in that.  He will have some difficulty in convincing them of it. Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney seems to have a mania for decrying every tariff that is introduced.  He tells us that it is impossible to grow wheat in this country.  Of course that statement coming from a practical farmer like Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney counts for something.  He seems to forget that the demesne lands owned by him at the present time and the districts surrounding them formed at one time one of the best wheat growing districts in Ireland.  Deputy Davis's native district also was well known for the production of wheat.</P>
      <P>He talks about the danger of this motion and the loss of employment it will mean at various small ports. But none of them have told us that the price of flour had steadily increased since Messrs. Rank got control of the flour milling industry in this country.  None of them have told us that the world price of wheat was never lower, and at the same time the farmer is paying 11/- to 12/- a cwt. for flour at the moment. Deputies opposite made no effort to give any explanation as to the reason for that.  I say the Minister is to be congratulated on the introduction of this motion, and I hope that later on, when he introduces the Bill, that he will take good care that some of the land of the country that is now producing nothing but beef, will be turned into the production of wheat, as it could have been long before this, and would if we had a National Government in office for the last ten years.</P>

      <P>In consequence of the arrangements made over-night, I <Col N="217" /> intend to be very brief.  In other circumstances I would like to deal with this motion at some length&mdash;at least the length of my remarks would bear some relation to the importance of the matter under discussion, particularly in view of the fact that on the 10th April, 1930, I moved in this House: &ldquo;That the Dáil is of opinion that steps should be taken by the Executive Council to frame a scheme of National Control which will provide adequate safeguards for the Saorstát Milling Industry and for the consuming public.&rdquo;  I would like to emphasise that I am supporting the motion of the Minister not because I believe that is the most desirable way in which wheat growing could be encouraged, and not because I believe it is going to reduce the price of the loaf.  On the contrary, I do believe that there will be some increase in the price of the loaf, because if anything at all emerges from the Economic Commission of which I was a member, and of which the present Minister was also a member, it was this, that it was agreed that the flour policy should bear some relation to the wheat-growing policy. I subscribed to that in a minority report.</P>
      <P>I signed the report with certain reservations, and addenda.  I feel that the motion before the House is a motion which has a good deal of merit to commend it.  It is a comprehensive motion.  It deals, in my view, in a very economic way with the relating of the wheat growing policy to the flour producing policy.  I feel with the Minister that whilst agreeing with the experts who gave evidence before the Commission that Irish wheat has a very high water content, yet the hope was there expressed that with the addition of some method of kiln-drying our wheat, wheat-growing in this country could be made a success. I am at one with the Minister in some aspects of his policy and in particular with the one which runs counter to many economic fallacies which have ruled in this country for many years.  We have come to regard cheapness as the be-all and the end-all of our national economic existence. I do not at all believe in that policy, neither do I subscribe to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" /> While I know that there are a whole lot of tags in the Fianna Fáil policy I certainly do subscribe to this particular item in their social and economic policy.  I would, at the same time, utter one word of warning. There are many farmers in this country who have supported the Fianna Fáil policy and they must remember that in supporting a policy they cannot afford to support it in one particular item without supporting the whole lot.  If there is to be a nationalisation of industry in this country some measure would have to be introduced to compel agriculturists to grow wheat, and the Minister will have to pass such a measure as this.  I say that because I have found from experience amongst farmers that they will not grow wheat unless compelled to do so.</P>
    <P>The policy in this country is that the farmer will grow what pays him best.  That is a fairly sound policy for the individual, but it may not be a sound policy for the country or for the nation.  If the farmer is going to profit on the one hand by the remission of rates&mdash;he has been told he is going to get full de-rating in a short time&mdash;he must face up to this aspect of affairs, that he may be compelled, and possibly will be compelled to grow wheat, because that is the essential kind of wheat policy as announced by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have heard something here about international trade.  Like Deputy MacDermot, I do support international trade, but I do so with certain reservations. I do not support international trade when most of the trade is on one side and very little on our side. That is what was happening under the aegis of the Millers' Mutual Association of England when they were dumping into this country all their surplus flour to the detriment of the smaller millers in the country.  I have always had regard to this point of view that there are a lot of activities growing up around the smaller mills in this country.  Some years ago, before the Rank combine, we were faced with the closing down of our native mills and there was great danger that the whole of this key industry would pass into the hands of foreigners.  I never <Col N="219" /> had, and I have not now any objection to foreign capital coming into this country, but I certainly refuse to be swallowed up, to have our country swallowed up and our industries swallowed up by people who are not nationals of this country.  I certainly do intend to vote for this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not desire to say very much in connection with this motion, but I do want the House to advert for a few moments to the views previously expressed in this House at one time by Deputy Anthony on the motion for the nomination of Eamon de Valera as President.  The Labour Party expressed the view that something should be done, and indeed, must be done if we are going to withstand the attacks by the foreign flour combine upon our existing flour mills. I said then on behalf of the Labour Party that I hoped the Government would take steps to insure that our Irish mills did not pass under foreign control.  Foreign control where the capital is not easily got-at is an undesirable thing in any country.  But foreign control as expressed in the activities of the foreign flour combine which was operating in this country was a most undesirable kind of foreign control, because it was control designed not merely to secure a monopoly of the milling of wheat, but it was control designed to close our mills and to use this country as a dumping ground for the surplus flour of our next-door neighbour.  The simple question we have to ask ourselves to-day is this: Are we standing to-day for allowing the Irish market to be saturated with imported flour from Great Britain, or are we standing for the policy of keeping our Irish mills in existence?  As I said before, whatever case there is for importing foreign wheat, there is no case whatever for importing foreign flour. Deputy Blythe spoke on this matter to-day, and we thought we would have some alternative suggestion from him as to what would be done in the situation confronting the country.  But we had no alternative suggestion from Deputy Blythe.  We had no remedy offered for the difficulty which faces <Col N="220" /> us.  A fair summary of Deputy Blythe's speech, Deputy Davis's speech, and Deputy MacDermot's speech would be: &ldquo;Keep on buying in the cheapest market; keep on exporting your wealth to other markets; keep on exporting your population.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In none of the speeches delivered by any of those Deputies was there any suggestion for facing up to the difficulty which exists.  I agree with Deputy Anthony when he says that while international trade is good and desirable and something to be encouraged, when it is mutually advantageous, the kind of international trade we have had for the past generation has not been an advantageous kind of international trade so far as this country is concerned.  No Government with any commonsense would shrink from taking steps to conserve for our people such forms of industry as are suitable.  The whole tenour of the speeches from the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches and the speech of Deputy MacDermot was to buy in the cheapest market.  If we allow that policy to dominate our whole national industrial activity, then why produce anything at all in this country, because almost everything we can produce can be produced somewhere else much cheaper than we can produce it here. If we followed that policy to its logical conclusion, where is the wealth to be produced to purchase those commodities which we are recommended to buy elsewhere?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have one complaint against this motion.  I think it is not dealing with the matter in the big and comprehensive way in which it requires to be dealt with.  I would much prefer if the Minister established a Wheat Board charged with the responsibility of conserving for our flour mills the milling of wheat, and at the same time regulating the importation of wheat, and, if necessary, the importation of flour. Over and above those things I would like the Board to be given power, not merely to carry out the duties which I have indicated, but in addition, to do something to encourage the growing of wheat in this country.  I think both activities are related one to the other. I hope the Minister will give us some indication that this is only a preliminary <Col N="221" /> step, and that subsequently we will have established a Wheat Board which will not merely regulate our imports, which will not merely regulate the activity of our flour milling industry, but which will look after the interests of the consumer and do something to develop wheat growing within the country.</P>
    <P>We will be told it is quite impossible for this country to grow wheat.  There was a time, even within living memory, when this country grew very much more wheat than is grown to-day.  I am assured by practical farmers, and by others who claim to be authorities on the matter, that there has been no substantial change in our climate over that period of years.  If we could grow wheat at one time, and grow it profitably, why cannot we do the same to-day?  The only difference between that period and now is that at that time we used our land for the purpose for which the land was intended by Almighty God, namely, to produce food for our people.  But the element of commercialism, the element of the Stock Exchange, enters into our modern activities, and we prefer to buy wheat from outside, because it is cheaper; we prefer to carry on a scheme of international gambling and barter instead of using our land for the primary purpose for which it is intended.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give us some indication that this is only the first step.  If it is intended to be the last step, I think it is a hopelessly inadequate step.  I hope the Minister will give us an assurance that it is only a forerunner of the establishment of a Wheat Board, of more and more Governmental regulation of our wheat production and of our flour milling.  I hope the Minister will not be deterred by Deputy MacDermot's objection to Governmental interference from going ahead with a scheme for developing our flour mills with the utmost advantage to the nation, and at the same time endeavouring to have grown in the country, plains of wheat such as at one time existed here, and so enhance the wealth of the nation.  If the Minister proceeds on that line I think he will be taking a sound and <Col N="222" /> practical view of the problem, and the successors of Deputies Blythe and Davis in years to come will, I think, have good cause to regret the speeches about buying in the cheapest market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it right to associate myself with those who have stressed the importance of preserving, as far as we possibly can, the milling industry in the country.  When one bears in mind that a good deal of the by-products of this industry have an important bearing on our production of bacon, pork, beef and other commodities of that sort, I think the importance of it will be fully realised. We must recognise the necessity that exists for getting as cheap a supply of foodstuffs for agricultural live stock as ever we possibly can.  We always had a milling industry in the country, and possibly, were it not for the enormous over-production after the Great War, it would not be suffering from the depression which exists.  I think the help proposed to be given under this Bill will enable us to bring back again, in some degree at any rate, an industry which was such a very prominent one in this country.</P>
      <P>It has been pointed out that under the quota system there is a danger of inefficiency creeping in.  I think that particular danger will regulate itself, because if there is inefficiency and if bad flour is produced there is not the slightest doubt it will not be bought. The particular mill concerned will then not be producing its quota, and therefore that quota will be reduced and the mill will eventually go out of existence, largely because it produces inferior products.  I feel that with the help that is now proposed the milling industry will be able to hold its own. Undoubtedly Irish offals are of a very high character, and are particularly valuable in the production of bacon and pork.  A mixture of food is absolutely essential in that particular connection, and we have not enough offals in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the small fine that is proposed for over-production is a mistake and I am not in agreement with that portion of the Minister's policy. The help proposed to be given to the <Col N="223" /> inland mills will be of tremendous assistance in keeping them going, and I welcome that prospect.  In the constituency I represent there are several important mills which, unfortunately, have not done so well.  This proposed help will be of very material assistance. Having regard to the important bearing of this industry on our greatest industry, agriculture, I believe the Minister is working on lines which will be productive of much good, not alone to the milling industry, but to agriculture as a whole.</P>

      <P>Deputy Blythe criticised these proposals on the ground that they were childish, ridiculous and absurd.  Deputy McGilligan criticised them on the ground that they were not original, that they were similar to proposals which he had submitted to the flour millers.  They were both wrong. Deputy McGilligan added, and I should like Deputy Blythe to grasp the significance of it, that the proposals which he submitted to the flour millers were rejected by them.  We have been told that these proposals will mean an increase in the price of flour, and a number of Deputies spoke as if the motion before the House involves an import duty upon flour.  It does not. There will be no import duty on flour, except persons decide to import flour other than under a licence issued by the Revenue Commissioners.  It is intended that all the flour required to be imported, all the flour we need to get from abroad in order to supplement the products of our own mills, and a little more will be imported duty free.  We have been told that we are going to increase the cost and, at the same time, that that increase in the cost to the consumer is going to have no result except to confer a benefit upon a small group of inefficient mill owners.  I take it that that represents the argument used by Deputies opposite&mdash;a big increase in the cost to the consumer, in return for which we are going to get only a benefit conferred upon a small group of inefficient mill owners who, for some reason that has not been stated, are, we are told, opposed to the scheme. <Col N="224" /> Deputy McGilligan asked me if these proposals had been submitted to the mill owners and what they thought of them.  They were submitted to the mill owners, and the Flour Millers' Association said that they would much prefer to be left as they are.  They are quite pleased with their present position and do not want any change.</P>
      <P>What is the present position?  Deputies must consider these proposals in relation to the present position.  Deputy Blythe talked about a <i>cartel</i> under Government control.  There is a <i>cartel</i> in operation now.  There is not a free market for flour now.  The production of Irish mills is strictly limited.  Irish flour millers have to pay a fine if they exceed the quota in operation now.  There is a certain limitation upon the amount of flour that may be imported.  There are definite regulations governing every transaction in relation to flour used here, whether that flour is produced in an Irish mill, or imported from an English mill, and that system of control is administered by a body partly composed of Irish millers and partly of English millers.  Is it more desirable that the flour milling industry and the flour importing industry should be controlled by an organisatition of that kind than controlled by a Department of State?  Deputies who talk about the cost to the consumer appeared to take very lightly the additional cost to the consumer which resulted from that organisation which came into existence during their term of office and which they did not interfere with.  The price of flour has gone up.  Deputy Moane, I think, stated that.  The Irish flour millers are making such respectable profits out of this arrangement that they do not want to change.  It does not suit them to change this arrangement, because the arrangement designed by flour millers for flour millers is working for the benefit of flour millers.  The alternation in the arrangement is going to mean that the flour milling industry is not going to be operated entirely for the benefit of the millers in future, but that the rest of the country is going to get some advantage out of it as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="225" /> There is this essential difference between the system now in operation and the system we propose to bring into operation, that the quantity of flour that is to be imported under the new system will be determined by us.  We can permit any quantity of flour we wish to come in, if we find, for example, that prices are rising unduly, and that there is a combination of flour millers to exploit the situation. We can permit in whatever quantity of flour we consider necessary to upset that plan.  We cannot do that now. At present, the quantity of flour imported from British mills, whose owners are members of this Association, is strictly subject to limitation, and these English millers, if they proposed to import into this country more flour than they are permitted under the arrangement would also have to pay a fine upon the excess.  If this is a scheme to prevent the flour-milling industry here developing upon efficient lines, what is the system we have now in operation?  We, at least, are going to give these mills in this country an opportunity of working to capacity which they have not got now.</P>
    <P>We have been told that this fine upon excess production that we are proposing to operate means that we contemplate an increase on flour to the same amount.  At any rate, our mills will be working to their full capacity. These mills pay a fine upon excess production on present quotas without working to their full capacity.  Was it contemplated to limit the increase of price that was to take place when the Association came into operation?  Why did not the Government then in office take the necessary steps to protect the interests of the consumer?  Their hearts are bleeding for the consumers now, but for two years they saw the flour milling industry here being regulated in that manner, being regulated by an organisation over which they had no control.  They saw the price of flour gradually going up. step by step, in consequence of that arrangement and they did nothing.  It was only when we decided to end that arrangement, to put the flour milling industry of the country under Irish control, to give it an opportunity of developing to full capacity, and extending capacity to meet all the requirements <Col N="226" /> of the country that they began to consider the interests of the consumer.</P>
    <P>What are the interests of the consumer, and how are the interests of the consumer going to be affected by these proposals?  We have flour mills here at the present moment, some twenty of them, producing flour to 50 or 55 per cent. of their capacity, and selling flour at a price which they consider satisfactory, at a price which they consider so satisfactory that they are opposed to any proposal to alter the present arrangement.  If, instead of producing to 55 per cent. of their capacity, they in the month of September produce to 100 per cent. of their capacity, could we not look for a reduction in the price of flour?  Their overhead charges will be the same. Rents, rates, upkeep of machinery will be the same.  Consequently, their cost per unit of production will go down.  We can, therefore, contemplate a reduction in the price of flour, except in so far as that reduction in price is offset by a reduction in the price of offals.  In any case, it is in a downward direction we shall except the price to go.  The proposal that any mill producing in excess of the quota should pay a fine of 3/- per sack will, of course, be completely inoperative for some time, because each mill is going to get the quota which represents the maximum capacity, calculated in accordance with a certain formula. It will not be able to produce flour over and above that quota except by working more than the usual number of hours per week or the usual number of weeks per year, or installing additional machinery, which will take a considerable time, in any case.  It is necessary that we should have some such fine in operation if the quota is going to have any significance at all. We have got not merely to ensure that the flour-milling industry develops, but also that it develops along the line most conductive to the national welfare. We have, for example, to get flour mills other than in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  If we draw a line through Dublin and Galway, there is no mill north of that line, except one in Sligo.  We must get mills north of that line.  Consequently, it is necessary to ensure that all the development <Col N="227" /> will not take place in one area or another, and that when we have reached the point where we will have mills enough to produce our requirements, the costs in certain districts are not going to be higher because of heavy transport charges, and, also, it is our desire and aim to keep in existance the inland mills.  The inland mill is an essential part of any wheat policy and we have a wheat policy.  The tendency in recent days has been to concentrate flour milling at the ports.  That concentration of flour milling at the ports would be all right and, in fact, would be a welcome development if we did not contemplate the use of the inland mills again for the milling of Irish wheat.  We are going to do that.  At present the inland mill has certain disadvantages vis-a-vis the port mill, but these disadvantages will, to a large extent, be offset by the advantage of being able to get their wheat cheaper when Irish wheat is available, or, at least, a certain part of their supplies.  I do not, however, want to be taken as saying that all the advantages are with the port mill.  There are some millers in this country who appear to be strongly of the opinion that the balance of advantage is with the inland mills.  There are, as a rule, lower wages paid to the workers in a country town or rural area than in one of the port cities, because the cost of living is usually much lower.  There are, in many cases, cheaper power, lower rates and other advantages which offset the disadvantage of having to pay more for the grain, and, in so far as there is a balance of disadvantage against the inland mill, we are, for the time being, going to redress it by a subsidy arrangement, and, subsequently, by a wheat arrangement. It can be argued, and it has been argued, that the larger inland mill has the balance of advantage as against the port mill.  I do not know whether that is so or not, but it seems quite clear that, in respect of the smaller mill, with a capacity of less than six sacks per hour, the balance of advantage is against the inland mill, and consequently, it is intended to limit the subsidy to the annual output <Col N="228" /> which a mill of that size could undertake.</P>
    <P>The Tariff Commission Report has been quoted, and, particularly, the statement made by the applicants for the tariff that if the duty of 3/- per sack, which they requested, were imposed, they would increase their price almost by the whole of that amount. That has nothing whatever to do with the proposal before the Dáil.  At the particular time when the tariff application was in progress, it was alleged that flour was being dumped here at an uneconomic price, and we know that the Irish mills were going out of production, in consequence of the fact that they could not, no matter how efficient or well situated they were, or what other advantages they possessed, sell flour at the price at which flour could be bought from certain places. Undoubtedly, the imposition of the tariff would have meant some increase in the price of flour, but that increase in price would have taken place in any case, because the English millers, at that time, were engaged in this campaign to put the Irish mills out of existence and an increase in the price of flour would undoubtedly have helped the disappearance of the Irish mills.  We are not putting a tariff on flour.</P>
    <P>The quotations which were read from the report have no relevance to the motion before the Dáil.  The flour that will be imported under licence will be imported duty free and will be sold at the same price and subject to the same profit as it is being sold at the moment, but it is very hard to say what exactly the price of flour is and this is a factor that Deputies should bear in mind, that the price of flour, from week to week, or month to month, fluctuates quite considerably. Up to the date of the establishment of this Millers' Mutual Association, that fluctuation was quite remarkable, but since then the fluctuations were not quite so frequent, because, of course, a situation has been created in which certain regulation was possible, but it is since then that there have been differences in the price of flour in one month as against another, frequently by much more <Col N="229" /> than 2/- or 3/- a sack, and the average miller will tell you that he does not know the average price at which he is selling flour until the end of his accounting year, when he divides his output into his receipts and finds out what his average price was.</P>
    <P>No impost on the community follows from the passage of this motion. The intention is to secure that the price of flour will be fixed, not by the three shillings fine on production in excess of the quota, or the 5/- import duty on flour not imported under licence, but by the element of competition which will be allowed to continue. It is our intention that over and above the requirements of the country there should be flour available, either from existing mills here or by importation, in sufficient quantities to ensure that the inefficient mill is going to suffer, and that the efficient mills will be able to make progress, and that there will be effective competition between them all without the importers, and that, consequently, any attempt at profiteering will result, as it should result, in immediate loss of trade.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan asked me what was the present capacity of the working mills and what was the amount of flour which would be imported during the month of September.  I could not give him even an indication of the amount of flour which would be imported under licence during the month of September.  The capacity of the existing mills has been stated by them to be 2,200,000 sacks per year.  Taking the requirements of the country at 2,900,000 sacks, we find that only 700,000 sacks per year would necessarily have to be imported, even if none of the silent mills came back into operation, but some of the silent mills will come back into operation immediately the scheme comes into operation. Others will take a longer period, because of the financial difficulties to which I referred, but, with all the silent mills working, the margin between our capacity and our requirements will be very small indeed, and that margin will be closing up at a rapid rate, because already there are <Col N="230" /> certain proposals coming forward for the erection of new mills in particular centres.  I could not follow Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney at all in his remarks about the effects of over-production. We are certainly not suffering in this country from any over-production of flour.  Deputy McGilligan referred to the position of Jacobs'.  It is intended that Messrs. Jacobs can secure all the flour they need, imported under a licence issued in accordance with paragraph 2 of this motion, without being subject to any importing difficulties whatever.</P>
    <P>Some considerable reference was made to the difference in the proposals in respect of mills owned by nationals of the Saorstát and mills owned by non-nationals, those mills owned or controlled by the firm of Messrs. Rank. The intention is to give to each of the mills now working here, no matter by whom owned, a quota to mill to its present capacity, but it is definitely intended that, in respect of mills not owned by nationals of the Saorstát, no increase in that capacity will be allowed.  The remarks made by Deputy Bennett, with respect to the position in Limerick, are altogether wide of the mark.  I do not think that the development of the flour milling industry in Limerick is altogether dependent on Messrs. Rank.  Anyone who looks at a map of this country, and considers the position of Limerick, in relation to wheat growing areas and importing facilities, must come to the conclusion that Limerick is a natural centre for the flour milling industry here, and the possibility of flour milling development in that city can be contemplated without regard to the firm of Messrs. Rank at all.  But, definitely, the intention not to permit any increase in the capacity of mills owned by non-nationals of the Saorstát will not be departed from.  If that decision should involve the abandonment of the Limerick Harbour proposals to which Deputy Bennett referred, then they have got to go by the board but I would like to make it clear that these proposals were examined from the financial aspect without regard to the intention of Messrs. Rank, and they were considered to be financially <Col N="231" /> sound in relation to the trade which the port had in previous years, and not in relation to any estimated increase of trade following upon any extension in the milling capacity of the city.  The decision of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners announced in yesterday's Press seems to conflict with the information supplied to Deputy Bennett.</P>
    <P>We are taking under this Bill power to acquire mills which for any reason are not engaged in the production of flour.  It is necessary that we should have some such power.  If we are to enforce conditions which make the people of this country dependent for their supplies on Irish flour mills, it is necessary for us to ensure that the failure of any particular manufacturer, through any fortuitous circumstance, will not prevent the Irish people getting supplies.  Flour is a necessity of life.  We might for a period do without boots, or without some other articles which are subject to import duties.  We could not do without bread, and if in any circumstances the supply of flour was likely to be curtailed through the shutting down of a flour mill for any reason, it is necessary that we should have power to acquire that mill, and if necessary work it.  I can assure Deputy McGilligan that we will be able to get the necessary technical skill to work the flour mills for whatever limited period it may be necessary for the State to work it.</P>
    <P>As regards silent mills, I have been asked what are the conditions that are likely to be attached to the licence issued to them when they resume production. These mills have been spoken of as if they were uneconomic.  That is perhaps true of some of them, but it is certainly not true of all of them. There are some of them which have closed down for reasons not directly associated with the competition which they had to meet from other sources, and they are equipped and in a position to produce flour as economically as the mills which are at present in production.  If a mill is definitely uneconomic, if a mill is unable to produce flour at a price comparable with the price that other mills are doing it, <Col N="232" /> then there is no room for it in this scheme, because, in so far as the quota is given to any mill, the import figure will show a corresponding reduction, and it is necessary for us to see that that mill will produce up to its quota, and produce at a price at which flour would otherwise be obtainable.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the only conditions likely to be attached to the issue of licences in respect of these mills will have relation to their ownership, and be designed to secure that the ownership will be in the hands of Irish nationals.  Deputy McGilligan also referred to the necessity of having some prohibition upon the sale of mills.  It is not intended to exercise that power of prohibition in respect of the sale of mills by one national of this State to another, but a mill that is now owned by nationals of the Saorstát may, upon sale to a non-national group, or to a non-national, become liable to the loss of its quota.  Definitely the intention there is, irrespective of what the effect may be in other directions, to secure that this industry will not pass under foreign control to a greater extent than it has been permitted so to pass up to the present.</P>
    <P>The question has also been raised as to the amount of employment likely to be given.  I did not say that no employment would be given, but I said that the amount of direct employment in the mills would be small.  A modern flour mill, I explained, does not require very much manual labour.  Roughly speaking, 150 to 200 persons are likely to be given direct employment in the mills.  It is not a large number, but there will be a considerable amount of employment given in ancillary industries as well.  Apart from that, the whole flour-milling position must be considered in relation to the tillage position.  If we allow our flour mills to go, we will never find it possible to bring into operation the tillage programme we have in mind.  The preservation of an efficient flour-milling industry is an essential part of any tillage scheme.  As Deputies are aware, the growing in this country of the amount of wheat we would require to supply our annual consumption of flour would give very substantial employment, <Col N="233" /> employment to more than 20,000 men per annum.  It will take some considerable time, if in fact we ever get to the point of supplying all our requirements, but we can go a long step in that direction, and those Deputies opposite who believe or have been advised that it is not feasible or advisable to grow wheat here or to mill that wheat into good flour here are completely mistaken.  Not merely is it possible to grow wheat and to grow it in considerable quantities, but some of the best flour-millers in this country are more than satisfied that very satisfactory flour, better in many particulars than the flour now offered, can be milled from that wheat even when that wheat is not subjected to any processes of mixture with any imported grain.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton asked if this proposal was merely the first step in relation to a general wheat programme.  I explained in introducing the motion that that was the case.  Under this motion we propose to restrict the importation of flour as from 1st September.  From that date we will endeavour to get the existing mills to take on the full production. The next step will be the bringing into production again of the mills now silent and the erection of new mills in the districts where these mills are most needed.  The legislative proposals which will be submitted to the Dáil in the autumn will provide the necessary means to that end.  At the same time certain proposals in relation to our tillage policy will be brought to the Dáil.  We hope that next year, in the harvest of next year, there will be much larger areas under wheat than heretofore, and a beginning will have been made towards getting on to the position in which the whole or the greater part of our requirements in flour can be milled in Irish mills from Irish wheat.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there was any other point raised to which it is necessary that I should refer except in one particular.  The speech made by Deputy Bennett and a certain remark made by Deputy Corry make it necessary that we should clearly understand what the position is in respect to foreign ownership of flour mills.  It <Col N="234" /> was suggested that Deputy Bennett had intimated to Messrs. Rank that if they held on for a certain period there might be a change of Government and that they would then be in a position to carry out their original programme. If my information as to the attitude of Deputy McGilligan is correct and if I have read aright the various indications on the files of my Department I do not think that Messrs. Rank would be well advised to give effect to Deputy Bennett's hint.  No matter what the Minister for Industry and Commerce does, no matter who is Minister for Industry and Commerce and no matter what is the political situation existing at the time it would not be possible for any conscientious person in that position to watch the developments which have taken place or to study the obvious indications of the policy of Messrs. Rank without being gravely perturbed.  I know that Deputy McGilligan was perturbed.  I know that before the change of Government took place he was seriously considering whether or not the time had arrived for him to take action. The change in Government took place and in the situation that existed I decided that action had to follow. Having given the circumstances of the case full consideration, I decided that the best course to follow in the present circumstances was to cause the least possible upset while at the same time taking the necessary steps to ensure that the position would not be worsened.  Consequently, it was intimated to those concerned in the Limerick and Cork enterprises which are under foreign ownership, that under any flour milling scheme which would be introduced they would be limited to their present capacity and that so long as this Government remained in office there was little possibility of their being allowed to extend beyond that capacity.  In my own view, in their being allowed that limit I felt we were dealing generously with them.  That is the position, however, and I would be very much surprised if, by any misfortune, Deputy McGilligan came back into office, he would decide to change that policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move &ldquo;That this Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;  This Bill makes provision for an expenditure under two distinct heads: firstly, under Section 2 for an expenditure by the Minister in discharge of his functions under the Act of 1925&mdash;that is, for an expenditure of £335,000; secondly, by the Electricity Supply Board for additional provision for the generating capacity of an expenditure of £365,000. The provision made for expenditure by the Minister will, it is expected, be final as far as he is concerned, and it covers four broad heads: (1) the settlement of the contractors' claim; (2) the settlement of claims for compensation; (3) certain minor works; and (4) costs of administration.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (5) of Section 11 of the Shannon Electricity Act of 1925 imposed a limit of £5,210,000 on the amount of the advances which can be made from the Central Fund for the Shannon scheme.  That amount was increased by the Electricity Finance Act of 1929 to £5,835,000.  The further increase contemplated by this Bill brings the total up to £6,170,600.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These advances will be made to the Shannon Fund, which is under the direct control of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, subject, of course, to the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  The payments made from these advances will be made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The position in respect of this Fund is as follows: The total borrowing powers authorised under the Act are £5,835,000.  The total payments made up to 30th June this year were £5,780,200, leaving a small balance of £54,800.  The expenditure for which provision is now required is: (1) Compensation. The total required in respect of compensation is £203,250.  The main item is in respect of compensation which will arise for lands flooded or required in or around Lough Derg. The amount which we are asking for in respect of compensation may be on the generous side.  It is hoped that a number of claims may be settled for somewhat less than we have estimated, but it is obviously desirable that we should be on the safe side to avoid any <Col N="236" /> possibility of having to come to the Dáil again with a further Bill, and also to enable the various compensation claims to be disposed of as rapidly as possible.  There is a sum of £23,197 required for certain minor civil works. There are a number of such works required of various kinds, none of them very large.  In addition, there is a sum of £6,000 required to meet administrative expenses up to the completion of claims in respect of lands flooded and acquired.  We are also making provision for £5,000 for contingencies. The total under these heads amounts to £237,447.  Deducting from that the balance given already of £54,800, we get a net amount of £182,647, which is the sum required in respect of these items.  We have to add to that a sum of £150,000 payable to the contractors. These two together make a total of £332,647, or roughly, the £335,000 that we are asking for now in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the payment which has to be made to the contractors is as follows: In August, 1930, the contractors rendered their final account in respect of the works carried out by them under the constructional contract dated August, 1925.  The full amount of the claims came in round figures to £1,055,000. At the time of the rendering of the account the contractors notified the Minister then in office and the engineers that on certain legal grounds they contended that the engineer was no longer qualified to issue a certificate based on that final account, which would be binding on the contractors under contract.</P>
    <P>The engineer proceeded with the examination of the accounts with a view to the issue of a certificate for such items as he considered admissible.  The Minister's representative attended before the engineer, but the contractors did not.  On the 21st October the engineer issued a certificate indicating which items of the account he considered admissible and which items were inadmissible.  The items regarded as admissible amounted, in round figures, to £24,500.  The complaints made by the contractors against the engineer fell into three classes. They complained that the engineer did not give decision at the stage when it <Col N="237" /> was alleged he should have done so; that is, in the case of extensions of time.  They complained that the engineer did not give the decisions which the contractors desired in matters relating to wages, and they complained that the engineer would not act without the Minister's authority in the giving of written orders for extra work.</P>
    <P>The contractors applied to the Attorney-General for a fiat to institute proceedings in the courts with a view to establishing their contention that the engineer was no longer qualified to make binding conditions under the contract, and thus reopen all the decisions in the certificate of 21st October, 1930.  The late Attorney-General did not grant the fiat, but he appears to have intimated to the contractors' solicitor that he would consider any further representations they were in a position to make on the matter.  Before the matter was proceeded with, the facts of the case were reported to Professor Meyer-Peter. He was one of the experts concerned with the initiation of the civil construction side of the Shannon works.  He was asked for an independent opinion as to what sum, if any, over and above the amount paid to the contractors on foot of the engineer's certificate of the 21st October, the contractors could reasonably expect to establish as due to them on the final review contemplated in the contract of the items of their account regarded as inadmissible. Professor Meyer-Peter, having considered the matter, mentioned a sum in the region of £150,000.  The Executive Council of the late Administration approved of an offer of this amount.  An offer was accordingly made to the contractors' solicitor; it was accepted by his clients, and a formal agreement made between my predecessor and the contractors was subsequently executed.  It is on foot of that that this payment of £150,000 is now being made.</P>
    <P>The second heading under which expenditure is provided for in this Bill is in connection with the decision, by the Board, to increase the generating capacity.  That is under Section 4. Before dealing with that I would like to explain the necessity for Sections 3, <Col N="238" /> 5 and 6 of the Bill.  Section 3 has relation to so much of Section 15 of the Principal Act, as amended by Section 7 of the Act of 1930, as limits the time within which variations may be made. Sub-section (2) of Section 15 of the 1927 Act provides, in effect, that when any portion of the Shannon works is handed over by the Minister to the Electricity Supply Board, the Board becomes liable for a proportionate part of the advances made to the Minister from the Central Fund for the construction of the works and also for any outstanding interest on such advances. In practice it was found that it was impossible in some cases to determine accurately the liability to be transferred to the Board until a considerable time had clapsed from the actual transfer of the works.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (10) of Section 15 of the Principal Act, which was inserted as an amendment by the Electricity Supply (Amendment) Bill, 1930, provides for the subsequent variation of a liability fixed under sub-section (2), but it was stipulated that such variation could not be made after the commencement of the half-yearly payments to be made by the Board by way of repayment to the Exchequer of the advances originally made to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for the construction of works&mdash;payment of compensation, etc.  It is now considered that the limitation upon the time within which the variation may be made in the liabilities transferred from the Board should be removed.</P>
    <P>Under Section 5 (4) of the Shannon Electricity Act of 1925, claims for compensation for permanent interference with fishery rights may be made at any time within ten years after the completion of the works which caused the interference.  The repayment of the advances to the Minister for paying such compensation will be imposed as a liability on the Electricity Supply Board by making some portion of the Shannon works that has been handed over to the Board liable for such proportionate part of the advance as is fixed.  It is clear that claims for compensation for permanent interference with fisheries may be made long after the portions of the Shannon works <Col N="239" /> have been handed over to the Board, thus necessitating the variation of the proportionate parts of the advances already fixed and necessitating such variations later than the date fixed by sub-section (10) of Section 15.  It is possible that a similar variation may be also required by reason of expense incurred by the Minister under certain other heads.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is necessary to give the Electricity Supply Board power to construct, maintain and operate the generating station at Ardnacrusha. When the Act of 1927 was being drafted it was intended the Board should not embark on extension works at Ardnacrusha without the prior consent of the Oireachtas.  The view is that sub-section (3) of Section 20 of the 1927 Act empowers the Board to construct, maintain and operate electrical generating stations anywhere throughout the Saorstát except at Ardnacrusha. Therefore, apart from the provision of the necessary money, the Board must get legal power to extend the generating station at Ardnacrusha and that power is conferred by sub-section (1) of this section.  The effect of sub-section (2) is to make any additional works constructed under Section 5 part and parcel of the Shannon Hydro-Electric Scheme for all purposes. The Act of 1927 defined in general terms the functions of the Board in relation to the system and contained other provisions such as that which enables the Board to exercise certain functions and duties through its duly authorised officers and servants. Sub-section (2) of this section places the extensions, for which Section 5 provides, on the same footing as the remainder of the Board's works.</P>
    <P>As regards Section 6, the position is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce acquired under the Act of 1925 certain lands, chiefly flooded lands, as a result of the construction of the works.  The Minister as the result of the acquisition becomes liable in lieu of the tenant to pay annuity and other payments to the Land Commission under the Land Purchase Acts. Certain agreements have also been <Col N="240" /> made with the Great Southern Railways Company for the construction of railway sidings in connection with the transformer station.  Under these agreements certain small payments are due in perpetuity by the Minister to the Company and <i>vice versa.</i>  There are also certain other mutual benefits and obligations under these agreements. Under existing powers the Minister must pay these annuities and transfer to the Board the liability for repayment to the Minister for Finance of the advances which must be made from the Central Fund to enable the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make the payments.  This is a somewhat cumbersome procedure, particularly as the amounts involved are comparatively small, and when the Minister has completed operations under the Shannon Act it would be a waste of time and labour, involving book-keeping transactions over a long period, if the present arrangement were continued.  This section accordingly provides for the transfer to the Board of the liability to make such periodical payments in future.  The transfer will be made by order in the same way as the liability in the past has been transferred to the Board for repayment of advances to the Shannon Fund.  It is estimated that the total annual payment for which liability will be transferred to the Board under the section will not exceed £3,000, which is a comparatively small sum in relation to the Board's annual revenue.  It will be made out of the Board's revenue, and it will not be possible for the Board to obtain advances for the purpose of meeting recurring liabilities of that kind.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides a sum of £365,000 for the provision of additional generating capacity.  Shortly after the change of Government took place, it was intimated to me by the Electricity Supply Board that new generating capacity would be required to meet the peak load in 1933, and the summer load in 1934.  Certain discussions took place as a result of which the Board examined the various methods by which the additional generating capacity might be provided.  The Board examined the cost and the advisability of <Col N="241" /> providing the additional generating capacity by new hydro-electric units only, by new steam units only, and by a combination of one hydro-electric unit and one steam unit.  The figures presented by the Board supported their recommendation, which was in favour of getting the additional generating capacity by the installation of one new hydro-electric unit at Ardnacrusha and an additional steam unit at the Pigeon House.  The Board estimated that in the year 1933-4 the number of units to be developed would be roughly 200,000,000; that the peak load in that year would be 78,000 kilowatts; that it was necessary to have a plant capacity of 98,000 kilowatts.  The capacity of the existing plant being only 90,000 kilowatts it was necessary that provision should be made for the additional 8,000 kilowatts required for the peak load.  The existing plant, they estimated, would be deficient by 20,000 kilowatts in the following year, by 32,000 in 1935-36, and by 44,000 in 1936-37.  They estimated that the annual cost of production in respect of new plant to produce 40,000 kilowatts would, if new hydro-electric units only were determined upon, be £41,000; if new steam units only were determined upon, £39,500; and with a combination of one hydro-electric unit and one new steam unit, £33,500.  That would be in the year 1935-36&mdash;and the plant capacity would have to be increased by that amount.</P>
    <P>The reason for these figures, and the reason for the Board's recommendation was that if they decided to go ahead with new hydro-electric units only, certain additional storage would have to be provided, but by the installation of an additional steam unit at the Pigeon House it was possible for them to make much more advantageous use of their present storage.  They have what they call an iron ration of water storage.  That iron ration represents a certain water storage which must be held during the various years until such a late period in the summer that it generally cannot be utilised at all.  If sufficient steam generating capacity to carry the day load in the event of an extended dry spell in the autumn were provided, that iron ration of water <Col N="242" /> storage could be released.  Consequently it appears from the Board's report that the provision of additional steam capacity as the result of reducing the number of units to be generated by steam would enable the water power to be more fully utilised. It is intended that when this additional plant has been installed, and when generation has reached 250,000,000 units per year, there will be only about 15,000,000 units steam power required, while the rest, that is 94 per cent., will be water power.  During the dry years, of course, the conditions can be such that the steam energy will be about 50,000,000 units at that stage of the load.  The costs of the various installations recommended by the Board are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  the installation of a 25,000 k.v.a. generator, combined with a Kaplan turbine of 30,000 horse power, at Ardnacrusha, together with the necessary transformer and switch gear, £220,000;</P>
    <P>(2)  the installation of a 20,000 kilowatt steam turbine with provision of boiler capacity of approximately 10,000 kilowatt at the Pigeon House station, £100,000, and</P>
    <P>(3)  an increase in the boiler capacity from 10,000 kilowatt to 20,000 kilowatt at the Pigeon House station, £45,000.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that a 20,000 kilowatt steam turbine is to be installed at the Pigeon House, but that increase in boiler capacity will be only to the extent of 10,000 kilowatt.  That is all that is considered necessary at the present time.  It has been intimated that certain developments in boiler construction are going on, and that, although these developments have now been nearly completed, they have not yet reached the stage where we would be safe in investing in a boiler of the new design.  It is not necessary, however, that we should do so at this stage.  This second boiler will not be required for some time, and, by that period, it is thought that these new developments will have been perfected, and that, consequently, by delaying the installation of the second boiler until it is absolutely necessary, the advantages of the new development <Col N="243" /> can be secured.</P>
    <P>In connection with these new works it is necessary that I should explain to the Dáil a certain decision that was made by the Executive Council. The information conveyed to me was that the additional generating capacity would be required in the winter of 1933, and that there was no time to be lost, as the installation of the additional generating capacity would take a very considerable time.  A period of 18 months was mentioned in connection with the new hydro-electric units, as representing the very minimum which could be considered, whereas 20 to 24 months was much more likely to be the time required. A period of 15 months was mentioned in connection with the new steam units.  It is understood that the total capacity of the existing plant is adequate to supply the peak load next winter, but certain insurance against breakdowns must always be effected, and if one unit went out of production, the generating capacity of the remainder would be inadequate to meet the load.  Consequently, it is essential that some additional generating capacity should be provided before the winter of next year.  The circumstances required a prompt decision and yet it was not possible, on the information available, to make that decision.  A certain period elapsed while the Board was examining tenders received, and various expert reports submitted and preparing its report for me.  In the meantime, they recommended that, in so far as the new hydro-electric unit might form a part of any programme determined on, work could be proceeding on the erection of the coffer-dam at Ardnacrusha.</P>
    <P>I felt that I was bound by an undertaking given to the Dáil by my predecessor, and given at my own request, that no part of the money provided for the Electricity Supply Board, the £2,000,000 provided last year, would be expended on new generation.  When this proposal in respect of a coffer-dam, however, was submitted, in view of the apparent need for urgency, the Executive Council decided to authorise <Col N="244" /> the Board to proceed with the construction of this coffer-dam and to charge the amount against that £2,000,000.  The amount was £30,000. That amount is, however, being provided out of this sum now asked for, so that the position in respect of the two million pounds will remain unchanged. It is necessary, however, that we should inform the Dáil that that step was taken.  The coffer-dam will be more or less a permanent structure. It will be permanent to this extent, that it will be left there after the new turbine has been installed, with whatever alterations are necessary, and will, consequently, reduce the cost of the installation of an additional turbine which may be installed at Ardnacrusha. The erection of another coffer-dam on another occasion will not be necessary.</P>
    <P>No doubt Deputies will be querying the position in respect of the publication of the Board's accounts.  The Board's accounts for the year 1930-31 have not yet been published and, as Deputies are aware, they are long over-due. It was originally intended that these accounts should be available at the beginning of this year, but the audit of them has not yet been completed. I am now informed that it is expected that the audit will be completed by the end of August and that the accounts for the year 1931-32 will be ready for audit by the end of July, and that the audit should be completed by the end of September.  It is necessary, however, that Deputies should be given some information concerning the financial position of the Board.  We had a long discussion on this matter last year, and it was revealed that the financial position of the Board was by no means satisfactory.  I do not think it can be said to be satisfactory yet, but, as the public know that that is the position, the question we have to ask ourselves is, by what date, and with what speed, the unsatisfactory nature of the financial position of the Board can be remedied.  It is estimated that the accounts for the year 1930-31 will show a deficiency of £198,318.  Deputies may compare that sum with the very much smaller deficiency shown in the accounts for the previous year which <Col N="245" /> have been published, but, in order to get a proper comparison, they must bear in mind that included in the items of expenditure in the year 1930-31, there were for the first time the full interest charges to the Department of Finance in respect of Shannon works transferred to the Board.  The greater part of the works were transferred in that year and an interest payment of í359,419 fell due.  There were also certain abnormal allocations in respect of depreciation of stocks and bad debts, but the position at the end of the year was, as I have said, that the revenue of the Board from the sale of electricity, or from any other source, was inadequate to meet all the charges against that revenue by a sum of £198,318.</P>
    <P>That figure which I have given is of course an estimated figure.  The audited accounts have not been published but it will serve to give Deputies a general idea of the position.  For the year 1931-1932 it is estimated that the deficiency will be £33,169.  That estimated deficiency is substantially less than the deficiency of the previous year but there is nevertheless a deficiency there.  In that year the interest payment was £455,000, but the same provision in respect of depreciation of stock and bad debts had not to be made.  For the future the position is that the Board estimate that for the year ending 31st March next they will produce a surplus roughly in or about £90,000.  In the following year, however, that is the year 1933-4, sinking fund payments will arise for the first time.  The surplus for the year 1932-3 plus the surplus for the year 1933-4 will be adequate to meet the sinking fund payments arising in the year 1933-4, leaving a sum of £33,000 for allocation to reserve.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that the Board is required by the terms of the Electricity Supply Act, 1927, to make certain provisions in respect of depreciation and other charges and that the interpretation of that section was one of the matters in dispute between the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Board.  A strict interpretation of the section required the Board to make normally a provision in <Col N="246" /> respect of depreciation which would provide a fund capable of renewing all the assets transferred to the Board when their renewal became due.  If that full depreciation fund had been provided, taking it that the Board is required to make that full depreciation fund, there would be a deficiency in that fund of £407,000 on the 31st March last.  That deficiency would have increased to £507,000 on the 31st March next and would continue to increase according to the Board's estimates up to the year 1937.  In each year some payment against that deficiency might, they estimate, be made but as from next year, that is, the year 1933-4, the Board expect that the revenue will be adequate to pay all the cost of operation, repairs and maintenance, and the general management expenses, and the payment in respect of liabilities assumed from local authorities, interest and sinking fund charges, with a small surplus.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from these figures that any proposal to reduce the charges for electricity would have to be very carefully considered.  The financial position of the Board is, as I have said, unsatisfactory and it is necessary that we should be satisfied that any alterations in policy in respect of rates was not going to produce a diminution in revenue which would make that position still more unsatisfactory.  The Board estimate, on the basis of annual consumption, an increase in consumption of 14 per cent.  It might be contended that a decrease in rates might produce an annual increase in consumption to a greater amount.  That may or may not be correct.  I have not had an opportunity of going into that aspect of the matter with the very great care that would be necessary before I would be in a position to make up my mind as to what the possibilities were but in the light of the figures which I have given it is quite clear that any alteration in policy would have to be very carefully studied before being given effect to.</P>
    <P>The present position is that the Board expect to meet all their interest charges in this matter, plus all their operation expenses, with a small surplus this year.  They hope next year to be able to commence the payment of <Col N="247" /> sinking fund charges as well as interest charges, and the operation expenses with a small surplus, but as I have pointed out, they have as yet made no provision for a reserve fund, as was contemplated under the Act, and they do not expect to be able to reduce in any way the deficiency in the Reserve Fund, which a strict interpretation of the relevant section would make it necessary to decide exists, until the year 1937.  At the same time there is no reason to regard the financial position of the Board as unsound in any way.  I think that whatever interpretation of that particular section of the 1927 Act is the correct one, it is an arguable case that the Board should not be required to make that full depreciation provision, while at the same time repaying capital advances.  However, it is obvious that even if we decided that the Board should not be required to make that provision for depreciation at all, it would still not be possible to contemplate any diminution in revenue consequent upon a reduction in lighting or heating charges.</P>
    <P>I have refrained up to the present from saying anything that might give rise to a general discussion upon the whole policy of electrical development in this country.  The Government on coming into office had to deal with the situation that it found existing.  It found the Shannon Scheme controlled by the Electricity Supply Board in the position which I have indicated, requiring additional generating capacity to meet an anticipated demand for current and requiring that additional generating capacity with considerable urgency.  It has put before the Dáil the recommendation of the Electricity Supply Board as to the manner in which that increased generating capacity should be provided.  We have examined, with all the care which the time available permitted, the various figures submitted by the Board.  On these estimates and figures it appears that the Board's recommendations must be accepted as being the most economical and best suited to deal with the situation, particularly the situation in respect of time.</P>
    <P>The new generating capacity which <Col N="248" /> will be provided by this expenditure will provide for all the requirements of the Board to the year 1936.  After that date, if the increase in consumption continues at the rate of 14 per cent. per annum, a still further generating capacity will have to be provided, but before then, I think, there should be an expert examination into the whole question of the future of electrical development here.  There should be an examination into the various problems that are associated with the provision of additional generating capacity at Ardnacrusha, such as the suitability of providing it by additional steam plant or the possibility of providing it by some other method.  However, that examination can proceed, and it is the intention to arrange for it, in due course.  In the meantime, however, the position is that this increased generating capacity must be made available and no time can be lost in doing so.  Things have already run rather close and we could not afford to take the risk of delaying matters any further as, otherwise, at the end of 1933, we might find ourselves in the position that we should be unable to supply the demand for electricity that might the arise.  Consequently I recommend the Bill to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that there has been no Bill, which has proceeded from the Ministry to date, to which I can give such complete, warm acceptance and recommendation as this.  Apart altogether from the three relatively rather minor changes made in Sections 3, 5 and 6 of this measure, there are the two somewhat big points outstanding&mdash;that there is required one sum of about £335,000 and another sum of £365,000.  I feel that the fact that the present Ministers come here asking for these sums is in itself the completest answer that could be given to the comments made by the present Minister, when he stood over here, in July, 1931.  That may be regarded as introducing controversial matters which it would be better avoid, inas-much as we have made an agreement as to the saving of time.  I will avoid them by postponing them, because there will be an opportunity later on <Col N="249" /> to go into them, but since the Minister said something about the generating capacity that will have to be provided I want to refer to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that the first sum of £335,000 is required for compensation claims, for certain minor civil work, for certain administrative expenses which will be incurred until the land claims have been paid off, for a very small sum for contingencies, and for a sum to meet the charge made by the contractors with regard to the final account.  I would like Deputies to note in this House that, when the discussion last came on with regard to the Shannon expenditure and finances, it was assumed by the people who are now the Government that the contractors' claim for £1,000,000 would have to be paid.  Two or three Deputies here, who were most voluble at the time with regard to the Shannon finance, made up expenditures of their own, which they said would have to be met, which amounted to from £14,000,000 to £17,000,000, and one of these millions pointed out was the million that would have to be found to meet the contractors' claim.  It must be a source of gratification to them that that one million pounds has been reduced to £150,000, and was reduced to that amount more or less, but not entirely, under the circumstances of which the Minister spoke.  The claim arose, according to the Minister, because the Engineer was declared by the contractors as no longer qualified to issue the final certificate for the reasons that it had been charged to some extent that he had been against the contractors from the point of view of extra wages and that he was too much under the control of the responsible Minister.  They claimed that the sum of £1,000,000 was due to them.  The Minister said that action was first of all prevented because the Attorney-General had not granted his fiat for execution, but he said that, prior to this taking place, one of the experts on the scheme was consulted.  That skips over a certain important piece of history.  The Attorney-General had not at any time refused to grant a fiat. He said that in a matter of this sort, a Governmental matter, a matter dealing <Col N="250" /> with a State proposition, he had to have a very definite prima facie case before him before he could give a fiat and he asked for further supplemental information.  There was a lag in proceeding and it turned out afterwards that that lag had been deliberately brought about because the contractors themselves were becoming somewhat doubtful as to the amount of money they would have to spend trying to establish their claim to oust the Engineer from the contract and because they were beginning to be not so confident that, even if they succeeded in their first plan of ousting the Engineer, they would be granted a sum equivalent to the expenses that would have to be incurred in a legal suit.  The matter was taken up afterwards, while this lag was going on, by men representative of the firm and myself. When certain representations were made to me, I had also to consider what the State was likely to lose in the way of actual money, and in the way of time lost on the part of two or three very eminent civil servants and engineers in the occupation of the State, in having a case of this magnitude, if they had to be kept going making up evidence and giving evidence in a very long drawn out case such as this promised to be.  Before there was a consultation with Professor Meyer-Peter, there was a consultation with the Engineer, and he frankly admitted that if there had been a representation made to him when the final certificate was being issued and the contractors had appeared either in person or in the person of their representatives, he had no doubt whatever but that the final certificate which he had given in the first instance would have been increased.  By how much, he did not say.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances it would be necessary to go into details and figures and to find out what is the proper sum to have paid in addition to the £24,000 which was the amount of the financial certificate.  After certain detailed examination of that amount of money was made, Professor Meyer-Peter was definitely approached and asked to consider himself established as arbitrator hypothetically.  In that I <Col N="251" /> was relying on the fact that the contract itself, which was rigidly and tightly drawn, did contain a clause where, by agreement between both parties, an arbitrator or arbitrators could be set up for the determination of any points that fell for dispute between the two sides.  I asked Professor Meyer-Peter to consider himself, for the time being, established as such arbitrator, and to let me know, in private, his opinion of the amount of money which equitably should be granted to meet the contractual rights of the company and the contractors' claims, the impact of these being left to his determination as to which was the superior matter and which had the more justice about it.  He was asked to say what, on the whole, he would consider would be the sum that he would recommend for payment.</P>
    <P>Previous to hearing from Professor Meyer-Peter about the sum, I had myself discovered that the contractors' firm would be satisfied with the payment of £150,000.  Professor Meyer-Peter recommended something more. However, subsequently the action was settled on the basis of £150,000.  It is to be noted, in that connection, that Professor Meyer-Peter was called in, but not as somebody to pass a rather casual sort of judgment on the matter. The whole business was presented to him as if it was an arbitration established under a contract by virtue of a particular section of the contract.  He was asked to pass his judgment in that capacity and he did so.  It was a rather satisfying thing that the contractors themselves had come to the conclusion that £150,000 would satisfy them; that an engineer whose conduct was not questioned, had come to the conclusion that a minimum sum of £120,000 and a maximum sum of from £160,000 to £170,000 would be satisfactory, and that Professor Meyer-Peter's sum of £150,000 was the sum granted. It seems to me, taking all these things into consideration, that the House and the country should be satisfied that the payment made is not merely the minimum payment to prevent an action but an equitable sum from the <Col N="252" /> point of view of all the parties to the contract.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that last point, because undoubtedly I met nobody in my time who investigated these works, and had an appreciation of what was going on, who did not express the opinion that the contractors had done work on that scheme which was worth very much more than the payment they received.  And I heard nobody outside the firm but who expressed the opinion that the firm had in fact made the ordinary percentage profit that a firm would like to have on such a contract, and I heard expressions of opinion of doubt as to whether they made any profit or not.  The second item is one of £203,000 for compensation, and it was said that that was for flooding in and around Lough Derg.</P>

      <P>Well, in the main. I am sorry he mentioned any sum for compensation because he will find that there will be an immediate foregathering of people concerned to see how best they may divide this £203,000. That figure will be before them.  I think it would be better if we had been told, simply, that there was a certain sum of money required for compensation and if the Minister liked he could even come forward and say that it would be a reasonable thing to increase his contingency amount and that he was prepared to give compensation. There are charges for flooding in and around Lough Derg, in that amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I had better explain.  I do not want to create any wrong impression.  There are quite a number of specified classes of cases of compensation included in that amount. The largest happens to be in and around Lough Derg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear that the £203,000 is for a number of claims and not from Lough Derg alone.  In connection with Lough Derg there was the suggestion made that by depriving the turbines of a certain amount of water leading to a lowering of the lake a certain amount of damage, now inflicted upon the <Col N="253" /> owners of land around Lough Derg, could be prevented in the future, and that there would be no necessity to protect in years to come these proprietors from excessive flooding, or to buy out certain lands proposed.  I presume that the matter is still under consideration, because I do not think it had advanced to a point where any real decision could be taken on the matter.  And as that particular programme did seem likely to lead to a considerable reduction in the sum that would be paid to those around Lough Derg I think it is one that could be pursued with advantage.  The least optimistic figures I saw indicated that a saving could be made on that payment.  The other item included in this sum of £335,000 does not amount to much.  In ordinary years the administration expenses and contingencies are small and reasonable. The next item is for £365,000.  We were told in a general way, and that was the only statement that could be made, that this was to provide increased generating capacity to meet the situation that will develop in 1933 and to make provision for 1934. Further, we were told that there had been a comparison made of the different costs of making a new and sounder provision for a combined hydro-electrical unit or fuel provision, or a combination of those, and that there should be a combination of a hydro-electric unit of some type, with extra steam capacity and all the necessary incidental charges to this for increased storage capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder in that connection has any further investigation been made of the possibility of joining up the ordinary storage accommodation which is contemplated at the moment in the hydro-electric development here with the fuel provision made in the North of Ireland in the Belfast steam station.  Because undoubtedly it seemed, at one time, that arrangement, if it could be made politically, was going to be of economic advantage, and that if made, it would not mean a transfer of money.  It would mean one party getting units in one part of the year and paying them back in another part of the year, and <Col N="254" /> that it would in fact help both parts of the country to achieve a fuller use of the particular capacities they have than what is happening at the moment.  There was also the further point made at one time that the increase, whether sufficient or not for the purpose in view I cannot say, could be got by a very small expenditure of money on one of the upper lakes&mdash;Lough Ree.  I suppose since this has been put up the Board have examined the matter and turned it down in favour of what is now proposed. Passing that, however, it is of immense interest, and to myself an immense source of satisfaction, that Ministers intend keeping up, without any of the opposition that I met with, in terms of the requirements of 250,000,000 units of electricity.  When the Shannon Scheme was first talked of we were deemed to be the maddest of optimists because we engineered a scheme which looked forward to the requirements of this country of about 150,000,000 units.  It is very gratifying to find that without any great claims, as against the optimism of the statement of the Minister, we are making provision, and not many years ahead, in which he sees there will be a requirement of 250,000,000 units.</P>
    <P>A turbine is going to be established at Ardnacrusha at a cost of £220,000, with 30,000 horse power.  In addition, there is 20,000 k.w. steam with the attendant boiler capacity, costing £100,000, at the Pigeon House, and some further provision by way of boiler capacity there as well.  Is there any impact of the tariff proposals on any of the parts required for the turbine at Ardnacrusha, for the boilers, or for plant at the Pigeon House?  Has the Board, in fact, in this year, apart from the installation, by reason of the tariff policy had to pay anything extra for requirements since the new load of tariffs came on?  That would be an item which would upset the calculations made in relation to the old prices if there is any considerable sum in which they would be mulcted.  I am not sure that I understand what the Minister said with regard to the coffer-dam below the power house.  I think he was quite right in doing what he did, when <Col N="255" /> it was made evident to him that time was of the essence of the situation, and that he had to go on immediately with the provision of proper dam arrangements. But he took a roundabout way and if the Board charged its funds with £30,000, which presumably is now going to be repaid, I do not think anyone would have objected if that £30,000 had in fact been spent out of whatever funds the Minister had in hands, as long as there was a fairly speedy explanation to the House of what happened. Clearly circumstances rule some of these things.  I understood him to say that there is a coffer-dam being put down at a cost of £30,000, charged on the Electricity Supply Board's funds.  He then said that the coffer-dam would be left there to help further installation.  Surely the actual coffer-dam will not be left there.</P>

      <P>The underground foundation, carrying on the old policy. That is very much what was previously proposed and I do not think there is any addition.  I think that is what the Minister said and that we will have the items which are specifically referred to in the Bill.  The House should welcome the fact that the scheme is now shown to be getting out into the open.  I always longed for the day when some such stage of development of the Shannon would be reached, when some stage in the Board's equipment, attention to business and efficiency would be reached that one could say: &ldquo;Very good, there is particular development, generating so many units; there is sale for these units at such an average price and that meets various things which a Board of that type ought to meet year by year.&rdquo;  Then we should be told what <Col N="256" /> is left out, and, if anything was left out why it was left out.  As far as the Minister spoke of the amount I think we have at any rate come very near that stage, which cannot be reached until after 1933, when sinking fund payments fall upon the Board.  It is only when the demand to meet sinking fund begins that they are facing up to future responsibilities in their entirety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this expenditure of new money because it means that the Board sees ahead of it another market, has the new power for it, and sees itself selling at the present rate.  The expenditure of the money is I think very good.  As far as the expenditure of the first £330,000 is concerned it is all to the good.  It is very hard to give any estimate on an undertaking of this magnitude but we are very close to the end of the development stage of the original Shannon Scheme. We have in fact gone beyond the original Shannon Scheme as far as capacity is concerned.  As to the work that the contractors did, the subsidiary payments to landowners, and the rest, we are within sight of the end, and it is satisfying to be there. As far as the second sum of money is concerned I am all for it.  It appears to me to be very good, and to be a very satisfactory thing, that the Board wants to tackle the capacity because they see a market ahead in which they can sell to their own advantage.  The Minister has made many comments on the Board and on the accounts.  I do not intend to follow him into all the points he mentioned.  We are told that the audit of the accounts for 1930-31 will be finished by the end of August, and that the accounts for 1931-32 will be ready by the end of this month and produced in September. That means that when the House next meets we will probably have two sets of accounts before us, and that would be the occasion, to my mind, for a general review of the Board's activities.  The Minister in his preamble to whatever remarks he made said that the Board's finances were not yet satisfactory.  What one was concerned about was, when all this situation is remedied, and with what speed, what new situation <Col N="257" /> emerged.  Thereafter, he made certain statements with regard to deficits.  In fairness to the Board, it should be stated that some of these deficits were foreseen.  In fact, some of these deficits were definitely a part of the original economics of the scheme.  To say that the Board have not made any sinking fund payments is only to say that they have not done something that they were not asked to do and which, in the circumstances of the time, nobody would have dared ask them to do.</P>
    <P>We are told that the 1932-3 accounts estimated a surplus of £90,000 but that for the year 1933-4, when sinking fund payments arise for the first time, the surpluses of 1932-3 and 1933-4 will both be required for sinking fund payments falling due in the latter of these two years and that, after that has been paid, there will be £23,000 put to reserve. That is the situation which the Board thought in July of last year they would have been able to reach. It seems to me to be a very good tribute to the estimating capacity of the new Board that their forecasts are being borne out so accurately.  They did estimate that, with the increased charges which they thought fit to impose last year, they would find themselves in a position in 1933-4 in which they would be able to meet their sinking fund payments and carry forward something to reserve.  They saw that carry-forward to reserve increasing in some small way year by year.  They saw that being done while they did make some payment to reserve more or less for a depreciation account.  The recital of the figures in that connection is, I think, intended to create a bogey.  The recital of the figures about the deficiency in the depreciation account if that depreciation account were ruled by the narrow and rigid interpretation of a particular section of the 1925 Act&mdash;I do not think it is worth while speaking about that.  To speak about half a million deficit on a particular account at that time is to take things completely outside their proper framework.  It was never in the perspective of the Board that in those early years there would be a depreciation account of the type that <Col N="258" /> would have amounted to half a million pounds.  There never was, even in the contemplation of the people who made their scheme for them, a depreciation account of that type in the early years.  It was hoped that, as years went on, and early enough, they would begin to put aside something.  The Minister himself has not indicated his view on one of the matters about which he was so voluble last year.  Last year, he would almost have plumped for no depreciation account.  The allegation was made that the Board was being too severely pressed, that no Board should be asked, at one and the same time, to amortise its capital and provide for wasting assets&mdash;to have a fund built up which would allow for the replacing of those assets when wasted.  Yet it could be partly inferred from some of the remarks made by the Minister that he believed the reverse was what should have happened&mdash;that they should have been asked to amortise their capital and, at the same time, build up, right from the beginning, a reserve fund to meet all these wasting assets against the time of their disappearance.</P>
    <P>I am glad to find the Minister coming out soundly with this statement&mdash;that they should be satisfied about the revenue and the continuance of it in a particular way before there would be any alteration attempted in the present policy about charges.  While he did save himself by saying that it might be contended that a decrease in rates would provide an increase in consumption, which might more than equalise the decrease, he felt that was worthy of study.  I hope he will continue to give it study, and I hope he will continue to allow the Board to be, in the main, the rulers of a situation like that, and the people who will have the burden of responsibility for saying whether or not there should be a decrease or an increase in the charges at any time.  That is what they were set up to do.  It was essentially one of their functions.  It is not a matter the responsibility for which should be taken from them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="259" /> The Minister stated that the Board had estimated a 14 per cent. annual increase of consumption.  I should like to have that related back to the last year or the year before that. Last year, when the Board did decide to increase charges, there were many wiseheads in the community who thought that that was a bad plan and that it would have been far better at that time to inagurate a new era of decreased charges, leading to such a vast increase of consumption that the revenue would not decline, but increase.  The Board at that time made quite a detailed series of calculations bearing on the point of increased consumption&mdash;increased consumption under the charges as they were, and increased consumption under the increased charges.  They did estimate an increase in consumption, and they did even estimate an increase in the number of consumers after the increase of charges. Consequently, they estimated quite a good increase in revenue.  If the Minister has those estimates before him, I would like if he would say whether they have been borne out by the facts or whether the pessimists who said that, if the charges were increased, consumers would drop off and that, apart from that, the annual rate of increase in those that remained would lessen and that for both these reasons there would be a very definite decrease in revenue&mdash; whether the pessimists who said this were right.  When I had touch last with the Board, their estimates were being borne out.  From the way they were heading then, the estimates should have worked out.  There had been no falling off in the number of consumers.  There had been no falling off in the amount of electricity that those who had attached to themselves to the scheme were taking.  It would be worth while to have some statement from the Minister on that so that we would know whether the Board's estimates for the future are likely to be correct or not.  Finally, the Minister said&mdash;with this I think the House will be in agreement with him &mdash;they were now providing generating <Col N="260" /> capacity for what was regarded as the requirements up to the year 1936; prior to that date, he thought, so as to provide for a much later date, there should be expert examination of &mdash;this is what I understood him to say&mdash;the type of generating capacity. I think that would be wise.  It would be following out what was done in the original Shannon Scheme.  The original Shannon Scheme was very expertly examined by the firm which put up the proposal firstly, and it was subjected to very detailed expert examination by the four Europeans who were called in to advise on the matter.  It was still further examined by laymen and engineers here.  Quite clearly, before there is a decision taken to embark upon the last stage of the development of the Shannon, whether, say, the Liffey should be thrown in at that point or whether there should be some better combination of steam and hydro-electric power, is clearly a matter upon which experts should advise.</P>
    <P>It would be a new way and I would hope that these experts would advise because one of the functions given to the Board was to advise upon matters relating to electricity in the country and I should imagine that one of the things to which they would turn their attention would be that very matter. What is to happen after 1936?  Is there to be another river tapped or is there to be another fuel tapped?  That is clearly a matter for the Board.  Under the Act as it stands it is for the Board to advise the Government and if necessary to call in further experts to advise them as to what they should do. Possibly the conjunction of these two things and having an expert investigation by the Government would seem to be the plan which would provide the best for the future after 1936.  However the money is required and the money is not very considerable in comparison with the moneys previously voted for the scheme.  The scheme has advanced far beyond the expectations of anybody at the time it was first instituted.  The moneys have been kept under control and the only doubt at the moment is one that will not be resolved until we see the two years' <Col N="261" /> accounts of the Electricity Supply Board.  When these accounts come before the House I believe it will be found that the Board will have done very much what was expected of them. The Board are meeting the interest charges; they are prepared to make sinking fund payments and they are to set aside all of the moneys that ought to be set aside, with one exception, that is the item for depreciation.  On that matter of depreciation we certainly can get satisfaction from the fact that they will be carrying something to reserve and we can see whether what they are setting aside is sufficient.  If we want to see that sum enlarged it will be a matter of getting a fuller electricity development in the country.  If we want a decrease then there is the chance of getting reduced prices right away.  There is, with each addition to the Shannon Scheme, a prospect of a cheaper development of the scheme because the original scheme even in the small matter of the coffer-dam, as the Minister knows, bore on its back very many of the charges that would not be necessary if the country decided only on having the first scheme.  But when the second and third scheme come into being they will reduce relatively the cost of the original scheme and there should be some reason then to hope for a cheapening of electricity in the country. I am in full agreement with this Bill.</P>

      <P>(Clare): Deputy McGilligan gave us the Shannon Scheme.  It threw a good deal of light into obscure places, but it created quite a number of shadows and it is in the hope that this piece of legislation will remove the shadows that I am endeavouring to make any contribution to this debate.  Since 1925 we had some six pieces of legislation regarding the scheme.  I think this is the sixth.  Notwithstanding that it was thought necessary to introduce these successive measures, we still find some shadows lying across the Shannon Scheme.  Are these shadows going to become permanent? The fault is not altogether with the present administration.  The fault to a great extent lies with Deputy McGilligan himself.  Anyhow, whereever <Col N="262" /> the fault lies, my object is to try to remove the defects that at present exist.  I think that some of these six pieces of legislation introduced here and carried into law might very well have for their object the removal of the distress consequent upon the operation of the Shannon Scheme brought about in the district where the Shannon Scheme operates.  I want to refer to such matters as the fishermen disemployed because of the operations of the Shannon Scheme.  That still is a shadow lying across the light of the scheme.  For the past seven years that shadow has been lying there and nothing has been done.  I should like to know from the present administration what they intend to do?</P>

      <P>Bills can be amended and Deputy McGilligan knows that. Undoubtedly these defects lie upon the administration of this scheme for the past seven years and it is nearly time that some consideration was given to them.  We have to consider also the position of lock-keepers who have been disemployed because of the operations of the Shannon Scheme.  If they are to go unemployed now surely we ought to try to find out whether something can be done for them.  People who have been employed there for forty years have now lost their employment. They are offered a sum of £13 a year to live on.  The piece of land which was attached to the house of the lock-keeper has been submerged, the house has been submerged and yet when some of these people ask that the value they were getting from this land and the occupation of the house should be taken into account when compensation is assessed, they are told it cannot be done.  That is a matter that might be set right by some piece of legislation introduced here, or perhaps some provision might be introduced in this Bill to increase the compensation payable to these men.  There is the question of the submerged land.  That question is still hanging fire if you will excuse the mixed metaphor.</P>

I should like to know what has been done in the matter of arbitration in connection with this land that these people have not been able to utilise for the past seven years. I notice that there is certain mention of compensation for disturbed fishery rights but there is not one word about disturbed fishery people whose occupation has been destroyed.  The powers of the Electricity Supply Board are being extended and it might interest the House and those who are responsible to know that for the past seven or eight years people have been disemployed along the Shannon Scheme from Killaloe to Limerick; the fathers of families have been standing idly by seeing people from Cork, Donegal, Mayo, Kerry and several counties in the entire Free State working at their very doors while they themselves are unemployed.  I wonder if this is the manner in which this money is to be utilised now or whether the local people are to stand idly by while people from outside counties are employed. I would appeal to the Minister to see that local labour will be used in the construction of whatever new works are to be carried through there now.  I do not want to intervene any further beyond just asking the Minister to give consideration to these points.

I would just like to ask a few questions. First of all I would like to know whether this is a greater development of the Shannon Scheme or whether it is attached up to the original Shannon Scheme?  Those of us who took the trouble to follow in all its stages from its inception the whole project have not completely forgotten the experts' <Col N="264" /> report and the different speeches in this House by the Minister who promoted the scheme.  We have still in our memory certain details of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The original or partial development of the Shannon Scheme at a certain cost was to do a certain thing.  The greater development was to be an addition at a small extra cost, and it was not only going to give an increased amount of electricity, but also, in a sense, it was to reduce the over-all cost.  Part of the original investment was invested for the purposes of the greater development.  I am inclined to say that this is not a greater development of the Shannon Scheme, but rather a patching, or bolstering up, of the original development.  So far as the greater development is concerned, I think, from what has been said by the Minister and by Deputy McGilligan, that the greater development of the Shannon Scheme will cease to worry this House at any time.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan agrees practically with everything, but he disagrees on one point.  He said that possibly there may be an additional charge on some of the material to be used in Ardnacrusha or the Pigeon House because of the tariff policy of the Government.  The Deputy who was responsible for spending millions on this scheme is now wondering about the extra expenditure that is going to be charged because of tariffs.  I will make him a present of the great point he has discovered.  The Deputy said there was a great deal of volubility from certain members on the Government Benches, and he suggested the Minister was one of these.  He did not, however, challenge many of the things that were said.  I would like to know what is the cost per unit of electricity generated by the Shannon Scheme at the present time.  What is the cost going to be as we go along?  What is the cost per unit going to be when we have not only the interest charges but also the sinking fund to meet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one year alone we have it admitted that the interest charges amounted to £445,000.  Does anyone realise what that means per unit <Col N="265" /> generated, not at the moment, but when we reach that great peg on which Deputy McGilligan hung his hat&mdash; 2,000,000 units?  If we sold every unit of electricity, 2,000,000 units being generated, the interest charges would mean ½d per unit, without taking the sinking fund into consideration at all. The Minister did not segregate the different types of current sold.  I would like to know, for instance, what amount of the current sold in the years 1930-31 and 1931-32 was sold for traction and other industrial purposes and at what rates was it sold?  To what units of electricity would interest charges, which could not be charged to the units sold for industrial or traction purposes, apply?  They were sold, I take it, at very slightly over ½d a unit.</P>

      <P>I stand corrected.  I was afraid to be too hard.  I find I was too optimistic.  We find there were millions of units of electricity generated at the taxpayers' expense sold at less than the interest charges, in order to subsidise private industries which are run for private profit, and not for the State.  I am sorry we did not sit late last night, because we are robbed of being able to do justice to this matter.  I am not talking now of the loss of £200,000 that was made.  We do not know yet what the full loss is going to be.  Optimistic Deputy McGilligan accepts all the hopes expressed by the Board&mdash;not by the contractors or by the experts, but by the Board.  We have got the Board's optimistic hopes as to the future.  By 1936 everything is going to be all right; the whole scheme is going to function O.K.  I am still the pessimist I was at the beginning about this scheme.  Deputy McGilligan talked about some of us estimating that the cost of the Shannon Scheme was going to be £14,000,000 to £17,000,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I said, some years ago, that the scheme would cost £10,000,000 actual cash, not including the cost of the acquired undertakings <Col N="266" /> with compensation.  I stand by those figures.  If anybody understands what £445,000 per annum in interest means he will realise that it represents capital to the extent of, at least, £8,000,000, not including the three-quarters of a million that we are introducing to-day, on which, also, interest charges will accumulate.  I am not sharing the optimism of Deputy McGilligan.  I hope when the accounts come up for consideration we will be facilitated in discussing them in a proper business-like manner, so that we will know where we are and where this scheme is going to end.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan seemed to think that the remarks of Deputy Hogan could be laughed at.  I agree entirely with what Deputy Hogan said.  If the points he put forward are not going to be covered by this money I hope some amendment will be submitted that will cover the case he made for the people who are involved.  So far as I am concerned I will do everything in my power to secure that the injustice to the people the Deputy referred to will be rectified.  I think it is a perfectly scandalous thing that these people are left out.  A person who happened to have a piece of land that was interfered with, or who happened to have a house that was blown up, is entitled to compensation; but the unfortunate people who lost the means of providing bread and butter for themselves and their families are not to be entitled to compensation; I do not subscribe to that.  I do not believe that the making of adequate provision for the people of whom Deputy Hogan spoke will involve any substantial amount.  Provision for the working man usually means that the State is getting something substantial in return.  These men merely want the right to live, and they are prepared to pay their share back to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no idea as to the figures given to the Minister by the Board in reference to the alternative possibilities of meeting the situation with which they are confronted.  I would like to know what will be the additional cost per unit by reason of the installation of the 10,000 kilowatt capacity addition at the Pigeon House.  What is to be <Col N="267" /> the extra cost per unit for the installation of the 20,000 kilowatt capacity addition at Ardnacrusha?  What will be the alternative generating cost if we do not do anything at Ardnacrusha but try to get 20,000 or 30,000 additional kilowatt capacity at the Pigeon House?  If there is nothing else bebehind it other than that we want extra units of electricity, I would prefer to see the Pigeon House working all the year round rather than only occasionally, when we are short of water or when there is a peak demand during some of the winter months.  I cannot see any reasonableness, any business acumen or understanding, in spending additional money in the way proposed when there may be practical alternatives that can be carried out at smaller cost.  If it were the case that we had to spend money at Ardnacrusha, whether we wanted additional units or not, there would be no help for it, and of course it would have to be done.  On the other hand, if by spending additional money there we are going to get extra units, reducing certain costs, or to get these extra units at a lesser cost than under the alternative proposition at the Pigeon House, that would be a reason for it. I should like, however, to have some information as to what these figures mean.</P>
    <P>I mentioned before that at present there is roughly ½d. per unit interest charges on every unit of electricity generated by the Shannon Scheme.  I think I am safe in saying that 30 per cent. is sold at these traction rates, which are less than the cost of interest alone.  If you add, therefore, the overhead costs and the interest charge that is deficient on to the other units, I think you will find that what I said in 1926 is an absolute fact, that the interest charges alone on units sold to the general community, outside those for traction purposes, amount to 1d. per unit.  When we come to have a sinking fund, and if the optimistic point of view is that we are going to have no loss in 1933, if we are going to add to the sinking fund charges&mdash;I do not know at what rate it is going to be &mdash;we are going to find that while before <Col N="268" /> it was possible to generate electricity in this country at roughly .75d. to .98d. per unit, all charges included&mdash; labour, importation of fuel, etc.&mdash;the State has risked upwards of £10,000,000 to enable it to sell electricity at 1½d. per unit, and I think Deputy McGilligan will have to admit that his achievement is not such that it will be an everlasting memorial to his credit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a lot of &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; are all in what the Deputy has put forward.  I am giving actual facts as they face us. I am not saying that there is going to be a loss.  I am quoting the &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; of Deputy McGilligan, when he was Minister, and the &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; repeated by the present Minister, as given by the Board.  The &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; were all there. The actual facts are that electricity to-day, on interest alone, not counting overhead charges, is costing practically 1d. per unit, and that with the sinking fund charges, outside the electricity sold for traction purposes, electricity will cost the consumer 1½d. for interest charges alone, not counting overhead charges, running costs, or wages.  I do not know for how many years the contract made for traction electricity is to run, but I certainly feel that if it binds the Shannon Board to sell the electricity for all time at less than the cost of interest charges alone, it is a thing that will have to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made by Deputy McGilligan to the sinking fund charges arising out of the Minister's remarks. You cannot arrange your sinking fund charges on the basis of what you think you are going to be able to pay.  Your sinking fund charges must be on a basis which will have relation to the life of your machinery and plant. There must be provision for sinking fund not alone for repayment of capital but for replacement of machinery.  If it were possible to do that out of profits, by putting it to reserve, it would be all right.  But until you do that, until you have some definite line to go upon, you cannot have sinking fund rates other than those laid down by the experts or the engineers.  If the life of the plant is so many years, you <Col N="269" /> must make your sinking fund on that basis for the repayment of the capital.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the total cost of the Shannon Scheme is going to be, including the Shannon Board.  I hope we shall soon know what the Shannon Scheme actually cost, including the sum mentioned here, and the cost of running it arising out of the setting up of the Shannon Board; what the cost will amount to by way of compensation, with all the complicated circumstances that arise.  I want to know when we will cease to have to make payments towards the cost of the Shannon Scheme and all that surrounds it.  I do not know what the amounts are going to be, but I hope that some day we will get a list with each item segregated showing us where we stand. Deputy Hogan suggested that the Board were getting larger powers.  I hope they are not getting more powers than they had under the previous Government. It is suggested that the Board are going to get wider powers to do certain things or to be allowed to manage as they have been managing in the past.  I should like to see their powers restricted.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister is going to give the House an opportunity of discussing the accounts of the Board in detail when presented in next August or September.  In view of the fact that the House is now precluded from giving the detailed attention it should give this matter, in relation to things which have happened in the past and the references made by the Minister, I should like him to answer the set of points put to him by Deputy Hogan.  I should also like a definite assurance to the House by the Minister that he will give a proper opportunity of discussing the accounts when presented in every detail, so that we will know something about the position of the Shannon Scheme up to the end of 1931-32.  If the accounts are presented in August or September, we should be able to discuss them in October or November.  I hope the Minister will give that assurance, because Deputy McGilligan accepts everything, and practically congratulated the Minister <Col N="270" /> on carrying out everything that he would have done if he were the Minister.  I want to assure the House and Deputy McGilligan that my opinion of the Shannon Scheme is the same as it was in 1926, and to say that I consider it is shaky from the foundations up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that the more I listened to what the Minister has to say, and what Deputy McGilligan and other Deputies who spoke afterwards had to say, the more it was borne in upon me what a lesson this discussion should be to the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he talks about setting up Indian meal mills and operating them by the State, and taking over industries, if needs be, and running them by the State.  I cannot conceive anything less desirable than the kind of discussion we have had to-day. Deputy Briscoe informed us blandly that this is only a taste of what we will get when he gets down to a full dress discussion of the Shannon Scheme.  There is nothing like plain, blunt speaking, and I say that I do not believe there is five per cent.  of the Deputies in the House who know a bee from a bull's foot about the Shannon Scheme, and here we are all going through the farce of cross-questioning the responsible Minister on the details of the Shannon Scheme, and discussing coffer-dams and kilowatt values with the Minister frankly leaning over to his officials and asking &ldquo;what is a k.v.a.?&rdquo;  How could he know, or how could any of us know? We can devote our time to the discussion of the principles of legislation and warn the people, if we believe that the Administration is going off the rails, but how am I to come here or to come before my constituents and say that I am in a position to cross-question Mr. Browne, the Chairman of the Electricity Supply Board, or any of the gentlemen over there who represent the permanent officials of this Department? They have forgotten more about the Shannon Scheme than I will ever know, and they have forgotten more about it than any Deputy sitting in this House, with the exception of Deputy McGilligan and the Minister <Col N="271" /> for Industry and Commerce, will ever know, and yet we proceed with this farce of discussing the finances and a variety of very highly technical matters when it is manifest to anyone listening to the discussion that it is conducted out of the abyss of ignorance in which the House is labouring and must labour and out of the very self-same abyss of ignorance, if I may say so, with great respect, in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is labouring with regard to other industries he threatens to take over and operate by the State if political circumstances should make it necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mention that because it throws into clear view, and, I hope, will serve to illuminate the mind of the Minister when he talks about certain remedies he proposes to adopt in certain circumstances. I hope that this particular discussion, and the discussion he will have to endure and groan through next September, when he presents the accounts of the Shannon Board, will serve as a warning to him that unless he wants to go out of his mind, and a large body of the members of the House to go out of their minds with him, he will not take the step of running industry by the State.  I do not propose to address myself to the details of the finances or management of the Shannon Scheme.  I do not know anything about them.  All I do know about the Shannon Scheme is to realise the full scope of my own ignorance of it, and I can only hope that other Deputies will know that much about it, but there are matters arising out of the scheme which I do want to know something about, and there are some matters about which I want to know a little more.  I would like the Minister to inform this country some time, because the information was never forthcoming from his predecessor, and, whenever the question was put, there was a pretty sharp answer ready for anybody who put the question, what is the total amount of money that has been spent on capital account in respect of the Shannon Scheme and the distribution system throughout this country that the Shannon Scheme requires <Col N="272" /> for the conveyance of electricity generated at Ardnacrusha to the consumer, and can the Minister form any estimate of what the total sum will eventually be when we are finished spending money on capital account in respect to the Shannon Scheme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get information as to whether the public can ever know the extent of their liability in this matter (1) what has been laid out on capital account on the Shannon Scheme, and (2) can the Minister form any present estimate of what the ultimate liability of the State will be in respect to the scheme.  I speak of liability, while I fully recognise that the operation of the Electricity Supply Board will eventually pay all this back, and pay interest on it, and recoup the State for its outlay, but, speaking from <Col N="273" /> ordinary commercial experience&mdash;I am fully aware that there may be some special practice in connection with the manufacture of electricity&mdash;I do not see why when this scheme was never expected to pay profits, although, of course, it had to pay interest, it should not be expected of it that it should create a depreciation fund, in addition to repaying its capital liabilities, and why it should not have undertaken that burden from the very beginning. Because, so far as I can see, subject always to my ignorance of the management of such complicated and technical enterprises as this is, unless you have a depreciation fund which will replace worn out machinery and installation, at the end of their ordinary life, you will be faced with the very same position as that with which you were faced when you started the scheme.  No scheme can be said to be functioning satisfactorily, from a financial point of view, unless we can say that the State is done with and that the State's potential liability in respect of the scheme is finished, and it is only a question of letting the machine operate until its indebtedness is repaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, we would expect, as was promised by the then Minister, that when capital expenses were discharged back to the Government, what I will call the profits would be used for the reduction of the rates, but I do not see why a depreciation account should not have been operating from the very beginning, and I do not think anything like equanimity could be maintained by the members of this House until they have an assurance from the Minister that an adequate depreciation fund is in being and being regularly maintained.  Deputy McGilligan, who is sometimes difficult to follow when he is making a point, was dealing with Professor Meyer-Peters' award, privately made to him, and he desired to establish it finally in a settlement of this lawsuit.  Not only was the most economical settlement made, but a settlement was made with the contractors which was perfectly equitable.  He said it was a settlement for £150,000. I think he did better than make a perfectly equitable settlement.  He was entitled to make the best settlement <Col N="274" /> he could.  The contractors had the Law Courts to go into, if they wished, and I think the Department was perfectly right in making the best settlement they could, and, as a matter of fact, according to Deputy McGilligan, he made a settlement for a sum less than what Professor Meyer-Peters would have thought equitable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Just about the same sum or very little less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was so near as to be almost the same figure.  Deputy McGilligan went on to rejoice in the development of the demand to 100,000,000 units without clamour, and rather to decry anybody who had any difficulty about endorsing this scheme with the enthusiasm with which he endorsed it when he put it through. It is quite true that the demand has increased, or that the Department now foresees a consumption of 200,000,000 units, without clamour, but not without confiscation, and not without sacrifice, I believe, in the contracts that the Board make for the sale of electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan, who is an expert in all matters appertaining to this scheme, is well aware that it is quite beyond the ability of almost any member of the House to follow him through the exceedingly complicated details of the accounts and the administration of the Shannon Scheme.  I think all will agree, whether they admire his operations under this scheme or not, that he knew it inside out.  It is perfectly impossible to meet or challenge the statements he makes about his achievements in respect to the Shannon Scheme.  It will be also impossible when the present Minister for Industry and Commerce completes his encyclopædic knowledge of the scheme to follow him. He will be producing requisitions for £500,000 and £750,000 and Deputy McGilligan will attack him and the rest of the House will be lost in bewilderment. The Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies will go to the Cumann na nGaedheal Lobby and the Fianna Fáil Deputies will march into the Fianna Fáil Lobby and not a single member of either Party will know what they are going into the Lobby for.  I have always admired Deputy McGilligan in <Col N="275" /> his denunciation of people who advocate the running of industries by the State in this country, but I must say that he is the man who is largely responsible for the greatest example, the most extravagant and reckless example of that particular heresy which he is so fond of pillorying himself.</P>
    <P>I admit that I am not competent to pass judgment on these matters.  All I know is that I want to make this point before I finish.  When our people were suffering under conditions which it is very difficult to describe dispassionately, when our people were living in filthy houses under conditions which were unfitted for animals much less human beings, when there was boundless work to be done in housing the poor and in rescuing them from the appalling conditions into which they have been allowed to sink, the Government of this country decided that it was expedient to spend between five and ten million pounds on the Shannon and to pledge the credit of the country for that purpose.  What the ultimate outcome of that expenditure will be I do not know.  I do not want to decry the Shannon Scheme.  I hope it will be a success.  The more successful it is the better pleased I shall be.  We have it now and it is the duty of every citizen in the State to make the best of it and to help the Government to make the best of it, but I do say this, that I think it was wrong when there were grave social ills to be remedied, which could have been remedied with that money, to embark on this scheme at that time.  I think it would have been better if this money had been spent otherwise.  It has been spent now and I think the time has come for the Minister to give this Dáil some undertaking as to what is the maximum sum that he would recommend the Dáil to advance for the development of this scheme.  It will be poor consolation to us to know of the limit to the ocean in which we have struggled before we shake ourselves and come out dry on the other side, but it will be some consolation to his own followers at least if they know that they have not to troop through the Lobby in voting money for matters which they <Col N="276" /> do not understand and for purposes that they can neither weigh, balance nor judge on.</P>

      <P>I quite understand, sir, but the same thing would apply to Deputy Hogan's plea about the fishermen, and I perhaps thought I might not be out of order in alluding to that particular matter.  At the same time this particular measure was supposed to confer considerable benefits on agriculture. It has certainly failed in that respect on account of the price of current.  The price of light is a thing to which I must draw attention.  Quite recently the Cork County Council had an estimate before them for the lighting of the Courthouse.  The prices that were quoted by the Electricity Supply Board were twice as much as the estimate <Col N="277" /> for gas and that did not include a very heavy sum for the installation.</P>

      <P>I want very little more than to ask a question directly connected with the subject matter of the Bill.  I should like either to be corrected or confirmed in the impression which the Minister's account gave me of really the most important matter in the Bill, that is, Section 4.  Very briefly I formed the impression that what is proposed is by the expenditure of a comparatively small sum of money to make the stand-by at the Pigeon House so effective that a certain stand-by of the power at Ardnacrusha can be put into general service for the supply of electricity by the remaining sum of money, and that it is not proposed in this Bill to expend any of the money allotted under Section 4 on the actual increase of power at Ardnacrusha.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are putting in a new turbine at Ardnacrusha.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>You are putting in a new turbine but you are not providing fresh power.  You are proposing to use the power that is available.  You are proposing to use that power usually and generally for the provision of electric current by keeping a larger stand-by available at the Pigeon House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>By the provision of the <Col N="278" /> additional steam generating unit we make it possible to use a certain amount of the water power which would otherwise have to be retained until so late in the season that it could not be used at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the power available there.  You are proposing by this expenditure to have the Shannon plant available to use that power constantly and in order to be able to do that you are expending that comparatively small sum of money on the stand-by plant at the Pigeon House.  I formed that impression and I think it is quite important that it should be generally known and understood. The reason that I want attention drawn to the fact is this, that otherwise criticism might be made very aptly and strongly about the application of this £365,000 to the Ardnacrusha scheme before the inquiry, which I was very glad to hear the Minister say he intended to have.  It is of the greatest importance in view of the extraordinary figures given to us by the Minister afterwards and the increase in the demand for electrical supply throughout the country, that we should have that inquiry at the earliest possible date.  I venture to express the hope that such an inquiry will be of the widest possible kind as to the best way of providing for the demand which is obviously coming on us&mdash;I was going to say, too rapidly, for the good of our electrical schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister if it would not be true to say that part, at any rate, of the cause of the financial difficulties of the Electricity Supply Board arises from the fact that the transmission costs to Dublin, for example, from Limerick are so high.  I hope that this inquiry will consider the whole matter of the provision of supply throughout the State, including perhaps, a go-back and a revision of the scheme proposed by Sir John Griffiths to make use of the Dublin supply, that is, of the power available by the Liffey. I hope the inquiry will be of the widest possible kind in view of the extraordinary demand, and the increasing <Col N="279" /> demand, which is coming year by year.  In a matter of this kind, 1936 is a very short time ahead and no time should be lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The various points raised during the course of the discussion were mainly of a secondary nature and it will not take long to dispose of them.  Deputy McGilligan referred to a proposal that the Shannon Scheme might be linked up with the Six-County scheme and that it would be an assurance against a breakdown in that respect which would save a stand-by plant here.  There are certain attractions in that suggestion, and if it were possible to make such an arrangement I can see no reason why, the Executive Council here would not be glad of it.  There are obvious difficulties, however, at the present time in negotiating any such arrangement, and the chances of success in the negotiations would, at any rate, be sufficiently small as to make it absolutely out of the question for us to proceed along these lines rather than by taking the necessary steps to provide the generating capacity which we will require next year.</P>
      <P>On the general question of storage&mdash; that is being investigated at the moment, and undoubtedly some expenditure will arise in the near future in that connection.  It may be necessary to lower Lough Ree temporarily for a period of this year, and at a subsequent date to lower it permanently.  If that should be the case, however, it would be necessary to come to the Dáil for additional moneys in that connection.  No part of the moneys set out in this Bill is provided for this additional storage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may happen this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was anticipated that last year it might be necessary temporarily to lower Lough Ree, but the weather turned wet and the necessity did not arise.  The same possibility may arise this year, but it is impossible to say at the present time.  Next year, however, and certainly the following year, additional storage will have to be provided.  It is <Col N="280" /> possible that for a time the additional storage can be procured at a very small expenditure, but subsequent additions to the storage capacity will involve a more considerable outlay. The whole position of storage is being investigated at the moment and no proposals relating to it are now being submitted to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The question of the Killaloe fishermen was raised.  I have had their case under consideration and I may say I have been considering their case with a great deal of sympathy.  The position, however, has been complicated by the fact that it is very hard to get definite information as to those who are entitled to the description of &ldquo;Killaloe fishermen&rdquo; and who have been definitely deprived of their livelihoods as a result of the flooding of the fisheries.  Quite a number of names have been mentioned in connection with the matter, and, whatever claims the persons concerned may have had would appear from such information as we have been able to get to be very definitely bogus claims.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say.  The position is that there is no power under the existing legislation for compensation for these people and if such proposals are to be considered it will be necessary to come to the Dáil to provide the necessary funds.  The matter can then be discussed again in the Dáil, but as matters stand at present we have only power to pay compensation where it is clear that certain rights to property have been destroyed.</P>
      <P>The query was also made concerning certain other possible compensation claims.  The position is that regarding claims for compensation respecting land around the headways, they are going to be subject to arbitration.  We are trying to push ahead the necessary negotiations as rapidly as possible, and I can assure the Dáil that no avoidable delay will arise in getting all these matters disposed of as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to certain sums arising out of the Shannon Scheme, the question <Col N="281" /> has been asked whether this Bill represents a further development of the scheme or a patching up of the old scheme.  I think that it is quite clear that it must be regarded as a further development&mdash;that we are increasing the generating capacity and installing the new turbine referred to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Certain information was asked as to the cost per unit of the electricity consumed.  I am not able to give that information, but if the Deputy will table a question I will supply it.  The question was asked when will payments towards the cost of the scheme stop.  In case of any confusion arising out of the meaning of the word &ldquo;payment&rdquo; I should like to say that the money provided under this Bill, and previous Acts, and the advances made, are repayable by the Electricity Supply Board and interest is charged upon that repayment.  It is expected that the amount provided under Section 2 will be the final payment in respect of matters arising under the Act of 1925.  That expectation may not be fulfilled, but as far as <Col N="282" /> we can foresee, at present, this payment will be final.  As to the point raised by Deputy Dillon, as to the time when advances in respect of the Shannon Scheme will stop, it is not anticipated that they will ever stop. Year after year there will be additional capital to be provided for development purposes as the consumption of electricity increases.  The State is the supplier of electricity and it must be in a position to meet the demand.  The Electricity Supply Board anticipates that the further grant amounting to £300,000 will provide for the development anticipated for some time to come.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding Six Thousand Six Hundred Pounds (£6,600) be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1933, for payment of subsidy in respect of leather (sole and insole).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Executive Council was considering its tariff policy, prior to the introduction of the Budget, the matter of sole and insole leather arose on an application made by the Tanners' Federation for the imposition of a protective duty.  The matter was examined with considerable care, because it was felt, in so far as leather was the raw material of an important industry, any action taken in respect to it would have to be such that the fortunes of the allied industry would <Col N="286" /> not be adversely affected.  It was felt, however, that, in so far as it was desirable to impose a tariff, arrangements might be made which would permit of boot and shoe manufacturers procuring their requirements, in so far as they had to import them, free of duty, although there were certain difficulties arising out of the fact that a number of manufacturers were also merchants, and that it might be impossible to distinguish between leather imported for manufacturing purposes and leather imported for merchant purposes.  The main difficulty we came up against was that there are established throughout the country a number of hand boot manufacturers, a type of craft which we would be very slow to damage in any way.  The imposition of the duty on sole and insole leather, involving as it would a slight increase in the price of sole and insole leather, would have a very serious effect on hand boot manufacturers.  We decided, therefore, that the method of tariffs was not the one to adopt in this case.  I said that the imposition of a tariff would have the effect of increasing prices, because it is clear that leather is being imported at prices which are either uneconomic, or that can barely repay the cost of production and transportation. The leather trade journals published in Great Britain and in other parts clearly show that price cutting is widely practised, and that in the depressed condition of the industry in other countries all sorts of methods are being adopted to hold trade.  A particular effort was being made by English tanners to secure themselves in the market here.</P>
    <P>Having, however, ruled out the method of tariffs we considered what alternative methods might be adopted to preserve and to develop the tanning industry.  As Deputies are aware, the tanning industry was once very widely established here.  Its decline is, of course, largely attributable to the substitution of motor cars for horses, and in no circumstances, no matter how favourable, could the tanning industry ever be restored to the position which it formerly occupied.  At the same time there is considerable scope for development. <Col N="287" /> There is at the moment one fairly large tannery, and a number of smaller tanneries, all reasonably equipped and reasonably efficient, producing leather of a very high quality. In one small tannery leather of a particular quality is produced which is, in fact, exported.  The present production in respect to sole and insole leather is very, very far from all our requirements, although the tanneries are equipped and are in a position to supply in quantities all the requirements of the Saorstát.  They are not, in fact, supplying more than ten per cent. at the moment.  We decided, therefore, upon the method of subsidy and got into consultation with the Tanners' Federation and discussed it with them.  Certain proposals were put up by them as to the rates of subsidies they suggested.  These rates were, in our opinion, excessively high, and would have involved the State paying not merely all the labour costs of production, but some part of the cost of raw material as well.  We went into the matter again in as great detail as was possible, and ultimately decided that a rate of 1½d. per lb. for sole and insole leather manufactured after the 1st July would be sufficient to put the Free State tanners in a competitive position, would not impose any undue burdens upon the taxpayer, and would meet all the circumstances of the case.  The information available to us would seem to indicate that the payment of this subsidy would reduce the cost price of Irish leather to in or about the selling price of English leather.  In so far, however, as Irish leather is admittedly of much superior quality to imported leather it was felt that manufacturers were in an advantageous position to secure the market here in the event of the subsidy and the rate fixed being given. The present position is that roughly 10,000 hides are tanned in the Saorstát every year and, of these one-half are manufactured into sole and insole leather.  At the rate of subsidy we propose the annual cost would be £1,650 upon the present output.  If the output increased four times from 5,000 to 20,000 hides, the total annual <Col N="288" /> cost would be the amount provided for in this estimate, £6,600, which is as much, if not something more, than we anticipate will be required in the present year.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have probably received telegrams and other communications from the Tanners' Federation, in which they state that the rate of subsidy proposed here is too low and will not have any beneficial effect upon the industry or result in any substantial increase in the output of sole and insole leather here.  I ask the House to appreciate that we have to take into account a number of factors and we are satisfied that the rate proposed&mdash; 1½d. per lb.&mdash;is adequate to offset the natural disadvantages which the Irish tanners are labouring under <i>vis-á-vis</i> their English competitors.  Although it will not permit of their making any large profits and will involve a hard fight on their part to improve their position in the market, nevertheless it is as much as the taxpayer might be expected to give them to help in that process.  The revival of the industry is undoubtedly of importance, because there is a very large annual consumption of leather of one kind or another here.  If we get a start made on sole and insole leather, we may be able to branch into other parts of the tanning industry and engage in the manufacture of other types of leather of which there is a fairly large consumption here.  The subsidy is being provided for by estimate because it is largely experimental.  If, after the experience we gain during the present year, following the passing of the Estimate and the operation of the subsidy, we consider that it is desirable to proceed further along these lines, a Bill will be prepared and introduced in the Dáil to deal with the matter.  It will be necessary, of course, to take powers to examine the books of producers and to take other steps to ensure that no unjustifiable claim will be made against the Vote.  We are satisfied that it is not necessary to have these powers for the present year, as we hope to be able to take the necessary steps to safeguard ourselves against fraud, and get all the information necessary for the allocation <Col N="289" /> of the Vote.  But the legislative proposals which will give us the necessary power will be introduced, if it is subsequently decided to proceed with this subsidy arrangement.  I may add that it is intended to limit the subsidy paid to any one firm to the amount which would be paid on 25,000 hides.  In other words, if in the case of any one firm, production exceeds 25,000 hides, the subsidy will be paid on 25,000 only.  It is not expected, however, that total production will reach that amount in the present year.  I think the Dáil should pass this Vote.  It is, in our opinion, likely to lead to the development of an industry which offers considerable possibilities in the future.  If it has the effect which we anticipate and leads to that development, the money will have been well spent.  If it does not lead to development, the money will not be spent at all and the taxpayer will have suffered no loss.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be very brief on this Vote, but there are one or two points to which I desire to direct attention.  We are now going to give a subsidy for the tanning of leather and we have got to do that because the boot manufacturers, although they have got their tariff increased from 15 per cent. to 25 per cent., cannot be got to use Irish tanned leather.  They are certainly not doing it.  If they were doing it to any great extent, this subsidy would not be required.  We are faced with the position that, although a tariff which could not be said to be unsuccessful has been suddenly raised from 15 per cent. to 25 per cent., the people enjoying the benefit of that extra 10 per cent. will not give to other people a little of what they are enjoying themselves.  Why will they not do it?  They made their case when the application for a tariff on leather was on before.  Their case was really based upon two things&mdash;the material supplied to them from the Irish tanneries and the price at which it could be supplied.  The first objection was really fundamental and was never removed.  So far as I can understand the technicality of this matter, we are almost entirely concerned on <Col N="290" /> this Vote with the main part of the hide, the sole leather bends.  That is the part of the hide that remains after the head part and the belly part have been cut off.  I understand that there are two processes by which the hides are prepared for the tannery after the animal has been flayed.  There is the wet salted process and the dry process. The dry process produces a less good type of hide for tanning.  It is more apt to show defects when followed by further processes, but, nevertheless, it is cheaper.  That is what is imported. Our manufacturers say that if they do not get that cheap, imported hide, brought to a certain point under the dry process, they cannot manufacture in competition with other folk.  They stated that even if the tanneries here were to go off the wet salted hide&mdash; they showed no indication then of doing that and I do not know whether they have shown any indications since &mdash;even then the price would be prohibitive. I quote from the Tariff Commission Report, No. 11, page 43, paragraph 142, the relevant portion:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;During the course of the investigation of the application, it was made abundantly clear that Saorstát boot manufacturers were using a class of leather which was not being produced in this country and obtaining it at a price which, even if increased by the full amount of the tariff asked for, would still make it possible to import it at a lower price than that at which home-produced leather could be bought.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The tariff asked for was 25 per cent. and I think that paragraph has a relation to the 25 per cent.  The tariff application was later reduced to 15 per cent.  I think this document proceeds, until the later paragraphs, on the basis of a 25 per cent. tariff.  I draw attention to these words:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;...it was made abundantly clear that Saorstát boot manufacturers were using a class of leather which was not being produced in this country, and obtaining it at a price which, even if increased by the full amount of the tariff asked for, would still make it possible to import it at <Col N="291" /> a lower price than that at which home produced leather could be bought.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Their attitude was that, even given a 25 per cent. tariff, Saorstát leather would not be bought.  In other words, given a 25 per cent. subsidy, the tanner, if he passes on the entire subsidy to the boot manufacturer, cannot get him to buy his leather.  What is the amount of this subsidy?  It is stated to be 1½d. per lb. on sole and insole leather.  If you take that and spread it over the whole hide, not giving any percentage to the different types of hide&mdash;head, belly and bend&mdash; it amounts to 9 per cent.  What situation, therefore, is going to arise? According to the Tariff Commission Report, even if you gave a 25 per cent. subsidy&mdash;they, of course, use the word &ldquo;tariff&rdquo; but I think the terms are equivalent&mdash;and if the tanneries pass that on to the boot manufacturers, they will not be able to get the boot manufacturers to buy their stuff.  What chance, then, have they of doing that if they get only a 9 per cent. subsidy?</P>

      <P>The repairers are brought into this, and the same considerations are said to apply.  The case is not made with the same vehemence but the same considerations are stated to apply.  With a 25 per cent. tariff, it is stated the imported stuff would still be bought.  Here we have a 9 per cent. subsidy.  Unless there is some considerable change in the industry in the Free State or unless the tanners have decided to employ not the wet salted hide, but the dry hide, I do not see any chance of this subsidy being any good whatever, and I do not think there is any necessity for the subsidy.  When the tariff to the boot manufacturers was being increased from 15 per cent. to 25 per cent., the Minister should have used some persuasion to get them to impose upon themselves the obligation to use some percentage of home-made leather.  We would then have been saved this £6,000&mdash;if it is only going to be <Col N="292" /> £6,000.  Surely the use of £6,000 worth of home-tanned leather could be brought about by the boot manufacturers. I think the two things could have been combined in that way and we would have been saved this subsidy.</P>

      <P>I would submit to the Minister that he is only wasting the time of the House in introducing a subsidy of 1½d. per lb. for leather.  The Minister's milling policy has already given the knock-out blow to the dock expansion in Limerick.  The hundreds of unemployed who are looking for employment on that scheme are seriously disappointed.  The one industry in Limerick that is capable of giving employment is the tanning industry but the 1½d. per lb. that is offered by the Minister is of no use whatever to that industry and the Associated Tanners have decided not to accept it.  I would appeal to the Minister to increase the subsidy to the level of the tariff on boots.  Anything less than 25 per cent. is no good and it will be of no use.</P>

I would point out to him that this is of no use whatever.  It will not in fact give employment to one man more than the number employed already. There are in Limerick hundreds of unemployed anxiously looking to the Minister to increase the subsidy to 25 per cent.  Unless the Minister increases it to that figure he may as well withdraw his subsidy altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the principle of the subsidy for this industry. There is in the City of Cork at the moment an abattoir which has practically speaking a huge waste of hides which are only sold for a few shillings a piece.  The means of utilising <Col N="293" /> this by-product by turning it into a commercial commodity has been explored by this particular firm and they are thinking of embarking upon the very industry which the Minister proposes to subsidise.  I feel that this is a step in the right direction and that through its means we will be utilising one of our products, a product which we are producing here at a very cheap rate.  The subsidy will open up a means of utilising that almost waste product and will give an opportunity of developing an industry from this by-product. It is an industry that will give very considerable employment. We all know that in the past there were in the City of Cork several tanneries which have now gone out of existence. If we can revive that industry we will be doing an enormous amount of good.  The Minister is commencing in the right direction.  He has given a reasonable subsidy and it is better to start with a reasonable amount than with a very large subsidy. I do not know of any industry which could be started that can command more sympathy than this particular industry of tanning.  It will foster the dead meat industry and the byproducts of that industry will be used at home.  The subsidy will start or revive what ought to be a prosperous industry in this country if it were only properly worked.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>While in general I am not a very great advocate of tariffs or subsidies I am prepared to support the subsidy in this particular instance mainly for the reason that this industry provides in its manufacture a means of using up a considerable amount of home raw material.  It is a different thing from some of the tariffs that have been imposed recently by the Government. In the case of the woollen or any other industry we had not any assurance that any considerable amount of the native raw material would be used. Here I am given to understand that the proprietors of the largest tanning industry are prepared to give an undertaking that fifty or sixty per cent. of the hides used in their factory will be Irish hides.  It is for that reason and for that reason only that I am prepared <Col N="294" /> to lend my voice in support of that subsidy.  As far as my information goes the tanners and the trade unionists who are supporting the demand for a tariff or subsidy on leather are of one mind as to the effect of the Minister's Resolution.  They consider that it would be practically useless to give a subsidy of 1½d. per lb. by way of helping the industry.  If any subsidy is to be given it must be a far greater amount than that proposed by the Minister. The Minister must give the subsidy on a more liberal scale.  I find it difficult to get up here in this House and support even this subsidy for I believe there are other and better ways of helping an industry than by subsidies, but I believe an exception could be made in this case.  If the Minister presses for it he can get a definite guarantee that fifty or sixty per cent. of Irish hides will be used.  That is the sort of guarantee that he would be unable to get or could get in the case of any other tariff industry.</P>

Deputy Reidy said that the tanners were against accepting it and that the subsidy was quite useless. Deputy Bennett deserted his flag though he said he found it hard to support the subsidy, yet the Deputy wants the subsidy on a more liberal scale.  I submit that the Deputies who have spoken against the amount of the subsidy know nothing about it except what they gather from the telegrams they got from Limerick this morning. The fact is we are proposing in the 1½d. per lb. subsidy to give the tanners 60 per cent. of the labour costs.  If we were to raise the subsidy to 4d. per lb. that would provide not merely all the wages paid by the tanning companies but we could in fact make better provision by giving the workers the amount direct and in that way with the money we could provide for a large number of workers if we were to adopt that method.</P>

They have a better product; their leather is much better than the imported leather.  They can undoubtedly beat the English leather if conditions are levelled up so that they can fight fair.  We are levelling up conditions and we do not propose to do more than that.  The proposition <Col N="296" /> which we are making is quite a reasonable one.  If the members of the Associated Tanners' Federation decline to take this subsidy I am quite certain we will get people to engage in the manufacture of sole and insole leather and they will consider this subsidy sufficient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Take another example. A brewery might be making certain casks and purchasing others.  It would be in the nature of an ordinary extension of business if it proceeded to make those other casks.  If the Minister is of opinion that a business may not only carry on strictly on its old lines, but that it would be enabled to carry out certain minor additions, it would be well to know that.  For the sake of argument, it might be necessary for a brewer to take up the business of bottling.  Changes in the nature of trade might make it necessary for him to bottle.  The object of the amendment is to see that all normal extensions of business should be possible. If the Minister agrees with that, I think he should examine the wording of the section because I believe it is necessary to have it examined very carefully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a big difference. That would enable a firm engaged in one business to stop that business and go into an entirely different business merely because the machinery might be suitable.  For example, a firm engaged in flour milling could mill maize or rice or some other product which would be to some extent a different business.  There are other circumstances which occur to one. Generally speaking, I think it is unlikely, in the case of an existing business which for any reason might want to get out of one line and get into another, that a licence would be refused. At the same time, I think the power to refuse should be retained.</P>

      <P>In case some industrial damage might be done by the transfer. Again, the transfer might be carried out as part of a policy designed to put an Irish firm out of business.  It applies only to foreign firms operating here.  The position is that so far as these firms have been in existence here they are not being interfered with.  In the case of new firms, a licence is required under the Bill.  If an existing firm goes into new branches, similarly a licence should be required, otherwise the purpose of the measure is being refuse should be retained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a marked difference between the two&mdash;a firm <Col N="300" /> coming in and a firm here&mdash;and the Minister knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not altogether&mdash;sometimes. There are quite a number of firms here that are acclimatised as it were, but there are some foreign firms who were not here on 1st June, 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is at least one firm which has been here for a very long period and the majority of the shareholders are resident in this country. It has grown up out of this country. I am sure it is not alone in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the case, for instance, of a foundry engaged in making a particular type of castings for which it has a market now.  It does not make another sort of castings at all.  But, in the course of trade, the market which it has for its present castings might fail, and it might be possible with its plant to make a different sort of castings.  I think from what the Minister said he would regard that as a continuation of the same business.  I should like to hear what he thinks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to say it was.  For example, if there were a foreign firm engaged in the manufacture of women's ready-made clothing, and that firm decided to get out of that business and get into the making of men's ready-made clothing, I think there would be a case for stopping them, in so far as men's ready-made clothing is an over-crowded industry in certain branches at present.  In so far as a firm merely develops and carries on the business carried on on 1st June, there will be no interference, even if there are certain developments arising out of changing fashions or changing methods of production, but in so far as it enters into a new business I think it should become subject to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister is anxious that in a number of cases there should be applications from foreign firms to come in and establish industries.  I gather from the optimistic way he has spoken that firms can hardly be kept off the wires, there are so many applying. Suppose a firm comes in here, even if they get a licence to manufacture a certain type of article, in the first case, if experience shows them that is not the proper article for them to manufacture but that they can use their machinery for other articles, they are not going to be allowed to do it&mdash;at least they would have no guarantee. That is likely to act as a deterrent and possibly work against the policy that the Minister professes.</P>

There is a fairly extensive business and there are great-grandchildren here.  I suppose grandchildren would be regarded as coming within this category.  By <Col N="303" /> reason of the fact that their grand-father or great-grandfather was not born in the country they would be practically estopped from entering into the possession of his property.  A trusteeship would be required to keep it running in that case, and there may be other such cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to press on the Minister that a lot of these convictions would probably be for offences of which the people were unaware. They would probably be only technical offences, and I would ask him to accept the smaller amount suggested, which, I believe, will be quite adequate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that a maximum fine of £50 is inserted in the Bill does not mean that on every occasion on which an offence is committed that fine will be imposed.  I take it that if a man were charged with a purely technical offence, a very small fine would likely be imposed, but I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that prosecutions can only be at the suit of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the Deputy may be sure that prosecutions will not take place purely on technicalities.  They will only arise in cases where, in the <Col N="306" /> opinion of the Minister, there is a deliberate attempt to evade the terms of the Act, and, obviously, the principle proposed here is that there should be as it were a first offence punishment and a second offence punishment. That is what is in the section as it stands&mdash;a fine of £50, as a maximum, with a fine of £10 per day if the offence is a continuous one.  That is the maximum fine and it is a usual provision inserted in Bills of this kind, but, in so far as it is unlikely that prosecutions would ever arise except where there is a deliberate attempt at evasion of the terms of the Act, I think the maximum fine should be retained at that figure.</P>

It is really from the point of view of the effect on a person at a distance who reads a Bill such as this that I ask the Minister to consider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister ought to accept either the amendment in my name or one or other or both of the next.  I think the section as it stands is far too drastic.  It is the sort of thing that ought not to be embodied in legislation.  I presume there will be no such case as officials setting out to persecute any individual, but it leaves it possible for an individual to be given tremendous trouble.  He has simply to be charged and he is put to all this trouble.  I think the sub-section should be struck out and that the prosecution should proceed in the ordinary way, or, if the Minister is not willing to agree to that, he should agree to one of the others.  It is a bad type of section to have in legislation.</P>

      <P>All the matters to be proved are in the special knowledge of the person prosecuted.  It would be difficult, if not impossible, for the Minister to prove them independently. I submit that the paragraph throws no undue burden on the person prosecuted. Amendment 25 suggests that prima facie evidence must be given, but it is precisely in relation to the giving of such evidence that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has the difficulty.  Amendment 26 is unnecessary as the words proposed to be deleted merely explain the earlier part of the sub-section.  I am astonished, however, that Deputy Blythe should move to delete the sub-section because I copied it from him. This sub-section is adopted from the Livestock Breeding Act, 1925, and it constituted the precedent we followed. It seemed to me to be a good precedent so we incorporated it in this Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister must admit that some of these may raise a great deal of trouble in their actual proof in court.  Take paragraph (b). If there were a large number of shareholders and the question of seven consecutive years and all that had to be proved&mdash;I do not say it could not be done&mdash;a very considerable amount of trouble will be caused.  Also, if, after a lapse of years, it had been proved that a particular thing was in a certain line of business, I do not think that a person should be put to all this trouble without even prima facie evidence being given against him.</P>

      <P>I would submit to the Minister that the number of different and detailed things covered here, and which can be very difficult of proof, ought not to be thrown on a person engaged in manufacture here without at least prima facie evidence of the charge being submitted, as well as the charge itself.  It seems to me that, under the section as it stands, the Minister need simply throw out a piece of paper, saying &ldquo;This man is committing an offence under this particular Act&rdquo; and stop there and make no case at all.  In fairness to himself, and to the people engaged in manufacture here, there should, at least, where a charge is brought against a man in business that would put him out of the business he is in, be prima facie evidence brought forward to substantiate the charge.  It is only when the Justice is satisfied that there was prima facie evidence that the man ought to be called on to go through the process of proving some of these very involved things.</P>

All the matters which arise are in the special knowledge of the person prosecuted and it is precisely on the matter of producing <Col N="309" /> prima facie evidence that the difficulty exists.  The Bill is so worded that it shall not be lawful for any person to do any of the things mentioned, carry on manufacturing enterprise, etc., except under the conditions mentioned in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g).  If a person is charged with carrying on business without a licence, and the Minister establishes, to the satisfaction of the Court, that no licence has been issued, it is for the person then to demonstrate that he comes under this section and that a licence is not required.  Only he can prove that but the Minister could not disprove it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Every application under this section for a new manufacture licence <Col N="311" /> shall be in the prescribed form and be made in the prescribed manner and shall contain the prescribed particulars.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to set forth in a schedule to this Bill the reasons for that.  I do not see why there should not be a schedule to the Bill published in the form of questions which a manufacturer making an application will have to answer.  I take it that we are not afraid or ashamed of the questions that will be asked of a manufacturer who is thinking of setting up a new business.  The sooner he knew what he was faced with the better.  He should be able to take up the Bill and the schedule and to consider the questions that he will have to answer in the schedule, presumably in a manner satisfactory to the Minister, so that he can get his licence.  I suggest to the Minister that he should put in the schedule all the questions that will be asked.</P>

      <P>A schedule is not necessary.

Section 1 states that the expression &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; means prescribed by regulations made by the Minister under this Act, and Section 11 states that &ldquo;the Minister may by order make regulations in relation to any matter or thing referred to in this Act as prescribed or to be prescribed.&rdquo;  All such regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas after they are made and if a resolution is passed by either House annulling such resolution, it shall be annulled, so that the prescribed conditions and regulations will be laid before the House.</P>

      <P>No.  Amendment 29 is one that could not be accepted.  It would not be possible to put down in the prescribed form all the information that might be required.  The amendment would suggest that we <Col N="312" /> should actually consider beforehand in relation to any particular application that might come along the type of information in respect of that application that we might require.

      <P>I think that it is not a good plan to have the licence subject to conditions. I presume the licence will be a licence to manufacture a certain article.  As the section stands it might be that a manufacturer shall be licensed to manufacture a certain article, and that he shall pay certain wages or that he shall have John Smith as foreman.  It gives extraordinary power to add conditions of that kind to the licence.  In my view the licence should be a licence to carry on a trade defining that trade as strictly as you like&mdash;to manufacture shirt buttons out of bone or anything you like, but once that is done a person should be allowed to carry on his business in the ordinary way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended to take power under the paragraph to impose conditions designed to secure that the full benefit from the establishment of the industry would be felt here.  In the case of a readymade clothes manufacturer it may be that a condition would be imposed that the whole of the bulk of the cloth used would be of Irish manufacture.  If he required stationery we might require that the stationery would be manufactured here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have required in all cases as a sort of statutory condition that the holder of the licence shall furnish whatever information may be required.  In certain cases we might attach a condition relating to the location of a particular factory.  A foreigner might say that he was ready to engage in, say, Dublin in the manufacture of readymade clothing.  The position, we would say then, is that there are more than enough there already, but that in some <Col N="316" /> town in Donegal or Mayo or perhaps Kerry the proposal could be considered and therefore the condition attaching to the licence would be that the factory could be established in some such district. It is almost impossible to know in advance all the conditions likely to arise, but generally speaking the terms and conditions would be such as to secure the greatest possible amount of employment for our people and to secure to the greatest possible extent that the raw materials for the industry would be procurable in the country. In certain cases also a condition prescribing a maximum output might be necessary.  A firm might come in with a proposal to establish itself here.  We might feel that it would be good to have it here but that it might lead to a monopoly of the market&mdash;that it would establish a big plant and proceed with price-cutting arrangements and thereby put out of business the existing Irish firms.  In so far as there was room for it we would let them in but making it clear that they were coming in under overriding conditions to prevent such a thing occurring.  In respect of the various applications which in fact have been received already, apart altogether from those which are likely to be forthcoming in the future, they are such as to make it impossible to put in any more than is there already.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice to-day that I would raise the subject matter of the following Question on the adjournment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To ask the President if he will state (1) if reports have been received by him or if he has, otherwise, reason to believe that the landing of arms on the coast of the Saorstát, or their transfer across the land frontier, has been successfully attempted or is likely to be attempted; (2) if instructions (whether of a special or general nature) regarding attempts to bring arms into the Saorstát have been given by him direct, or through the Ministers more particularly concerned, either to the Gárda or the Army; (3) if any steps have been taken to prevent arms destined for associations in this country acting without the authority of the State leaving foreign countries, or to effect their seizure before being landed here; and (4) if any requests for collaboration in the matters of prevention or seizure have been made to any other Government, or if any offer of collaboration has been made by any other Government and, if so, how such requests and offers have been received.</P>
      <P>What was put up to me as a reply was this:</P>
      <P>No information has reached me that any landing of arms on the coast of the Saorstát or any transfer of arms across the land frontier has taken place or been attempted.  In fact, the reports received by the Government are to the effect that there has been no such landing or transfer.  With regard to parts (2), (3) and (4) of the question I can only state that in view of the representations received the Government has taken all the precautions that would be warranted if those representations were well founded.</P>
      <P>I asked that Question of the President and I direct attention to the fact that it referred, not merely to something attempted, but something likely to be attempted, and the reply was that he knew of no such likely attempt. I then directed his attention to that part of the Question which referred to requests for collaboration, or if offers of collaboration had been received, and to that, I think I got no answer at all. I then asked in the second part of the Question, if instructions, regarding attempts to bring arms into the Saorstát, had been given by him, either to the Gárda or the Army. Three times I asked very much the same question&mdash;and three times, all the President could be brought to say was that all the precautions that would be warranted had been taken.  I asked precisely on that if the full force of the law was going to be brought to bear on people attempting to land arms. Again, the President was evasive, and took refuge in the phrase that all the precautions warranted have been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I put the gist of this Question in another form I want to call attention to the peculiar phrase used in the third sentence of the reply: &ldquo;With regard to parts (2), (3) and (4) of the question I can only state that in view of the representations received the <Col N="327" /> Government has taken all the precautions that would be warranted if those representations were well founded.&rdquo; If anyone can discover what that means I would like to offer a prize. &ldquo;In view of the representations,&rdquo; what were the representations?  We do not know, but we are told, &ldquo;the Government has taken all the precautions.&rdquo; Note this for straight speaking, for good English and proper appreciation of Parliamentary procedure&mdash;Parliamentary Question and Reply&mdash;&ldquo;The Government has taken all the precautions that would be warranted if these representations&rdquo; whatever they may be&mdash;&ldquo;were well founded.&rdquo;  The idea of a Parliamentary Question is to get information and the general idea of a Parliamentary reply is to give information. There has been a complete failure to appreciate either what the function of a Parliamentary Question was, or of the duty in regard to a Parliamentary reply.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to-day to public anxiety in this matter.  That was derided by the President.  There is considerable public anxiety.  It is not going to be allayed by a certain camouflaged statement given by way of reply to-day.  There is considerable activity off the coast of this country for some two or three weeks.  The statement appeared in the Press that destroyers belonging to another country had put into certain ports in this country.  There were certain statements made backed up by Deputies that a boat had, in fact, been seized and searched and there have been many rumours of success in the way of landing of arms.  There has not been a word from the Government as to whether or not there was an attempt made to prevent that, or whether an attempt was successfully brought off to bring in arms.  We know that there are arms in the country&mdash;whether they are newly imported or not I do not know&mdash;but two incidents during Congress Week showed distinctly that they are in the country, and they are in the hands of people determined to use them against the people and against private property <Col N="328" /> rights.  I have no information that any action was taken by the Government in regard to these incidents.  As far as I can see to-day there is not going to be even a clear declaration from the Government that the law will be enforced with the utmost rigour against individuals, no matter what guise of patriotism hides them, if they attempt to bring in arms without lawful authority.  When a question of this sort is raised, even if it were on the merest rumour it was founded, and that there was not the substantial backing of a Deputy, who stated that a boat had been searched for arms&mdash; and apparently searched with authority&mdash;if there is anything so definite as that a responsible Government would have welcomed the opportunity of even a rumour being brought to their notice.  It would give them the opportunity to say that, if such a thing were well founded, or if, hereafter, any such attempt were made, they would deal with it and deal with it according to the law.  If they do not like the law as it is at present, they could tell us that they are going to change the law.  If their mentality with regard to the landing of arms is not in accord with what the law is at the moment, they ought either to change their mentality or change the law.  We had no statement that the law was going to be enforced.  There was a running away from the responsibility of enforcing the law&mdash;a hiding behind the phrase: &ldquo;In view of the representations received, the Government has taken all the precautions that would be warranted if those representations were well founded.&rdquo;  Is that the answer of an honest man facing honestly up to the question put to him?  I repeat that question: is that the answer of an honest man facing honestly up to the question put to him?</P>

      <P>The honesty referred to the facing up to the question.  No wonder the President laughs at anybody <Col N="329" /> associating honesty with himself. Is that the answer of an honest man honestly facing up to a question put to him about the landing of arms, which is illegal at the moment?  There is only one statement required in answer to this question&mdash;a very simple statement.  That is, that, irrespective of whether there have been attempts or are going to be attempts, the law is going to be enforced, and that if coercion&mdash;that awful word&mdash;must be used, it is going to be applied to people who are seeking for means to coerce other people and are endeavouring to bring weapons into this country because they believe it is only by brute force they can coerce the people and not by argument.</P>

      <P>It does seem an extraordinary thing that on a rather important question, such as whether or not arms are being brought into this country without authority, there should be all this attempt to close down.  I wonder why it is.  Have Deputies some feeling that if the answer to this question is as the people of the country would like, they are turning their backs on their own tradition?  Are they a little bit afraid of some things they may have stated in their own constituencies at times?  Are they a little bit too mindful of a certain enthusiasm which they displayed with regard to certain people who may be remembering that enthusiasm at this moment and may be relying on it to prevent the law being enforced against them?  I wonder is that the reason why members of a particular party cannot have this question even discussed?  The House is entitled, since it did not get this information earlier, to the information I asked for. I asked, in the second part of the question, if instructions had been given either to the Gárda or the Army regarding attempts to bring arms into the country.  I asked, in the third part of the question, if steps had been taken to prevent arms destined for associations in this country acting without authority of the State, leaving foreign countries or to effect their seizure before being landed here.  I asked further&mdash;and this should be answered&mdash; if any requests for collaboration in the matters of prevention or seizure have been made to any other Government or if any offer of collaboration has been made by any other Government and, <Col N="332" /> if so, how such requests and offers have been received.  All those questions admit of a very simple and very precise answering.  That precise answering should be given.  Did any other Government approach this Government or was any other Government approached by this Government in this matter at all?  Were the Civic Guards instructed in this matter or were the Army instructed?  If so, what were the instructions?  If we can have those four points answered, I am satisfied.</P>

      <P>The Deputy, in the course of his remarks, said the question could have been directly and simply answered by stating whether any arms were landed or whether we had information that would lead us to believe that any arms were likely to be landed and whether the law was going to be enforced.  As a matter of fact, this morning, either in the direct answer or in the supplementaries, particularly in the supplementaries, these two questions were definitely answered, almost in the very words that the Deputy suggests now would be a complete answer.  I said that in our view no arms were landed and our belief is that no arms were landed.  We had no information that would lead us to believe that any arms were likely to be landed and, as far as enforcing the law was concerned, we said we would enforce the law.  The Deputy revealed the real purpose in his own mind in asking this question in the remark he made a few minutes ago; apparently the Deputy is not happy because the Government can carry on here in these benches without exciting the people by bogus rumours.  We have not got to raise up any Communistic cry.  We have not to raise up any threats or suggestions that arms are coming into the country; in order to have peace in the country we do not want or require Public Safety Acts.  Apparently what is troubling the Deputy is that we have peace in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The coal boat was searched.  It was searched by the Gárda in the carrying out of their duty <Col N="333" /> and if there is any conclusion to be drawn from the searching of the coal boat it is that the Gárda were vigilant and that the law was to be enforced if there was any need for enforcing the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer was made to the question that precautions were taken that would be warranted if the representations made were well founded.  What does that mean? There is no difficulty for anybody who wants to understand its meaning understanding it.  Representations were made to the Government and we acted as if we believed these representations. We acted as if we were certain that all these representations were well founded and every precaution that should have been taken on that assumption was taken. I do not mean to say that we ourselves believed the rumours or the representations or scares were well founded, but we felt that no risks of any kind should be taken and we did not take any. <Col N="334" /> Every precaution that should be taken by the Government under such circumstances was taken.</P>
      <P>We have been asked what reports were received about this.  I do not want even the distance that I went to-day to be a precedent.  I am going to inform the Deputy that I will not answer any question in future about confidential reports that we get from the Gárda in the carrying out of their duties, or confidential reports about other business of the State.  I have the responsibility to see that confidential reports will be kept confidential, and we intend to maintain that confidence. The only redress that members or Deputies of the House have against our refusal to give away matters of confidence is to get a new Government.</P>
