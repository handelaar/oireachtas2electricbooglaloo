      <P>asked the President what steps, if any, he proposes to take in regard to candidates duly returned to serve as members of Dáil Eireann who sit and vote as such without having first taken, as stated by him to Dáil Eireann, the Oath provided for by Article 4 of the Treaty and Article 17 of the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JasperTraversWolfe" hpid="Mr. Wolfe Mr. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President if, in view of his statement to Dáil Eireann that he and 70 other candidates returned to serve as members of Dáil Eireann and now acting as such have not as yet taken the Oath provided for by Article 4 of the Treaty and Article 17 of the Constitution, it is now intended to withdraw the Constitution (Removal of Oath) Bill, 1932, as that measure would now appear to have been negatived on the Second Reading by a large majority of the members of Dáil Eireann qualified to vote thereon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President whether, in view of the uncertainty at present prevailing amongst the land annuitants, who have been promised full derating of agricultural land, he can now state when he will be in a position to make a declaration as to the present policy of the Government on this matter, and whether he will undertake to speed the negotiations and correspondence now proceeding between his Government and the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy means to suggest that there is any uncertainty with regard to the tenant purchasers' liability to pay their annuities, the suggestion is entirely unwarranted. The tenant purchasers' liability is not an issue in the correspondence with the British Government.  On the question of the ultimate disposal of the annuities, I can only refer the Deputy to my previous reply to him on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask if the President can give any estimate of the date on which he will be able to state that the declaration made to the electors and the undertaking on which he and his Party have been returned to power, <Col N="1447" /> namely, the derating of agricultural land at the expense of the land annuities, was all bluff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Informal discussions took place during the year 1931 between officials of the Department of External Affairs and officials of the Dominion Office in London, with a view to arriving at an interim arrangement for the administration of the waters of Lough Foyle pending a settlement of the dispute as to the right to the several fishery.  It was hoped than an interim arrangement pending settlement could be arrived at without prejudice to the general question of jurisdiction over the waters of the Lough, but the hope has so far not been justified.  Since the present Government came into office, it has not been possible to deal with this matter, but I am arranging to have the whole situation re-examined by the law officers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, licences have been issued in all cases. It would appear that the difficulty arose from something other than the issue of licences.  Those who have carts and who cross the Border are compelled to go by approved roads to certain central stations, clearing stations.  It is really on that account that the difficulty arose.  Representations have been made by the Minister for Agriculture to the Revenue Commissioners in order to see whether that difficulty could be obviated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Ruttledge) Patrick J. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>When dealing with this Estimate on the last occasion I think we reached as far as sub-head I, which deals with improvements.  Under that sub-head there is a reduction of £20,200 from last year.  I am informed that after examination by the Land Commission they considered that the sum of £191,050 represents the amount which was considered necessary by them to be expended in the present year.  It represents what they consider at the moment could be usefully expended.  During previous years there have been savings under that sub-head. Last year the saving was £50,000 and in the previous year something like £26,000.  The reasons for that saving, I understand, are that a good many of the energies of the Land Commission had to be directed towards carrying out the relief works that resulted from the relief Votes passed in this House. Improvement works stand in a somewhat different category from relief works.  Improvement works are closely related to the taking over and improvement of estates.  They have to be examined in connection with those estates, whereas relief works can be considered and examined on their merits as matters apart altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be necessary, before the end of the present financial year when these matters have been more fully examined, to come to the House and ask for a supplementary Vote, but at the moment the amount that is asked here represents what the Land Commission are of opinion can be usefully applied.  In addition to sub-heads O, P and Q, which are really a continuation of similar sub-heads in the Estimate for last year, there is a new sub-head introduced for the first time this year.  This new sub-head is to provide for possible payments under Section 34 of the Land Act, 1931, in respect of claims out of purchase moneys notwithstanding certain defects in title. <Col N="1457" /> It is not anticipated that there may be any such claims&mdash;practically very few at any rate&mdash;arising, and this can be regarded somewhat as a token Vote.  With regard to the Appropriations in Aid, these are substantially the same as last year with the important exception of excess annuities under which provision is suggested for an increase of £15,000, due mainly to the setting up of provisional annuities payable by tenants on Congested Districts Board estates under Section 23 of the Land Act, 1931, and the corresponding increase in the &ldquo;Excess Annuities&rdquo; due to improvements to holdings effected by the Land Commission.  On the other hand, there is a decrease of £3,450 in the collection costs for payment in lieu of rent, which has been practically wiped out by the operation of Section 9 of the Land Act, 1931.</P>
    <P>As regards the general work of the Land Commission, if we take it up to the end of the past financial year, the altered position, by comparison with twelve months ago, is, briefly, that practically the whole of the tenanted land coming under the Land Acts 1923-1931 has been vested in the Land Commission, the exceptions being a few cases in which the full particulars have not yet been ascertained and the applications of fee farm grantees and lessees under Section 44 of the Land Act, 1931, where there will have to be some further investigation.  That represents a tenanted area of 2,896,000 acres comprising 97,000 holdings and representing a total purchase price of approximately £19,750,000 is now vested in the Land Commission under the Land Acts, 1923-31.  Of this area, only some 560,000 acres have been also re-vested in fee simple subject to Annuity payments in 16,300 tenant-purchasers. That will give an indication to the House of the enormous amount of work that yet remains to be done to complete re-vesting in the tenants.</P>
    <P>The same applies to holdings on Congested Districts Board estates. Under Section 23 of the Land Act, 1931, 19,400 of these holdings comprising some 650,000 acres and representing <Col N="1458" /> a total re-sale price of about £2,140,000 have been listed during the past year so as to put the tenants on a purchase annuity basis, but their re-vesting in fee simple in the tenant purchasers remains to be completed, along with some further particularly difficult cases which have not yet been listed.  The re-sale of the congested districts holdings now remaining is a very complicated problem on account of the existence of a large proportion of uneconomic landholders, rundale tenures, and so on which will necessitate a rearrangement of holdings.</P>
    <P>As regards untenanted land, the Land Commission have acquired under the Land Acts, 1923-31, a total area of 405,000 acres and offers have been made or the lands gazetted for acquisition in respect of a further area of 122,000 acres, while an additional area of some 670,000 acres is in various stages of investigation with a view to its suitability for acquisition.  Of the lands actually acquired, over 330,000 acres have been already divided amongst 16,550 allottees.  This is apart from 160,000 acres of untenanted land divided by the Land Commission on the Congested Districts Board's and Estates Commissioners' estates since 1923. The total amount expended by the Land Commission since 1923 on the benefit and improvement of estates under all the Land Acts is approximately £1,705,000, and the total relief work expenditure by the Land Commission since the inception of such works in 1924 is about £500,000. Of this latter figure, approximately £43,000 was in respect of the Relief Act of last year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the collection of the annuities, while we cannot state that the position is eminently satisfactory there is no reason whatever to take any heed or notice of the alarmist statements that have been circulated through the country in various ways. I am satisfied that the tenant purchasers and the tenant farmers are making a genuine effort to pay the land annuities, and that any hesitancy or any difficulty that has arisen is due entirely to the depressed conditions in <Col N="1459" /> agriculture throughout the country.  If we compare the position, say, at 31st March with the position at 31st January of the present year we find that it is no worse: that the position on 31st March is equally as good as it was on 31st January.  The annuities are coming in satisfactorily, and so far, despite statements to the contrary, there has been no necessity to resort to any extra pressure to collect the annuities. There are numerous applications before the Land Commission from time to time, and particularly within the last few months from tenant-farmers asking for time and indicating reasonable efforts on their part to pay the land annuities.</P>
    <P>Deputies might expect that I should state something with regard to the policy of the Land Commission.  I do not propose at this stage to say more than this: that it will be the aim of the Land Commission to co-operate with the Government fully and enthusiastically in what is the declared policy of the Government&mdash;to provide an opening and a living for every man of character and conduct who is willing and able to work.  It will be the aim of the Land Commission not only to divide land but to divide it in such a way that it will enable the people put on the land to derive an economic livelihood from it.  Every effort will be made to speed up the acquisition and distribution of land.  I believe that much, if not all, can be accomplished on the administrative side, but should any difficulties arise requiring legislation, then I will come to the House and ask it to pass that legislation to enable a more speedy and satisfactory acquisition and division of land to take place.  I do not propose to say more at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement is not a very comprehensive one, and I think that for the information of the House, he should have dealt with the sub-heads in much more detail.  I do not propose to deal with the sub-heads, nor do I propose to criticise any one individual item in the Estimates.  I cannot do that for very obvious reasons.  I only want <Col N="1460" /> to make a brief reference to the net increase in the Estimate this year, an increase which according to the Estimate amounts to £9,000.  I think that increase is very small, when you consider the enormous amount of work the Land Commission had to do under the Land Act, 1931, last year. When Deputies remember that 70,000 holdings under the Land Act of 1931 were vested in the course of one year, and 20,000 tenants on Congested Districts Board estates were placed on an annuity basis, they will realise the enormous amount of additional work that was thrown on the staff of the Land Commission.  I think that not alone Deputies in this House, but tenants generally throughout the country, owe a debt of gratitude to the Land Commission staff, and particularly to those members of the Land Commission staff who were actually engaged in the work of preparing the vesting lists.  It was a remarkable achievement, accomplished in a remarkably short space of time.</P>
      <P>I thought the Minister would have referred to certain very important aspects of Land Commission activity. There is one aspect of Land Commission activity that the Minister himself is particularly interested in&mdash; at least, his constituents are particularly interested in this aspect of the work, the reclamation work.  I was anxious to hear something from the Minister in connection with that work, because I know that different opinions prevail, not only in the Land Commission itself, but outside the Land Commission, with regard to the usefulness of this particular work.  A considerable area of land has been reclaimed during the last three years in Gaeltacht districts in the West, South and North, and I know that a certain view prevails, to the effect that reclamation work is rather expensive, and that the official view is that the State should get value for every penny of money spent by Government Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not take the rigid official view on a very important matter of this kind, but that he will, when he comes to examine <Col N="1461" /> this problem of reclamation, look at it purely and simply from the standpoint of the needs of the people of this country, and particularly from the standpoint of the needs of the people in the Gaeltacht areas in the South, West and North.  In his own County of Mayo a very important experiment was carried out some years ago, an experiment which, I think the Minister himself will agree, has been successful in every detail, and I hope he will see to it that that experiment is continued, not alone in his own county, but in the other Gaeltacht counties as well, and even in certain other counties outside the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>I stress that matter of reclamation work for many reasons, but for one reason in particular.  I stated myself on more than one occasion during discussions on the Land Commission Estimates that the area of land available for the relief of congestion in this country is very limited, and that even assuming that all the available land in the country has been acquired by the Land Commission, it would not be possible to provide for more than approximately forty per cent. of the congests, and consequently, every opportunity should be availed of for the purpose of rendering more land arable, in order that it will be possible for the Land Commission to provide for a larger percentage of congests.</P>
    <P>I thought also that, on an occasion such as this, the Minister would have availed of the opportunity of stating what the policy of his Department was with regard to land acquisition and land distribution.  In previous years, when I introduced similar Estimates, I was twitted by every Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party, who were then on the Opposition Benches, about the delay in acquiring and distributing land, and I thought that I would have heard from the Minister to-day how he proposed to speed up the acquisition and distribution of land.  That is a matter in which the people of the country are very much interested, and in which the people of his own constituency are particularly interested.  I think, on the whole, that during the time I <Col N="1462" /> was associated with Land Commission administration I received more complaints from people in the Minister's own constituency than from people in any of the other twenty-six counties, and I am quite sure that the number of complaints has not lessened since the Minister assumed the responsibilities of office.</P>
    <P>With regard to the payment of Land Commission annuities, I thought that the Minister would have given us some figures showing the latest arrears of unpaid annuities.  An impression certainly does prevail very generally throughout the country, that there has been a considerable falling off, during recent months, in the payment of Land Commission annuities.  It is quite true, as the Minister said, that one of the causes, and probably the primary cause, for the falling off is the depression prevailing in the country at the moment, but I am not so sure that a contributory cause has not been the newspaper propaganda carried on for the last two or three years.  Quite a number of farmers were under the impression, that, when a Fianna Fáil Government was returned to power, they would not have to pay land annuities at all, and I think, as a matter of fact, that some members of the present Fianna Fáil Party, when carrying out their canvass in different constituencies, gave people to understand that when they were in office, and in control of the Government of this country, they would not have to pay any Land Commission annuities at all. I think the Minister will find that that is another contributory cause to the falling off in the payment of these annuities.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to Sections 42 and 44 of the Land Act of 1931, and I am anxious to find out from him the number of cases actually dealt with up to the present under Section 42 of the Act, and I would be glad if he would see that the operations under Section 44 are speeded up.  A number of small farmers, fee-farm grantees, particularly in the West of Ireland, have been harassed, during recent months, with demands for payment of the arrears of their rents, and, in fact, in some cases, they have actually been taken into the <Col N="1463" /> Courts, and decrees obtained against them.  For these reasons, and in order to relieve these people of the dread of Court proceedings, I would ask him to speed up operations under the section relating to fee-farm grantees.  The work, after all, cannot be very heavy. There are not so very many of these fee-farm grantees in the country, and I imagine that it ought to be possible to deal with them in a very short space of time.  I hope the Minister will indicate in his reply if he proposes to follow the policy hitherto followed by the Land Commission with regard to reclamation.  As he has refrained from stating what his own particular land policy is, and what the policy of his Party is, I have assumed that he has already satisfied himself that the policy hitherto followed by the Land Commission is the right policy, and the only sound policy for the people of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPatrickKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the announcement made by the Minister that he will facilitate the speeding up of the acquisition and division of land.  In Co. Meath, the constituency I have the honour to represent, there is scarcely a parish but has its quota of ranches, which give a minimum of labour with no expenditure on improvements such as buildings, manuring and draining. We may be told that a county is rich because of its profusion of grass, but this merely gives us a wealth which cannot be diffused at present amongst our people.  In fact, a large percentage of our poverty can be attributed to this cause.  It may be argued that the ranching system is a necessary adjunct to the production of beef.  That may be so, but the division of a larger holding into small holdings will not diminish its beef-producing capacity. It will certainly maintain it at its present level, if it does not actually increase it.  Grass beef is a summer months' product.  We have no beef coming off the ranches during winter time, when the price of that commodity reaches its highest figure, whereas from the smaller holdings we have a continuous supply of grass beef in summer time and a considerable <Col N="1464" /> output of stall-fed beef in winter time Therefore, if we require an all-year-round supply of beef we must necessarily give preference to the small holdings.  Incidentally, we would be giving greater employment.  In any scheme that may be introduced for the amelioration of the unemployed the division of land will co-operate.  The ranching system being antagonistic to productivity is an enemy to employment. We require farms of sufficient size to guarantee that the occupier, with ordinary competent management, will be able to maintain himself in circumstannces devoid of financial worry. I have seen instances where land has been divided and the workingmen were not only refused a holding, but they were compelled to turn their cow off the ranch on to the roadside to graze.  The tradition in the workers' families for hard work and integrity was not considered sufficient qualification for the working man to be trusted with a plot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to point out to the Minister that where farms have already been divided the occupiers complain of the impossibility of supplying the necessaries of life when their annuity has been paid.  When these farms were purchased by the Land Commission an exorbitant price was given to the landlord and, consequently, the Commission was forced by its own extravagant purchase to saddle on the shoulders of the incoming tenant an annuity which he was unable to meet.  He was overtaxed, the land was overtaxed, an altogether undesirable state of affairs. He took over the holding with a poverty of equipment and, in the absence of initial help, he was altogether unable for the task.  The Minister may not have had time to familiarise himself with the inner workings of the Land Commission, but I am satisfied that the system he has inherited can be improved upon.  As an administrative machine it is expensive and cumbersome; it is unsympathetic to a degree, and has proved itself altogether incompetent to satisfy local needs.  I hope that the Minister will not only introduce fundamental changes in policy, but that he <Col N="1465" /> will deem it advisable to introduce revolutionary changes in the system and method of administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear the last speaker refer to the value of the small holder in this country.  I can see that he appreciated the enormous potential wealth that lies in the labour not alone of a small farmer, but his family, and what an enormous increase to the wealth of this country would be brought about by an increase in the division of large holdings.  Not alone are there these large holdings, but there is a large number of derelict farms which, perhaps, if the influence of public representatives were brought to bear, might be usefully divided amongst small holders in the- neighbourhood. That is a point to which I would direct the Minister's attention. That state of affairs exists very largely, I am sorry to say, in the constituency that I have the honour to represent. It is, above all things, a big national loss to the people of this country, having regard to the value of agriculture as the source of our national wealth.  I would specially urge the Minister to take into consideration the delay, and the loss caused by the delay, in the final passing of these divisions by the Commissioners.  Often two and three years elapse between the first inspection, the report that it is fit for division, the negotiations which must ensue on the value, the allocation to the allottees and finally the passing by the Commissioners of the particular persons to whom the lands have been allotted.  I have in mind one particular farm at Ballymacoda the division of which has taken that length of time to carry through, and which has created a good deal of dissatisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another side of the matter to which I would also like to draw attention, and that is the loss and the anomaly caused by coast erosion on some farms which are being sold.  If a fair rent has been fixed on certain lands the purchase price is assessed on that fair rent.  Although that farm may be washed away before half the purchase period has expired, still the full amount is paid to the landlord and the Land Commission appear to be <Col N="1466" /> powerless to make any change.  That is a point I should like the Minister to investigate and see if there is not some means of altering the law in connection with it.  If it is not a judicial holding, then the Land Commission, I understand, can interfere, but if a judicial rent has been fixed, then the purchase money must be based on the fair rent, irrespective of whether the holding is going to be in existence at the end of the 67 years or not.  There is no question but that lands have been purchased at an extravagant price.  I would direct the Minister's attention to Section 1 of the Act of 1919 under which lands had been bought at peak prices and distributed at absolutely uneconomic rents to holders who are now utterly unable to pay the annuities fixed upon them. The result is that half these farms are really derelict, or else have passed out of the hands of the original occupiers into the hands of people who, perhaps, are just as badly off as the original holders.</P>
    <P>I must pay a tribute to the Land Commission for the good sense with which they have treated the question of arrears.  While these arrears are a big loss, there is no question about it that any undue and precipitate action on the part of the Land Commission in distraining for them will result in their being utterly unable to recover any further moneys from the occupiers. Therefore, I think, pending some arrangement with regard to these arrears, the Land Commission must be sympathised with and commended on the good sense with which they are dealing with that particular side of the question.  I can pay a tribute to the courtesy they have shown at all times in any attempt to try and help people who are in arrears.  It is uphill work, and I do not agree with the last speaker that the machinery is wrong. Considering the difficulties in the way, I think the Land Commission have done very good work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Land Acts as administered at present are a farce.  In the Swords district of North Dublin exorbitant prices have been given to the landlords.  The landlords could not have got half the price if <Col N="1467" /> the land were put up for public auction. The lands have been given to unfortunate people who are not able to stock them or do anything else with them, and the result is that landlords, who, some three years ago, got these exorbitant prices, have the lands back now on the eleven months system. I wonder is the Minister aware of that?  Outside Swords, only ten miles from here, there was a holding given to ex-Service men, and the farmers around have all this land at present on the eleven months system. The men who got it were not able to pay for it.</P>

I could name these big landlords who got exorbitant prices for the land three years ago and who now have it back on the eleven months system, and have it stocked with their own cattle.  If that is the way the land is going to be divided amongst the working-classes, I hold that the Acts, as at present administered, are only a farce.</P>

      <P>I would like to direct the attention of the Minister to the share of re-afforestation work that has been allotted to the County Donegal. I think he will find out, if he looks into that question, that every other county in which re-afforestation has been deemed to be practicable has had a very much better show than Donegal.  I think if he asks the representatives of Donegal in his own Party they will tell him that the people of Donegal feel that they are being neglected and are not getting their fair share of the work which has been specially designed for the relief of the <Col N="1468" /> Gaeltacht, of the remunerative work, which is in no sense relief work, but work that will pay for itself in its own good time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, with your assistance. Another question that I would like to refer to&mdash;and here I believe I shall not be arrested in my course because it is a matter that apparently no one seems to be responsible for&mdash; and that is the old drainage boards all over the country.  They are largely founded on the Act of 1846.  I want to suggest this: that if, as at present, they seem to be under the benignant surveillance of the Board of Works, the Board of Works have no authority over them.  They can make suggestions and encourage them; they can do everything but the one thing they ought to do, and that is to see that these boards are doing the work, for which they collect rates.  I suggest to the Minister that he should look into this question of the old drainage boards set up under the Act of 1846 and find out if powers could not be taken to control their operations and to supervise their activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other problem that I think unquestionably comes within the Minister's province, and it has already been referred to, and that is <Col N="1469" /> the matter of large farms.  Large farmers have gradually got into the habit of letting conacre.  They do not come under the heading of estates. They have never been dealt with under the Land Acts up to the present. I think the Minister might, with great advantage to the country, investigate the question of whether he could not acquire large holdings of land that admittedly for years have been let out in conacre to labourers and cottiers in the district, and to see if he could not take steps to acquire these farms for the Land Commission and sell them to the people who are actually working them and have been working them for years.</P>
    <P>I think if he looks into conditions in Donegal he will find, in East Donegal particularly, that that system very largely prevails.  I would be glad if the Minister would examine that question and find out if steps could not be taken to acquire these lands and distribute them amongst the people who are actually working them at the present time.  I do not suggest that such land as I refer to now should be acquired under the compulsory purchase clauses of the Land Act, because I do not think that the compulsory clauses of the Land Act should be invoked to deal with them.  But I do suggest that gentle, persuasive methods such as are employed by the Board of Works and different other Departments should be employed by the Minister so that the people who really work this land should become the owners of the land by which they live.</P>

      <P>I wish to join with Deputy Roddy in his tribute to the work of the Land Commission in carrying into effect the provisions of the Land Act of 1931.  This Department has been described by Deputy Kelly as somewhat of an anomaly.  I notice he finished his speech without in any manner contradicting what Deputy Roddy said.  Hence, we can now take it that Deputy Kelly accepted Deputy Roddy's tribute to the Department. What I want immediately to bring before the Minister is this: It is said that, under the conditions existing <Col N="1470" /> in the agricultural community, the land annuities are coming in fairly satisfactorily.  That may be so.  I have not the figures before me; the Minister has.  But if I am not greatly mistaken there is a very considerable amount of arrears due, and much more than the average in recent months. However, I am not particularly concerned with regard to the figures themselves, but what I submit to the Minister is this: If, as he admits, the delay in payment is due to the conditions existing in the agricultural community, and if, as has been indicated through the Press, instructions are being sent out to the State solicitors to take immediate proceedings for the recovery of these annuities, I suggest the Department should employ some other machinery than legal proceedings, which adds additional heavy cost to the annuities which the tenants are already unable to pay.  If they are actually unable to pay the annuity it would be an unbearable burden to add costs that would be, perhaps, three or four times the amount of the annuity.  If that system is persisted in under present conditions, it would make the position of these people intolerable, and there would be nothing left but to eject them.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether he will be in a position to take steps to have the rents of tenants on the old Congested Districts Board and Land Commission estates reduced.  I presume that will depend on whether the land annuities will or will not be retained.  A very serious situation has arisen in the county I represent, as great numbers of the people are unable to pay the annuities.  Their valuations are also very high.  These people are in a deplorable state, and I would be glad if the Minister could say if he can make any attempt to reduce the annuities or to extend the period of payment during the coming year.</P>

      <P>I have not much to say on this Estimate, as this question has been worn threadbare.  Deputy Roddy regretted that we were not going <Col N="1471" /> fast enough.  That is very strange. Up to a month ago I was afraid we were going too fast.  I actually advocated slowing up.  I do not know whether it was an inheritance, or that things did not seem to be going as we would like to see them going, but I thought there might be reconsideration. For instance, I found I was up against most extraordinary problems. I found a migrant with 370 acres of land, while within three miles the people were in an absolutely hopeless plight.  I do not know why they were left so, as on many occasions I attempted to have matters rectified, but I was always turned down.  There is a place outside Navan known as The Commons, in which 59 families exist. There are about 170 acres there, or barely three acres for each family. These people have to walk to Navan, a distance of two and a half or three miles, to obtain milk.  On the other hand, we find a migrant with 350 or 360 acres of land in the same district. I do not know if we are going to become benefactors in Meath.  At any rate, we do not intend to continue to be any longer.  My attitude is that we must make an attempt to look after the people of the district, as we have a considerable amount of congestion in County Meath.  I did not see anything like it in the Gaeltacht or in Galway, and no attempt was made to relieve it.  I think we ought to attempt to deal with that situation before we continue these migratory schemes as intensely as they have been carried out up to the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the names and the acreage in the cases I mentioned where the people are living under congested conditions. I do not think one of these people objects to migrants coming to County Meath, because they know that the Dáil, when passing this legislation, intended to relieve congestion in the West.  We have not the slightest objection to that, but we object to being exploited to a degree that arouses suspicions.  I am sure the Minister will take a note of the fact, and see that these schemes are attempted in such a way that the migrants will not find themselves in <Col N="1472" /> enmity with the people of the district. That can be done if a little diplomacy is used.  One of the reasons why I thought we should go slow is that I think the land should be divided at certain times of the year.  There are periods when it is financially suitable, and seasons when it is unsuitable to do so.  A number of properties were divided within the last few months, and, as the tenants are liable for rent from the 1st January, that will mean that they will practically be paying in advance all their lives.  In fences that are put up at certain times the quicks do not grow.  The fences fall into the gripes after a few nights' frost, entailing considerable extra expense and trouble.  For that reason I believe that some sort of close season should be arranged.  I believe that good work could be done by the Land Commission during the summer months in revising land, and that a considerable amount could be ready for division from October to February.  If the farmers got the land in November or December, they could make preparations to meet whatever charges would arise in the way of annuities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roddy was quite right to have his little jibe on the annuity question. I know that he does not mean half what he says.  I got information that in fairs and markets recently people were heard to remark, &ldquo;Jack, you are a fool to pay the land annuities. Do not bother doing so.&rdquo;  The individuals who made the remarks had already paid.  There is a good deal of that going on, and it should not be allowed.  I believe it is right to invoke the law and to take notice when statements of that kind are made.  I do not know much about the law, but I know that when a tenant gets down and out the Land Commission issues a writ and the rate collector immediately issues a writ.  The result is that people will not visit these places, fearing that the rate collectors would seize their traps or cars.  The unfortunate tenants next find that they cannot set their land, so that their affairs are brought to a standstill.  I wonder could the Minister develop some other method of getting over that difficulty.</P>
    <P>I know a number of farms that are <Col N="1473" /> high and dry owing to these circumstances. They cannot set the land. The auctioneers will not take them on and the families are starving.  I know one case where a family had to get home assistance.  I think we could manage to collect the rents and the rates in a different way and avoid putting a farmer out of action.  I do not think that is a good way.  I think we ought to devise some other method, as it is pitiable to see people who tried to work but who found that owing to a certain financial system and high organisations, not alone here but all over the world, they are down and out.  It is not their fault.  It is unfair that we should have laws that put them further down and prevent them from communicating with the people in the outside world.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the congested districts of County Meath.  If he pays attention to these districts and relieves the congestion that exists in them he will find that there will be no difficulty as regards the migratory system.  As long as the uneconomic holders and others are left to hang on and to look at the migrant visiting a big farm, which he sets in meadow at an auction which the uneconomic holders attend, there will be dissatisfaction.  They have to pay for this meadow £5 an acre.  I got a complaint from Gormanstown area that a migrant from Donegal was unable to carry on and that he set his land and was working under the Land Commission as a ganger.  Another man who came from Donegal was actually working on the farm building ditches, having set his land.  I think we have enough unemployment in Meath without adding to it.  Because I say these things it does not follow that I or the people of County Meath are opposed to the migratory system.</P>

      <P>The statement made by the Minister that the ranches are to be divided will be welcome news to the uneconomic holders and landless men of Tipperary, which constituency I have the honour to represent. No county has suffered more in the past through clearances than Tipperary. No county is more ranch ridden than is Tipperary.  Cromwell's edict to our forefathers was &ldquo;To hell or Connacht.&rdquo;  As he gazed over the Golden Vale of my county, he said, &ldquo;This is a land worth fighting for.&rdquo; To-day, the descendants of these Cromwellian planters hold broad acres in that county, with the result that until emigration was shut off recently there was nothing for our people but the emigrant ship.</P>
      <P>I should like to take issue with the Minister as regards the statement that the annuities are being paid as regularly as they were in the past.  In my district, that is not so.  I agree that, to some extent, that is due to the bad economic conditions.  Agriculture is almost down and out.  That is due, to a large extent, to the fact that too much money was put into the pockets of the landlords, not only for the ranches, but for the ordinary tenanted land.  If some remedial legislation is not introduced, I am afraid you will see a great part of the county I represent cleared out again. Evictions will have to take place, because the people will be unable to pay unless the price of every class of agricultural produce goes up.  The district I come from is paying roughly £3 per Irish acre in rent and rates. The farmers cannot continue to pay that sum although they are working their farms on a most up-to-date system. Civil bills have gone out all over the district I represent to a far greater extent during the past month or six weeks than they ever went out before.  In my own locality two Civil Bill officers who heretofore could not afford any other mode of conveyance than an ass and cart are now driving practically every day in motor cars, the processes being so numerous.  I am aware of that myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1475" /> A number of tenants who have been served with processes have told me that they have not got the usual six days' notice.  A large number of the processes shown to me were for only a moiety of the annuity.  I can bear evidence to that fact.  I had one Civil Bill in my possession last Sunday in which the amount demanded was £10 13s. 3d. for the December moiety of the annuity.  On that Civil Bill, just after the process server had done his duty and before it entered the Court, there was a sum of £1 10s. 0d. marked as costs.  What will the cost be to that poor man when it is so large before the case comes to the ordinary processes of the Court?  The costs will be probably £3 or £4 more when it does come to Court.  I do not know what the cause of these heavy costs is.  Probably it is due to the Circuit Court rules giving power to the State Solicitors to treble their former charges.  Formerly, the costs of such a Civil Bill would not be more than 10s.  I would ask the Minister to consider that matter carefully and not to let the State Solicitors all over the country have a free hand with regard to costs.  I think the only hope for the country if the Government is not able to withhold the annuities from England is to get a Bill passed extending the period of repayment from 68½ years to 100 years or 120 years.  There is no reason why future generations should not pay portion of the high rents which farmers are now obliged to meet and which they are utterly unable to meet.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reference to improvement works and relief works, I think this question has not in the past been fairly or justly gone into.  In substantiation of my statement, I have had the figures from 1st April, 1924, to 31st March, 1931, taken out and I find that out of a total of £1,160,984 expended on the improvement of estates in that period £75,178 was spent in Kerry and £276,656 in Galway.  During the same period the total Land Commission expenditure on relief works was £501,000 approximately <Col N="1476" /> of which Kerry received £43,000 and Galway £64,000.  I would suggest to our new Minister to have a just distribution and a fair basis as regards the allocation of grants for relief works and improvement works and that there should be a clear departure from the procedure carried on by the late Government in so far as the allocation of grants is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that a fair basis would be the number of unemployed and the poor law valuation in each county.  I am speaking generally, not alone for Kerry but for every other county.  I am speaking more or less on principle.  As regards derelict farms, the system in vogue at the moment has, to a great extent, led up to their condition.  For instance, the sheriff of each county has to carry out a certain legal procedure which is in total conflict with the actions and resolutions which local bodies have tried to carry out to relieve the people.  In explanation of that, I would like to point out that Kerry Co. Council had under consideration a system as a result of which they suggested to the Land Commission authorities that they could relieve the pressure by adopting the principle of allowing tenant farmers to carry on, and that they ought not to carry out the letter of the law in each case.  We approached the sheriff in Kerry and ascertained that under the legal procedure as outlined to us, he could not accept payments unless the full amount of the debt had been tendered. The result was that the unfortunate farmers were not even able to let their land in grazing, the land was left derelict and the farmers were forced to carry on under terrible conditions. I therefore thoroughly agree with the last speaker and other Deputies who have referred to the question, that there should be some new system of alleviating the conditions that prevail in connection with derelict farms, having regard to the total inability of the people to meet the requirements. <Col N="1477" /> I agree also with the suggestion of extending the period of payment.  In fact, I would specially ask the Minister to try to revise the system so that the sheriff in each county could accept moneys from the farmers concerned irrespective of the amount of arrears due.  To make my point clear, I would point out that if a farmer owed, say, £50, which at the moment he was unable to meet, and if a grazier came along offering a certain amount, the sheriff should not be compelled to turn that grazier away because the amount tendered for grazing was not sufficient to pay the full amount of the arrears due.  I would respectfully ask the Minister to change the system in such a way that the farmers could carry on and make an honest effort to meet their requirements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKiersey" hpid="Mr. Kiersey Mr. Kiersey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiersey</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to make a few remarks in regard to what Deputy O'Reilly and the last speaker mentioned. From what I heard during the debate in regard to the collection of rates and annuities on derelict farms, the trouble complained of appears to be general throughout the country.  I know that in County Waterford we have derelict farms on which a four-footed beast has not been for some years.  The rate collector cannot allow the farms to be let or cannot let the farms for grazing or come to an agreement with the tenant farmer to take grazing stock on the land because if he did the Land Commission would come in the next day and seize the cattle put on the land.  As the law stands at present the rate collector or the tenant, simply because he is not able to pay his rent, cannot take in any grazing stock or make any use of the land.  I think that matter should be considered by the Land Commission.  Perhaps one of the officials of the Land Commission might act as agent and set the grazing of these lands.  That along with not demanding a full hundred per cent. payment from the tenant where a number of years' rent or rates was due would result in getting some money from them, probably most of the money, and there might be a little left to spare for the tenants.  We have been considering it from every point of <Col N="1478" /> view, considering all the aspects of the case in County Waterford, simply, because of the loss which it means to the rates.  Certain deductions have been made from our grants because of the amount due to the Land Commission, and we are not getting the rates due on these lands either.  I support other Deputies who have spoken on this matter in the suggestion that an arrangement should be made under which this state of affairs need not continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>If there be one matter more than another which has given me great concern it is the method of collection adopted by the State solicitors.  I would suggest that that could be rectified by collecting the amounts directly through the officers of the Land Commission.  It has been my experience to see decree after decree issued against those whom I might call the weakest members of our population at the present time.  I have seen decrees with costs altogether exceeding the amount of the annuities due and, in the event of seizure by the sheriff, I have seen and ascertained that the sheriff's men have actually left the premises on receiving payment of their expenses.  That has been repeated week after week, and simply amounts in some cases to a farce.  The men will call, receive their expenses for the day and go away satisfied.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that some system should be devised for the purpose of collecting those annuities in the same manner as amounts due have been collected by rate collectors and also by income tax collectors, and that an order should be issued by the Land Commission under which these debts could be collected without any proceedings either in the Circuit Courts or the District Courts, as the case may be.  I would suggest to the Minister the necessity of farming a scheme for that purpose.  By doing so he would save a huge amount of money for those weak members of the community.</P>

      <P>I support the statements that have been made by Deputies from other parts of the House in reference to the intent and keen desire <Col N="1479" /> to collect annuities that apparently has been the policy, and is the policy now.  There is a constituency in which Deputy Davin should be in terested, Leix, and I am informed on reliable authority that over 600 processes have been served quite recently in that county and that over 400 more have been got out since.  That state of affairs is certainly one in which the Minister should take a personal interest, because there seems to be a mass production of processes for service on unfortunate people who are not able, however willing they may be, to face the present conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening to the last speakers dealing with the question of collection of annuities, but I am afraid that they have not gone into the basic question of the responsibility for the breakdown of these derelict farms.  There is no use in talking about the collection of rents at the present time in this country, because people are not in a position to pay, and I think, instead of going into figures or cheese-paring about the question, it should be suggested, as I respectfully suggest to the Minister, that he should bring about a scheme by which all arrears would be cleared off, that they would be paid ultimately, but that the payment should extend over a number of years, because as a good portion of the land of Ireland stands at present it is useless to the country.  I think it is a shame to see so much arable land going derelict when some definite move could be made to convert it to some use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So I think that in fairness to those people who have been paying their way up till now, it would be incumbent on the Ministry to pass legislation by which some solution of the question would be arrived at, because, after all, it is not fair to ask those people who have been paying their way until now to take the burden on their shoulders any longer.  When people are not able to pay their land annuities the burden is thrown on the ratepayers and they have to pay interest on the money that they have to borrow.  So I think the sooner these owners of derelict farms <Col N="1480" /> are put on their feet the better for the whole community in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. Lynch Mr. F. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Roddy, I do not intend to deal with the various items on the Estimate which were, of course, prepared before the Minister took up office.  There are just a few matters that I should like to refer to, however.  I think it was Deputy Kelly who gave out a great tirade against ranches.  Of course, there are ranches and ranches, and I think that this campaign against ranches can go just a little bit too far.  I suggest to the Minister in his capacity as the Minister on whom lies the responsibility for the economic condition of the Gaeltacht generally, that he should be careful that he is not taken off his feet by any campaign for carrying on this division of land too far.  Deputies from the Gaeltacht counties who understand the economic conditions in the Gaeltacht counties will realise that, to a large extent, the small holders in the Gaeltacht in South Kerry, West Kerry, Mayo, Donegal and in great portions of Galway, are mostly dependent for the sale of their unfinished cattle on the coming down of persons to the fairs there who have lands in the fattening counties of Meath, Kildare, and so on; and if these persons are put completely out of action, if their lands are taken from them, or if their farms are reduced to a point at which they cannot carry on in the particular way in which they farm them, the injury will ultimately fall on the small holder in the Gaeltacht. Deputy O'Reilly threw up his hands in horror at the idea of any migrant getting 370 acres of land.  I should not be at all so shocked if he was a migrant from a congested area where five or six or seven hundred acres of land were taken from him and divided amongst the congests in the particular area from which he came, and if he was a man who was engaged largely in the cattle business and could not conduct his business except he had a large tract of land.  I should not throw up my hands in horror at all at the idea of placing such a man in possession of a large extent of land in his new home even to the extent referred to if it would enable him to <Col N="1481" /> carry on the business which he had always carried on and enable him to go down and to purchase unfinished cattle where he had been accustomed to purchase them in the past.</P>
      <P>One almost smiles when one hears of congestion in the County of Meath, but I can quite appreciate the fact that there are pockets in some of the Midland counties which are almost as congested as some places in the West and South.  I agree that an effort should be made to satisfy persons in these congested areas in the Midlands, in the first instance, because it will smooth the way and make the path easier for the Department in bringing up migrants.  But I think care should be taken that the persons who are selected are persons fitted to work the land and make it a paying proposition. Deputy Curran referred to some cases in the North County Dublin.  I do not know about the cases to which he referred.  I do not know whether they were Land Commission cases at all. They probably were not, but I can quite well imagine that the fact that those lands are now being let on the eleven months system to the farmers about, might just as easily be attributable to the fact that the persons who got the land knew nothing about the working of land or were incapable of working the land, as to the fact that too high a price was paid for the land originally and that they were responsible for the repayment. That indicates the care that has to be taken in giving out land to landless men.  There is no use in giving land wholesale to landless men unless they are men who have been accustomed to work land, unless they know how to handle it, and unless they have some capital with which to stock it, or have sufficient guarantee behind them to enable them to stock it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot quite follow Deputy Flynn in his divisions of expenditure over a number of years.  Presumably, the expenditure on the improvement of estates goes according to the estates that are being actually handled by the Land Commission.  If estates are being handled in a large measure in one particular county, improvements <Col N="1482" /> will, naturally, follow the acquiring of estates there, and a larger sum will be spent in a particular year in that county.  At any rate it would be a ridiculous suggestion to compare any one county with any other county as regards the expenditure of money in any given year or even over any given number of years.  Conditions may be clearly different in the different counties.  It would be just as sensible to suggest that the £191,000 provided this year should be divided by 26 and the amount so obtained allocated to each county.  In the same way the division of money under the relief Vote was made, presumably, according as the necessity was greatest.  I think a large portion of it was spent in Gaeltacht counties as a matter of fact.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roddy referred to the question of reclamation.  If I remember rightly, two systems of reclamation were in operation.  There was one which I always thought had in it the elements of success.  That was where a farmer was encouraged to reclaim portion of his land-bog or mountain land in his own holding rather than the system under which the Land Commission went in themselves, took a big tract of land, and started reclamation on their own account and then parcelled out claims and had it split up.  I think that a system under which a farmer would be encouraged to add a little more arable land each year to his holding by means of some small bonus per acre would give a better result than the big and rather costly schemes of reclamation of whole countrysides directly by the Land Commission. That is a matter that I think the Minister should look into.</P>
    <P>There is another point in which I have always been rather personally interested.  It is in connection with the acquisition of land.  Where the lands are being acquired in the neighbourhood of towns and villages, if it is at all possible a portion of such land should be set aside to provide playgrounds.  I know that there is at least one precedent in Kerry in the Ardfert district in the Talbot-Crosbie Estate.  A playground was provided there and vested in trustees.  I know <Col N="1483" /> that there are demands from other towns and villages for similar facilities. I believe it is a proposition that the Minister should consider favourably whenever it is made to him.  I think there will always be found a desire in most towns and villages for such facilities for sports fields, football fields and so on.  I think you will always find trustworthy persons who will be prepared to act as trustees on behalf of the inhabitants of such town or village.</P>
    <P>If I remember rightly there has been an unnecessary alarm about derelict lands.  I think there was always to my knowledge an arrangement by which, for instance, a man could set his land with the authority of the Land Commission. I do not mean always, but in recent years there was such an arrangement. I have known of cases by which, through such an arrangement with the Land Commission, a man was allowed to set his land and the proceeds of the sale of the letting were handed, through the auctioneer, in repayment of his annuities or arrears, and if there was any surplus it went to the particular annuitant.  If that arrangement continues I do not think there is really very much more that the Department could do.  I remember that the Commissioner for Kerry was formulating a scheme by which these derelict farms were to be taken up and worked in a certain way. I do not know the exact details of the scheme.  But if any individual annuitant is unable to set his farm and if an arrangement is made by which the cattle of the person grazing the farm are not liable to be seized for the arrears due, well, that is about as much as could be expected from the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>The particular difficulty in my area in the County Clare is in connection with the repayment of annuities by a large class of the smaller holders in that particular area.  I refer now mostly to people who purchased their holdings under the 1923 Act.  A great many of these people, if not all, purchased their holdings at prices which were based upon rack rents.  These were estates where the <Col N="1484" /> landlords had been in the habit of allowing a rebatement of 40 per cent. in the rent.  These tenants found that after the purchase of their holdings they had to pay a higher annuity than they were paying as rent before purchase.</P>
      <P>There was an epidemic of fluke over West Clare which spread over the greater part of the county six or seven years ago.  Many people there lost practically every beast they had at that time.  They are still struggling and hoping against hope, and all the time there is an accumulation of arrears.  I would like if the Minister would take into consideration this class of people for whom I speak, and that some consideration should be given to them so as to help them to tide over their present difficulties.</P>
      <P>There is another matter.  On certain estates on which there were large residences it so happened that when the estates came to be divided the valuation of those residences was added on to the holding with the result that the valuation of one particular division of land around the residence was rather excessive and was out of proportion to the intrinsic value of the land.  That helped to place the people who got these particular divisions of the land in a serious difficulty.  There is a matter which has been referred to by previous speakers and that is the issuing of processes without the usual six-day notice.  That is a thing that should not be permitted, because it means adding on costs out of all proportion to the amount of the annuity involved.  I hope the Minister will take the necessary steps to prevent a continuance of this sort of thing.</P>

      <P>If there is any Minister who deserves the sympathy of the Dáil it is the Minister for Lands and Fisheries, for he is taking over a legacy of mismanagement, wrong legislation and every possible wrong thing that could be done to put the farming community of this country in a position of insolvency and to place them all in the impossible position the late Government had been placing them for the last ten years.  I have listened here to Deputies who have become unusually prolific in ideas and proposals this <Col N="1485" /> evening.  We had Deputy Hassett talking about landless men.  The policy of the Land Commission up to the present has been not to give land to landless men.  That statement of mine has been borne out by the statement of the ex-Minister for Lands and Fisheries.  It has been the policy of the Land Commission not to give land to landless men and Deputy Hassett has defended that.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hassett alluded to the fact that the particular trouble to-day with regard to these arrears of annuities was because those lands were purchased at entirely too high a price. Deputy Hassett was a member of this Dáil during the particular period when these lands were purchased.  He was present here during the last four years. On every single occasion when the members of the present Executive Council brought up a proposal for legislation to see that the Government would be in a position to give the lands to the tenants at a fair rent, Deputy Hassett was one of those who walked into the Lobby against those proposals. I think it is rather ridiculous to hear him now complaining of the result of his own work here.</P>

      <P>Sure.  I agree with Deputy Hassett that during the last few months there has been a regular flood of decrees and writs, and sheriffs and bailiffs have descended on the unfortunate tenants.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that when dealing with this problem the Minister should begin at the roots; he should get rid of a large portion of the legacy that has been handed down to him. He will not be able to rectify the position unless he has the courage to take out those things by the roots. Many complaints were made this evening of bailiffs visiting people, and reference was made to the impossibility of a tenant setting land to a grazier because he owes arrears. All that trouble is due to legislation passed here during the last four years <Col N="1487" /> by the Deputies now sitting opposite. I know the case of a tenant who a short time ago got portion of a divided estate.  He did his best.  He obtained a loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation and purchased cattle.  He was paying off his loan and paying his annuities.  There was no building on the land he got and he was obliged to use his neighbour's out-offices.  He woke up one morning to see his cattle being driven away by the sheriff and bailiffs.  He had to pay well in order to get his cattle back again.  They were taken simply because he happened to be using the out-offices of a person who had not paid his arrears.  Deputies opposite are responsible for all that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to the policy of the Land Commission in regard to farms taken over by banks. In several portions of my constituency banks advanced large sums for the purchase of farms.  One might say they drove the price of land up to three times its actual value.  Bank managers were at auctions offering money to prospective purchasers. Some time ago a bank sold out one farm of about 200 acres.  The Cork County Council found itself in the happy position that at last it was able to get payment of rates that were due on the land.  The Land Commission was also in the position that it could have obtained the arrears of annuities but instead of that the Land Commission relieved the bank of the burden and took the farm out of the bank's hands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the policy of the bank in 1922-23 anything to do with this particular Estimate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will learn a little more when he is here a little longer.  When the Land Commission took the land from the bank the <Col N="1488" /> County Council lost a good ratepayer and the Land Commission lost the annuities.  For the last two years that farm has been derelict.  It remains in the possession of the Land Commission. No one can take it at the rent demanded.  When the farm was taken over the amount paid by the bank was put on it in addition to the amount due by way of annuities and whoever takes the land now has to pay all.  There are several farms in a similar position throughout the Twenty-Six Counties.  I think that policy was a foolish one.</P>
      <P>We heard a lot about migrants.  I will give the history of one migrant. He was taken from a nice farm in West Cork and transferred to my constituency. The farm he left was 40 acres in extent.  He was transferred to a farm at Condonstown.  It cost £67 to remove him, his family and stock and he got £100 to assist him in erecting out-offices, etc.  He has been in occupation of the new farm for five years and he owes four and a half years' annuities to the Land Commission. In trying to settle the case the Land Commission about a month ago offered him £67 more to cover his removal back to where he came from and a sum of £70 for repairing the house he left originally in West Cork. They were anxious to plant himself and his stock back there again and they would, no doubt, consider him a very good riddance.  The point is that the annuities due on the holding to which he was transferred will come down on the next tenant.  That is the history of one migrant.  He was so well off that he refused the second offer and he had to be evicted.  If a lot of other migrants were transferred in the same way I do not know where we would find ourselves.  That policy was absolutely wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in regard to large numbers of estates is that the land was purchased for at least five times its actual value and the tenants put on this land are absolutely unable to pay the rack-rents demanded of them. Steps will have to be taken to have the land re-valued and the State, no doubt, will have to bear the burden of mismanagement on the part of the <Col N="1489" /> Land Commission under the control of the late Government.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been customary, in moving the Financial Resolutions for each year, to make a financial statement in which the general economic position of the State is surveyed.  In every financial survey made during the past decade it has been customary to observe that &ldquo;conditions during the year became increasingly bad.&rdquo;  We have to say that of the financial year 1931-1932, as I fear we shall have to say it of 1932-1933, except in so far as the new Government, by a wiser policy, may mitigate the evils of our depressing heritage.  The economic consequences of the Great War have involved almost every State, whether vanquished or victorious, in an equal disaster.  The collapse of huge speculative undertakings has left investors everywhere possibly much wiser but undoubtedly much poorer.  These circumstances have co-operated to restrict, first of all, industrial production, and, as a consequence, to narrow and depress the market for our agricultural products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This State might have escaped the worst consequences of the present situation.  It is well known that in agricultural communities changes in economic conditions always lag behind but correspond to the changes which take place in associated industrial communities. When, therefore, industrial conditions became universally depressed, it followed inevitably that agriculture, though at a later date, would become depressed also.  The Hatry crash gave us an ample forewarning of what was to come, and if at any time thereafter, as disaster supervened on disaster, culminating in the departure of Great Britain from the gold standard in September last, our financial and fiscal policies had been informed with a little prudence, a little foresight, a little <Col N="1490" /> courage, we would to-day be facing the future with greater equanimity.</P>
    <P>What, however, is the position in which we do find ourselves?  It is my duty to set it truly and plainly before the Dáil, and before the country, so that all may realise the magnitude of the task to which our minds must be set.</P>
    <P>Let us take the debt position first. On the 31st March last the direct liabilities of the State amounted to £38,687,469, made up as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The total of these two groups of contingent liabilities is £117,934,909, against which may be set assets, valued conservatively at £25,250,000, leaving a net deficit on this account of £92,684,909.</P>
    <P>Taking all these items into consideration, this little community of ours finds itself burdened with a net State or public debt, direct and contingent, amounting to no less a sum than £115,000,000.</P>
    <P>But the dead-weight burden of the public debt will not be appreciated if we assess it merely in terms of the capital magnitude of the debt itself.  A much truer measure is its annual cost to the community.  Expressed by this standard we find that the annual cost to our citizens of our public debt commitments in 1931-32 was £7,159,888, made up as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>So much for the capital position of the State.  I should like now to speak for a moment of the present capital position of the citizens and to compare it with the position as it was at 31st March, 1931.  Taking that date first, we find that during the year preceding it we had an investment income of approximately £9,735,000 gold, derived largely from investments in Great Britain.  The capital value of those investments was about £177,300,000 gold, equivalent&mdash;stated in another standard&mdash;to 41,779,087 gold ounces.  In 1931-1932 our investment income shrank to about £8,950,000 sterling, equivalent to 1,640,948 ounces gold, and the capital value of our investments at 31st March, 1932, was reduced to about £163,960,000 sterling, or 30,061,421 ounces gold.  It will thus be realised that due to the default by Great Britain in her gold obligations this country has lost no less a capital sum than 11,717,666 gold ounces or, expressing it in terms of the value of sterling at 31st March, 1932, of £63,900,000.  Similarly, our annual income from these investments again expressed in terms of gold converted into pounds sterling, has decreased by £3,560,000, mainly due again to the departure from the gold standard.  It is to be hoped that these facts will be kept in mind by every section of the House when the question of the land annuities comes to be discussed.</P>
    <P>And now what is the substructure of trade which maintains this capital position and upon which the whole fabric of our finances is borne?  In 1930-1931 the total value of our import and export trade was £98,068,000 gold.  In 1931-1932 that value expressed partly in gold and partly in paper pounds, <Col N="1493" /> was £85,750,000.  The contraction, even expressed in this way, is startling enough.  It is much more startling if the trade is considered in terms of the same unit for both years.  Taking the gold ounce as our standard of value, we find that in 1930-1931 our total import and export trade was worth 23,108,807 ounces gold, whereas in 1931-1932 it was only worth 15,721,925 ounces gold.  The decline, therefore, in 1931-1932 was equivalent to 7,386,882 ounces gold.  So that, in 1931-1932 the total value of our import and export trade was only 68 per cent. of what it was in 1930-1931, and only 63 per cent. of what it was in 1927-1928.</P>
    <P>In such circumstances it is not to be wondered at that at the close of the financial year 1931-1932 the Budgetary position was extremely unsatisfactory. Revenue shrank in almost every direction, except where it had been artificially expanded by an increased impost.  On the customs and excise side the more notable deficiencies in this regard were the beer duty, which declined by £666,042, to £2,761,611; the duty on motors and tyres, which produced £393,896 or £115,087 less than in the preceding year; and the duty on tobacco which for the first time in many years failed to expand, and at £3,426,471 was £13,980 below the yield for 1930-1931.  The most noticeable disappointment, however, was the duty on hydro-carbon light oils which, despite the fact that the rate of tax was doubled during the year, yielded only £535,218 or £114,782 less than the estimate.  The diminished revenue from the beer duty to which I have referred was not, I am sorry to say, occasioned by any notable increase in temperance.  It was mainly due to the fact that my predecessor collected in 1929-1930 duty upon beer which did not go into consumption until 1930-1931. Similarly, the decreased yield which I anticipate for 1932-1933 is due not at all to any decrease in domestic consumption, but to the fact that duty was paid in 1931-1932 upon the libations of this year.  In this connection, however, I may confess that I have some hopes that during the current year certain travellers coming from the dreary desert of prohibition <Col N="1494" /> may do something to revive one of the ancient glories of the revenue.</P>
    <P>On the Inland Revenue side, honest Seán Citizen, under the pleasing and effective persuasion of buff papers, white papers and red letter papers, and, in the latter part of the year, of the additional stimulus of an extra 6d. in the £., exceeded Exchequer anticipations by £325,124 and yielded up an income tax and sur-tax of £4,600,124.  Excess Profits Duty beat the book by £52,000.  But Death was not so kind as my predecessor had expected, and, were it not for the fact that the Exchequer had a windfall of about £200,000, the Estate Duties would have been lower than the estimate by about £85,113.  Stamp Duties again disappointed us, and at £365,000 odd were lower than the estimate by £30,740 and lower than the yield for 1930-31 by £11,529.  In the gloom of the Exchequer, however, twinkled one bright, if lonely, star. The duty on Wireless Apparatus had in 1930-31 brought in £34,600, and last year when expected to account for only £35,000 actually yielded £43,129. Disappointing from a Revenue point of view in almost every way the year closed with a deficit of apparently only £639,234.</P>
    <P>I suppose that in certain quarters, where omissions and commissions alike are accepted as remarkable achievements, a deficit of £639,234 would in any event be held up to admiration as the final triumph of a businesslike administration.  But to allow it to remain at that would be to deny to the late Government all its due.  It required much ingenuity and a certain manipulative skill to reduce the deficit, even in appearance, to only £639,234.  I shall try to make clear how it was done.</P>
    <P>In arriving at the aforementioned figure of £639,234 all expenditure has been treated as normal, and all revenue as normal, but we find that the late Minister intended to treat as abnormal the following items which, in strict propriety, ought in my opinion to have been regarded from <Col N="1495" /> the outset as normal expenditure, viz:&mdash;</P>

    <P>In addition, he actually appropriated from the Local Loans Fund and used for the purpose of meeting &ldquo;Normal&rdquo; expenditure a sum of £100,000.  Nor did it end at that.  There fell into the Exchequer during the year two very handsome plums in the shape of £295,000, representing arrears of interest due from the Electricity Supply Board, and £100,000, representing what was called surplus interest transferred from the Post Office Savings Bank. My predecessor transferred these to revenue.  In doing so, however, he overlooked the fact that he had left uncovered £424,000 of accrued interest on Savings Certificates.  I presume it was an oversight.  After all the objurgations which we have heard during the past ten years about honour and honesty and the Ten Commandments, nobody could believe it was anything else but an oversight.  In this way, however, a real and effective deficiency of £1,195,000 was made to appear as a book deficiency of £639,234.  But the shrinkage has been in appearance only, just as though our eye had been put to the wrong end of the telescope. The difference of £556,000 between the real and the disclosed deficiency has been met by appropriating to revenue what should have gone to the reduction of debt.</P>
    <P>Leaving behind us that unedifying past, we may now turn to the year before us.  It presents a grim and forbidding aspect.  It will be a hard year, a year of self-denial for all of us.  But it will be an honest year.  We shall honour our obligations to our people, and we shall pay our way.  According to the White Paper giving the Estimate of Receipts and Expenditure, issued some days ago, we shall require to provide during the year £4,824,377 <Col N="1496" /> for Central Fund Services and £21,969,623 for Supply Services.  The latter figure, however, makes no provision for the additional funds which will be required under the Old-Age Pensions Bill recently introduced, and under a minor Bill modifying the Military Pensions Act, which will be introduced in due course by the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>Nor does it cover any additional expenditure which may be occasioned by the report of the Committee on Widows' and Orphans' Pensions, nor provide for anything in the nature of special relief grants nor for works to create employment.  It represents the cost of existing supply services solely, together with the two minor items which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The published requirement for Central Fund Services includes the earmarking of £900,000 for the purposes of the Road Fund proper, the provision of £650,000 for sinking fund payments, and £1,768,750 for interest on outstanding debts.  The total provision for the service of debt is £2,419,650, or £373,353 more than last year.  Of this sum £150,000 is to cover the cost of issue and the capital charges in this year upon a new loan which may have to be raised.  The increase in the balance remaining over what was provided last year is almost entirely due to the fact that we are putting £450,000 to the Savings Certificate Interest Equalisation Fund.  We are thus making complete provision for all interest accrued to 31st March, 1932, on £7,020,000 of Savings Certificates issued.  By doing that we are doing more to establish the credit of this community at a high level and upon a sound basis than&mdash;to use an expressive Americanism&mdash;all the &ldquo;Ballyhooing&rdquo; which has been indulged in during the past ten years about the credit of this State.</P>
    <P>Coming now to the Supply Services, in the White Paper these stood at £21,969,623.  In former years something was always knocked off this item for savings.  The custom engendered a tendency in the spending departments to inflate estimates in anticipation of the cut.  The Estimates which we are now considering were prepared under <Col N="1497" /> these conditions.  They undoubtedly contain an element of this inflationary character.  If I were to follow the example of my predecessor I should avail myself of the whole of this element and utilise it for the purpose of securing a balance.  There are special considerations in this particular year which render it inadvisable to follow, to the fullest extent, this precedent.</P>
    <P>The general speculative and economic position abroad, and the new taxes to which I am compelled to resort, impart a larger element than usual of uncertainty to our estimates of the tax yield.  I do not propose, therefore, to write down the Estimates to the fullest extent as was previously done, but to reserve a part of such elements of over-estimation as they contain to meet any deficiency in the revenue which may arise from the causes to which I have just referred. At the same time, I do not propose to be content with what are, after all, merely hypothetical savings.  I feel that new administrative methods in the Civil Service would eventuate in real economies.  It is our intention to set up special machinery to secure these, and we propose, for the purposes of the Budget and for the extra services which I shall detail later, to take credit for them.</P>
    <P>The vexed question of the segregation of items of expenditure into the categories, normal and abnormal, remains to be dealt with before I proceed to the more arithmetical side of the Budget.  I am convinced that in the main both the extent to which and the manner in which the segregation has hitherto been made are indefensible.  No authority on public finance would attempt to justify borrowing to provide for services like Public Works and Buildings, grants to Universities and Forestry.  The position, however, becomes not merely unjustifiable but farcical, when we have every little fiddle-faddle of public expenditure arbitrarily classified as abnormal merely to achieve a balance. That is not to say that there are no expenditures which may be classified as abnormal.  There are.  But they must be unusual in their magnitude, <Col N="1498" /> and generally unusual also in their character.  On these grounds the cost of the Shannon Scheme would properly be defrayed by borrowing. Public Works, where these are definitely of a recurring character, and are not of such a nature as will yield a certain and immediate economic return, cannot be regarded as abnormal and should not be provided for out of borrowing.  On the other hand, abnormal expenditure arising, for instance, out of military operations of a costly nature may properly, in the earlier years at least, be regarded as abnormal.  If the operations, however, were long drawn out so that a war-like condition became the normal habit of the State, then a large part of such expenditure would have to be regarded as normal.  Similarly, the provision of emergency relief in the case of widespread famine or a national catastrophe could properly be classified as abnormal expenditure, whereas the expenditure necessary to relieve the continuous or recurring distress of poverty-stricken elements of the community must be regarded as normal and must be provided for out of normal revenue.</P>
    <P>According to these well-established principles, it is permissible to regard as abnormal expenditure some portion of the costs of a war, and, possibly, all the costs of replacing property damaged or destroyed by war.  But it is not permissible to fix, as my predecessor did, an arbitrary figure as the level of the normal expenditure on the Army, and to classify all expenditure above that figure as abnormal and to meet it by borrowing.  If it were possible to justify proceedings of that kind by any principles of public finance then we could justify its application to every service in the State.  The procedure would eventually become a cloak and an excuse for every sort of administrative ineptitude, extravagance and corruption.</P>
    <P>Bearing these arguments in mind, there are only two items in the present year's Estimates which I feel can be regarded and treated as abnormal. These are first the provision which is to be made under Vote 14 for Property Losses Compensation, and, secondly, <Col N="1499" /> the provision made in the Central Fund Estimates to complete the repayment of the Dáil Eireann (Internal) Loan.  These two items together amount to £137,100.</P>
    <P>As to whether our contribution to the Local Loans Fund should be regarded as normal or abnormal there may be some room for argument.  In view of the fact, however, that the fund is now being mainly used to finance public health works and housing schemes, which, the former particularly, cannot be said to yield a full economic return, it is my opinion that these contributions should now be regarded as a provision which should normally be made out of revenue. Otherwise, we shall be compelled to continue the same high charges for loans from the fund as have hitherto prevented many local authorities from proceeding with necessary public works.  As this year's contribution to the fund, however, will be made out of revenue of an unusual and, perhaps, non-recurring character, the question will remain open for another year.</P>
    <P>Having thus cleared the ground we shall now attack the main problem. As I have said, in the estimates of expenditure on the Supply Services which were prepared by my predecessor, nothing was included to cover the additional provision which, arising out of the Old Age Pensions Bill recently introduced, has to be made this year for Old Age Pensions, nor for additional Wound and Disability Pensions, all of which are to be provided under the terms of a new Army Pensions Bill to be introduced at an early date by the Minister for Defence.  These items will require the Exchequer to find an additional sum this year of not less than £270,000, of which about £250,000 will be absorbed by Old Age Pensions. The total amount, therefore, to be provided will be:</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1500" /> From this amount I propose to deduct the sums required for Property Losses Compensation and to complete the repayment of the Dáil Eireann Loan, and thereby to reduce to £26,926,000 the amount to be provided out of taxation for the aforementioned purposes.</P>
    <P>From the White Paper it will be seen that the existing taxation will bring in only £19,893,000, and that this with the non-taxable revenue of £3,417,000 will produce an additional revenue of £23,310,000.  We have thus to find at the outset £3,616,000, over three and a half millions.</P>
    <P>The raising of that amount under present circumstances is a truly terrifying task.  The late administration went to the country because they would not face it.  We propose to do it, however, and to do something more.  We must do it in order to maintain existing services, and we have to do something more to accelerate the provision of houses, and in order to enable local authorities to provide relief in the form of employment for those of the community who are workless and hungry.  We shall not be able to rely solely on taxation to provide to the full extent that something more.  We shall have to ask the personnel in every branch of the public service to come to the assistance of the community.  We shall have to secure rigorous economies in the existing administrative machine, and we may have to borrow.  One thing, however, we shall not do.  We shall not cut the social services, and we shall also, so far as may be possible, suit the burden to the back.</P>
    <P>In addition to the provisions to which I have just referred, it is also necessary, in view of the special emergency, to make additional provision for the relief of unemployment, partly by means of free grants for housing and public health schemes, partly by loans at low rates of interest from the Local Loans Fund, and partly by special road works financed from borrowings undertaken by the Road Fund.  These unemployment relief items, taken together, will reach a total of £1,550,000, in addition to <Col N="1501" /> which there will be available £550,000 already provided under Vote 8 for the Local Loans Fund.  Moreover, something must be done this year for the relief of agriculture and for children of those families who are in receipt of home assistance.  In respect of the first we propose to make an additional supplementary grant of £250,000 in relief of rates on agricultural land, thus giving effect to the resolution which we put before the House when in opposition.  In respect of the second, we propose to give a sum of £100,000 to assist local authorities to provide milk for the children of families in receipt of home assistance.</P>
    <P>In order, therefore, to arrive at the total deficiency which we must cover, the sum of £1,550,000 for the emergency unemployment relief schemes, together with the sum of £350,000 for agriculture and the contribution to Home Assistance, must be added to the figure of £3,616,000 already mentioned, making £5,516,000 in all.</P>
    <P>It may be asked here are there no reserves to which we might turn in this desperate situation.  I regret to have to say that there are none.  Every asset that could be realised was realised by my predecessor, and realised largely to defray expenditure which, if not altogether to be avoided by economies, ought to have been met out of normal revenue.  Not merely was this the case, but even the future has been mortgaged by him.  At the end of last year the Government granted £250,000 for the relief of unemployment.  The basis of that grant, which was taken from the Road Fund, was a hypothetical payment on account of a hypothetical award which it was expected would be made in our favour by an arbitrator appointed to determine our claim for a share in the Road Fund of the United Kingdom.  If the arbitrator does not award us anything, I shall have to make good to the Road Fund that £250,000 which was appropriated from it last year by Deputy Blythe.  It has been said of some men that their successors in a fairy estate have remembered them by their deeds&mdash;their title deeds.  I fear that we shall remember our predecessors only by their mortgages. <Col N="1502" /> They are about all they have left to us.  And since they have left nothing in the chest, and nothing in the stocking, it will be seen that we have nothing left to us but the taxpayer's pocket, to which, with great regret, we have now to turn.</P>
    <P>I have said we must suit the burden to the back, and to those who are best able to give we must first have recourse. I shall not deny that, strictly speaking, we are a poor community.  I readily accept that, judged by the standards which prevail elsewhere, the extremes of great wealth scarcely exist among us.  But in the kingdom of the blind the one-eyed man is king, and in our dire necessity, even the only moderately well-to-do must take a very heavy share of the burden which, unfortunately, must fall upon every section of the community.</P>
    <P>I shall begin with the tax which, at any rate in its first incidence, falls upon the more comfortably circumstanced amongst us.  The British income tax in September last was increased to 5/- in the £.  Ours, in October last, was only increased by sixpence, to 3/6.  Why the increase was so small I do not know, since an additional halfpenny per lb. was imposed on sugar, which is a necessary of life, particularly among the very poor.  I propose to emulate the good example of Mr. Snowden, in praise of whom certain Irish papers were lyrical a few months ago, and to increase the standard rate of income tax to 5/- in the £, and to confine the half-rate relief to the first £100 of taxable income.  I realise, however, that for those who earn the lower incomes this would be a very heavy burden, and I propose, in the case of earned incomes, to increase the earned income allowance to one-sixth of the amount earned up to £450, leaving the allowance in case of any balance in excess of that figure at one-tenth of such excess, subject to a maximum earned income allowance of £200 in all.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, when the Fianna Fáil Party sat on the benches opposite we indicated by amendments which were put down to successive Cumann na nGaedheal Budgets that the relief in respect of children should be increased, <Col N="1503" /> and the figures then aimed at were £50 for the first child, and £40 for each other child.  Our amendments were rejected. They came from the Fianna Fáil Benches, and, as a matter of course, were immediately dubbed impossible by the then Government.  I find they are neither impossible nor impracticable. In fact, we can do very much better than we had hoped, so that the allowance, not for the first child merely, but each child, may be increased to £50, and I propose to make that commendable reform accordingly.</P>
    <P>The fact that I am to make an allowance in respect of children fills me with pity and concern for the forlorn bachelors among us.  How can a Minister for Finance do anything for a bachelor?  He cannot, for instance, grant him any relief in respect of children. The problem has caused me earnest cogitation, because since I am in this mood of beneficence I should like&mdash;I am afraid I cannot long maintain it&mdash;to be beneficent towards everybody. Unfortunately, circumstances will not permit me, by increasing the married allowance, to gild the bonds of holy matrimony, but possibly by making the drear loneliness of bachelordom more repellent I might drive many an eligible young man to take the plunge.  Accordingly, I propose, by reducing to £125 the personal allowance made to unmarried persons, to add a gold-tipped arrow to Cupid's quiver, and to make matrimony the refuge of bachelors and spinsters with taxable incomes.</P>
    <P>It is good to think that, even for a Minister for Finance, virtue may bring something more than its own reward because as a result of this entirely beneficial rearrangement of the Income Tax reliefs and allowances I hope to bring into the Exchequer an additional £35,000 this year and about £56,000 in a full year, apart altogether from the sum of £1,000,000, which I hope to get from the Standard Rate.  Furthermore by the rearrangement of reliefs and allowances a large number of taxpayers who are paying income tax on the old scale even at the 3s. 6d. rate, will be relieved altogether of income tax even in the new scale.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1504" /> There are two other changes of first importance which we intend to make in regard to income tax.  I have already indicated that the allowance in respect of earned incomes up to £450 will be increased to one-sixth. We have now to do something for the possessors of investment income on condition that they in turn do something for the country.  With a view to encouraging our own citizens to invest their capital in Saorstát industry, we are, therefore, including in the Finance Bill a clause providing for an allowance for income tax purposes of twenty per cent. in respect of dividends arising from subscriptions to any issue of capital made after the passing of the Bill by a Saorstát public company which satisfies certain conditions.  These will be broadly that the company's trade is carried on mainly in the Saorstát, that the company is managed and controlled in the Saorstát, and that the whole of the issue of the capital to which the concession applies is devoted either to the establishment of a new business or the extension of an existing business.  Certain types of businesses will be excluded from the benefit of the concession.  The allowance will be granted to the individual investor who must be resident in the Saorstát and not resident elsewhere, and will have effect not only for income tax but also for sur-tax purposes. The concession will apply to new issues of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  The high rate at which it will be made will render it very valuable.  It should make forthcoming issues of the Agricultural Credit Corporation in particular much more attractive even than they have hitherto been, and should put the Corporation in a position to raise funds on terms which will enable it to reduce substantially its rate of interest upon agricultural loans.</P>
    <P>By the other major change in the income tax law to which I have referred it is proposed to make assessments under Schedule D. on the recipient of a rent from business premises where such rent exceeds the amount assessed under Schedule A. on the basis of the valuation.  Owing to various circumstances this change will <Col N="1505" /> only produce about £13,000 in the current year.  We are planning for the future.  It is a change, however, which it is hoped, like the grain of mustard seed, will grow into a mighty tree beneath whose foliage luckier Ministers for Finance than I will sit at ease to catch the glittering prizes as they fall.</P>
    <P>There are several minor amendments in the income tax law which will require resolutions but which I do not intend to dilate upon at this stage.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to pass on from income tax to sur-tax.  We shall have to make changes there also.  It is a well established fact that many folk in comfortable circumstances are quite prepared to pay a good deal to rub shoulders occasionally with the rich. We propose, by reducing from £2,000 to £1,500 the level above which sur-tax is payable and to give a few who are in the top section of the income tax scale the opportunity of rubbing shoulders with the rich all the year round.  At the same time we shall not charge them very much for the privilege, since the rate in respect of the first £500 of excess over £1,500 will only be sixpence.  For wealthier individuals the principle of coequality must be given effect to, otherwise the possession of an inferiority complex might be imputed to us.  The imputation is one which no self-respecting citizen of the British Commonwealth could for a moment endure, so we propose to raise the rates of sur-tax throughout the rest of the scale to something like the British level. We do not, however, propose to follow the British practice by adding an over-riding 10% throughout the scale. We shall leave that also as an Imperial Preference.  The changes in the sur-tax, it is anticipated, will bring in an additional £77,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Corporation Profits Tax it will be necessary to increase the general rate of that tax to 7½ per cent. in the case of Saorstát companies and foreign companies which maintain a register or branch register of shareholders here, and 10 per cent. in the case of foreign companies trading in <Col N="1506" /> the Saorstát which have shareholders resident in this country, but which do not maintain here a branch register of the shareholders.  The scope of the tax will be enlarged to bring in public companies, the liability of whose members is unlimited and which distribute profits amongst them.  The exemption granted to public utility concerns, working under statutory limitations as to prices or rates of dividends, will be withdrawn, except in so far as it applies to dock, canal or railway undertakings, or to certain building societies or the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  The tax free allowance will be reduced to £5,000 instead of £10,000, and the tax will be charged in respect of every accounting period ending after the 31st December, 1930. As a result of all this, we hope to secure for the Exchequer an additional £230,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>Over and above the fee payable to the Currency Commission by banks in respect of the Consolidated Bank Notes which they put in circulation, we propose to impose an additional 1½ per cent. on such notes.  There will be a further tax of 3 per cent. on that part of the respective quotas allocated to the several banks which are not in circulation.  In this way we shall get £90,000.</P>
    <P>The total amount which I propose to raise by means of the aforementioned Inland Revenue taxes is £1,445,000. We have now to call in the assistance of the Customs and Excise.  In October last my predecessor imposed an additional tax of ½d. per lb. or 4/8 per cwt. on sugar.  Sugar has a very high food value and it is an absolute necessary of life.  A tax on sugar is a &ldquo;hard&rdquo; tax.  It cannot be imposed without a corresponding increase in the cost of living.  It, therefore, falls heavily on the very poor.  Tea, on the other hand, has little value as food. It is not a necessary of life.  A tax upon it is a &ldquo;soft&rdquo; tax; that is to say, a tea tax need not necessarily involve a diminution in consumption or an increase in the amount spent upon the commodity.  The poor can adjust themselves to it more easily than to a tax upon sugar.  They will not have to pay more for tea, and I have no <Col N="1507" /> doubt that with a tax on tea we shall have enterprising grocers proclaiming to the public that their &ldquo;2/8 tea is still 2/8.&rdquo;  I propose, therefore, to replace by a duty on tea the additional duty which last October was imposed on sugar and sugar composite goods. That is to say, a Customs and Excise duty at the effective preferential rate of 4d. per lb. (the full rate being 6d.) will be imposed on tea, while the Customs and Excise duty on sugar will be reduced by 4/8 per cwt. or ½d. per lb. The change will make virtually no difference in the revenue; the remission of the sugar duty costing £400,000 with the tea duty just about balancing that at £418,000.</P>
    <P>The growing practice, found particularly among large distributing firms and multiple shops, of importing their commodities ready packed for sale has been noted.  The custom, undoubtedly, has restricted opportunities for employment here.  We should, at least, be allowed to pack and parcel for ourselves the foreign foodstuffs which we are compelled to eat.  I hope at one and the same time to help the revenue and to provide employment by imposing a package tax at the rate of twopence per packet or parcel and twopence per bottle the capacity of which, I think, does not exceed two pints. The tax will apply to all articles of food and drink, and I am sure it will gratify the many male citizens who were good to write to me in this connection when they learn that it is going to apply to cosmetic and medicinal preparations packed ready for sale.</P>
    <P>In the present circumstances it would not be justifiable to refrain from extending the tax on entertainments, much less to reduce it in any of its applications.  It is necessary, therefore, to enlarge the scope of the tax to cover all forms of entertainment, including dances, for which an admission fee is charged.  The duty will cover outdoor sports, horse racing and greyhound coursing, and will bring in £84,000 in the current year.  There will be no change in the duty on cinematograph films, nor will the existing exemption on theatrical entertainments be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The question of an increase in the <Col N="1508" /> tobacco duty must now be considered. At the present moment the customs duty on tobacco in this country is 1/4 per lb. less than in Great Britain.  It will be necessary to increase the duty by 1/2 per lb.  In this connection, however, special consideration must be given to the position of the smaller manufacturers <i>vis-a-vis</i> their more powerful competitors.  When the duty was increased in Great Britain in September last the manufacturers there were able to shoulder the burden of the tax and to refrain from passing it on to the public.  It would not be possible for our native manufacturers to do this.  Some of them are, in fact, working at a slight loss so far as the manufacture of pipe tobacco is concerned. We propose, therefore, in the case of firms which were carrying on business in the Saorstát continuously since 1st April, 1922, as manufacturers of tobacco, and which have since remained in the beneficial ownership of Irish-born residents, to grant a special rebate of 7d. in respect of every pound of unmanufactured tobacco received by them.  This will enable them, by increasing their charges slightly to the public, to make good their losses.  In that connection I ought to say that there is no reason whatever why there should be any change in respect of cigarettes.  In the case of the more powerful and foreign-owned firms in this country we expect that they will act in the same spirit of self-denial towards our citizens as they did towards those in Great Britain.  The net amount which I expect to get this year from the increased tobacco duty will be £350,000.</P>
    <P>The case of the Irish tobacco grower has often been argued in the Dáil with great force but with little effect.  In order to give him a fair chance to establish a new agricultural industry in the country, I propose to remit altogether the excise duty hitherto chargeable on tobacco grown in the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>Passing from tobacco, it is natural that we should come to the tobacco dealer, and I propose to make some slight alteration in the terms of the tobacco dealer's licence, and to relate the amount of the licence duty to the <Col N="1509" /> Poor Law valuation of his premises, where such valuation exceeds £10. On valuations which are not in excess of that figure the licence duty will remain at 5/3.  In the case of premises on which the valuation is greater than £10, there will be charged on the excess an additional excise duty at a rate equal to 1 per cent of the Poor Law Valuation.</P>
    <P>Minor changes will also be made in the duties on matches, and a tax will be imposed on mechanical lighters.</P>
    <P>Arising out of representations which were made to me by a deputation from the Licensed Trade I had the existing position of the Brewing and Distilling trades carefully investigated.  There is no doubt that the smaller breweries particularly have been hit extremely hard by the depressed economic conditions of the past ten years.  Many of them are on the verge of extinction, the output of some of them being not even so much as 5,000 barrels.  It will be admitted that their position is most precarious.  The policy of the Government is to decentralise industry so as to distribute employment over the largest possible area.  Workers would be thrown out of employment over the number of the smaller towns of the Saorstát, and to some extent also farmers in the immediate vicinity of these towns would be affected if the small breweries were to close down. In order to keep them alive, it is proposed to grant a relief in the form of a remission of 5/- per standard barrel of the Excise duty charged upon the first 5,000 barrels.  This concession will cost us £9,750 in the current year, and its benefits will be limited to breweries which malt or roast here not less than 80 per cent of the grain used by them.</P>
    <P>One of the anomalies of the existing position in regard to the tax on musical instruments is that records for the reproduction of music by means of gramophones, pianolas, and other similar instruments, were exempted in 1924.  It is difficult to defend this exemption particularly when violins, pianos, etc., by means of which professional musicians earn their living, are subjected to a tax.  I propose, therefore, to reimpose a Customs duty in respect of all such instruments, and <Col N="1510" /> to charge it at the rate of 33? per cent. of the value of such records.  Musical sound films, being subject to the high rate of cinematograph duty, will not be subject to the new duty.</P>
    <P>In order to encourage the assembly here of wireless apparatus from ultimate component parts it is proposed, whilst continuing the existing duty on the parts, to increase the rate of duty applicable to any complete apparatus and to any substantial assembly of component parts to 50 per cent. ad valorem.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to make permanent the duties which are popularly referred to as the &ldquo;McKenna Duties.&rdquo;  These duties on musical instruments, clocks, watches and cinematograph films were first imposed in 1915, and have been annually renewed since.  There does not appear to be any good reason for continuing this inconvenient procedure.  It was first devised at a time when every Liberal had to be a Free Trader even after he had become a Protectionist.  Times have changed since, and I understand that nowadays a Liberal may be anything he likes, and everything he likes, provided he is nothing long.  The procedure remains merely as a relic of a vanished age in British politics.  I propose to abolish it.</P>
    <P>The particularly difficult position in which many small passenger-carrying concerns have been placed by the imposition and increase of the petrol tax and by the seating tax on omnibuses has been brought under my notice.  I have had the situation carefully investigated, and I am satisfied that, unless some relief be afforded, many of these concerns will be driven out of business and many people thrown out of employment.  The Government could not permit such a position to arise and, accordingly, have decided to reduce the seating tax in the case of buses by 33? per cent. as from the end of the current quarter.  This concession will cost about £23,000.</P>
    <P>The net result of all the changes which have been made up to this point still leaves a very considerable sum lacking to balance what I may describe as the normal Budget.  I <Col N="1511" /> have still to find an additional £1,508,750.  My position would, indeed, have been a hopeless one if the need of the Revenue and the policy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce had not chanced to coincide.  New duties to the number of 43 are being imposed on the advice of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  All are necessary for the fulfilment of our industrial programme, since we are capable of producing here everything to which they are applied, and they will yield to the revenue £910,000.  The full list of duties will be set out in the schedule attached to the necessary Resolution, but I may say at this stage, for the information of the House, that among the more important of them is a tax on newspapers and periodicals imported in bulk quantities, and of which the superficial area of page or front cover does not exceed 320 square inches.  In this case the full rate of duty will be 1½d. per copy, with a preferential rate of ld.  During the period in which I have been considering the Budget proposals I have had urgent and emphatic demands from many quarters for the imposition of such a duty. Undoubtedly, its imposition now will help both our native printers and our native writers.</P>
    <P>Another important duty will be a tax on constructional steel imported fabricated and ready for erection.  We may not be able at this moment to roll steel sections here but, undoubtedly, we are able to drill and fit and erect them.  At this moment practically none of the fabrication of these structures is being done in the Saorstát, and similarly their erection is being carried out mainly by outsiders.</P>
    <P>The position at this stage is that allowing for the remission in sugar duty, the bus seating tax, and the beer duty, we have provided for £26,260,250.  But on our normal Budget we require, as I have said, £26,926,000.  I shall have to ask for sacrifices from those who are engaged in public employment to help me to find the remainder.  I propose to find <Col N="1512" /> by reductions in salaries and allowances in the various branches of the Public Service, and I hope I may be able to say later that this has included the Judiciary, the sum of £250,000.  In the light of the community's urgent need this cannot be regarded as too large a sum to ask.</P>
    <P>From savings due to over-estimation in the cost of the Supply Services we hope to get, say, 1½ per cent. of £21,969,000, the amount of the original estimate.  This should produce £329,535.  My predecessor last year took 2½ per cent. as the figure for over-estimation.  In addition to this we propose to have the whole system of administrative routine in the Public Services, and with it the question of office accommodation; the lighting, heating, and furnishing of offices, the utilisation of modern business appliances; purchase of stationery and consumable stores generally; printing, etc., examined by a body of experts specially engaged for the task.  Taking into consideration the magnitude of the services concerned it should not be difficult for an investigation of this kind to produce a saving of not less than £100,000 in the current year.  As a result of the sacrifices and economies which I have indicated, we shall be able to reduce the expenditure figures for the normal Budget by approximately £679,535, leaving the net expenditure on that side of the Budget at £26,247,365.  Against which we can now set tax and non-tax revenue amounting to £26,260,250, leaving a surplus at this stage of £12,855.</P>
    <P>It were well that we could close the accounts here and compliment ourselves that our great task was nearly done.  Unfortunately, however, it is far from ended.  We have still to remember the plight of the unemployed. There is no need for me to describe the position of those who are workless and hungry.  We have heard a good deal about them both inside the House here and outside it.  We have, however, the inspiring thought that the Opposition party by their votes in the early afternoon of this day fortnight indicated that they are <Col N="1513" /> at one with us in our endeavour to provide the funds which will give effect to the principles embodied in Deputy Morrissey's proposals.  During the past few weeks also it has been consoling to note that responsible organs of the Press have recently been urging us in the same direction and emphasising our obligation to discharge our Christian duty to our needy citizens.  I am glad at this stage, when even the stoutest spirit might flag, to reinforce my resolution by the thought that I have behind me the weight and influence of responsible newspapers, that always mean what they say.</P>
    <P>The House was told last week by Deputy O'Connor that there had been a complete cessation in the speculative building trade.  I have no doubt that there was, and that the cessation was due entirely to the defective provisions of the Housing Act for which the ex-Minister for Local Government and Public Health, Deputy Mulcahy, was responsible in the last Dáil.  We propose to set aside the sum of £100,000 to increase considerably the grants which were made available under the last Housing Act, the grant to be payable only on the condition that the work on the house is commenced before the 1st September next.</P>
    <P>In addition, we propose to provide for local authorities either as a free grant or as a grant-in-aid, according to the nature of the works upon which it will be employed, the sum of £350,000 to be spent on public health works, minor road works, e.g., cul-de-sac roads, and arterial drainage schemes. It will naturally take some time for works of this description to get under way, and, in the meantime, for the immediate alleviation of distress we propose to make a grant of £150,000 to be used in works which will absorb the greatest possible amount of labour, for example, in the clearance and preparation of derelict sites for building.  In addition to the £877,000 which, after the remission of the bus-seating tax, will be available from the Road Fund for the normal purposes thereof, we propose to provide for special road works of a more comprehensive character than would be covered by the grant <Col N="1514" /> for immediate relief works the sum of £1,000,000 to be raised by borrowing on the security of the Road Fund.  In addition, we propose, out of the Local Loans Fund, to place at the disposal of local authorities to immediately finance local public health works and housing schemes a sum of not less than £550,000 to be repaid by them on the annuity system at a much lower rate than at present to cover interest and sinking fund.  Apart altogether from the £877,000 which will be available in the normal way from the Road Fund, the special provisions for the creation of employment which I have indicated, and which are necessary to give effect to the principle contained in Deputy Morrissey's motion, will amount to £2,150,000.  I believe that this will be regarded by everybody as an adequate and full discharge of our commitments in that regard, and a complete fulfilment of our pledges to the unemployed.</P>
    <P>Taking into consideration the amount required to be provided out of the Local Loans Fund, and by borrowing on the security of the Road Fund, we are left with a balance of £600,000 still to be provided for the creation of employment. In addition, we have to provide £350,000 for the additional Supplementary Agricultural Grant, and for the Grant-in-Aid of the provision of milk for the children of necessitous persons.  As a first step in this direction, I propose to transfer from the normal to the emergency section of the Budget the surplus of £12,885.  For a large part of the balance I shall have to turn to the proceeds of the sweepstake. I have had to consider many proposals in this regard.  They were all rejected in favour of one which was submitted by the Emergency Committee of the Hospitals and which outshone all others in its attractive simplicity.  I propose to levy 25 per cent. on the hospitals' share of the proceeds of all sweepstakes drawn after the 1st March, 1932.  This, I hope, will bring me in not less than £650,000 this year. In view of this change in the original scheme, I propose to ask my colleagues in the Executive Council to reconsider the present allocation between public and county hospitals of the proceeds of the sweepstake.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1515" /> It has often been represented to the Government that a large amount of Irish capital is concealed here and abroad, frozen up, and withheld from Irish industry.  I have been told that the owners of such capital, having made themselves liable to heavy penalties for offences against the Revenue, are afraid to put their funds to a profitable use in this country.  In view of the fact that the new economic policy of the Government must be adequately financed, and that it is desirable that every available source from which capital can be secured may be open to Irish enterprise, the problem of liquifying these resources has engaged the serious attention of the Government.  Apart altogether from this aspect of the matter, however, I think it will be generally agreed that the present position is unsatisfactory from a revenue point of view, and that measures should be taken to clear it up expeditiously. Whilst I am entirely satisfied, from the evidence produced to me, that the Revenue Commissioners have been dealing with this difficult question in a most reasonable and humane spirit &mdash;that is my sincere conviction and it is the conviction upon which I am going to act in future&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I have come to the conclusion that it is desirable that some special concession should be made to make it easier for taxpayers who have not yet done so to put themselves right with the Revenue in respect of past liabilities not brought into assessment, so that the community may have the use of their money in industry.</P>
      <P>I propose, therefore, on the one hand to make a substantial concession to induce the taxpayers concerned to come forward and effect settlement, and, on the other hand, to tighten up the law so as to enable us to deal effectively with taxpayers who refuse to take advantage of my offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concession will be as follows: Any taxpayer on intimating to the Revenue Commissioners that he desires to avail himself of the benefit of the <Col N="1516" /> announcement which I am now making will be supplied with a form of undertaking. This form must be completed and sent to the Revenue Commissioners not later than the 15th August, 1932. On it the taxpayer will undertake to furnish to the Revenue Commissioners by the 31st December, 1932 (or such later date as they may allow), such accounts and information as they consider necessary to enable them to compute correctly the total amount of all duties underpaid, and, where the Commissioners consider such a course necessary, to have the accounts certified by an accountant approved by them.  When this undertaking has been satisfactorily carried out, the Revenue Commissioners will accept in full settlement (subject to a minimum which I will explain in a moment) a sum not exceeding seventy-five per cent. of the total of all duties (Income Tax, Super Tax or Sur-Tax, and Excess Profits Duty), underpaid from 1914 (inclusive) to date.  There will be no further penalties, and no interest will be charged.  Prompt payment will be required, but any case in which the taxpayer's present circumstances are such that he cannot pay the full amount so computed without grave hardship will receive special consideration.  The concession will be extended to cases at present under review in the Revenue Department, in which the Revenue Commissioners have not yet formally notified to the taxpayer or his agent the amount which they are willing to accept in settlement. The minimum duty payable will be the income tax (and sur-tax or super-tax, if any) for which assessments can now be made (i.e., for six years in addition to the current year), together with any such taxes properly payable in respect of assessments already made.</P>
    <P>In order to facilitate the bringing to book of taxpayers who refuse to take advantage of this concession, I propose to amend the Finance Act of 1926 by repealing the provisions in that Act which limit to cases of apparent fraud or wilful neglect the Commissioners' powers to make Excess Profits Duty assessments.</P>
    <P>I intend also to have explored the question of the adequacy and effectiveness <Col N="1517" /> of the present provisions relating to income tax penalties, especially the penalties for making declarations which the taxpayer knows to be false, with intent to defraud the Revenue. In another country recently, a judge, when sentencing to three years' penal servitude a prisoner who had pleaded guilty to making false income tax and super-tax returns from 1921 to 1929, made the following observations: &ldquo;You have pleaded guilty to a series of crimes which showed that, for many years, you have been deliberately robbing your fellow citizens. Every time you took a sovereign from the Commissioners of Inland Revenue you were not robbing them, you were robbing the taxpayers of this country.&rdquo;  I consider that to be a perfectly correct statement of the effect of income tax frauds, and I intend to explore every method by which the law can be tightened up, so as to secure the punishment, if necessary by imprisonment, of taxpayers who in the future offend in this respect.  In such a matter, the protection of honest taxpayers from the fraudulent practices of dishonest ones is clearly the duty of the legislature.  I hope that the net result of this concession will mean that over and above the sums which will be collected in the ordinary way by the Revenue Commissioners the Exchequer will receive an additional £350,000 in the present year.</P>
    <P>The special concession in respect of income tax, super-tax or sur-tax and excess profits duty underpaid since 1924 will produce about £350,000, and will enable me to close the emergency Budget with a surplus of £62,885. There, so far as the Budget is concerned, our work is done.</P>
    <P>I should like, however, to advert for a moment to the question of housing, and to indicate the Government's policy in that regard.  According to most recent estimates there is a real shortage of not less than 50,000 houses in the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>As a first step, towards the solution of this problem, we propose to make available for local authorities, immediately the proposals of the Minister <Col N="1518" /> for Local Government and Public Health are formulated, up to £5,000,000 which will be advanced to them at such a rate as will enable for example, houses, the economic rent of which, under present circumstances, would be 8/- per week, to be let at half that figure.  We have provided in the Estimates for Central Fund Services a sum of £150,000, to cover the interest and sinking fund charges on that sum of £5,000,000 for the current year.</P>
    <P>Before I close I should like also to refer to the prospects for next year. In order to balance the Budget, the Government intends, as I have indicated, to ask those who are engaged in the public service, particularly in the higher ranks, to make certain sacrifices, because under present circumstances this is the first and most obvious economy which can be made. A sacrifice of this nature, however, should not be confined merely to those who are directly engaged in the service of the Government, or paid out of the Central Fund.  The Government has made itself responsible for a large part of the expenditure of local authorities, and contributes very large sums to maintain their institutions and organisations.  It is only just that their more highly paid servants should also make some special contribution in the present financial circumstances. We hope that this will be done voluntarily, but we feel that it must be done in any event.  It should result in a substantial saving to the Government, and to the local ratepayer.</P>
    <P>Apart from these first and most obvious economies, however, we feel that the time has come when, as I have already indicated, an examination should be made into the whole question of the present administrative machinery in all State services and Departments.  The Civil Service here was taken over from the British.  Its procedure has been built up through the centuries.  It is felt that it still contains many survivals that are in some respects too cumbersome for modern requirements, and in other respects unnecessary.  This is no fault of the Civil Service.  It is hard particularly for zealous and conscientious <Col N="1519" /> civil servants to break with tradition. If fresh minds, with the outlook of the business man and taxpayer, were allowed to examine the existing system, we feel that many useful changes would be suggested therein, not merely in relation to office routine but in relation also to such problems as office accommodation, etc.  It is significant that when the British Government were anxious to secure savings and economies under these heads, they employed for the purpose not individuals who were associated with the Civil Service, but men of the highest standing and reputation in the business world.  We hope to enlist the services of such people, and as a result of their activities to make real economies, and next year to afford substantial relief to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that in the opening part of my speech I enumerated the Land Annuities, Local Loans Annuity and Royal Irish Constabulary Pensions among the items which should not be lost sight of in any review of our financial position.  In respect of them we pay to Great Britain a sum of £4,799,000 per annum.  It is clear that the continued payment of this sum is a burden which is far beyond the capacity of our people.  As the Dáil knows, the whole question of this continuance is being reopened.  The Government, because it feels that the issue is now one of life or death for the country, is determined to maintain our rights in that regard.  In this connection it has a right to ask, and a right to expect, that every section of opinion here and outside will be behind it in the action it is taking.  If it succeeds, and with the united support of the people there is every reason to believe that it will succeed, our Budgetary position next year will be an easy one.  We shall then be in a position to remit altogether the £1,126,000 which we have had to find for repayment to the British Government in respect of the Royal Irish Constabulary Pensions. We shall be able also to relieve the Central Fund to the extent of £1,000,000 in respect of the Supplementary Agricultural Grant which was made last year, and which we have <Col N="1520" /> again increased this year, and which, so long as it is voted, must be provided for out of taxation.  Not only should we relieve the Exchequer of these heavy burdens, but we should also be in a position to utilise the larger part of the balance of the annuities for the development of agriculture and the relief of our rural population.</P>
    <P>It will be noted, furthermore, that in the present year, in order to relieve the extreme distress which everywhere prevails, we have been compelled to provide £580,000, either as free grants, or as grants-in-aid, to accelerate the execution of works which would create employment.  We hope next year to reap the full fruits of the Government's policy both in regard to industrial development, and in regard to housing, and thereby to have secured a solution for the unemployment problem.  There is every reason to expect that this hope will be fulfilled.  For we have taken special steps to set free additional capital for our enterprises, and to make Irish industrial enterprises more attractive to Irish manufacturers.  We shall then be in the position that it will not be necessary to provide any further grants of this kind.  We shall have set the wheels of industry going, broken the fallow field with the plough, and provided, for those who are to-day hungry and hopeless, the opportunity of earning their bread in their own land.</P>
    <P>The country is on the eve of a great change, and great changes cannot be brought about without great sacrifices. We are waging a war on hunger and unemployment, and the prize of victory is a happy and contented people.  We are asking the community to give much in order that the future may be better and happier than the past has been. But what we are asking for now, in this year of crisis and difficulty, we confidently believe will be returned to them a hundredfold in the years to come, when the fields of Ireland again provide bread for its people, and when in every town and hamlet throughout the land there will be a busy and prosperous industry, and happy homes.</P>

      <P>(2)  That sur-tax for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1932, shall be charged in respect of the income of any individual the total of which from all sources exceeds one thousand five hundred pounds, and shall be so charged at the same rates as those at which it is charged for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1931.</P>
      <P>(3)  That the several statutory and other provisions which were in force during the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1931, in relation to income tax and sur-tax shall, subject to the provisions of this Resolution in relation to sur-tax, have effect in relation to the income tax and sur-tax to be charged as aforesaid for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1932.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose this evening to discuss at any length the statement which the Minister for Finance has laid before the House.  As he has pointed out, it is necessary that the numerous Resolutions which are submitted to us should be passed before 10 o'clock to-night, and it has been usual for the House to pass the Resolutions submitted in the Budget irrespective of the view and of the action it might take later on the Report Stage.  It is impossible to discuss <Col N="1522" /> the Budget statement as a whole without having time for consideration of it, and without discussion of the Budget statement, as a whole, it is somewhat useless to occupy the time of the House in discussion of individual Resolutions on the First Stage.  I do not propose to offer to the House more than one or two remarks about the statement which the Minister for Finance has just read.  If I were speaking solely in my capacity as a member of Cumann na nGaedheal, and if I were viewing matters solely from a Cumann na nGaedheal partisan point of view, I could heartily congratulate the Minister for Finance on his Budget.  Taking a wider view than that, I think it is impossible to avoid deploring the decisions which the Minister for Finance and the Government have taken.  We were told before the election, in advertisements issued by the Fianna Fáil Party, that they would save £2,000,000 per annum on administration and that that was altogether irrespective of savings they were going to effect by reopening agreements with Great Britain.  It was indicated that as a result of that policy there would be very great reductions in the burdens on the people.  It is evident from this Budget that there are not to be reductions in the burdens on the people, and that in this time of difficulty there is not to be any real seeking after economy or savings.  The Government in power at the moment, cannot any more than the Government which has gone out, be blamed for the fact that, as a result of world conditions, the yield of many taxes has gone down.  The price of our products has gone down, and the reduction in the price of our products has meant that less money was in circulation.  That has tended to reduce the yield of taxation.  The reduction in income from incomes outside has caused the yield of taxation to come down.  The Government, when faced with that reduction of national resources, has not sought, and apparently is not going to seek, to reduce expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Budget speech reveals that the cross-roads mind is still strong amongst the Fianna Fáil Party.  We had in the first part of the Budget a <Col N="1523" /> great deal of that cross-roads attitude of mind, an attempt to deal out Party propaganda by misrepresentations of various kinds, which I need not go into at the moment, but which I will deal with at a later stage.  We have no attempt made to conserve resources and to enable the country to face all the economic difficulties before it. Actually we have new burdens proposed to be thrown upon the people. I do not say that there are not things in the Budget with which I agree.  I believe the making of the McKenna duties permanent is thoroughly justified. There are matters of greater importance than that with which I would agree, but the Budget as a whole seems to me to reveal that the month or two that the Fianna Fáil Party has been in office has not been sufficient to get out of their minds the irresponsibilities which grew up during the years when the cross-roads propaganda was the controlling factor in the consideration of every problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not enumerate, and we have not had time to consider, the forty-three new revenue tariffs which have been proposed.  We have not had any details of the cuts which it is intended to impose on the public service. I presume we will have them to-morrow. I do not know whether the Minister will, or can, circulate without delay a tabular statement showing the various changes proposed to be effected by the Budget or whether it would be possible to circulate in tabular form the proposals which he intends to take effect with regard to cuts of various kinds.</P>

It seems, however, that there are many provisions in the Budget which will lead to a great deal of administrative difficulty in the future and which will lead to hardships and injustices of various kinds.  I believe that, in other respects, the Minister is definitely taking the short view instead of the long view and has turned his mind away from the real methods of attaining economic prosperity.  The difficulties of the times, undoubtedly, made it impossible for the Minister to introduce a popular Budget, but they did not make it impossible for him to introduce a sounder Budget.</P>
