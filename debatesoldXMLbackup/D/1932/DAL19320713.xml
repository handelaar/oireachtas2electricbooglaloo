      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is he aware that what is now known as the Australian flag <Col N="764" /> was first raised at the Eureka Stockade by an Irishman named Peter Lalor when leading the miners in resisting British aggression, and as such should receive more respect from liberty-loving Irishmen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries what better arrangements he has in contemplation for the more efficient policing of our fishing grounds against the depredations of foreign trawlers and when he hopes to put these arrangements into effective commission; and if, pending such arrangements, he would endeavour by mutual agreement, with England and the Continental countries whose nationals fish off our coast, to extend the limit for trawlers of those countries from three to six miles from the nearest point of land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Ruttledge) Patrick J. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the more effective policing of the exclusive fishery limits of the Saorstát is still under examination.</P>
      <P>The subject of the extent of territorial jurisdiction at sea engaged the attention of an International Committee for the codification of International Laws recently, which failed, however, to reach an agreement on this point.  In the circumstances, I do not think that I could usefully at the present moment take the step suggested in the latter part of the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries whether the lands at Kilmorna, County Kerry, in the De Janasz Estate are vested in all the present occupiers, and if so, if there is a clause in their agreements to the effect that they cannot dispose of those lands until after the expiration of a certain number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The allotments made on the division of the untenanted lands on the De Janasz Estate at Kilmorna, County Kerry, have not yet been vested in the allottees.  In accordance with the usual practice of the Land Commission the purchase agreements signed by allottees prohibit them from disposing of their interest in their parcels before the lands are vested in them, without the consent of the Land Commission.  This reservation is specially necessary in cases where the parcel is given for enlargement of an <Col N="768" /> existing holding, so that the parcel may not be sold and the intention of the Land Commission defeated.  The majority of the allotments on this estate were for this purpose.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether at the instance of the Dairy Disposal Company, lorries were sent from Cork to Ardfert to transport butter from the creamery at Ardfert to Cork and if so, whether it is to be the policy henceforward of the Department to prefer road transport for butter to the detriment of railway transport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken) (for Minister for Agriculture)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Dairy Disposal Company that a much cheaper freight rate, including chilling facilities at the port, has been obtained by them in this case than could be obtained by rail transport from Ardfert.  I understand that repeated representations have been made by the Dairy Disposal Company to the Railway Companies on the subject of the high rates to London, but that no substantial concession has so far been granted.  The matter of choice of method of transport is one for the Dairy Disposal Company, with whose discretion, under the circumstances indicated, I do not feel in a position to interfere.  The question, therefore, of the policy of the Department of Agriculture does not arise.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the answer, I should like to ask the Minister if it is not the policy, as declared, of his Party to support the railway industry, and will they make representations to the Dairy Disposal Board to ensure that they will not <Col N="772" /> take steps in favour of road transport by bus as against the railway industry?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>In ordering the business, we have to arrive at a certain order for the convenience of Ministers as the Deputy well knows and, considering that, we have not been able to arrange that No. 3 would be taken in the sense it was suggested it might be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be clear that, while taking three Supplementary Estimates which were not mentioned, when <Col N="774" /> the business to be concluded before the adjournment was mentioned last week&mdash;we are prepared to take that extra business&mdash;but we do object to taking the extra business of which we had not notice, and, as well as that, allowing an arrangement to be made which will prevent us to-day from getting any adequate discussion on Estimate No. 52, which gives an opportunity of raising certain matters of urgent public importance.  If the President could make any arrangement whereby the Finance Bill would be rapidly disposed of so that we could reach the Supplementary Estimates, say, at 5 o'clock, that would be all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is difficult for the President or anybody else to make an arrangement.  The President will realise that there is a possibility that not only are we giving him extra business, of which we got no notice, but also giving up the right which we have now to discuss certain things.  In the circumstances, and seeing that facilities are being given the Government, they might do their best to see that we might get an opportunity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, as a matter of fact, did their best.  I have been trying for the last half-hour to get this thing arranged so that it could be done.  It cannot be done, and that is all I can say.  It cannot be done in the order in which it was on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the President explain why it was that this morning at 11 o'clock we were informed that the order of business was to be Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and that was subsequently upset at 1.30, when all arrangements had been made in connection with those with whom I am in touch to have the order of business in the other form, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will let me explain.  I got in touch with the Opposition office and stated that the order of business was as on the Order Paper.  I did not realise <Col N="775" /> that there was likely to be a major debate on the agricultural Estimate. When I found there was, I asked the Department concerned were they prepared to take that in the order indicated. They said no, but after the Finance Bill.  I immediately got in touch with the Opposition office but I understand most of the people concerned had gone away.  At the earliest moment after I found out what the position was, I got in touch with the Opposition office to let them know we were not taking the business in the order I had indicated already.  That is the explanation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask what is the Departmental business which is going to be so intricate on Estimate 52? As far as I know it is a matter of general policy that arises on Estimate 52.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the amendments to the Report Stage of the Finance Bill show promise that, with a certain amount of co-operation, the Report Stage could be dealt with inside two or three hours, might I ask that there should be no objection to taking Estimate 52 after that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>On that question, the Minister is prepared to take them in that order, that is after the Finance Bill amendments have been disposed of.  Of course we are near the end of the Session, but I think this whole question of the arrangements with the Opposition will have to be very carefully considered before we tie ourselves up again.  It is necessary for the Government, as provided in the Standing Orders, to have the arrangement of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only explanation which has been offered for the change in the order of business, which was first suggested by the Parliamentary Secretary having the control of business is that the Department are not ready to discuss departmentally items which may arise on Estimate 52. Taking Item 3 in its order, the Departmental items that arise in Estimate 52 could be dealt with easily on the Appropriation Bill.  It is not Departmental items that fall for consideration on Estimate 52, in the main.  It is a matter of general policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the general policy is more urgent to-day than it will be to-morrow&mdash;only for that reason.  That is the all-sufficient reason.  I still think it is possible to have that without the aid of the Department which has been introduced as the only explanation for the change.

      <P>We have no objection to this particular proposal. I presume the Minister knows that this had been agreed upon actually before the change of Government.  I can recommend it to the House.  I think when the scheme was originally introduced it was pointed out that every care was taken to see that every legitimate case would be covered and that in itself occasioned a certain amount of delay in producing the scheme.  We thought we had covered every case of that kind, but as a result of the experience of a couple of years it was found there were numbers of cases in which there were genuine teachers involved who should come under the pension rule but they were ruled out by the exact letter of the rule.  For that purpose it was proposed to change the rule along the lines upon which it has now been changed, namely, altering the period of years and bringing in the other qualifications about two-thirds. I think that will meet a number of Deputies who are still in the House and who brought forward cases for the consideration of the last <Col N="780" /> Minister for Education and the present Minister.  I am sure the cases they mentioned will be met or practically met by the present rules.</P>

He was endeavouring under this particular scheme to have his service as an official of the Association counted as secondary school teaching.  I think that case has been met under the altered rules. Perhaps the Minister will indicate whether it can be met under the new rules that are now being submitted?</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister will indicate whether there are any other points, besides the two referred to by Deputy O'Sullivan, which are covered in the new scheme? What is the Government's policy with regard to teachers who obtain a superannuation allowance?  Of course it is obvious they cease to be recognised teachers except in so far as a superannuation allowance is concerned; but do the Government take cognisance of whether or not they obtain employment of any kind after they become entitled to superannuation?  Are they free agents in that matter?  I would like the Minister to give me an answer on that question.  It is difficult to determine the course of the new regulations without some explanation. Will the Minister say whether the two points mentioned by Deputy O'Sullivan are the only points covered in the new scheme?</P>

      <P>In page 6, Section 6 (1), after line 25 to insert the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Premises shall not be deemed to be occupied for the purposes of any trade, profession, or vocation within the meaning of this rule where the premises are mainly occupied for residential purposes and no part thereof is occupied for the purposes of trade but a part thereof is occupied for the purposes of a profession or vocation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to meet some of the points raised by Deputy Thrift and also by Deputy McGilligan. I think in the section as originally drafted they raised the objection that residential premises used by a doctor would become chargeable under Schedule D.  I think Deputy Thrift has seen the amendment and I believe he will agree with me that, in so far as we can do it, it meets his point.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="782" /> This amendment is a drafting amendment. I think in the Schedule in Item 14 the percentage preferential rate of duty is less than two-thirds of the full rate and accordingly this amendment is necessary.</P>

      <P>This amendment is designed to some extent to meet the case raised by Deputy Thrift in regard to small private films.  These films are not suitable for exhibition in ordinary cinema theatres.  It appears that a machine has been developed for use principally in educational institutions and also by salesmen and others for the purpose of displaying their wares.  A narrow film with a sound strip attached is used in these machines and it would be obviously unfair to make a full charge in the case of these machines which are not designed primarily for entertainment purposes; it would be unfair to charge them the full rate of duty.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Lynch, I beg to move amendment 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Amendment to amendment 3.</P>
      <P>In the proposed amendment 3 to insert after paragraph (c) a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d)  owned at the date of the passing of this Act by a company whose shares or stocks are quoted on any Stock Exchange in Saorstát Eireann and has established a share register in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="785" /> The amendment sets out that under this new proposed section companies should come in whose shares or stocks are quoted on any Stock Exchange in Saorstát Eireann and who have established a share register in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>That enables the companies to have quotations on the Stock Exchange, which, of course, makes the stamp duty on transfers here come to the Exchequer of this State, and if they have a register in the Saorstát then the death duties will come into the State on the death of persons who are shareholders in the company here. Therefore, these particular companies who would come under the section are companies whose existence here is of advantage and benefit to this State. In addition to that I put it&mdash;and I want to put it very shortly because this matter has been threshed out in previous discussions here and I do not wish to say very much more upon the matter&mdash;that it is taking away the preference which is being given to one set of manufacturers at the expense of another set; that certain persons or companies came into this State and set up business in this State; and that those persons are behaving as ideal employers.  It is unfair now that after they have been established here for years, after they have built up their factory and everything else here, it is unfair to start discriminating against them in favour of any other person and I may add too that the company in question is a company in which there is an enormous quantity of Irish-owned capital involved.</P>

We could not do that for one reason&mdash;which may possibly lead to a repetition of the previous speeches in this House&mdash;which I venture to make again and that is that it would cost the Exchequer at least £160,000.</P>

      <P>The Minister in moving No. 3 suggested he was moving that amendment to meet certain representations made by Deputy Norton. As I understand it, the Minister's amendment No. 3 means that those firms at the present moment who are licensed manufacturers of tobacco and who are not Irish companies within the terms of his amendment, and perhaps within the terms of the Control of Manufactures Bill, ought to be deprived of a particular preference but that as soon as the taxation that is here or the restrictions in connection with the Control of Manufactures Bill operate sufficiently heavily on them to make them form themselves into Irish companies, they must get a rebate of the 7d.  Now the particular tobacco manufacturers whose case was specially mentioned here and on which this question originally arose, made, I think, representations to the Minister that they were only waiting until following <Col N="787" /> the very great expenditure of money on their part here in the setting up of their firm and following on the necessary loss that would fall on the first three years of their working &mdash;they would settle down and establish themselves and turn themselves into an Irish company here &mdash;to turn into an Irish company this company that has satisfactorily carried on its business under the laws of the country up to the present and has given a considerable amount of employment here both in the setting up of the new factory and its working. This company has told the Minister that it is anxious at the earliest possible opportunity to become an Irish company.  If it takes it four, five or six months and carried its intentions in that way and becomes an Irish company, the Minister is going deliberately, and I suggest, unnecessarily, to deprive it of the rebate as between the 12th of May, the date of the coming into effect of this taxation and the date on which it becomes an Irish company.  I submit that that company is in a bona fide way going to carry out the intentions which they have and I suggest that the company should not be mulcted for this particular taxation, for four, five or six months that must necessarily elapse before the coming into effect of additional taxation and the time by which they are able to carry out their intentions.</P>

      <P>The Deputy possibly has a poorer sense of the significance of words than I have.  By his own showing here he has a very much poorer sense of the use of words and he can very easily see that things are not identical and that there is no analogy between them at all.  Here is a case where a person is not entitled to any particular privileges.  Possibly in eleven months' time he converts himself into an Irish company and he is entitled to reap, under this amendment, all the benefits and advantages which he would have had if he had been an Irish company during the preceding eleven months.  I think the Deputy himself will see why no Government could accept a proposition like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position we have then is this, that when an Irish company, coming back in changed circumstances here from Belfast and establishing itself here three or four years ago at a time when building costs were very high and spending £250,000 in establishing a sound tobacco factory here and giving a very big and considerable amount of employment, finds itself after three years working just as they anticipated, beginning to have their business properly established and to be making a profit.  On the eve of being able to put their shares into the market in such a way as to secure that their company would be an Irish company, they find themselves, on 12th May last, faced with a completely new policy of discrimination.  That discrimination as regards certain types of companies in contrast with others was enshrined in this Finance Bill and subsequently enshrined in the Control of Manufactures Bill.  The Minister has brought in an amendment to his Finance Bill so that any company <Col N="789" /> which is a non-Irish company, on becoming an Irish company, or any new company establishing itself as an Irish company, will get this rebate.  This company is going to be caught in the discrimination contained in this Finance Bill.  It is going to be forced to sell itself at a time when there is an unnecessary deduction from its capital arising out of the discrimination involved here.  That is all I want to say on the matter.  The Minister suggests that this is Deputy Norton's contribution to the saving of Gallaher's. After the Labour Party's performance on the Housing Bill last night, I am prepared to believe it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And in view, further, of the latitude that I am going to take.  There is an amendment on the Paper which provides that any licensed manufacturer of tobacco who was on 1st April, 1932, and has been continuously since a licensed manufacturer of tobacco but who, at the date of the passing of the Act, would not be entitled to receive the rebate &ldquo;shall nevertheless be entitled to receive such rebate as from 12th day of May, 1932, provided that within twelve months after the passing of this Act such licensed manufacturer becomes qualified to receive the rebate ....&rdquo; Might I ask in connection with this, does the whole question of rebate operate within the financial year?  I assume it does.  Might I ask what is to prevent Deputy Mulcahy's amendment <Col N="790" /> taking effect under the terms of the Minister's amendment which we have just carried&mdash;Amendment 3? Supposing Gallaher's do transform themselves into an Irish company, taking lettered paragraph (c) in the Minister's own amendment, we are told that &ldquo;the person licensed to carry on such business shall be entitled to receive a rebate of sevenpence in respect of every pound of unmanufactured tobacco received by such person upon which the duty imposed by this section has been paid.&rdquo;  Supposing Gallaher's transform themselves into an Irish company within the twelve months, will they not be entitled to demand a rebate, because the tobacco referred to is clearly tobacco upon which the tax imposed by the section has been paid?  Are there any limiting words which prevent a rebate being claimed at any time within the financial year?  I think it is necessary to know that before we can discuss the other amendments.</P>

      <P>It is a question of getting the reason why, because on the answer to the question will depend the argument that is to proceed on amendment No. 5.  May I again put the point? A company is in existence at this moment.  It might transfer its ownership without ceasing to be the same company.  If it becomes a company beneficially owned in the Saorstát and if it has inside the financial year paid duty at the full rate, is it not entitled to a rebate under the terms of the Minister's amendment, which I shall read: &ldquo;The person licensed to carry on such business shall be entitled to receive a rebate of sevenpence in respect of every pound of unmanufactured tobacco received by such person upon which the duty imposed by this section has been paid&rdquo;?

      <P>The Deputy can get an answer to that elsewhere.  I thought the debate on amendment No. <Col N="792" /> 5 had been concluded.  However, I think I ought to point out to the Deputy the definition of the expression &ldquo;Irish owned company&rdquo; which is contained at the bottom of the amendment. &ldquo;The expression &lsquo;Irish-owned company&rsquo; means a company of which the majority of the shareholders are Irish-born residents holding between them shares which, in the aggregate, are more than one-half in nominal value of the issued share capital of such company and carry at ordinary general meetings of such company more than one-half of the total voting-power of all shares in such company carrying votes at such meetings.&rdquo; I think the Deputy himself has missed the point.</P>

      <P>In page 18, before Section 23 (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  The duty imposed by this section shall not be charged or levied on any articles which are shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to consist only of frozen boneless veal produced <Col N="798" /> in a country within the British Commonwealth of Nations and consigned from that or any other such country and imported solely for use for manufacturing purposes in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is introduced to facilitate an existing Saorstát industry for the manufacture of meat paste. The products of this industry are mainly exported, so that even if this provision were not made, a drawback would be payable as regards the part which would be imported.  The duty-free admission is a much simpler and much more satisfactory procedure from the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners and the manufacturers.</P>

Supposing the people engaged in this meat-paste industry want to go into some other form of the meat-paste business, for which they will have to get raw material from outside, would it not be the proper thing to leave in some general word instead of the particular frozen boneless veal, say &ldquo;meat&rdquo; simply, or &ldquo;meat or animal products produced in a country within the British Commonwealth of Nations&rdquo;? The whole thing is covered by the later phrase &ldquo;imported solely for use for manufacturing purposes in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  I think that guards everything that the Minister may want.</P>

      <P>When I heard Deputy McGilligan get up and say that he desired to leave out the word &ldquo;live,&rdquo; I certainly thought I had discovered in his incisive personality a soft spot.  I discovered subsequently that I had not and I think it is rather regrettable &mdash;if the Deputy does not say it, I will&mdash; that the Irish Treasury should have made a special exception in favour of <Col N="800" /> the cruellest and most savage sport practised in this country.  I can well understand that the dog men will become eloquent.  Maybe I have started a debate that will go on for I do not know how long.  I cannot, however, let this occasion pass without saying that coursing in many parts of this country is nothing better than savagery.  The men who engage in it will not advert to that aspect of it; the gentlemen who hunt foxes will not advert to that aspect of it.  To see unfortunate hares let loose one after another in order to be torn to pieces by hounds, and all for the edification of onlookers, is to me a most disgusting business.  If the coursing of dogs has to be carried on, greyhound racing is the better of a very undesirable pair.  For a different reason from that mentioned by Deputy McGilligan I wish that the word &ldquo;live&rdquo; would be removed from this resolution.</P>

      <P>I quite agree with the statements made by Deputy Dillon regarding park coursing.  It is most cruel and I appeal to the Minister to take out the word &ldquo;live.&rdquo;  We have in this country the electric hare and I think that the people who attend those places are as well entitled to do so as those who attend the park coursing meetings.  As Deputy Dillon said, park coursing is absolute cruelty.  I dare say in the open coursing it may be good and fair sport, but, in the case of park coursing, it is downright slaughter.  I appeal to the Minister to take out the word &ldquo;live.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The hare that does not escape is killed and a good many animals do not get as decent a death as that.  I am quite certain that the hares get a fair hunt.  I am sure that at least 75 per cent. of the hares escape at the majority of park coursing meetings.  At the Waterloo Cup and at other places the hares get as good a chance as any other animals get.</P>

      <P>I would like to add my voice to the appeal made to the Minister to exempt the word &ldquo;live.&rdquo; In the country districts, while they are not able to rise to such a luxury, if I may so call it, as an electric hare, they nevertheless have mechanical means of carrying on greyhound racing.  They adopt a much simpler method when they cannot avail of an electric hare. I must say that this affords a very considerable amount of amusement in country districts and it eliminates the effects alluded to by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Curran.  Of course everybody is entitled to his own opinion on this matter.  Deputy Dillon and Deputy Curran are entitled to have their views with regard to the cruelty or otherwise of coursing.  I certainly think that if the House agrees to Deputy McGilligan's suggestion, it will eliminate any effects of the sort described.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will remember that the case made out for the original amendment was in connection with the training and export of greyhounds.  I am sure if he thinks over it he will realise that the amendment he now offers goes only a very small way to meet that particular case.  The case was strong before, but I am sure that the Minister will now realise that, with the extra 20 per cent. that is being put on live animals of this kind exported to England, the case is still stronger than it was when the Minister promised to meet the arguments put up from these benches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Let us put the amendment on a proper footing.  The whole purpose of the section is to procure revenue.  I am satisfied, so far as greyhound coursing is concerned&mdash; and I am not considering any other aspect of it except the revenue producing aspect&mdash;that there is going to be no revenue derived from it and the attempt to collect revenue is only going to cause most unprofitable labour for the officers of the Revenue Commissioners.  For that reason I am exempting coursing primarily, but the situation is quite different in regard to greyhound racing.  I know the attendance at meetings at which mechanical hares are used is substantial.  I know that the profits of the greyhound racing companies have been very large indeed.  Therefore, I say that this is an entertainment which can be made to yield something to the Exchequer. For that reason I am giving the House the option of either accepting the amendment as it stands or consenting to its withdrawal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>A peculiar situation has arisen here.  There was an amendment moved the other day by Deputy Lynch from the front Opposition Bench.  I rather approved of that amendment and was prepared to support it, but I understood that the amendment was being withdrawn by the Opposition on an undertaking given by the Minister for Finance that he would introduce the amendment which he has now introduced. Why are the Deputies opposite now objecting to this amendment? Why did they not press their amendment the other day?  Why did they agree two or three days ago to have an amendment of this kind introduced? Why are they so anxious now to go back on their attitude of the other day?  I was somewhat sorry the other day that Deputy Lynch did not press his amendment because I was particularly anxious that the tax on greyhound racing should be taken off. I thought it would be in the best interests of those people who breed greyhounds for sale.  I thought it would be a little advantage to them and to that trade that the tax should be on the coursing meetings.  For that reason I am satisfied with this amendment.  I understand the Minister for Finance could not give way on the whole lot. The attitude of the Opposition now rather puzzles me.</P>
      <P>With regard to the remarks of Deputy O'Sullivan, I cannot say that there is the same amount of jubilation on this side of the House or in the country at the idea of the British imposing a 20 per cent. tax on Irish cattle and Irish produce as appears to exist amongst the Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies in this House.</P>

I think he should look upon the matter from a different standpoint. We here think that the matter should be looked upon from a different standpoint than that of the people on the opposite benches I was going to appeal to the Minister now to extend his generosity to greyhound racing tracks seeing that this greyhound racing enhances the price of greyhounds, but the Deputy says there is no use now in doing that at this stage.

      <P>Deputy Cleary might have his memory refreshed if I read what he said on this matter on a previous discussion here.  Speaking on the 8th July, column 563-564 of the Official Debates, the Deputy said: &ldquo;My impression is that coursing is of very little use to people who sell greyhounds and gain by the selling of them. Coursing as I know it, is only a sport&mdash;<Col N="805" /> a very expensive sport to those who engage in it.  In my county, it is usually a sport for people who can afford to spend money on it.  It is track racing that makes whatever market there is for greyhounds.  Since greyhound track racing came into prominence the value of our export trade in greyhounds has increased.  Were it not for that greyhound breeding as a profitable proposition would not be worth while.&rdquo; The Deputy now goes back on his advocacy of the freedom of the greyhound racing track from taxation.</P>

      <P>Greyhound coursing in the country brings out the best qualities in the dogs and it brings forward the best dogs for the coursing track.  That is very necessary from the point of view of the export of dogs for greyhound racing.  Deputy Mulcahy has pointed out that the export of greyhounds is dead.  The importers of greyhounds on the other side will pay the tariff.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 10a.</P>
      <P>On page 19, Section 25, to delete lines 41 and 42 and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Duty calculated in accordance with the following provisions, that is to say,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>(a)  where the premises to which such licence applies are of a residential character and no part thereof is used as a factory or a shop and the sale of tobacco or snuff on such premises under such licence is effected solely by means of one and only one automatic machine or other mechanical contrivance, such excise duty shall (subject to the limitation hereinafter mentioned) be of an amount equal to one-half of the 1 per cent., of the amount by which the poor law valuation of such premises exceeds £10;</P>
      <P>(b)  In every other case, such excise duty shall (subject to the limitation hereinafter mentioned) be of an amount equal to 1 per cent., of the amount by which the poor law valuation of such premises exceeds £10;</P>
      <P>(c)  The total amount of the excise duty now payable and the additional excise duty imposed by this section chargeable in respect of any one such licence shall not exceed £10.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (a) of this amendment is designed to meet, in part, the amendment put down by Deputy Wolfe, completely exempting automatic machines from duty, to the extent that they will be only charged, so far as the valuation of the premises in which they are situate exceeds £10, at the rate of ½ per cent. of such excess.  Paragraph (b) of the amendment is in fulfilment of the undertaking which I gave Deputy Mulcahy that, if he would withdraw his amendment on Committee Stage, I would accept the principle but increase the limit of duty from £5 to £10.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 10b.</P>
      <P>In page 20, before Section 26 (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Where two or more individuals carry on business as moneylenders in partnership and such individuals take out moneylenders' licences in respect of the premises or all the premises in which they so carry on business in partnership, the Revenue Commissioners shall remit or, if the duty has been paid, repay to such partnership&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  where such business is so carried on in one premises only, a sum equal to the total duty on all except one of the moneylender's licences as taken out by such individuals in respect of such premises, or</P>
      <P>(b)  where such business is so carried on in two or more premises a sum equal to the total duty on all moneylender's licences so taken out by such individuals in respect of any such premises in excess of one such licence for each such premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment has become necessary because the relevant clauses of the Moneylenders Bill of 1932 are not <Col N="811" /> identical with the clauses in the Moneylenders Bill of 1929 upon which the original section was based.  The amendment will grant the concessions to partners in so far as it limits the duty to what it would have been in the case of a single individual.

      <P>This amendment to Section 29 is designed to cover the case of a licence taken out after the 1st of July, 1932, but before the passing of the Finance Act.  The case was not covered by the section as originally drafted.</P>

      <P>Amendments 12 and 13, I think, should be considered together, as they are more or less in the nature of drafting amendments.  It is proposed to permit the refund to take the form of a credit on payment under the new licence.  Power is, in fact, taken, under the regulations to be made under this section, to repay by way of credit but it is not usual to provide for credit in specific terms in the Act.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 17:</P>
      <P>In page 27, Section 47, line 57, after the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;not being a member of the Oireachtas of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a most amazing section.  The purpose of the section is to allow the Revenue Commissioners to remit all interest payable in respect of a certain year and to grant such remission of such duty as is considered just.  The terms of instructions to the Revenue Commissioners are, that, where they are satisfied that a person who is liable to Excess Profits Duty (a) has voluntarily furnished to the Revenue Commissioners all such information in his possession or procurement as is requisite for the due computation of the amount of such duty&mdash;which, incidentally, he is bound to do &mdash; or (b) if he is in such financial circumstances that he cannot without undue hardship pay the whole amount of such duty or (c) has so furnished such information and is in such financial circumstances, then, the remission may take place.  It is to be noticed that the first condition on which the Revenue Commissioners may remit is if a man does what he is bound to do, and the second condition &mdash; and it is not a junction but an alternative &mdash; if he is in such a financial condition, whether he furnishes the information or not, the Revenue Commissioners may make certain remissions.  I propose to put in, after the word &ldquo;person,&rdquo; the <Col N="815" /> words &ldquo;not being a member of the Oireachtas of Saorstát Eireann,&rdquo; so that the section will read: &ldquo;Where the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that a person, not being a member of the Oireachtas of Saorstát Eireann, has done these two things, etc.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do that for this reason, that it seems to me that when we are making this peculiar remission of duty, we should not allow it to be said outside that members of the Oireachtas are looking for something in the way of remission, where that remission is really founded, in the main, or going to be founded upon their doing something, which, in fact, they were bound to do. Notwithstanding the opinion that may be held, inside the House, of members of the House, there are people outside who have expressed the view that this is specially designed for the safe-guarding of individuals, being members of the Oireachtas, who are put in conjunction with people who occupy Government posts, and who are close to them and who have got this particular remission to allow them to escape certain taxation which ought to be imposed on them.  Whether that is right or wrong, and I do not believe it is right, I think that we should have a standard set, at any rate, for members of the Oireachtas, that they are not going to claim these peculiar remissions. If a man is elected here to do his duty as a public man, that ought to include his doing his duty as a private citizen in the matter of taxation, because a man's public duties rest to a great extent upon such matters as taxation and the imposition of taxation. We should not allow it to go forth that a member of the Oireachtas can gain a remission of taxation because, after the event, and after he has voted for something of this sort, he can do something which he was bound to do before, and so obtain a remission of taxation which had been justly and equitably assessed upon him. I move the amendment.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand the rather peculiar reasons that have been given for moving this amendment. Deputy McGilligan has advanced arguments in support of the amendment which he has moved which he himself admits are untenable and without foundation.  He asks the House to accept the amendment for reasons which he thinks cannot be substantiated. Quite obviously, this is a concession given, as I pointed out in the Budget speech, to the general body of taxpayers, and as members of the Dáil do not enjoy any benefit or advantage which the general body of taxpayers do not have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; I do not see why they should be excluded from this concession.  I give the House the fullest assurance that there will be no interference by the Government with the discretion of the Revenue Commissioners in administering this section. I think that members of the Opposition must accept this, that we will not interfere any more than they did with the Revenue Commissioners in their administration of the Revenue law, and if that were not a sufficient assurance to the House that no undue pressure will be brought upon the Revenue Commissioners to give any concession under this section to which people are not properly entitled, I would remind them that all settlements made by the Revenue Commissioners under it will be subject to review and examination by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  If he notes any irregularity in the administration of this section, or considers any concession given by the Revenue Commissioners under it not to have been warranted, he will draw attention to that in his report, and the Public Accounts Committee will have an opportunity of considering that and of subsequently <Col N="817" /> reporting to the House on it. Therefore, I think the section as it stands is fully safeguarded against abuse and that there is no justification for the amendment proposed by Deputy McGilligan.</P>

      <P>As I explained in the Budget speech, it was originally my intention to approach this matter in another way.  When some information of this kind reached the Associated Hospitals Sweepstakes Committee, or, at least, the members of the Executive Committee of that Committee, I received a deputation and discussed the matter with them and they expressed the view to me very strongly that the course which I proposed to take, was in their view undesirable, and they submitted to me an alternative proposition <Col N="819" /> which after prolonged discussion I agreed to accept as the basis of the new tax provided that they would put the matter to me in writing.  In consequence of that I received this letter, dated 9th May:</P>
      <P>Dear Sir,</P>
      <P>In view of the declaration by the Minister for Finance not to tax the gross receipts obtained from the Hospitals Sweepstakes, the Executive Committee of the General Committee of the participating hospitals hereby agrees to the ordinary income-tax being levied on the total amount allocated to the hospitals (i.e., 25 per cent. of the gross receipts as ascertained under the Act).</P>
      <P>This is the paragraph which answers Deputy McGilligan's points:</P>
      <P>The Committee further agrees that the income-tax should be levied on the amount received from the Grand National Sweepstake of 1932, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Finance Act of 1931.</P>
      <P>The Committee pointed out that in their opinion a larger amount should be allocated to the voluntary hospitals and that 33? per cent. was too much for County Homes and Nursing Institutions.</P>
      <P>The Minister on his part undertook to recommend an inquiry into the present allotment of 33? per cent. assigned to the County Homes.</P>

We have the Minister giving his own reason for going back to the Grand National, outside the financial year.  It is almost tantamount to going up to a person and saying to him: &ldquo;Pay me so much or I will blow out your brains,&rdquo; and he writes back saying: &ldquo;I will pay you so much.&rdquo;  It does not answer the question: Why are they paying?  to say &ldquo;They will pay.&rdquo;  You have to get the previous threat.</P>

      <P>That remark would almost always apply, I suppose, to what Deputy Corry says.  The Minister has not explained why he must get from the hospitals a certain amount of money which necessitates going beyond the financial year.  He has not explained it now.  He did <Col N="821" /> explain it before.  He is a purist in finance, but he is going to go outside the financial year.  He is building up Budgets in the normal way, but yet he is going to rob the hospitals.  He complained to-day of an amendment which would give a rebate to people outside the period in which they would be entitled to receive it, but he can turn round and do exactly the opposite when it comes to the turn of the State.  The State, according to the Minister, can claim outside the financial year.  I merely wanted to get the Minister on record again with this brazen statement of his so that his doctor friend can again comment on it and other people can, later on, comment upon his attitude.  The robbing of the hospitals must be contrasted with the promised £2,000,000 remission in taxation.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 20:</P>
      <P>In page 29, Section 49 (1), line 21, to delete the words &ldquo;stamp duty&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;Public Charitable Hospitals Tax.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an important item.  The Minister, when he was introducing this whole business in his Budget speech, said:</P>
      <P>I have had to consider many proposals in this regard.  They were all rejected in favour of one which was submitted by the Emergency Committee of the Hospitals and which outshone all others in its attractive simplicity.</P>
      <P>We can now judge for ourselves as to the frankness and accuracy of this statement:</P>
      <P>They were all rejected in favour of one which was submitted by the Emergency Committee of the Hospitals and which outshone all others in its attractive simplicity.</P>
      <P>Here is the proposal:</P>
      <P>I propose to levy 25 per cent. on the hospitals' share of the proceeds of all sweepstakes drawn after the 1st March, 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The phrase was &ldquo;to levy 25 per cent. <Col N="822" /> on the hospitals' share of the proceeds.&rdquo; A few days afterwards the Minister produced a table explanatory of the Budget.  On the receipt side there appeared an item &ldquo;Income tax on hospitals' receipts from sweepstakes.&rdquo; The letter signed by Lord Powerscourt stated that the Committee was now willing to have the ordinary income tax levied.  Later on Deputy Sir James Craig raised the point as to whether this was income tax or not.  He saw a new phrase creeping into a Financial Resolution about stamp duty.  He was told the two things were very much the same. Later on I was told the Minister had not had the question of income tax discussed in relation to this matter at all.</P>
    <P>As will be seen in col. 1603 of the Parliamentary Debates, Deputy Sir James Craig asked a question in regard to this matter of stamp duty and he got the statement that the two things, income tax and stamp duty, were absolutely the same; there was no difference there.  &ldquo;One and the same tax&rdquo; was the Minister's statement. They may be both one and the same tax, but they are both equally wrong in their application to what is being done here.  I want to put the matter right.  I want to have this tax called what it really is, a Public Charitable Hospitals Tax.  Hence it is that in page 29 I am moving to omit the words &ldquo;stamp duty.&rdquo;  In connection with this phrase that has been used, how will the stamp duty be leviable if there is no stamp struck or affixed?  What is the necessity for the subterfuge about stamp duty when the Minister previously said it was to be a charge upon the proceeds?  He said afterwards that stamp duty and income tax are exactly the same.</P>

      <P>Sir J. Craig:... In the paper handed to us this afternoon under the heading of Emergency Budget Receipts there is an item of Income Tax from Hospitals Receipts from Sweepstakes.  I want to know is the Stamp Duty the same as the Income Tax.</P>
      <P>Mr. MacEntee: Yes.</P>
      <P>Apparently Deputy Sir James Craig was not satisfied with that.  He obviously knew what the Minister's &ldquo;yes&rdquo; might mean and the debate goes on:</P>
      <P>Sir J. Craig: There is no difference.</P>
      <P>Mr. MacEntee: No difference.  They are one and the same tax.</P>
      <P>That is the Minister's statement&mdash;&ldquo;They are one and the same tax.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If there is any point in that, let it be made.  I will come down to what the Minister said &mdash;&ldquo;They are one and the same tax.&rdquo; I say they are both equally wrong in their relation to this.  This should be called what it actually is, a Public Charitable Hospitals Tax.  Apparently the only reason the Minister will not put that in is because he does not want to have himself associated with a tax which has &ldquo;Public Charitable Hospitals&rdquo; attached to it.  He should get that monument to his memory, and I suggest it should be called a Public Charitable Hospitals Tax <Col N="824" /> because it is nothing else.  Why should the Minister be ashamed of it? He is actually raiding the hospitals, and some Deputies of his Party have declared that that is a grand thing. Some of them are even of the opinion that there is going to be more good got out of this than the hospitals themselves could do.  One Deputy, a supporter of the Minister's and of the Government's interests, said the hospitals did not spend any more money in work and did not give any more employment since they got the benefit of the Sweepstakes.  The matter is not of terrific importance, but it is of some importance.  The Minister himself did not know what the levy in proceeds meant as he said in the Budget speech when he described this tax as income tax or stamp tax.  In the explanatory statement issued afterwards, Lord Powers-court is quoted as saying that he would be agreeable to the ordinary income tax, and then the Minister said that income tax and stamp duty were one and the same tax.  Why should not the Minister call the thing what it is&mdash;a Public Charitable Hospitals Tax?</P>

      <P>I want just to say one or two words.  I was asked not to press my amendment and I consented <Col N="825" /> with very great reluctance indeed not to press it.  And now there is no use in my going into all the severe things that I intended to say and that I had hoped to say.  I will say this, however, that the Minister for Finance's name will go down to posterity as being the first man who is responsible for placing a tax on charitable institutions. He cannot get away from that. I want just to say another word.  I have here a sheet containing those pictures already referred to here and Deputy MacEntee only takes second place in this particular competition. Deputy Robert Briscoe is first.  What I want to draw particular attention to in this sheet containing these photographs are these statements: &ldquo;What the policy of Fianna Fáil is and what they are going to do.&rdquo;  The last sentence is this: &ldquo;It will make for the welfare of the sick, the poor and the aged,&rdquo; and one of the things they are <Col N="826" /> going to do is to rob the hospitals of the sums of money that were going to be used for the care of the sick, the poor and the aged.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;This duty shall not be charged or levied on any books which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, have before importation been substantially used or have before importation been in private ownership for a substantial period.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In page 35, First Schedule, Ref. No. 16, in the second column, after the word &ldquo;tags&rdquo; in paragraph (d) to insert in brackets the words &ldquo;(other than labels and tags of woven materials).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the Committee Stage of the Bill, the Minister for Industry and Commerce promised that he would consider the advisability of excluding labels and tags of woven material from the scope of the duty.  The use of labels and tags of this description is extremely limited.  There is, consequently, very little possibility of having them produced here.  The quantities imported are small and the cost of the concession will be very slight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a point on amendment 24, item 16, with regard to trade catalogues.  I do not think that the position with regard to trade catalogues is sufficiently appreciated.  If you impose a duty on catalogues imported in bulk you are going to place the wholesale <Col N="829" /> traders in a very unfair position with regard to their rivals who do their business from across the water.  In my opinion, all catalogues ought to be allowed in free or all catalogues ought to be subject to duty.  I understand that the Minister is considering the matter and if he merely mentions that I shall be satisfied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sorry this matter was not brought earlier to the notice of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  At this late stage, I am afraid we have not very much time to consider the matter further.  I do not know whether we could improvise an amendment which would exclude wall paper pattern books if imported in bulk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an amendment down to the Finance Bill, so that I cannot be accused of not raising the matter at the earliest possible moment. My position is that I cannot see why one set of catalogues should be allowed in free and catalogues in bulk should be subject to duty.  That is the attitude I take up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister to consider it from this point of view?  There seems to be an anomaly, in this way, that a local wholesaler who would import his pattern books in bulk <Col N="830" /> would have to pay the duty on them, whereas a wholesaler or factory, outside the Saorstát, can distribute pattern books singly to local people here, free of duty, which would give an advantage over the Saorstát trader.  I have discussed this point with Deputy Dockrell and I have made inquiries since and I find that there are wholesale distributors of wall papers in the City of Dublin alone.  I would ask the Minister to meet the situation one way or the other.  These people are not asking to have the duty taken off or put on, but they are asking that they should be put at no disadvantage as compared with outsiders.  I think that is the point that Deputy Dockrell has in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 25:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 37, First Schedule, Ref. No. 18, in the fifth column, to add a paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(v) vessels and boats which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, are primarily constructed and designed for propulsion by sails, or for propulsion by mechanical means, or for the carriage of goods, or are intended for use in the fishing industry or for the purpose of the lifeboat service.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This arises out of the suggestion, which, I think, was made by Deputy Good, that possibly ships might be described as &ldquo;articles manufactured wholly or partly of wood.&rdquo;  The duty, as originally drafted, was extremely wide in its scope, and the possibilities are, that, if you could get ships on to dry land, they might be liable to duty.  The amendment now proposed on behalf of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, exempts all vessels, except rowing boats, not intended for use in the fishing industry or for the purpose of the lifeboat service, and I think it will fully meet the point which was made by Deputy Good.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>There are rowing clubs throughout Ireland, who buy racing gigs, for instance.  The racing gig may be an ordinary tub outrigger boat or what is known as a fine boat, and neither of these is made in the country.  They are usually imported from Oxford, from boat builders on the Isis or the Thames, where a large number of wherries come from.  In the case of some of these boats, the prices run anything from £60 to £80, and with the tariff it will be very difficult for rowing clubs to get a decent fine &ldquo;four&rdquo; or a fine &ldquo;eight,&rdquo; under say, £100 or £120.  That is a very big consideration to numbers of University students, for instance, and to the young men who take part in this sport of rowing in this country. As a matter of fact, I could prove to the Minister's satisfaction that very few of these clubs are solvent, and they cannot afford to undertake the great expense that will be involved now in paying extra for their boats. If we had in this country boat builders who were building these racing gigs, I would certainly encourage this, but, when we are not building these things, I do not see why we should discourage the sport of rowing in the manner proposed by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy Anthony.  I think the matter of the money involved is very small, but it is a very serious item for these clubs.  Rowing clubs in Ireland, as Deputy Anthony has said, are not in a very affluent position&mdash;the one I am acquainted with certainly, is in debt&mdash; and they can only be run by subscriptions from outsiders.  I would press on the Minister that, as he is interfering with sport in other directions&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>Thirty or fifty pounds is a very small thing to the Revenue, but it is a very big item for a University rowing club.  I can assure the Minister that rowing clubs have to be financed in order to be got to work at all.  There is another aspect of this. There are many rowing pleasure boats used in this country, which afford working men with their means of livelihood, and, so far as I know, they are not likely to be made here at all.  Yet it is proposed to put a tax on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the views of the last speaker, but I should like to draw the Minister's attention also to the fact that rowing boats are necessary for the recreation of visitors in our various summer health resorts. The Minister will be striking a blow at the livelihood of a deserving section of the community, and I would ask him, in view of the very small amount of revenue he is likely to gain from this tax, to withdraw it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to place the Minister in any false position.  Rowing boats are made in this country and the very boats referred to by the last speaker are made in the City of Cork, Dublin, Baltimore and other places in West Cork.  They are made in this country and very good ones are made here.  Very good yachts are also made in this country, and if the Minister came down to my part of the country, I could show him a £10,000 yacht built, quite recently, in Baltimore.  The boats to which I refer are not made in this country and I do not see any prospect of their being made here, for some years, at any rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This discussion has been a case of much ado about nothing. I am awfully sorry that Deputy Anthony, who was so concerned about racing requisites, did not take the trouble, before he assumed that racing boats would be taxed under this, to read item 18, because he would have seen there that articles for use in sport would be exempted, and that, therefore, racing boats are definitely not covered by the duty.  As to the point raised by Deputy Brasier, in regard to ordinary rowing boats for <Col N="833" /> pleasure purposes, I think that Deputy Anthony has given him what I consider to be a conclusive answer.</P>

      <P>I should like to draw attention to a matter under No. 18. The Minister for Industry and Commerce gave an undertaking that printer's blocks would be exempt.  He has carried out that undertaking so far as lead blocks are concerned, but they can be taxed under the heading of &ldquo;wood&rdquo;&mdash;blocks mounted on wood. I ask the Minister to insert printer's blocks and type.  Wooden type would also come under it.</P>

    <P>This, I think, gives partial effect to amendment 183a put down by Deputy Thrift on the Committee Stage.  It is not proposed to accept the amendment in the form originally proposed, that is to say, excluding photographic apparatus, etc., for use in any educational institution, as it is not clear that cameras and photographic apparatus of a normal type are in fact used in schools and colleges to any great extent.  If they were so used, it is possible that they would be frequently availed of by private individuals for purposes other than those of an educational nature.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, however, is convinced that there is a case for exempting photographic apparatus of a specialised or laboratory type.  It is proposed to accept the principle of the amendment, and this gives effect to it.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £365 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1933, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including the Rates Advisory Committee, and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The amount required by the Supplementary Estimate is £365.  It is to cover the travelling and incidental expenses, subsistence allowances, etc., of delegates and technical advisers who attended the conference of the International Labour Organisation, and other meetings in connection, therewith, which were held during the present year.  Provision was not made in the Estimates for 1932-33.</P>

      <P>Which were held. Provision was not made in the Estimates for 1932-33 in respect of the delegation to the annual conference of the International Labour Office in Geneva in March last.  The new Executive Council decided that delegates should <Col N="839" /> go and, as the service had not been provided for, this Supplementary Estimate is now necessary.  The details are:&mdash;Travelling expenses and subsistence allowances in respect of four delegates, namely, an employers' representative, a Government representative, an adviser to the workers' representative and a workers' representative, £315.  In addition to that there was an entertainment allowance of £50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>One would have expected more information from the Minister for Finance, who was also Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. Has this money been spent? The conference is over many months. Those who travelled presumably got their subsistence allowance and if there was any entertainment given for which the sum of £50 was provided that, presumably, has been incurred as an expense. The Government must have known before this delegation started that there was no provision to meet their expenses and that there was no provision to meet this small item of money set aside for entertainment.  I think the Minister might have given us some reason why the estimate was not introduced earlier and where, in fact, the money has come from.</P>
      <P>Is this a repayment to the Contingency Fund?  What has happened? Supposing the Dáil were to refuse to vote this money, how is the State going to be recouped?  Surely, from the point of view of a purist financier, there might have been some indication of the fact that the money was spent and that it is now sought, after the event, to recoup the State.  The Minister might explain also why it was not possible to take this Vote earlier so as to enable the whole matter to be put in order at a better time.  Those are the preliminary points that I desire to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know any other reason except that I believe this is the customary delegation that is sent to the International Labour Congress. As to why a Supplementary Estimate has not been already introduced, I may say this is the earliest moment at which it could be introduced.  The decision to send the delegation had to be taken when the Dáil was not in session.  The time of the Dáil has been fully occupied with Government business since and this matter is submitted to the Dáil at the earliest available opportunity, in accordance with the recommendation of the Public Accounts Committee.  I may promise the House and the Deputy that we are not going to follow the bad example set by the previous Government and we will not hold back knowledge on various things from the Dáil even for a year or two.  That was the example set by the last Government in relation to certain matters until they were compelled by the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the Public Accounts Committee to submit them to the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is to be regarded as an explanation, I think one is entitled to say that the Minister for Finance badly needs an adviser, both as far as manners and finance are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, he is.  The Minister should get better advice than the advice upon which he is relying <Col N="841" /> when he says that this is the customary application.  Does the Minister know what was the ordinary delegation that went to Geneva for the International Labour Congress? Does he know whether, as well as the Labour people having an adviser, the employers' people had an adviser? Does he know whether they claim the right to have an adviser on every occasion?  Does the Minister know whether it could be said that there was an established practice with regard to the type of delegation sent out?  Does the Minister think that it is sufficient for the House, when an item like this is being discussed, to make the statement he has made without previously making an investigation? He cannot possibly have made any investigation when he makes such a statement.</P>
      <P>We are told that this is the earliest opportunity upon which the Estimate could be presented.  I have asked, and I do not think I have been answered except by way of implication, has the money been spent?  I am assuming now that it has been. It would be well to bear that in mind for the future when good finance conduct is being considered.  The money has been spent to some extent and the Minister says that this is the earliest available opportunity.  What nonsense !  We have had at least four other Supplementary Estimates introduced and they were passed within twenty minutes.  Was there an attempt made to get time for an Estimate of this sort?  There was an attempt made to get time for other Estimates and the time was granted. The whole speech of the Minister was an attempt to mislead the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question at all of there being an established practice with regard to delegations which would enable the Minister to answer in the way he answered Deputy Dillon.  He has not answered one thing.  I am assuming the money has been spent.  There was no attempt made to get this Supplementary Estimate brought before the House earlier. <Col N="842" /> It probably was not ready.  The Minister might have said that.  It takes some little time to get information from Geneva.  If it was even the small matter of £50 for entertainment, it would take some time to get the accounts collected.  The people out there are not in a hurry in presenting accounts.  Presumably the entertainment was given under the auspices of the Irish representative at Geneva.  Probably the bill did not come into him until the end of last month.  If there is any reason to be given why this matter did not come before the House prior to this it is because the account was not in.  The Minister gave a nonsensical reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That was one of the reasons.  It was certainly occupied with important Government business.  Today, <Col N="843" /> when the order of business was before the House, we had this Supplementary Estimate, which was referred to as a comparatively simple matter that might be passed in less than twenty minutes, dangled from the other benches as a great concession that they were allowing us to discuss. It was regarded as a great concession in view of the agreement arrived at.  If the Deputy's Party had taken up their usual attitude with regard to this, the Government might have been compelled to hold it over until next session. And then we would be challenged by Deputy McGilligan about the impropriety of our conduct in doing so.  As to the manner in which the Labour delegation was chosen, I am not in a position to state from personal knowledge what happened, because I did not happen to be the Minister responsible for the delegation.  The delegation was nominated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce was responsible for requisitioning funds for sending the delegation to Ottawa.</P>

      <P>That is an attempt to get around an original dishonest, untrue statement&mdash;that it is because the House was so occupied with other business&mdash;that is what the Minister said and that has been the answer made.  That is what we have been told about the method by which the employees' representative was selected. What about the employers' representative? What has the Minister to say about that?  If the Minister wants to defend this Estimate he must know something about this matter.  This matter is founded upon regulation and it is the function which the Labour people have from their angle insisted on enforcing that the representative must be chosen from the most representative body of employers.  The Labour Party have insisted on enforcing that.  The agreement has been too that the employers' representative would be chosen from the most representative body of employers.  The representative of the employers was not so chosen.  He was chosen by an organ which could hardly be so described in any reasoned way.  It cannot be said to be mainly representative of the employers and it cannot be said at all to be the most representative body of employers in the State.  I would like to know under what procedure that particular man was selected.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that I cannot satisfy Deputy McGilligan. His objection is to the manner in which the employers' representative was chosen.  The Government came into office on the 9th March.  Some time afterwards&mdash;I cannot say how long, but possibly a short time afterwards&mdash;the attention of the Government was drawn to the fact that for the first time in a number of years it was proposed not to send a delegation in connection with the Annual Conference of the International Labour Office.  That was rather significant and characteristic in view of the general attitude of the late Government towards Labour problems and towards the workers generally, that the one kind of item which they had chosen to economise on was this Conference which is, I think, of great interest and of great value to the workers everywhere and not less to the workers of the Free State than elsewhere. We had, during the preceding ten years, jamborees of various sorts at Geneva and elsewhere which, so far as the people were concerned were of little advantage and profit. The International Labour Office does some good, and at any rate whether it does as much good as some people say, the workers of the Free State are in it and are particularly interested in the proceedings of the Annual Conference. That matter accordingly was brought to the notice of the present Government and it was decided to reverse the policy of our predecessors in that matter and to send a delegation.  A delegation had to be secured at very short notice and the full consultation which otherwise might have taken place in regard to sending delegations and which should have taken place in regard to sending delegations did not occur for the reason that time did not permit. But the person who went as the employers' representative was chosen after consultation with the Cork Employers' Federation and with the Limerick Employers' Federation. <Col N="846" /> There was only one day available for that consultation.  Time did not permit the Dublin Employers to be consulted, but as it was a Dublin employer who went on the delegation and as the Government nomination in this matter was approved of by the employers in the second and third largest cities in the country&mdash;in the State at any rate&mdash;I cannot see how the Deputy can contend that there was any lack of consultation or that the Government nominee in this connection lacked the confidence of the nationally-minded employers, in the country at any rate.  Possibly that is what Deputy McGilligan has in mind&mdash;that the person who was sent as an employer's representative did not represent the importing interests in this country.</P>

The Government always nominates the members of the delegation and submits the names for approval to the organisation which may have been interested in the matter.

      <P>The point I wish to make is, having obtained the approval of the Cork body, the Minister mentioned that there was no time to consult a Dublin body of employers.  He mentioned that the nominee had been nominated by an association of manufacturers. I think he asserted very vehemently that they had nominated him.  The point I wish to make is that I think that association would not come under the terms of a representative body of employers in so much as they contain both employers' and workers' representatives.  Apparently the workers' representative was nominated very properly by the Trade Union Congress and the employers' representative was nominated by a mixed body of employers and workers.  That is what I wish to bring to the Minister's attention.</P>

I have emphasised&mdash;possibly over-emphasised &mdash;that the representative of the workers and the representative of the employers were nominated in each case by the Government and then submitted for approval.  In each case, as I was saying, the members of the delegation were nominated by the Government and where it was necessary their names were submitted for approval to certain organisations representing the employers, on the one hand, in regard to the employers' representative, and representing the workers, on the other hand, in regard to the workers' representative. In no case was the nomination made by any other person except the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Although this Vote is only for a small amount, I would like to know what advantage will accrue to the Free State as a result of this expenditure of £365.  Who inspired it?  We have heard a lot about trade unionists.  I belong to the old-fashioned type of trade unionists who believed more in work than in talking about work, I do not know whether the trade unionists mentioned by the Minister represented the workers of this country at all, as evidenced by <Col N="851" /> the result of the last General Election. To my mind I think it is waste of money going to Geneva to discuss problems whether they refer to labour or not that are the very negation of the policy that Fianna Fáil advocates. If we are to work out our own salvation, it seems to me altogether against the rules and regulations governing the workers, to ask them to take dictation from any other country.  I think it is about time that we here in this little State should look after our own affairs without consulting the workers of other countries.  For that reason I am absolutely opposed, not only to the spending of £365, but to the spending of 365 farthings on this International Conference, because I have no confidence in it.  In fact I may state honestly that I think that the majority of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, if they were to give us honestly their minds, would tell us they believe that no use would come from these international conferences as far as industry in this country was concerned.  There is no use bluffing or beating about the bush. The country is not interested, as far as the welfare of labour is concerned, in the sending of these delegates to Geneva.  The workers of this country, so far as I know, and I have as much experience of them as any man in this House, can look after their own affairs here.  In the present economic condition of the country I think it is absolute waste to spend this £365 in sending delegates to discuss matters that can have but very little bearing upon the economic or industrial position of this country at the moment.</P>

The fact that despite the Opposition we could force a piece of magnificent legislation through this House, in an hour and a half, is no bad record.  Rightly or wrongly, we believe we are tackling these problems in a Christian manner and in a proper manner.  There is no contradiction in that, while preserving our international outlook we pursue our national and economic outlook.  If we get an opportunity of making these known and spread abroad through the medium of the International Labour Conference at Geneva or elsewhere we shall take every opportunity of doing so.  We are aware of the extent of the world conditions, but we have our own social ideals and we are pursuing them in a world that is terribly confused at the present time.</P>

      <P>I am in entire sympathy with the idea of preparing these histories but I think the Minister is providing for the work on anything but a liberal scale.  I cannot conceive that a sum of £520 will go very far in preparing histories of counties in the Free State.  It seems to be a matter that requires considerable knowledge and considerable research and that the work will involve considerable expense. It is not a work that should be undertaken lightly or in a haphazard way. It is a matter that demands the employment of specialists of very peculiar and definite qualifications.  I am in complete sympathy with the object but I would deplore any attempt to deal with it in an amateurish or insufficient manner. I should like that something would be done that would be permanent and worthy of the country.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Alton in his plea.  I should like to ask the Minister whether he proposes that this £520 should cover the cost of new histories or is it his intention to collate existing ones?  We have Twenty-Six Counties to deal with.  Will there be a history of each county?  Will it mean the production of twenty-six histories?  The printing alone would come to over £520.  The reason I put the question in regard to the collation <Col N="856" /> of existing histories is that you have very many local histories.  In Cork, for instance, you have a history of Bandon and a history of the various townships. These are already in existence.  Is it suggested under this proposal that these various histories should be collected or collated and then be published as one volume?  In that case the cost would not be quite so much because the material would be at the disposal of the editor.</P>

I take it that this will be a work of permanent utility.  It is not a matter that ends to-day, to-morrow, ten years hence or in one hundred years' time. Every care and caution should be taken in regard to the selection of the person put in charge of the work to ensure that he would have the confidence of the best scholars in Ireland and in Europe and that he is a person on whom the confidence of future generations would rest.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>For the benefit of Deputy Alton and other Deputies I should explain that in the policy of advancing Gaelic ideals and the Irish language, in connection with the development of other subjects through the medium of the Irish language and in connection with <Col N="857" /> the creation of a proper atmosphere in the way of the development of national ideals amongst the pupils, it has been thought wise by the Department to lay special stress on local histories.  The local histories that are at present available are very good in many cases but are out of reach.  In addition to that there is no suitable history for young people.  The idea is to provide such a history and to go through manuscripts such as O'Donovan's and O'Curry's and other manuscripts of that kind and to have an entirely new series of local histories, books which will not run beyond about 200 pages and sell them at a cost of from 2/6 to 3/- each. The idea underlying the present proposal is that we should have an experimental period of two years.  I admit that a sum of £500 would not go very far but if I came before the House with the proposal to engage an editor for a period of twelve years it would seem a very long time although I might point out there is already a similar work in hands which will take a period of four years.</P>
    <P>I am simply asking for sufficient money in view of the existing financial stringency to enable a beginning to be made.  I have every confidence in the editor who has been selected and I think that Irish scholars have confidence in him too.  He has shown that he has a good knowledge of this particular work.  He has been already working upon it and I am confident that he is particularly fitted to produce works having a proper national tone and peculiarly fitted for Irish pupils.  I am not aware that we should approach the Civil Service Commissioners when special work of this kind is being undertaken.  I take full responsibility for the selection of the editor and I am quite confident that he is able to perform the duty. He will have the assistance of the primary branch of the Education Office who are specially interested and I think of the authorities of the National Library.  I think the work is certain to be a success.</P>

In view of the necessity for selling these books and trying to meet our expenses, it is doubtful whether separate volumes will be published for the small counties.  A decision, however, has not been reached on that point.  I do not know whether it is really necessary to go into the question raised by Deputy O'Sullivan. What I mean by &ldquo;national tone&rdquo; is a state of mind that takes Ireland for granted, the writing of the individual being in accord with that state of mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Perhaps I did not make that sufficiently clear.  The development <Col N="859" /> of Irish studies in the schools makes it necessary that we should have several subjects taught in that language and that we should have the necessary text-books.  I take Irish history and local history to be the subject most closely allied to the Irish language itself.  There is no reason, I think, why in a comparatively short space of time the subject of history should not be taught completely in Irish.  This is a step in that direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the idea of writing local history in Irish, but I suggest that it is a matter of considerable difficulty.  The Minister said that Irish scholars were satisfied with the appointment he had made. Is it the intention that the whole preparation of this work in Irish should be left to the editor, or will that part of the Department of Education which edits Irish books be given an opportunity of reading or revising what is to be produced?  I have no personal knowledge of the matter, but it is very difficult to find any one individual who combines knowledge of county history with sufficient knowledge of Irish to produce any sort of racy and readable books.  The Minister has in his Department a section containing a number of very competent writers of Irish. Is it intended that they should be used at all in this connection, or is it intended that these books should be produced entirely under the authority and in the Irish of the editor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend that the books shall be produced under the direction and supervision of the Primary Education Branch.  They are interested in the schools and it should be their duty to see that the books are suitable in every way.  There might be no objection to having the books published in English as well as in Irish.  As regards the question of co-operating with the editor, the Irish Publication Branch, to which Deputy Hayes has alluded, is there, and I do not see why there should be any difficulty in getting its co-operation if it is necessary.  I am <Col N="860" /> not quite clear at present whether it will be necessary, but, if it is, it will certainly be done.  I want to make it quite clear that I am going to leave the matter in the hands of the Primary Branch, who will see that the books are proper in every way for the schools.</P>

      <P>I should like to emphasise the position of certain counties&mdash;Waterford, Cork, Kerry, Galway and Donegal, for instance.  I think it would be very regrettable, and prejudicial to the whole scheme, if, in these counties, local historical writers, or a group of local historical writers, could not be got to co-operate, so as to have the histories properly written and properly written in Irish.  There are in Waterford, Cork, Kerry, Galway and Donegal groups with strong historical interests in very close association with the living language, and I suggest to the Minister that he should see whether in those areas, particularly, a writer could not be found to produce a local history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the trouble, in that connection, that we require a certain uniformity in these books.  We require them to be of a type and if we are not going to leave the ultimate responsibility in the hands of the editor, I am afraid that that desirable criterion might not be attained.  The editor has no objection whatever, and I have no objection, to discussing matters with Irish writers who have a particular knowledge of local history and getting their collaboration and assistance in making whatever arrangements are necessary.  But I think that there is a great scarcity of scholars who have, at the same time, such a literary knowledge of Irish and such a knowledge of local history as would enable them to undertake the whole responsibility.  I should be quite prepared to see that proposals put up from local writers were carefully considered. Where there are men of standing available, we shall make an endeavour to obtain their collaboration.</P>

      <P>Nobody can question the value of such work as is contemplated by the Minister.  The research of local historians is very valuable.  No doubt, an editor supervising the work generally and collating the information would perform a very useful service, but I think far more valuable information would be obtained from the local historians who have made a special study in their own counties.  The work done in that way would be more authoritative than anything that could be done by a central personage collating the information regarding the various counties. There is at present a very valuable publication contemplated by the Tourists' Association.  It is really a history of the County and City of Cork.  That work has been put in the hands of Professor O'Rahilly.  I am sure that a work like that, coming from the hands of a gentleman of standing, will be far more valuable than anything that could be done in the way of central preparation.  I feel that you will reduce the value of these works, whether they are printed in Irish or in English, by putting them all in the hands of one man.  Local historians in the various counties would be far more competent to deal with them than one man in Dublin.</P>

      <P>Before proceeding with the discussion of this Estimate, it may be just as well to state, so that there will be no misunderstanding later, that this is a Supplementary Estimate, in which the actual sum asked for is £400 and the purpose for which the sum is required is the administration of the Dairy Produce Act, 1932.  Normally, discussion should be confined to the object for which the money is required but, in view of present circumstances, a wider debate on the agricultural position seems inevitable.  As the Vote on Account and the Central Fund Bill will, to-morrow, give two further opportunities for such debate, it seems, from the point of view of the Chair, to be desirable that there should be some arrangement as to the item on which that wider discussion should be taken and concluded.  If that agreement is forthcoming and this Vote for Agriculture is the item selected, the Chair is agreeable, under the circumstances, to allow a debate <Col N="863" /> wider than should normally take place on Supplementary Estimates.

      <P>So, if you do make a ruling on this matter, and, without referring to the new legislation, if we do discuss the wider matter on this Estimate, it will then be ruled by you, or by the Ceann Comhairle, to-morrow, that that matter cannot be further discussed on the Vote on Account or on the Appropriation Bill?</P>

      <P>I suggest that, if you are going to discuss the wider question at all, it should be discussed either on this or on some other item.  If you discuss, for instance, the new position as it affects butter on this, the same arguments will be used again to-morrow under other heads.  It would be a wiser course to allow discussion on this to embrace the whole lot, or, alternatively to confine the discussion to the narrow point of the matter concerned, and have the other discussion to-morrow. Otherwise you will have two discussions somewhat similar.</P>

      <P>The Chair thought it desirable that the broader topic should be discussed on one item, and, of course, the House understands that, unless there is agreement on it, the Chair cannot have a discussion on this Estimate in which the broader topic would be discussed. The Chair must confine the discussion to the particular subject for which the Estimate is asked, unless there is agreement to discuss the broader topic.</P>

      <P>The only question which strikes me as being of importance in connection with this is that I understand that most of those Deputies representing agricultural constituencies, or being themselves agriculturists, would probably question whether three hours and twenty minutes is enough for the consideration of this very important subject. Normally, the Appropriation Bill and the final stage of the Finance Bill would be rather shortly debated in a day, having regard to the special circumstances of this Session.  I would say, in that connection, that it is possible that the House might be more agreeable to allow the larger discussion on this Vote and the smaller discussion on the other two measures.  But there is the further measure which I have indicated to you, and which, I believe, is in course of preparation.</P>

      <P>I got in touch with the Opposition about an hour ago, and told them that there was a new measure to be introduced, and it was suggested then that there might be agreement&mdash; I am speaking subject to correction now&mdash; to take the remaining stage of the Finance Bill to-night, and to debate the broad question of these tariffs on this new measure.  I was to get in touch with Deputy Hayes, but I have not been able to assure him yet that the Bill will be circulated to-morrow. There is still something remaining to be done with it before I could say, definitely, that it will be circulated. Up to the present, I have not been able to say definitely that we will have it, but I believe we will.

      <P>There are a variety of topics which certainly call for discussion before the House rises.  There is the situation which concerns us as a result of what happened yesterday in England.  Secondly, there is, apart from that, and a different question from that entirely, the position which faces this country through the delegation at Ottawa.  It is an entirely different thing and must be discussed differently, I suggest.  Thirdly, there is the matter which has been ventilated so much in the Press for the last few days and as to which an attempt was made to prevent publication.  These three big matters must be discussed. I doubt if they can be discussed on any single measure&mdash;the Butter Resolution, the Finance Bill, or the Appropriation Bill.

There is no desire to do anything which will prevent us from carrying out that agreement.  The suggestion made from the Chair, which is a very familiar one to me, that if a big topic is going to be discussed it should be discussed on one item, is one with which I am in agreement.  But with regard to the announced new Bill, it makes it difficult to make any suitable suggestion, and making suggestions across the floor of the House is not of very great value. Deputy McGilligan has indicated certain matters which must be discussed. What, for example, is the suggestion about the new Bill and when it should be passed?

      <P>When the Butter Bounty Bill was introduced some time ago the Minister gave an elaborate statement regarding its importance to the dairying industry, which, he said, was our basic industry.  At that time the situation which confronted those engaged in the industry was that they were in a favourable position in the main market outside this country with regard to the marketing of their produce. We had the advantage over non-Commonwealth countries of a 10 <Col N="873" /> per cent. tariff, which those non-Commonwealth countries had to bear.  The basis of the Minister's recommendations was that the Butter Bounty Bill, which had relation to all butter manufactured in this country, in creameries and other places, was necessary by reason of the economic condition of the dairying industry at the time.</P>
      <P>We are faced to-day with an entirely different situation.  We are in the position of being 20 per cent. worse off than Australia and New Zealand, which are our principal Commonwealth competitors in the British market, and we are in a 10 per cent. worse position than our very powerful competitor, Denmark.  That is the result of the new duties which the British Government have recently imposed.  The position with regard to the whole agricultural industry is very, very serious. Properly speaking, those engaged in the industry are subject now to liability for Land Commission annuities in two countries; each of them is levying or collecting&mdash;whatever one wishes to term it.  This produces a very complex situation.  The industry cannot possibly bear this impost of 20 per cent. on its goods going into the British market.  It is entirely unequal to that burden and no possible arrangement that I can think of could be introduced to remedy the terrible effects of that imposition on agricultural produce in our principal market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are complexities outside the immediate imposition which will be apparent to any observer.  There are, let us say, three different payers of Land Commission annuities in the country.  There is A who has paid, B who has paid all except the last gale and C who owes, perhaps, two or three gales.  There is the further complexity that A may possibly have cattle to sell which will be subject to this imposition of 20 per cent.  Then there is B who will probably have cattle for sale in a couple of weeks' time, and C who was fortunate enough to have disposed of them before this tax was put on.  I can see no possible means of equating or compensating or doing anything to prevent the various anomalies that are <Col N="874" /> bound to arise out of the situation with which we are confronted.</P>
    <P>It is a situation which is truly appalling, having regard to the general condition of agriculture all over the world. The Minister for Agriculture, when talking on this subject some months ago, mentioned that we had some equation in respect of the Imperial preference which we were receiving.  That has now gone.  If the case then put up had substance in it, if this were a basic industry and if this industry required a tax to be placed on our own consumers in order that an extra price might be got for our sales abroad, then how much more serious is it now when we are confronted with this new imposition in our principal market?  It is a matter on which I find the greatest possible pain in addressing the House. It is a situation in which I never expected to see this country placed.  It is a serious situation which affects, not alone the agricultural industry, but practically every business that there is in the country.  It requires careful consideration to see how far it will be possible to alleviate any of the terrible sufferings that are bound to ensue from the position in which we are now placed.</P>
    <P>I suppose it would be out of order to consider even for a moment the Bill that is to be introduced to-morrow. These disputes between nations are very much the same as disputes between employers and employees.  Disputes between nations which deal with one another and disputes between employers and employees are disputes which affect what gives both a living and they are not in the best interests of either of the parties.  Their solution in the course of a fight limits, interferes with, impedes the progress of those engaged in them.  In these days when one hears so much about following Christian principles, some principles ought to be adopted which will solve problems rather than intensify them.  The people of this country are not in a position, nor are the people in the neighbouring country in a position, to undertake an economic war one upon the other.  It is because of those <Col N="875" /> considerations that I move, so that the matter may be discussed, that this Vote be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to second that proposal.  I want to give in some more detail the points at which Deputy Cosgrave merely glanced when he was dealing with this particular Estimate and his proposal in regard to it.  It is well at this moment to recall the statements made by the Minister for Agriculture when he was introducing his scheme for the stabilisation of the price of butter and when he was replying to criticisms, and I will quote certain comments in order to show how peculiar, in the light of present circumstances, was the statement made by the Minister for Defence, who thought well to intervene in that critical debate.  The Minister for Agriculture in introducing the Estimate in Committee on Finance relating to the butter tariff pointed out that: &ldquo;It has been the experience of this country for the last seven or eight years that the price of Free State butter on the British market has been invariably lower than the price paid for Danish butter.  Some years the difference has reached as much as 21/- or 22/- per cwt., and even in the most favourable year the difference was 13/- per cwt., so that we may take it the Free State butter this year will not at its best reach the price of Danish butter. Danish butter is now quoted on the British market at 116/-.  That is after duty has been paid and after freight has been paid.&rdquo;  Note the premises. Then he goes on: &ldquo;If we take it that the Imperial preference that may be given to our butter is equated by the consumers' preference for Danish butter, we cannot, if we had butter to export at the present time expect to get more than 115/- or 116/- per cwt. for it.&rdquo;  The Minister for Agriculture proposed that the consumers' preference was to be equated by the Imperial preference which he assumed was to be given to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Later on in that speech the Minister for Agriculture indicated the necessity for the Resolution when he said: &ldquo;We must remember that dairying is the <Col N="876" /> basic industry in agriculture, that we get not only our butter and milk supplies through it, but also the cattle that are reared in this country.  To a great extent pigs and poultry depend on the success of the dairying industry. If these are all taken together&mdash;butter, milk, cattle, pigs and poultry&mdash;they must form more than one-half of the total production both agricultural and industrial of this country.&rdquo;  And then there was this sapient observation:&mdash;&ldquo;While we are endeavouring to get new industries going, we should be careful to protect the industries we have.&rdquo;  The success of the dairying industry, according to the figures of the census production amount to more than one-half of what was produced in the country both agricultural and industrial. And the Minister made the point that the success of the dairying industry depended upon the measure he was introducing so as to secure a certain price for that butter.</P>
    <P>He said immediately after that:&mdash;&ldquo;The position at present is, taking the creameries first, that they export half the butter they produce and the other half is consumed at home.&rdquo; And then this statement followed and it is very relevant at the present moment:&mdash;&ldquo;We cannot get any more for the half we export as we must take the best price we can get in competition with the rest of the world.&rdquo; And that is in the British market. Then he went on to say:&mdash;&ldquo;The only alternative left us is to turn to the other half which is consumed at home and to ask the home consumer to pay more.&rdquo;  I want to relate those remarks: that the dairying industry is to this country more than half of the entire production of the country agricultural and industrial; that on the success of his Butter Price Stabilisation Proposal depended the success of the dairying industry and through that depended the success of half of our production, agricultural and industrial.</P>
    <P>We have unfortunately to face the position that the British consumer on whom we had to rely preferred Danish butter.  But we hoped that Imperial preference would continue and so we equated the consumer's preference <Col N="877" /> for Danish over Irish butter. We were told that we could not increase the price in the outside market because there we were in competition with the rest of the world.  Therefore, we had to increase it to the home consumer. I spoke later and asked what was going to happen if our butter should lose the preferential position under the Imperial preference and there was a remark later by the Minister for Defence about the imperial tang and he thought that that was a sufficient answer.  The Minister for Defence referring to the question I had asked as to what should happen if we lost the ten per cent. preference said:&mdash;&ldquo;He (Deputy McGilligan) asked what would happen us if we lost the ten per cent., if England ceased to love us.  Then she might get to love us as much as she loves Denmark and import from us from 30 to 40 per cent. instead of from some other country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a prediction that has not been verified.  Later on the Minister for Agriculture had to make a more reasoned statement than that.  He said that two Deputies were very much concerned that we should lose the ten per cent. preference and he added:&mdash;&ldquo;I do not know why that question should be raised now.&rdquo;  A Deputy in an interruption asked &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;  And the Minister then said:&mdash;&ldquo;We had not anticipated that this ten per cent. would be lost.  If and when it is lost it will be time enough to face the question.&rdquo;  That is the question we have to face now and we have to face it under the circumstances described by the Minister for Agriculture.  On the price of butter depends the dairying industry which is more than half the entire production of this country.  We cannot increase the price of butter abroad. We have got to have relation between the price of the exported butter and we have to put a levy on the people who eat our own butter at home in order to keep up the price in the British market.  That was the position when there was a ten per cent. preference in favour of our butter.  But now instead of a ten per cent. in our favour there has been a ten per cent. <Col N="878" /> preference against us.  We have gone back 20 per cent.  That is why I ask that the Vote should be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    <P>What is the opinion of the Government as to the amount of the levy that will have to be met by those who buy the butter for consumption at home if we are to keep the British market against the Danish competition now fortified by a preference in her favour?  When we were making a levy of something between a quarter of a million and a million when we wanted our butter sold against a Danish competitor who suffered a ten per cent. disadvantage what levy will now be required when the Danish butter has ten per cent. in its favour against us?  That is a question that will have to be answered.  What will the new levy be?  Or are we going to go on selling butter in the British market at all?  If so what is to happen to the 350,000 cwts. of exportable butter which the Minister had to sell somewhere?  And it must be remembered this is only one item of the big number of items that will be subject to the additional duties imposed in England yesterday.  We have got to keep dairying going.  We have got, therefore, to assist the producers and sellers of butter.  We can only sell in England.  We cannot increase the price that we are asking over there. We want stabilisation and a certain price.  What is the new change to be put upon the consumer at home, or are we going out of the butter business?  That is a situation that has got to be faced on this item alone, though it is an important item in the Minister for Agriculture's own phrasing.  The reactions of this are going to spread in other directions. On this item so much depends, and if it were only on this that the 20 per cent. were put on, we certainly at this moment would be in a bad way.</P>
    <P>The Government all along told us in varying tones that there would be no attempt to discriminate against us by taxation.  We were told that that could not be done because England only bought from us what she could not buy elsewhere; that we could call the bluff.  The Minister <Col N="879" /> for Agriculture was asked in the debate from which I am quoting, what percentage of the total imports into England of butter did she import from the Free State and he admitted that it was something less than seven per cent.  Yet despite that we were told that in this special item of butter there could be no possible discrimination against us because it was going to damage the English consumer more than the Irish consumer.  But whatever was to happen we received the assurance that the Irish producer was not going to suffer and the Government would insist on that.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there must be a plan. We were promised a plan about unemployment; we had a scheme about reducing taxation.  The bluff of both of these has been called.  Could we have some indication early of what has been done to save butter producers in this country from the injury that looks likely to be done by what happened yesterday, and from the injury which looks to be inevitable, if we are to believe what the Minister for Agriculture said when introducing the Financial Resolution which gave him power to impose a levy for certain purposes?  If the people of this country are given satisfaction on one item, they will probably be spurred to greater effort with regard to the other items dealt with by the people on the other side.  But, if they can get no indication that there was a plan to meet such contingency&mdash;a contingency that could easily be foreseen &mdash;then they will know where they are, and they can only be in despair.  It is necessary to have this discussion as an urgent matter to-night, and it would be fitting that the President should intervene at the earliest possible moment, to see how apprehended injury is going to be avoided to the butter industry alone, so that we can get either confidence or lose hope from whatever indication he gives as to how he proposes to meet what is ahead.  That is why I think it is important to have this segregated in its own setting, and not discussed with what might happen, or fails to happen, at Ottawa, or that may happen as a <Col N="880" /> result of the impositions in the Finance Bill, and how the whole finances of the country may be affected by the Finance Bill.  As the Minister for Agriculture stated, this is the biggest item in our production, and it is threatened with destruction by what has happened.  People will anxiously wait to know how the destruction is going to be averted or the injury minimised.</P>

      <P>It is surprising the turn this debate has taken.  I am not surprised that Deputy Cosgrave was anxious that the debate should not be confined to the terms that would in the ordinary way take place on this Estimate.  Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies want to have their innings to-night.  The last Deputy announced that very forcibly, and told us that the contingency that has arisen with England was easily foreseen for a long time.  I thoroughly agree with him in that.  Anyone who followed the attitude and the actions of those on the front benches opposite, for the past 3, 4, 5 or 6 weeks could easily foresee that such a contingency would arise. We could easily foresee that they were preparing the ground, and that they were interested in nothing else but preparing the ground for such a contingency as has been created by the British.  We easily foresaw the attitude of the men who now speak with great concern for the butter industry, the dairying industry and the cattle trade.  We foresaw that their concern for these industries was to give the British hints how to destroy them. The contingency that has now arisen was easily foreseen.  It was suggested in the tone of the Deputies' speeches and is contained in the regulations that the British have introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few meetings were held in my county recently, secret meetings&mdash; which were attended by Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies.  I got a complete report of a few things that happened. The whole discussions at these meetings, which were held within the past two months, centred round statements made by these Deputies that this contingency was bound to arise, and that there was no doubt that England was <Col N="881" /> going to take up this attitude.  The attitude at these meetings was: &ldquo;We will avail of this opportunity to down the Government.  We will keep silent in public, as much as we can, but, at the first available opportunity we will step in and divide the forces here. Instead of following the British attitude, and being united in this crisis, we will divide the people as they were never divided before.  We will break the Government and, at the same time, break the Irish case.&rdquo;  That was the attitude taken by Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies at these secret meetings.  The only interest in the butter industry, and in the farming industry, was to allow this contingency to arise, to allow British Ministers to see that there was division here, and that they could be strong in demanding their pound of flesh.  The Cumann na nGaedheal Party and Deputy Cosgrave's proposal to refer this Estimate back for reconsideration was made on account of this contingency.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy was as anxious about the industries as his Party pretends, was he not informed that a measure would be introduced by the Government to-morrow&mdash;possibly a measure to undo the wrongs that may be done by the British measure; possibly a measure to recoup Irish farmers; possibly a measure to meet losses sustained in the dairying industry?  If the Deputy was in earnest, and was not interested in propaganda, as he is, but was interested in these industries, would he not have said that the decent thing was to let the Estimate go through and not to confine it to the ordinary terms?  Instead of doing that he comes here and decides &ldquo;to go&rdquo; for the Government.  Was not the other one the decent attitude for Deputy Cosgrave to take?  Could he not have his innings to-morrow?  Is it to his interest&mdash;and he was followed by Deputy McGilligan&mdash;to have scare headlines about, so as to stampede the State and the people?  He took the opportunity of having his innings to-night, at a moment when there should be only one voice in this country when, if discussions are to take place&mdash;as inevitably they must&mdash;the Irish people would be, at least, as united as the <Col N="882" /> English people are in their own interests? That is not the interest Cumann na nGaedheal has.  There has been criticism by Deputy McGilligan of the Bill dealing with a bounty on butter that was introduced.  What was the criticism from the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches when that Bill was introduced?  The ex-Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Hogan, very conveniently remained away from the House when that Bill was introduced.</P>

      <P>What happened was that the majority of the Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies interested in farming, the majority who know something about the butter industry, voted solidly for the measure and praised the measure in all its aspects.  Now, however, when you have a different state of affairs existing and when you have this panicky legislation by the British coming along, you have Deputy McGilligan pointing out what he should have pointed out then if he was the great statesman he pretends he is to-night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing happened this morning in the Lobby of this House which will give an impression of the type of mind behind the discussion started here to-night for propaganda purposes.  Two Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies&mdash; and I will say that the type of mind represented by these Deputies is in the minority on the opposite side, because I know there are some of them on the opposite side who are taking the <Col N="883" /> national view of this matter&mdash;but two, anyhow&mdash;the exceptions, if you like; there are a few, including practically every member of the Front Bench&mdash;two of them met in the Lobby here to-day. One of them said: &ldquo;Did you see the news in to-day's paper about the 20 per cent. against Irish produce in England?&rdquo;&ldquo;Isn't it great!&rdquo;  said the other; &ldquo;now we have them.&rdquo;  And the two of them were quite jubilant about the great news that the British were going to destroy the agricultural industry here.  That was their attitude. I admit that it is not the attitude of quite a number of the Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies, but it is a rotten attitude and an anti-national attitude, and it is the attitude for which the British are looking here, and it is an attitude which will defeat the Irish people if it is allowed to go on.  I say that instead of attacking they should strengthen the hands of the Government and not allow any of their members to go out and make scare speeches and defeat the people.  They should realise that the fate of the people is more or less at stake.</P>

We all know what Deputy McGilligan has emphasised again and again&mdash;that there is a ten per cent. tariff against us in the British market.  He need not emphasise that.  We are painfully aware of it, but our interest in facing up to this crisis is that the Irish people should win out in this question, that they should not be defeated or thwarted by having disheartened views on this matter.  The people who are interested in this industry, the dairy farmers, know very well that a united voice is the best weapon they could have and that the united voice of the whole people behind the Government in this matter is the proper attitude.  They know that the scare scheme organised by the Front Bench of the Opposition is organised with a view, not to refer the Estimate back for discussion, but to try, before the Government introduces measures, to give the people of this country a down-and-out feeling, to drive them into despair instead of rallying them as they would rally and as they are prepared to be rallied to stand in defence of their own interests.</P>

In view of what Deputy Cleary has said about taking a national attitude, I suggest that he is wholly misinformed in saying that the British people are united on this subject.  How he can say that after reading the daily papers I cannot understand, <Col N="885" /> because I am glad to say that a large section of the English people feel as I do on this question that an economic war is a disaster and an unnecessary disaster.  I would suggest that we should rally to prevent this economic war and that we should drive the two Governments into arbitration.  Goodness knows, it ought to be possible to have arbitration. Why should we break our necks about the principle of having a tribunal composed either inside or outside the Commonwealth?  Let us have, if necessary, an Anglo-Irish tribunal and let us make sure that it is not feasible to have such a tribunal before we ruin the country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cleary made other statements contrary to the fact.  He said that, in the passage of the Butter Bill through this House, Cumann na nGaedheal members on this side acquiesced in the Bill, or let it pass through without discussion.  If he was in the House during the passage of that Bill he must have known that the statement is contrary to the fact. I do not suppose that the farming members on this side of the House ever spoke as much on any one measure as on that particular Bill.  And if the Bill emerged from the House in the condition in which it did emerge it was not the fault of the members on this side of the House.  Attempt after attempt was made to amend the Bill in its various sections and while the principle of the Bill may have been all right, we all felt it might be improved. Deputy Cleary went out of his way to make that false statement.  He said to-night: &ldquo;We are getting our innings.&rdquo;  We were appealed to by various members on the Government Benches, and by people outside, to give the Government a chance.  Those who represent country constituencies have given the Government a chance. The Deputy opposite may laugh but this is no laughing matter.  There are no laughing farmers in the country to-night. We were asked to give the Government a chance, and we gave them that chance.  They have only to refer to the daily editions of the newspapers to see what speeches were made down the country.  I can speak for my own, and neighbouring counties, as to the number of speeches we made in opposition to the present Government in the last three months.  They might very well be contrasted with the speeches the Government Party made when they were in opposition with regard to the then Government.  We have not hindered the Government. <Col N="887" /> There has been no Government in the past ten years less hindered than the present Government was.  Deputy Cleary says that they were hindered but we know that they were not.</P>
      <P>We are at the moment considering a supplementary estimate for £100,000 on the Butter Bill.  The Butter Bill, in its original form, was, as some of us expressed it, and as I now repeat, possibly of very little use to the farmer. I said that when I spoke upon the Bill originally, and I repeat it now.  I said that the benefits the farmers could get out of the Bill would be very small and would be less than half what the Minister for Agriculture said they would be.  In the light of the events of the last twenty-four hours, with a certainty of an imposition of 20 per cent. tariff on butter, and all other agricultural produce, it is apparent, to the most childlike farmer, that the Butter Bill is now useless and is scarcely worth considering.</P>
      <P>None of us knows what proposals the President intends to make to the House to-morrow, or to-night, to relieve the situation.  Thousands of farmers who are badly hit are looking to some one for assistance and guidance, and crying out: &ldquo;Is there any balm in Gilead?&rdquo; and it is for the President to answer &ldquo;Never more&rdquo; or some time. The President does not answer.  Before this debate goes much further, and before this motion can be carried, we are entitled to look for some line of policy, for some announcement from the leader of the Government.  Rightly or wrongly, it looks as if we were to be engaged in an economic war.  Deputy Cleary said in his speech that some of us anticipated evil from some proposal brought forward in the House in the last three months.  Perhaps we did.  I was one who did, and perhaps forecasted what the results would be.</P>

      <P>Any Deputy who laughs to-night at the plight of the farmers, the less said about him the better.  I think we should have an intimation of the line of policy that is to be pursued to repair the damage done to the farmer, and to put some hope into his heart, so that he can look forward to something, and can have some hope of finding a way out of the morass into which he has been led by the Party opposite.  We are looking to the President to give us some line of policy that can be adopted for the better guidance of the House.  Until something like that occurs it is useless to be considering this Estimate.  I agree with the proposal of Deputy Cosgrave to refer this Vote back because, in its present form and in the light of the conditions prevailing in the last twenty-four hours, this bounty and this Supplementary Estimate are useless.</P>

We heard all about the reasons why Deputy MacDermot was anxious to approach the two Governments. We never looked for war.  We did not look for this.  This is the result of an action taken by the British Government when the money in dispute is being held in a suspense account and both parties have agreed <Col N="889" /> to arbitration.  England has agreed to arbitration.  She says: &ldquo;All right, arbitrate and anything you like, but I am fit to judge.&rdquo;  We know all about that.  We were not frightened by the big stick before, and the farmers of this country are not frightened by the big stick.  Deputy Bennett said that I laughed at the trouble the farmers were in.  I never did.  I am a farmer myself and have done more to help the farmers, inside and outside this House, than any Deputy on the benches opposite.</P>

      <P>I am endeavouring to answer a few charges made by Deputy Bennett, which undoubtedly are tending at the present moment and have tended to put the farmers into such a state of depression that they are very badly able to meet their liabilities. The farmers know that every year out of their sweat and out of the sweat of their unfortunate children so much loot has to be handed over under Acts of Parliament brought in here by the Opposition when they were in power&mdash;so much loot handed over to landlords to be spent in Monte Carlo or elsewhere.  We all know very well that these unfortunate farmers are put in a practically impossible position to face the present situation or any other situation.  How has the present situation arisen?  These <Col N="890" /> people over there went to England and made secret agreements, or agreements that were never brought before the Dáil for ratification.  Under these agreements this money has been handed over year after year, money provided out of the sweat and the blood of the unfortunate farmers. These were agreements that they did not dare bring before the representatives of the people for ratification, agreements that were found in the pigeon holes of the Department out of which they were kicked.  Their existence was not known of until they were found in the pigeon holes of the Departments out of which these gentlemen were kicked.</P>
      <P>We are now trying to face up to that position, trying to retrieve the money that has been robbed, I cannot call it anything else, out of the pocket of the unfortunate farmer and we have an attempt made to stampede the people of the country.  We had inquiries here for the last fortnight from Deputy McGilligan and others &mdash;information on this and information on that.  What information was given to the people of the country when that secret agreement was signed in 1923 handing over the annuities? When was that agreement placed before the people of the country?  When did the people learn about the agreement? They learned about it when it was found in the pigeon holes of the Department, when the late Executive Council moved out.  They left this legacy after them.  It is on that secret agreement that Thomas is basing his claim to the annuities, an agreement never brought for ratification before the Dáil.  I can assure Deputies opposite that they have not succeeded in stampeding the people as they succeeded in stampeding the people into accepting the Treaty in 1921.  They are not going to succeed now.  We hear any amount of talk about this imposition, this tariff and that tariff.  The people of this country are well able to stand up to any big stick that will be used.  I saw creameries burned down and closed in 1919, 1920 and 1921.</P>

      <P>And the people existed, carried on and recovered.  England did not succeed, nor did the Tans succeed in stampeding the people.  They will not succeed this time in stampeding the people.  If England chooses to put on a tariff on our agricultural produce going into that country, it is not going to be an unmixed evil, not by any manner of means.  If it changes the farmers of this country or the whole people of the country from being totally dependent on Britain for their economic existence, it will be a good day's work. If it teaches the people of this country that, that they are not going to place their whole reliance on a country that has kept them for the last 700 or 800 years as the hewers of wood and the drawers of water, keeping a kitchen garden for the British people&mdash;if it changes that policy, it will not be an unmixed evil.  The Executive Council will meet that position as it should be met.  We have decided that we are not going to hand over the money, the money dragged out of the sweat and the labour of the underpaid labourers and the farmers' sons and daughters. If we have decided that that money is not going to be handed over any longer to Britain, well, then, a good day's work has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter has been offered for arbitration to any fair court, but what was the result of that offer? &ldquo;You can arbitrate; we will send over another Feetham.  You can arbitrate and we will pick the judge.&rdquo;  I remember reading a statement made on one occasion by Deputy Blythe when he told us that the sentence which was to be imposed upon him by a certain judge was decided upon a fortnight before he was brought before the judge for sentence.  I suppose this matter has been already decided.  If we had fallen into the trap and agreed to let John Bull appoint a judge he would decide the case, but, thank God, we have an Executive Council in office now who are men enough to stand up to it, who are not going to adopt the policy of saying that England is a big country.  We are no longer going to crawl.  I am very glad that the day has come when the people of this <Col N="892" /> country elected an Executive Council and a Government that will not crawl. We are sick of all this thing.  I am not at all surprised, I actually expected, that this would be the first move, and I had every right to expect it.  It would be disgraceful of Thomas to let down his advisers.  It would be a disgraceful act on his part if he did not take the advice so freely tendered to him during the last twelve months by those on the Front Benches of the Opposition.  It would be a shabby thing if he did not at least try the bluff that they advised him to try.  Every single speech that came from that Front Bench on the annuity question was: &ldquo;Oh, John Bull will put on a tariff on cattle.&rdquo;  Surely to goodness it would be a mean and shabby thing for John Bull if he had not taken the advice.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that that bluff will be called.  I have the utmost confidence that the Executive Council will meet the case.  I must say that I did not expect much from the Front Bench opposite.  They have gone too far to be brought back, but I did expect something from the few bright spots Deputy Kiersey alluded to some time ago when I challenged the Opposion that they did not give us any help in relieving unemployment.  Deputy Kiersey then told us: &ldquo;A few of us did.  A few of us went into the Lobby with the Government on the Butter Bill.  A few helped to relieve unemployment, a few of us were anxious to assist the Government.&rdquo;  Is there any one of these bright spots left to-night? If so, I hope that they will be a little vocal.  I hope that when this Vote comes up for decision they will take the national side and the Irish side, for there are only two sides in this fight to-day&mdash;those who are for Ireland and those who are against her. We hear a lot of talk about the British market.  I challenge any single farmer listening to me to say that he can produce cattle for the price he was getting in the market for the last five or six months or even for the past twelve months for that matter.  The bad prices paid during the last three or four months in particular are being definitely used by the scaremongers of <Col N="893" /> Cumann na nGaedheal down the country.  &ldquo;That is a de Valera fair,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;look at the prices.&rdquo;  Compare the prices here during the last three months with the prices the Ulster farmers got.  Our prices compare very favourably with the price that the Ulster farmers got.  When we come to consider the position now, the first thing we have got to realise is that the farmers could not continue to hand over the annuities each year to Britain and produce the cattle for the price Britain was prepared to pay.  I, for one, would as soon go down, straight off the reel, as be starved to death by slow degrees.  That is what was happening the farmers during the last three years of Cumann na nGaedheal rule.  Each year you had bigger difficulty in collecting the rates and in getting in the annuities, because each year the farmers are getting poorer and poorer.  This total dependence on the English market had to end somewhere, sometime.  Difficult and all as the situation may be, I, for one, am glad the crisis has come and that it will be ended once and for all.  I am glad that we have at the helm a man who steered us through difficult positions before when there was a crisis in this country.  When the might of England was being used before, we had Eamon de Valera chosen by the people to lead them in that fight.  I am glad he is in the position to-day to see that fight to a successful conclusion. If England wants to fight, then England can have a fight.  So far as this tariff is concerned, I challenge Farmer Deputies opposite to say that they can produce a fat lamb at £1 or at 15/- or 16/- and pay annuities and rates.  Let us have this thing out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That clears the air.  If that is the position, then it would only be a matter of time until the farmer went &ldquo;wallop&rdquo; anyway.  I suggest that the first thing the Government responsible should do is to hold these annuities at home, since the farmer cannot afford to pay them, and see that those annuities are transferred to the farmers' pockets as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have other means and other ways of meeting this question.  What is the position of John Bull at the moment?  We buy from John Bull about five million pounds worth more than he buys from us.  If I was sending my butter and eggs every week into a grocer and getting 30s. for them and if I were buying £2 worth of goods from the grocer, which of the two of us could afford to fall out?  That is the present position.  John Bull says: &ldquo;You can keep your butter and eggs at home.&rdquo;  We will tell him that he can keep his groceries at home.  I have put the situation as clearly and fairly as I can.  There are only two sides to this quarrel.  On one side, are those who are for Ireland and on the other are those who are against her.  Ireland should have first claim on us.  When we realise that, it is our bounden duty to stand by Ireland in this quarrel. The quarrel has not been of our seeking. We have offered to put this case to arbitration because we know we will win before any fair tribunal in the world.  If we get a fair and impartial tribunal, we will win out with flying colours in spite of all that has been done by the Front Bench opposite.  If <Col N="896" /> England is sure of her case or if she has any case, what objection can she have to bringing that case before any man for judgment?  Why confine the tribunal within certain limits?  But England says, &ldquo;Yes, you can have a court to try it, but I will pick the judge.&rdquo;  Is there any Deputy on the Opposition Benches who is going to stand for that, who is going to stand for a packed jury or a packed court, for that is what this amounts to?  I am making a fair appeal to them, and, as I said, this is a fight as between those who are for Ireland and those who are against Ireland, and this is a time when every man who is for Ireland should support the Government elected by the Irish people to see this fight through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise principally to suggest that this is a debate in which we should hear from the President or from a member of the Front Bench. The Vote before the House is not a Vote that, in the circumstances, could be expected to go through as a matter of course.  The appearance of the situation is, and I think it must be so to everybody, that the scheme for which the Vote is now taken is useless. If there is something that we do not know that would make the Vote still of some value, I think we should hear it.  Perhaps the Government have some plans, and if they have plans that have any bearing on this situation, even though we may not hear them in detail, we should have some outline of them now.  There is going, unless something is happening about which we do not know, to be a 20 per cent. tariff on butter.  With that 20 per cent. tariff, the position is going to be worse than the position which the scheme was designed to remedy, and it would seem to any person that it is absurd for the Government which has brought that position into being, and which has brought about the imposition of that 20 per cent. tariff, to go on with this scheme for improving the price of butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would seem to me that the first thing for them to do was to take steps to see that there was not an imposition of 20 per cent.  There has been a great deal of talk here about <Col N="897" /> the national view and about the two sides, and so on, but there is no question of national principle involved here.  At most, this whole question of the annuities is a question of accountancy on a large scale.  It is the question of the lending and paying back of money, of the transfer of various liabilities and the cancelling of certain liabilities.  There is no question of principle whatever involved in it, and if a man believes that the money is payable to Great Britain, he is not being a bad Irishman in saying it, no more than a man is being a bad Englishman if he says the money is not payable to Great Britain.  This is a matter on which everybody is fully entitled to look at the facts, and to say what he thinks, and not have his patriotism called into question.  I do not need to go into it now, but I have frequently said that, in my opinion, these annuities are legally and morally due to the funds to which they have been going, but that is not the view taken by the Government.  I think it is wrong for Deputy Corry, or whatever Deputy it was, to say that the Free State, acting through the present Government has not provoked the present position.  I think it is perfectly clear that the Free State has provoked the present position, because, while negotiations in respect of arbitration were still going on, they have departed from the <i>status quo.</i>  They have withheld the payments always being made under previous agreements and under legislation.  They have forced the British Government, for the first time to draw on its own Exchequer to pay the interest on money loaned to the Irish farmer, and to meet a liability that it never heretofore had to meet, and therefore, it seems to me perfectly clear that the provocation is on our side, and that, even on the Government's own thesis, there was no justification, up to the present for the withholding of these land annuities and for the putting of them into a Suspense Account.</P>
    <P>Holding the Government's view, a situation and time might have come when the action they have taken would <Col N="898" /> have been justified.  Holding their view, I say that if they had said to the British Government: &ldquo;We do not believe that we ought to pay these liabilities, and we want to discuss the matter,&rdquo; and if the British Government had said: &ldquo;We will not discuss it; we will not go into it at all.  It is closed&rdquo;; if, after efforts to get them to negotiate, the British Government had refused, then, as I say, the Government would have been justified in this step.  If, when the question of arbitration had been raised, after negotiation, the British Government had declined any arbitration, and had declined after repeated pressure, the Government would have been justified, or if arbitration had been agreed to, and a long period of negotiation had passed, without any possibility of arriving at agreement, in regard to terms of reference or personnel, then a position would have been reached in which the Government, taking their own ground, would have been justified in withholding the annuities; but things being as they are, very little time having passed and very little negotiation having taken place, with very little attempt to reach accommodation, and having regard to the fact that the agreement was made a long time ago, and that legislation was passed making it operative, it certainly was a provocative act, and, in my opinion, an unjustified act, on the part of this Government, instead of paying these annuities, which they had collected for the purpose of paying the interest on the land stock, to put them into a Suspense Account.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Government have plans, but, if I am to judge from the speeches of back benchers, I gather that the Government have plans for making the position worse&mdash;for having an economic war along the whole front, and for having a campaign of attrition, with some idea of trying to damage the British more than they have damaged us, and without any regard to the further ill effects that that campaign on our part will have on our own people.  Instead of having that policy, if that is their policy, I think they ought to adopt the policy of preventing our goods from being shut <Col N="899" /> out of the British market, and of preventing the loss of goodwill and custom, and the changing of habit, and of preventing all the damage to our economic future that will happen.  As I say, there is no matter of national principle here.  It is all a matter of pounds, shillings and pence, and it is absurd to look on it in any other way.  When the national right to rule here was challenged, when it was a question of getting rid of the British troops, we were up against two things that could not be weighed one against the other. The economic loss in those circumstances did not matter.  There was a great national principle that had to be vindicated, but here it is only a question of pounds, shillings and pence, and the question of whether this policy will be more economically beneficial to the country than the other policy.  I certainly think that whatever may be the ultimate fate of the land annuities, whatever may be the ultimate decision in regard to them, it is bad policy for the Government here to provoke an economic war, as they have provoked it if it takes place, and to take no steps, even at this stage, to avert it. I think their duty is to take these steps and not to plunge the country further into a struggle, in which, at any rate, we can less afford to bear the loss than the other side.</P>
    <P>There was a great deal of talk about whether or not the farmer could afford to pay the annuities and that is quite a separate and distinct question.  All along the Government has been saying, not that they cannot pay, but &ldquo;We will collect&rdquo;&mdash;which seemed to indicate that they believed the farmer could pay&mdash;and &ldquo;we will not transmit.&rdquo; If it is a question of making an <i>ad misericordiam</i> appeal, as many countries in difficulty have had to make, it is quite a different matter, but we are not dealing with that now, and if an <i>ad misericordiam</i> appeal should become necessary, we are prejudicing, by this particular policy that has been adopted, the prospects of getting any results in any negotiations that might take place along that line.  It would be better, instead of having these irresponsible and foolish speeches from the <Col N="900" /> Back Benches in this matter, that members of the Government should speak and that we should have the real issues dealt with; that we should have the matter, which I say is a matter of accountancy, dealt with on the economic plane, and none of this flagwagging and attempts to get up some sort of a war spirit and lead the country into evils into which there is no need to lead it.  I would ask that members of the Government should address the House.  They should not be prepared to go on, apparently, as if nothing had happened, and to expect the House to go on as if nothing had happened.  What has happened is a very big thing.  There may be negotiations going on that I know nothing about but, on the assumption that no negotiations are going on, what has happened is a very big thing, and may be a much bigger thing very soon, and a thing that will lead the country into complete bankruptcy and into a sort of chaos.</P>
    <P>I do hope the Government do not want to shatter this world to bits in order to mould it nearer to their heart's desire, that they do not want to bring about chaos in order to put some of their theories into practice.  I hope they want to cause the least possible suffering to the people of the country, and if they do want to cause the least possible suffering to the country, then they ought to begin here and now by facing the issue as it presents itself on this Estimate.  They should continue to face it in some sort of a realistic spirit, and we should not have any talk about &ldquo;Black and Tan&rdquo; sufferings, or the &ldquo;big stick,&rdquo; or anything like that.  Let us face the exact facts. What has happened is that we have held back money that the British regard as owing to them; that up to this this country has always regarded as owing to them, and the British Government have simply taken steps to recoup themselves.  There is no more in it than that so far.  It is the first exchange of blows if you like.  It might become very much bigger, and I think that the Government certainly ought not to allow it to become very much bigger.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into details on <Col N="901" /> the question of a tribunal.  I think there is no difference in the tribunal.  I think a Commonwealth tribunal would probably, in all the circumstances, and in view of the sort of argument that Fianna Fáil as a Government have put up, be a more favourable tribunal, because as anybody knows that sort of argument would be much more likely to appeal to a British jurist, or a jurist trained in British law, than to an international jurist.  I think the Commonwealth tribunal would be more satisfactory, but, at any rate, if the Government are not going to agree to that tribunal, they ought to take steps to see that this economic war is not started until negotiations have gone a bit further.  Mention has been made of Mr. Justice Feetham.  Mr. Justice Feetham was the appointee of the British Government.  As far as I know, there has been no proposal in this case that the British Government should appoint the chairman.  Of course, anybody knows that the fortunes of litigation, like the fortunes of war, are very uncertain, and that no matter where the judge may come from you may get an unfavourable result.  The analogy of the Boundary Tribunal is of no value. I do not believe the present Government think that.  I believe, in fact, that they have other reasons for making difficulties about the personnel. These are face-saving difficulties.  I believe they want, if they agree to a tribunal, to have a grievance, so that they may be able to do something else afterwards.</P>

      <P>Any statement made will.  I am confident have that effect. The farmers have had bitter experience during the last ten years of the problem <Col N="902" /> of how to make ends meet.  Dairy farming has practically gone into bankruptey. Nobody knows that better than the Deputies opposite.  Deputies and farmers know what sum of public money was spent by the late Minister for Agriculture in endeavouring to foster that industry, depending at the same time upon the English markets for the sale of the produce.  We know what sum of money was spent in that endeavour, and we know with what results. The farmers realise that the Fianna Fáil Government have honestly endeavoured to meet the problem as it confronted them.  The farmers are not whining, as a Deputy opposite said, or calling out like a voice in the wilderness for some hope from this Dáil.  I have received letters within the last few days, and to-day I received wires, from farmers keenly interested in the dairying industry and in the other ends of farming.  These men supported the Cumann na nGaedheal at the last election. The purport of the messages sent to me was &ldquo;Let the Government hold firm in their present attitude; we are with them.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I appreciate the attempt to throw that indignity on the farmers when Deputies opposite want to create a scare.  The farmers are not appealing in that whining voice, calling upon the Government to make a surrender at the threat of reprisals by an outside country.  They are prepared to do now what they did on many occasions before, they are prepared, if needs be, to make sacrifices in the fight that is being made, and the farmers know that the present fight will be ultimately in their interests.  I want to vindicate the character of the farmers and to stand up for them against Deputies opposite who are endeavouring to vilify them.  Deputy Blythe said the Government had brought about this new tariff of 20 per cent.  I refuse to believe that.  I assert that the tariff is directly the result of the action of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party when it was the Government. That 20 per cent. tariff is the result of the secret agreement made <Col N="903" /> by the representatives of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, as was pointed out by Mr. Thomas when he was asked on what basis he made his claim for payment of the land annuities. We are endeavouring to rectify that secret contract.  Deputy McGilligan quoted a statement made by the Minister for Agriculture in speaking upon the Butter Bill in this House, that he refused to believe that a tax would be put by England on the butter going into that country.  What was Deputy McGilligan's prophecy then?  What was the prophecy of other Deputies opposite?  Are they satisfied now that their prophecy has been fulfilled? Most men are satisfied when they can point to their prophecy being fulfilled.</P>

It was to the effect that a tariff would be imposed by England upon these products.  As prophets, they are justified.  Are Deputies over there proud of that fact?

I may tell you the farmers are satisfied to leave this matter in the hands of a Government which has already shown itself to be the friend of the farmers.  What is your policy? Is it merely the policy &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;?  So far as I have heard from any Deputy opposite, that is the only policy that has been advocated.  They are the proud men in the proud position of being able to say, &ldquo;We are justified.  Three years back we told you this would happen and to-night is our triumph.&rdquo;  Could England have done other than she has done in this matter?  Could any popularly elected Government in any country, in view of the attitude taken up by the Opposition here, who form a substantial number of the representatives in this House, say to their people: &ldquo;We will refuse to collect those three millions a year&rdquo;?

    <P>No Government, no matter what their views are, could, in face of the position that exists here, have done other than the British Government have done unless they desired to court absolute defeat at the hands of the electors.  I hope the Deputies on the Opposition Benches are satisfied with their victory to-night.  They are in the extraordinary position that, having brought themselves to the point when they might flatter themselves on their triumph, in order to save themselves from their own act they dare not do it publicly.  Supposing that we accepted the alternative as we know it, supposing you succeeded in your effort, your immediate effort, to unseat the present Government, and supposing you come back to office, what have we to face?  We have to face the payment of the land annuities regularly to England, the payment of other <Col N="905" /> debts, and the withdrawal of the tariffs that have created employment in this country.</P>

      <P>I cannot bring myself to rejoice with Deputy Corry that such a crisis has come on our people. We have heard in the course of this debate back bench speeches from Deputies of the Government Party and we have had absolute silence on the part of the men whose duty it is to give a lead in such a crisis.  We have seen a clear exhibition of a shirking of responsibilities, of trying to draw without giving the lead.  In that they are consistent.  As long as this House has been in existence, on every question that came before the House for discussion, <Col N="906" /> be it great or small, a member of the Government has always been one of the first of his Party to express the policy of his Government on the situation that existed, such as it was. We have seen to-night back benchers put up one by one, their speeches calculated not to assist this crisis towards solution in one way or another but calculated deliberately to try and make this an issue between the Government and Cumann na nGaedheal.  When each one of them in a laborious way attempted to make this a Party issue, he did it to the cry &ldquo;This is a question between England and Ireland.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If ever I listened to three speeches calculated to stir up dissension and controversy amongst people of the same country they were the three speeches I listened to from that side to-night.  I think it is regrettable, when our farmers are faced with a situation that may mean the absolute extermination of their trade, certainly the total extermination of their export trade if this situation is prolonged, that we should have such speeches delivered here.  I think at least we should get something better than violent and heated Party provocative speeches.  Such speeches might have been excused when the Deputies opposite were in opposition, but I think it is unseemly, and I think it shows a total disregard of their responsibilities as belonging to the Government Party, for any Deputies to make the despicable type of speeches that we have listened to to-night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Phrases were slung across the House about secret agreements, about the events of 1920 and 1921, about a secret agreement in the year 1923 which was so secret that it was discussed in this House in April, 1923, when these same Deputies who are now talking were referring to this House as being the home of national apostates.  If we are going to have that kind of thing, let us have it to and fro.  Let us have the truth.  If Deputies opposite are the least bit interested in the matter, will they look up the Dáil Debates for the year 1923?  If they do they will see there that a full and adequate <Col N="907" /> discussion took place in reference to that particular agreement.</P>
    <P>We have a situation brought about in our country that has been provoked by absolute bundling and mishandling of a rather delicate situation; and when such a situation comes to its natural and logical end we have the complete failure of the Government Ministers even to take a lead in discussing it.  We have a complete running away from the situation.  We have a promise from back bench supporters of the Government that a Bill will be introduced to deal with the situation.  Presumably a case of attempting to feed the dog with a bit of its own tail; presumably attempting to try to subsidise for the loss of exports.  This is the situation for the unfortunate Irish farmer, who is expected to pay his annuities to two Governments and, when, in addition to paying these annuities twice he is supposed to pay the cost of administering an Act of that kind on this side and to pay for the cost of collection on the other side.</P>
    <P>Is it not time that we began to grapple with the realities of the situation? It is rather unfortunate that the Minister for Agriculture is abroad, because I really think that the Minister for Agriculture was genuinely concerned for the interests of the farmer and I feel that if the Minister for Agriculture were present here to-night whether in the Dáil or behind the scenes, he would be man enough to put down his foot and to say that this threatened situation must be averted, even at the cost of political complications.  I think if we sit down either inactive or if we pass a Bill that is to become another retaliation Bill, if we launch out on an intensive economic war in which the farmers of Ireland will be the casualties so glibly referred to by the Minister for Industry and Commerce a few weeks ago, we are embarking on a futile and suicidal policy, a policy which if we lend ourselves to it we will deserve every hard thing that will be said about us by posterity in this country.  Are <Col N="908" /> we to go on attempting to make into a national issue a mere squabble about finance as to whether agreements are to be maintained, or if this agreement shall be interpreted as a previous agreement, where one side is put in a position to defy the other and merely settle the point by saying &ldquo;what we have we hold?&rdquo; This is the situation that has come about.</P>
    <P>We on these benches have been jibed at because we had a certain amount of foresight and because we had a certain amount of vision.  I venture to say that there is no intelligent man interested in this question for years back that did not, in his own mind, foresee that such a situation would arise if we insisted, in the absence of agreement, in closing down on the payment of those annuities. I pay this compliment to the members of the Front Bench opposite that there was not one of them then that did not from time to time think of the possibility of such a step being taken.  I certainly know that the Minister for Industry and Commerce on various occasions admitted that such a situation as this was before the country.  But he dealt with it along the lines of telling his poor deluded audience that the British Government would never tax the Englishman's dinner table.  He said: &ldquo;Put that out of your minds; such steps would never be taken by any British Government.&rdquo;</P>

Now a situation has arisen, and it is purely a case of what is best to be done in the new circumstances that have arisen.  We are asked by the Fianna Fáil back benchers what is our policy in the matter.  For ten years we were in the position of being obliged to frame and state a policy on every crisis that arose in the country.  That responsibility was never shirked even for an hour.  Some man, some one of the Government Front Bench at all times stood up and gave a lead in the debate.  Never were the whole Government Front Bench seen to shirk that <Col N="909" /> issue.  They were always prepared to lead the House.  Never did they refuse to give a lead.  This is the first time of a real crisis in this country where we have back-sliding from an Irish Government, where there has been no attempt to announce policy.  We are asked what our policy is.  Our policy when we were the Government of the country was this: that obligations entered into had got to be honoured, and if there was a difference between the interpretation of agreements then that difference should be cleared up by frank discussion, frank, manly and open discussions between the parties, and if that failed by arbitration.</P>

      <P>The <i>personnel</i> of an arbitration court may be important, but I do not think that the geographical address of any of the members of the court is worth jeopardising the trade of the Irish farmer about.  I do not think that the particular town or village or country that an honest man comes from is worth jeopardising the whole butter and cattle trade of this country for.  We heard some talk about ambiguity last evening.  It is about time that ambiguity and phrase-coining and hair-splitting were removed out of the national life of the country and that where so distressingly serious a situation has arisen that we should be men enough to think of the human beings depending on us.  We should be able to do that even at the sacrifice of a little bit of prestige.  We should be able to get down to facts, to get to work, to cease quibbling about geographical places and to get this matter settled according to the judgment and honesty of the members of the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even in the next 24 hours every effort should be made by the Government of this country to bring the arbitration up to a point and to endeavour to get this Order suspended; and not have it put into operation pending the decision of that court.  Every one of us knows that it is easy enough to lose a market.  You can lose a market in one night by one <Col N="910" /> false step, and having lost it, it will take you ten long years to win it back again.  If we let the Dane and the Dutch and the Norwegian poach on our market for one month, a long decade will not oust them out of that market again.  Those are the things that matter.  It is not a case of one party trying to score off another party. There are twenty-four hours to go and during those twenty-four hours every effort of the Government and of those who maintain the Government in power must be directed towards trying to get an agreed tribunal, as against the suspension of the operation of this Order, until a decision of that court is arrived at.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I deplore the events which have led up to this action on the part of the British Government, because it is a stroke at this country at a time when it is least able to bear it. It would be an unheard of thing if a responsible Government did not warn the people against the consequences of hostile action, such as retaining the land annuities would be, towards the British people.  We know what an effect it would have on the minds of these people when carrying on their commercial relations, upon which the very life of this country depends. What are the consequences of the action of the British Government in imposing duties amounting to twenty per cent.?  It means that in our cattle trade alone two millions of money, at least, is going to be taken out of the pockets of Irish farmers.  It means a loss to the trade which is most vital to us, and upon which this country depends. Farmers will hold their cattle, if they possibly can, when they know that people in the cattle trade will deduct the twenty per cent. from the price paid for them.  Every other commodity which we export to the British market is taxed to a like extent.  It means that when we sell our exportable surplus we will lose the same percentage.  No matter what we say, the percentage will be deducted on our exports to the British market.  The full amount of this tax will be deducted from every item which is purchased from Irish farmers, and that will mean <Col N="911" /> a consequent reduction in their incomes. What action is the Government of this country capable of taking?  They have taken action already in taxing every commodity which we buy from England.  Therefore the British are not in a position to fear retaliation from us.  I feel that there is a very serious time in front of the Irish farmers. If our markets were reduced by international competition to a very low level, however low the level, we must sell there.  With the twenty per cent. tax we will lose a further sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the serious position with which this country is faced, and with which our markets are faced, it is up to the Government to endeavour to secure arbitration on the issue involved by every means in its power.  Surely it is not impossible in countries such as South Africa, India and other nations in the Commonwealth to find three representatives to do justice to this country on an issue that is so vital to its welfare. As the matter stands now, with the deduction of the tax, and the loss of the English markets, it means so much more of an opening for the nations in the Commonwealth that export to the British market.  That will completely undo our position so far as that market is concerned.  I do not see any alternative markets.  We will be reduced to the position of endeavouring to consume our own products. There is not here a population large enough to do so.  What will be the inevitable result?  It means that prices will slump far below the cost of production.  It has been put up to us that we cannot produce cattle at the present market prices. What will be the consequences now? Must the losses not inevitably be greater when farmers have to sell in order to pay, not alone their land annuities and rates but the various outgoings which are incidental to the economic working of a farm?  They must sell, and must sell at the figure which the buyer will give.  I think there is at any rate a mandate for arbitration.  I would ask the government to exercise their powers in that respect, and to submit this dispute <Col N="912" /> to a tribunal which they believe will be fair.  Before a jury is empanelled an opportunity is given to challenge a particular member of it.  Surely a jury can be agreed upon which will settle this dispute to the advantage of two countries which naturally should be friendly towards each other. Our interests depend entirely upon friendly negotiations and upon a friendly settlement of any dispute.  I think the Government will not be serving the best interests of the people if they do not explore every avenue in order to secure arbitration in this matter.</P>

      <P>It is a rather interesting thing to be taunted with sitting silent while Deputies on the opposite benches are speaking.  We had that experience for many years.  We had to speak on very important questions, and generally one Minister was sitting here paying no attention whatever to what was being said.  Apparently the Deputies on the opposite benches were very glad to stand up.  There was no hesitation about it.  They wanted this debate to-night.  They would not wait until to-morrow, when there would be the ordinary opportunity when the measure that the Government is bringing in, in relation to the present crisis, will be before the House.  Why then should we not give them an opportunity of saying the things they want to say?  They wanted to give a lead; to tell the country we were down and out, and in a miserable position; to tell the people that they were misled, and to ask the people to despair, because a nation near-by wishes to bully them, to take away their rights, and to dictate the court by which they are to take away these rights.  Some of the Deputies opposite said that this is a mere petty matter, merely a matter of pounds, shillings and pence.  It is rather unfortunate that human beings have somehow to work out their material existence on an economic basis of one kind or another in pounds, shillings and pence.  Yet we are told that pounds, shillings and pence are <Col N="913" /> mere matters.  I think it was a Deputy on the opposite benches who spoke of the Deputies there as being realists all the time, while we were the people who were talking about airy sentiment.  It would be all very well, said Deputy Blythe, if this were a national question. Is it of no importance to the people to be robbed every year of £5,000,000 which they have to find? Is is of no importance to the people to be robbed every year of £5,000,000 that they think is theirs? £5,000,000 a year means something to our people, and the people who should best appreciate it are the gentlemen on the opposite benches if there is anything like realism or truth in their pretences that they are the realists.  Of course, they are trying to put the Government in the wrong and pretend that it has led the people blindly into this position.  We have done nothing of the kind.  This position, as was admitted, was bound to occur, or something like it was bound to occur, if we were really determined to stand by our rights.  Was it to be thought that Britain which is getting quite easily five and three quarter or five and a third million pounds directly from us would give it up, if they thought that by bullying us a little we would abandon our rights and continue to pay without demurring as we have paid in the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us see what exactly has happened. For years sums have been paid to the British Government, which, in our opinion, and in the opinion of those who have examined it, were not legally or morally due to Britain. The various sums we have paid for the period of years since the Free State was established have amounted to over £51,000,000.  This is not a new measure. We debated it throughout the election time, and showed what that drain of money meant to our people.  We pointed out to them that the total cost of the Shannon Works scheme&mdash;great as that enterprise was&mdash;that the construction part of it did not cost us more than we are paying every year on the head of these payments.  We are handing over, therefore, to Britain, as the result of the policy of the present Opposition, sums every year the <Col N="914" /> amount of which is equal to the sum that was paid for the construction works of the Shannon scheme.  Is that a light matter?  Is it something we ought to continue to put up with when there is a remedy for it and when that money, we feel, is not due?  I have frequently pointed out during the debate on this matter in the country that, as the relative capacity of Britain to ourselves for bearing burdens was estimated by the British Treasury, as being 66 to 1 our total payments during the period of ten years to Britain have been equivalent to a payment by Britain of the colossal sum of £3,400,000,000.  If Great Britain had paid £3,400,000,000, and if they felt that that sum was not legally due by them, do you think that there would be any party in Britain who would act as the present Opposition here is acting? £3,400,000,000 is the equivalent that Britain would have had to pay if she were to pay the sum that we have to pay.  Take it the other way&mdash;per year. Britain's capacity again is 66 to 1.  That is their own estimate of it.  A payment of £5,000,000 by us is equivalent to an annual payment of £330,000,000.  If Britain were annually paying away to another country the sum of £330,000,000 would there be any party in Britain to stand up and say: &ldquo;This is not a national question.  It is a mere matter of pounds shillings and pence&rdquo; if you please?  When there was a question of £2,000,000 for Britain itself&mdash; £2,000,000 for the country whose annual revenue is £770,000,000&mdash;Mr. Snowden went over to France, or rather I think it was to Belgium, and fought there for that £2,000,000, and was acclaimed a national hero when he came back.  If he had gone over and tried to fight for £330,000,000 instead of £2,000,000, would there have been some party in the British House of Commons to stand up and say that he was not fighting for a national principle, that he should not make a national fight of it, and that it was a matter of mere pounds, shillings and pence?</P>
    <P>I have said at the start that there was no person in this country who did not realise that, if we were serious in this matter, we would have to face a situation such as we are facing.  I <Col N="915" /> certainly realised it.  And in order that there might be no doubt whatever about it, we put it down in our election programme in very definite terms as one of the things we intended to do.  We said that we intended to remove the Oath&mdash;and the Oath is gone&mdash;Seanad or no Seanad.  We said we were going to hold the land annuities until Britain proved in a fair court her right to them.  And we are going to hold the land annuities.  Who has acted provocatively in this matter? We are accused on the opposite benches of acting provocatively because we did not continue the work, which they had initiated, of making payments which we did not think were due from us.  The Irish people are under no misapprehension about our attitude on that matter.  We told them at the election time that if they wanted seriously to hold these annuities, they would have, as a nation, to do what a private individual would do under similar circumstances.  What would a private individual would do under that he was paying sums which were not legally due from him?  Would he continue paying them or would he bring the matter to a crisis, and in what way would he bring it to a crisis? He would bring it to a crisis by saying: &ldquo;I will not pay until you prove your case to receive these moneys.&rdquo;  And we have said that.  Of course, the gentlemen on the opposite benches, who have no objection to paying it, do not understand an attitude like that. We should pay, I suppose they would say, &ldquo;without prejudice.&rdquo; Well, I would say this.  There are £51,000,000 gone&mdash;gone, in my opinion, without any just reason for paying them. Britain has received it.  I would like to see us in the position of trying to get that £51,000,000 paid back, and I for one am not going to add to that bill to be got back.  The proper and the right thing to do is to hold these moneys.  We are holding them, and, to show our bona fides, we are putting them in a suspense account.  Despite the efforts of some of the gentlemen on the opposite benches, who are asking the farmers not to pay, we have faced the disagreeable course of demanding <Col N="916" /> payments of these moneys and putting them into the suspense account in order that, if it should be found by any chance that these moneys were due from us, then the money would be there to pay our debt. We are keeping the money there.  Why do we collect it?  Because the money is due to the community as a whole. It is due to the State.  We have always explained that it was due to the State. Gentlemen on the opposite benches want to make it appear that if it was not due to Britain then it was due to nobody.  That is not the position and it never was the position.  It is due by the individual farmers to the State, to the community as a whole, on whose credit partly the moneys were originally advanced.  We have not acted provocatively in this.  We have said to the British, &ldquo;We do not believe this money is due from us; we are prepared to have the matter settled by arbitration; but we are not, in going to arbitration, to be told that we must make our selection from a particular set that may be arranged by another Government&mdash;the other party to the dispute.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I said, in the last despatch to Mr. Thomas, the very essence of arbitration is freedom of choice of nominees by the separate parties.  Our choice, it does not matter how nominated, must be a free choice.  Somebody on the benches opposite said that geographical address does not matter.  Is it not extraordinary how we find Irishmen who always think a thing does not matter if it refers to themselves, and never ask: Why should it matter to the British?  Why should a geographical address matter so much to the British?  If it should not matter to us, it should not matter to them.  We simply say: &ldquo;Let the court be of the general character indicated in the 1930 Conference Report.&rdquo; The only thing we want is that we shall not be restricted in the choice of our nominees.  It would be hard enough to get them outside the countries.  As Deputies know well, we have not the power abroad that the British Government have.  We have not the influence abroad that they have.  We have not the various ways, directly and indirectly, of securing bias in our favour. <Col N="917" /> We are relatively a small country, which British propaganda has misrepresented. We are a country that has been particularly misrepresented in this matter, and even with the whole world to choose from, if we are to get people of the character indicated there, it will be hard enough to get people who will be able to resist such influence as may well be brought to bear upon them.  We have, then, in these circumstances, insisted that we must have freedom of choice.</P>
    <P>The Feetham Commission was spoken about.  I think there is no Irishman who will ever forget that Commission or who will ever again have any confidence in a court of that character.  With that experience before us, we are not, in a matter of such importance to our people, going to restrict our field of choice.  It has been suggested: &ldquo;Oh, if you only went on the plea that you could not pay, then it would be a different matter.&rdquo; If you engineered a scheme by which the annuities were not collected, if you went about and suggested to the farmers not to pay, then you could go over, it is suggested, to the British, and make an <i>ad misericordiam</i> appeal.</P>
    <P>The truth is, it is difficult, almost impossible, for our farmers to pay. We have seen the position with regard to arrears.  We know the several processes and appeals that have had to be resorted to to compel them to pay. We know they paid only after they had tightened their belts, on many occasions, and deprived themselves and their families, very often, of the necessaries of life.  They have struggled under exceptionally trying circumstances to meet these payments.  Because they did that and made these sacrifices, and because the community as a whole has insisted upon these sacrifices being made, they are told they should not make them at all by the very people who say that this money must be paid.  It is suggested to them that they should not make that payment at all and that we should make an <i>ad misericordiam</i> appeal to the British to relieve us of these debts.  If they were proved to be legally due, there might be something to be said for that, but why resort to <Col N="918" /> an <i>ad misericordiam</i> appeal if we have a moral right to retain them? Why should we do that?  It would probably be true to say we would have a better foundation in this country for making such an appeal than countries who are to-day looking for relief of their debts.  We are not making it, simply because there is a ground for getting it as a matter of right and not as a matter of grace.</P>
    <P>The British suggest that they would listen to us and that their attitude would be sympathetic if we made an <i>ad misericordiam</i> appeal.  We are not asking them to show any sympathy whatever, but simply to give us our rights in this matter.  We are asking for a fair court.  We are asking to get the same choice as we are willing to give the other side.  If they say to us that geographical addresses do not matter, we say back to them: &ldquo;It ought not to matter for you either.&rdquo; Let us have fair play.  The moneys are there.  We collected them; they will be there if the matter is to go to arbitration. It is suggested that the farmers or the community will have to pay both ways.  The community will not have to pay both ways.  Under the policy of the previous administration the farmers were paying.  The community were paying five-and-three-quarter millions, all told, of which five-and-one-third went directly to Great Britain.  They were paying that sum out.  The community, as a whole, will not have to pay that twice, because if Britain collects it one way she will not get it the other.  We are not going to pay twice.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that we are trying to work up an economic war.  We are not, but we realise, and our people, who elected us by a majority, and the people who are behind us, the people who would again elect us by a ma-jority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As long as this Government has a majority in this House it will carry out the mandate it fairly got from the people.  Do not forget that.  If the gentlemen across the water think they are going to use this method to beat us, they are making a big mistake.  The Irish people put us in the saddle and we are not going to get out of it, no matter what the gentlemen across the water think.  If they think they can put us out by these methods, they will find that they have mistaken the temper of the Irish people.  They are not going to get the chance.  The Irish people will not be asked, in times like these, to make a choice.  We were given a certain work to do, to defend the interests of the people, and so long as we have a majority in this House, then by every means available to the people, we will defend them.  I have said we are not looking for war in this matter.  We are simply out to maintain our rights by the only way that we have to maintain our rights.  If we surrender now, so sure as we do, whenever an occasion arises again when the British will want to get anything from us, they will use the same methods.  We are going to get out of economic slavery this time.  We may have trouble in doing it.  There will be hardships, no doubt, but there was many an Irishman before who wished to Heaven that an opportunity was given him to end the sort of economic policy that existed in this country in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the Deputies here stated that in the past we were hewers of wood and drawers of water for the British. Our present economic system was the result of their deliberate policy.  It would have taken us many years to change that policy possibly by acts of our own, by deliberate action on our own part.  They are going to do it for us.  If they force us to it, looking to the future and its possibilities, then my prediction is that many a generation of Irishmen will bless the day when the English tried to do this.  Then we will be driven back to what economics should be.  We will be driven back to have our people fed as the first duty of agriculture.  Our own people will be fed.  The hungry people who, in a <Col N="920" /> land of plenty, are unable to get food, with the proper system that may result from this will be able to get food. In the past we were producing at a loss.  Because there was no other direction to turn to we had to continue to produce at a loss until finally whatever little reserves of capital were left to our people were wasted and they were in the position to which they are reduced at present, almost in despair. Our own market was forgotten.  We got from the foreigner the things we could produce ourselves.  If we have to get things from outside the people who want to sell them will be very glad to take our produce in return.  We will be getting back a rational system of economy.  It will take some change from the present system and there is no doubt whatever that it will be difficult.</P>
    <P>Quick changes are difficult.  If we were choosing it, we would choose it by slower methods.  I do not say that the sum total of the slower methods and the inconveniences and distress that might be caused by them would not be greater than it will be by this violent change but we have got to face it. There is no alternative.  The only alternative is to pay away, and to continue to pay away quietly and without protest, these huge sums the amounts of which I have tried to get you to recognise by multiplying them by the factor 66 so that you might realise what they would be in the case of Britain.  Do not think that we are alone in this struggle.  Do not think that we are the only people, if they do try this economic war, who are going to be hurt.  The British people are going to feel it just as much as we are and every day of distress that there is here at the start will mean a day of prosperity for our people in future.  It will mean a proper national economy in future.  It will mean getting more quickly to the point that has been the object of this Party all the time&mdash;to help to get a national system of economy.</P>
    <P>Britain is looking to get her debts cancelled.  There will be many voices raised in the place where she wants to get them cancelled.  There will be <Col N="921" /> many voices raised if she tries this method of extracting unfairly from this people these enormous sums every year.  As I have said, we are not anxious to provoke this war.  We have told the people what their rights were and what they must do if they want to secure their rights.  We are doing that.  The people knew it and, if I know the Irish people, they are going to stand by it.  They know perfectly well what is involved.  They know perfectly well what these payments have meant to them in the past.  We are now, as in the beginning, quite prepared to let this matter go to arbitration, but if other people want to have the choice of court, to have it their own way, then the Irish people are not such fools as to ask us to give way.  I appeal to-night to the Irish people to stand firm.  Messages have come to us asking us, whatever we do, to stand firm.  That is the attitude of the Irish people to-night, and I say to them that is the attitude in which the Government will not fail.  Wherever there is an Irishman throughout the world to-night I appeal to him to stand up for the rights of his motherland.</P>
    <P>Our offer stands as before.  We are prepared to take a fair court, a court in which the British choose two and we choose two, the fifth to be agreed upon.  It will be hard enough to get such a court.  We are not going to admit the principle that that court must be chosen from the part of the world that the British care to prescribe for us and we see no principle that should attach to it.  They say we are members of one family.  Be it so. Suppose we are.  Are there not family quarrel that have to be resolved by submitting them to outside arbitration? Are there not occasions when families, so to speak, are so divided by members taking parts, that whatever might be said for settling the quarrel in the family might have to give way to the higher consideration that as all the members of the family were involved, it were much better to get, and there would be much more likelihood of getting, a fair decision from outside?  I see no principle in the thing.  I see no reason why the <Col N="922" /> British should demand it.  I see no reason why any member on the Opposition Benches should suggest that there is any principle in it that we should accept.</P>
    <P>I know that members on the Opposition Benches on other occasions when such a court was proposed by the British would not have it.  They would not have it in their case.  Why do they want us to have it?  One would think that there was agreement in the 1930 report and that these reports were something binding as if they had been a signed agreement. They have never been accepted even by members on the opposite benches as anything of that character.  All the report said was that it was desirable in certain cases, even in certain classes of cases, that such should be the case but because a thing may in general be desirable, is there any reason why, when there are special circumstances, what might be desirable in general should not be departed from?  I see no matter of principle in it, trying to look at it even from the British point of view of the thing.  Assuming that we were members of one family, if there was a family quarrel, it might be said that it would be better not to bring the thing out in public and, whatever might be said, that it should be decided within the family circle.  In general, that would be a good rule.  I have no doubt that in general it would be a good rule, but I do not see that there is any principle in it in considering that there are certain cases, and this is one, in which it is desirable to go outside the circle. That is our decision and, as I said before, it is irrevocable.  There is no use in raising false hopes about a matter of this kind.  That decision&mdash; that we will not be restricted in choice of personnel&mdash;so far as this Government is concerned, is irrevocable.  Our offer remains&mdash;a fair tribunal.  If it is accepted, there need be no economic war.  We do not desire an economic war.  We do not want to stir up any of this bitterness.  Bitterness is bound to result from any of these measures. I admit that.  It is inevitable.  We do not want to stir that up.  But the alternative is to pay over that money <Col N="923" /> and, believing that that money is not due by us, we do not intend to pay it. We will pay it when, and only when, a court that can be regarded as a fair court has decided that that money is due.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan (Galway) Mr. Hogan (Galway)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Galway): The President probably thinks that he has made something in the nature of a historic or, at least, a courageous speech.  I regard the speech as hysterical and I genuinely regard the speech as cowardly.  We could adopt that attitude, too.  Apparently, patriotism in this country consists in always delivering ultimatums, taking up a fixed attitude, talking big and getting popular applause instead of settling down and trying to solve the details of government, which is much harder, much more humdrum but much more patriotic. Deputies on the opposite benches said that probably we were delighted that our prophecies had come true. Well, we are not delighted.  If there is any man in this country at present who is delighted, that man is a fool. If there is any man belonging to any Party at this moment who is delighted or pleased for any reason, that man is a fool.  We are not justified by what has happened.  I shall put it in another way.  I am afraid that the position that we are in now goes a very long way towards disgracing the country.  I am afraid that the position we are in now goes a considerable distance to furnish evidence&mdash;I say &ldquo;evidence&rdquo;&mdash;for the view that used to be held, that this country is incapable of solving the complex, difficult, ordinary day-to-day problems that self-government involves.  That is the position as I see it.  I do not feel justified by the situation.  No farmer feels justified by the situation. As I see the situation, I believe that if there was an average standard of patriotism, an average standard of understanding and common sense amongst the citizens of the country, of whatever brand of politics, this situation&mdash;the most dangerous situation that has occurred in this country since 1922&mdash;would never have arisen.  That is my view on this question and I have no other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="924" /> I am not the smallest bit impressed with the President's histrionics to-night. I had suspected for some time that the President did not want any settlement.  If that is so, it is a damnable thing.  I am afraid that he is in the position of a man who walks into a hardware shop in a country town and asks for a tractor.  He knows he will not get it.  He knows that if he takes a spade he will have to dig, so he does not ask for that.  I am afraid that the President is not without knowing that there is one slogan that is useful in the country.  That is, &ldquo;Unite behind me and fight the British.&rdquo;  I ask the President is it the consciousness of that that is animating him to-night, or is it the real interests of the country? That is the big problem.  I do not regard fighting the British without good and sufficient reason as good patriotism.  I think this country is in much the same position as are most countries.  Its economic position is getting worse.  I think that position was far better three months ago.  I doubt if the country is able to stand any serious quarrel at the moment.  I am perfectly certain it cannot stand a big political fight and an economic fight at the same time.  That is exactly what the President is heading for.  He is trying to bring about two revolutions.  He is doing that with his eyes open and he calls it patriotism.  He is trying to bring about a political revolution, on the one hand, and an economic revolution, on the other hand.  Does he not know that that cannot be done in present circumstances without the most terrible suffering, the most terrible dislocation and the most terrible loss to the people?</P>
    <P>When the President appealed to the people to-night to stand firm, he reminded me very much of what used to be said in England during the Great War: &ldquo;We will fight to the last Frenchman.&rdquo; Who is going to pay for all these histrionics?  The honest man working down the country will pay. And I want to tell the President that that working man in the country is just as capable of making sacrifices as he ever was, or any member of his Party was.  He is not going to talk to <Col N="925" /> us on these benches, he is not going to talk to me about patriotism.  I have, and we on these benches have, just as good a tradition of patriotism as he has.  And we have no better tradition than the farmers and the rank and file throughout the country, who are going to pay for this and who will receive very little sympathy from President de Valera's histrionics.</P>
    <P>I appeal to President de Valera to face up to this like a man and to start with the intention of coming to some settlement and making some agreement. Let him start from that point of view and take the chance afterwards that he will be able to do the ordinary, humdrum work of government.  Let him give up the old view, &ldquo;When in domestic difficulties make a foreign quarrel&rdquo;&mdash;when you want to avoid difficulties at home about humdrum matters of government, when you want to avoid dealing with the ordinary requirements of the people, make a foreign quarrel and ask the country to unite behind you.  That is a cowardly attitude, and no amount of histrionics will make it anything else than a cowardly attitude.  I say that President de Valera has a chance at present that very few leaders had.  He could settle the whole thing, and settle it on good terms.  We are not in a position to settle it.  He knows that.  We did our work in our time.  We got a certain distance.  We took the consequences of our actions and we brought this country a long distance economically. You are in a position&mdash;if you are the man to take advantage of it&mdash;to make a great settlement for this country. You are in a stronger and in a better position to make a great settlement for this country than we are, if you couch your terms to enable you to do that. I tell you that the real patriotism is to drop your histrionics and get down to that.</P>
    <P>We were told that the farmer is unable to pay.  The point of view was also put forward that, after all, this may be a blessing in disguise?  What may be a blessing in disguise?  Am I listening to responsible men?  The abandonment of a market which is worth £30,000,000 may be a blessing in disguise!  On what basis or on what <Col N="926" /> principle, could that be a blessing in disguise?  I can understand the President of the Government wishing to change the economy of this country. While I do not agree with that policy in some respects, I ask: Why not do that and hold your market as well?  It can be done.  When, in times like these, a responsible member of the Government gets up and lightly says that the abandonment of a market worth £30,000,000 may be a blessing in disguise, I begin to despair of the country.  I say that this man should not be in the Government, and I say that, with this attitude of the Government, there is a very poor look-out for the country.  I cannot believe&mdash; there ought to be some business men in the Government, men who have some experience of dealing with affairs &mdash;that that is a settled, convinced conviction of the present Government. Look around at statesmen all over the world seeking markets everywhere. What would America give for a market which to her would be so big?  What would England give for a market which to England would be so big?  What would France, or any country that is trying to keep things going, trying to keep the social structure going, give for such a market, and here we are in this country alone adopting a totally different attitude and lightly talking in these times of being able to afford to drop a market worth £30,000,000, and saying that it is a blessing in disguise.  I know the President suggested at one time &ldquo;We will hold on and change the economy,&rdquo; but now that is all changed.  &ldquo;This may be a blessing in disguise&rdquo;&mdash;I do not mind that from Deputy Corry, who half suggested it, but imagine that coming from the President of the country in this year and in these conditions.</P>
    <P>Now we are told that they are going to make no <i>ad misericordiam</i> appeal to the English Government.  They were not asked.  We were told that it was stated from these benches that this financial matter is of no importance. Nothing of the kind was ever stated. It is an important question, of course. The payment of £5,000,000 is an important question.  Of course, it is, but <Col N="927" /> what was stated was that we declined to accept that the patriotism is all on one side.  We entirely declined to accept it and it is a waste of time trying to put it up.  We will not be put in that position.  It may be, the President said, that the farmers are not able to pay.  Other people went so far as to say that cattle are not paying now, but they did not know what they were talking about, because the one thing that is paying is a certain type of cattle.  &ldquo;Pigs are not paying, bacon, eggs, butter, nothing pays&rdquo;&mdash; supposing I admitted that for the sake of argument.  Will Deputies in this House face up to it properly?  Supposing that was so in the year 1932, has not every country in Europe experience of the same thing?  What is the experience of farmers in any ten years of history, or any fifteen years of history&mdash;any fifteen years you like to pick out, not to speak of fifteen years following a tremendous war?  There are one, two or three years during which things do not pay, but the reaction comes, and the whole problem of good farming is to try to create a little reserve to carry you over and to take advantage of the come-up again.  But these are the humdrum details that Deputies will not face up to and out of which they seek only to make political capital.  There was no country in the world in such a good position&mdash;I say this quite honestly, believing it honestly&mdash;to weather the storm as the Irish Free State, and we were weathering the storm fairly well up to 1930, and the reactions of the world situation in Ireland up to 1930 were less even than these reactions were in any other country in the world because of our very economy, because of our production of live-stock and live-stock products and, more important still, because the economy of the country was based on the comparatively small farmer who had his own labour.  They were able to pay the whole time, and some of them came out line-ball, and some, with hard work, were able to make a bit of money.</P>
    <P>A whole lot of them did and I know it well.  I know that there are solicitors, farmers and politicians, and a lot of these small farmers saved a bit of <Col N="928" /> money, and, up to 1930, and into the early part of 1931, they were even, some of them, making a bit, and there were a lot with reserves.  When did the rot set in?&mdash;the day the first manifesto was issued by President de Valera on the land annuities.  That was a black day for this country.  It is no use now for the President to say&mdash;this does not arise as between ourselves and the British&mdash;that he, unlike members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, told the farmers that they would have to pay.  He did, officially, but, beyond yea or nay, every one of your back benchers, every one of your organisers and your agents, and you know it, went around the country telling the farmers in 1926, and from that on, &ldquo;Vote for us and you need not pay your land annuities.&rdquo;</P>

If a a man pays each year as his demand becomes due, he is all right, but let him get into two or three years' arrears, and, in bad times, he will never get out of them.  That was the position you brought about by that campaign.  That campaign was badly got in the beginning and it had terrible reactions upon the people.  In my opinion, that end of it was even more demoralising than the Civil War.  But, anyway, we have it now, and there are a great many farmers, as a result, who are not able to pay and who must get time.  Deputy Maguire wanted to know what is our policy and have we got any. We know perfectly well that this in-changed the whole situation for us. We know perfectly well that this in-security and these moratoriums and this debate about land annuities, if it goes on for a considerable period, more and more farmers will be getting into the position where they cannot pay and, of course, we will have to face up to that, and, some day or another, it may very well be that President de Valera's patriotic policy may drive some Irish leader who has more courage and more patriotism and less vanity to make an <i>ad misericordiam</i> appeal somewhere.</P>

      <P>The only reason the British are doing this is because they think they see a set of Irishmen in this country who will oust Fianna Fáil and do the British work.  If the Irish people were standing solidly behind the national Government in this instance, there would be no talk about the British putting on taxes or anything else.  The British know perfectly well&mdash;those of them who are sensible &mdash;that if this policy goes on, it is not going to pay them.  It may not pay us, but it certainly will not pay them. Deputy Hogan talks about the £30,000,000 market we have in England. What market has England here? If Deputy Hogan is an Irishman, why does he not talk as an Irishman? Where is this Irish Opposition we were to have?  We have had nothing here, for the past couple of months, but a pro-British Opposition.</P>

      <P>This may be a blessing in disguise.  Deputy Hogan and everybody else who has been watching the British market year after year, can see that it is becoming the dumping ground for the agricultural produce of the nations of the earth and that as year follows year, we were finding it increasingly difficult to obtain, in the British market, a price that would enable us to cover the cost of production in this country.  We were finding it increasingly difficult to sell, in the British market, goods which would enable us to pay for what we were importing, and, if this goes on, it will force us to produce here in the country a lot of the things that we have been importing, and that is going to hit England.  It will force us to get alternative markets and that, again, will hit England.</P>

      <P>It will force us to find them out.  The administration that was in office for the last ten years was doing nothing but praising the one market and neglecting all the others in the world.  The Opposition here talk about these tariffs that the British are going to impose.  What are they going to amount to?  The British say that they are going to amount to the £5,000,000 we are keeping and we are keeping the £5,000,000, so that we will be no worse off.  As I say, it may be a blessing in disguise, but certainly the British will be the worse off.  If we can get all parties in the Dáil and in the country to back the Government and to stand up to the British this country will be very much better off.</P>

      <P>We have heard the Minister for Defence and the President. Such two speeches no Parliament has been ever called upon to listen to.  It <Col N="931" /> is time, at any rate, that some of those on the Front Bench got up to speak, as they can speak with authority. Previous to that they put up Deputies who knew nothing about the question and had no responsibility.  I do not believe that this House, or any other House, was treated with such disrespect until the President interposed. It shows in what a light the Front Bench view the position of the people for the future.  The Minister for Defence said that perhaps this may be a blessing in disguise.  He has admitted anyway that the disguise is there and no one can see the blessing. He talked about being forced to find an alternative market.  It is the Government's duty to find an alternative market, if such a thing exists in the world.  They need not apologise to the House, or anybody else, for finding an alternative market.  If there is such a thing, it is their duty to find it.  Let them not make any apologies about it, if there is such a thing in the world.  It is their duty to find it.

      <P>Nobody but a fool or a baby would make such a suggestion. We are as Irish and as patriotic as you are.  We have better names behind us than you have.  We have names going back two or three thousand years in Ireland, while some of you cannot talk about more than ten years.  We are prepared to make more real sacrifices than you are, and we have more to lose than most of you.  The President said one thing that perhaps gives a ray of hope.  He likened this position to a dispute amongst a family.  Twice, I think, he used that phrase in describing the present crisis with our neighbours&mdash;that this was like a dispute amongst a family.  Would it not be a good thing if they could settle it amongst themselves, he said, but if they could not, leave it to arbitration? I wish the President thought we were a family.  I wish the President thought that the British Commonwealth of Nations was a family, and I wish he would try to behave as one of the family, and encourage his Ministers to behave as members of the family.  He <Col N="932" /> or his Ministers did not give much indication in recent months that they thought the Commonwealth of Nations was one family.  Every opportunity they got they used it to show how contemptibly mean they could be to other members of the family.  Running out of the French Legation was not bravery.  Tearing down flags during the Congress was not bravery, and it was done under the President.  The flags of every nation can fly here, but one of the family that he is talking about could not fly its flag here.  We have seen to-night what I can only describe as the heroics of the mule.  I want to deal with this annuity question alone.  I shall not go into the question of police pensions or local loans.  The President has put the matter in such a light that even at the risk of being called a traitor to my country and the national interest I am going as far as I can to take the lid off.</P>

      <P>The Deputy and other Fianna Fáil Deputies thought it well to explain that it was the British farmers would bear this and that it would not hurt the Irish agricultural industry. We have been silent on the matter so as not to prejudice the position.  If we said anything at all it was only a mere reference.  What is the position? The President talks about the farmers not being able to pay.  Who does he mean is not able to pay?  There have been more Land Acts than one for this country.  Land has been purchased under three or four British Land Acts and under two or three Irish Land Acts.  Does he mean that only those farmers who purchased under the British Acts cannot pay?  Has he any word to say about the people who purchased <Col N="933" /> under the Irish Acts?  Can they pay?  Has he any idea of lightening their load?  Not a bit in the world.  The people who bought under the 1923 Act have to pay and the people who bought under later Acts have to pay.  Some of them got untenanted land and have to pay a price for it that, considering the way markets have gone, is not at all justified, nor was it even justified when they got the land.  It certainly is not justified now.  They have to pay.  How does the President make the case that only people who bought under British Acts cannot pay?  Does he also make the case that people who bought under other Acts cannot pay?  The President nods affirmation.  He makes the same case for them.  Very well.  Let us get to another point.  We assumed responsibility to the stockholders under the 1923 and subsequent Acts.  Does the President accept that as a national liability?  I am asking the President a plain question.  The President nods affirmation.  He does.  He does not accept the operation of the previous Acts as a national liability.  Why?  Is it because another Government chose to operate Land Acts that are really a national matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be good business for the President to interrupt and try to get me off the line, but he will not get me off.  The President admits his liability for the Acts passed by this Dáil, but he accepts no liability otherwise. Where does the British liability come in?  This is the thing I said I might be called a traitor for. Where does the British liability come in?  If the British never introduced a Land Purchase Act, would you have refused to do it?  No, of course you would not.  You would have done as was done in 1923 and as was done in subsequent Acts and the whole liability would be yours.  Because the previous <Col N="934" /> Government here, urged on by the Party that represented the country, did something of that nature, you call it a British liability.  I say it is your liability the same as the 1923 Act is your liability.  They did your work; they acted as your book-keepers and guaranteed your stock.  Their claim to pay is nil and your claim to pay is 100 per cent.  They have no right to pay in any court; morally or otherwise they have no right.  If I could get out of it, even though it is a just and moral debt, I would get out of it as quickly as you would get out of it. I have no more morality than you have and I have no more honesty than you have and the only thing preventing me from being as big a rogue as you are is that it is not good business.</P>

      <P>I have stated that if nothing had been done by our predecessors here the whole problem would be our problem and we would have to face it; either that or we would have confiscation&mdash;it would be either one or the other.  If it were only a question of making a choice, I know there are some people who would have preferred confiscation and who would not have favoured purchase.  I believe the majority of the people, if the question were put to them in 1920, would certainly have favoured purchase. I believe no statesman would have stood for anything but purchase. If the whole problem was left for us to deal with in our time this would be regarded as a national debt and the <Col N="935" /> British would have nothing to say to it. The only shred of a claim that the President has in connection with this whole matter is the position of the Six Counties with regard to the annuities.  I admit that there might be some arguing done from that point of view were it not for the financial settlement.  Under the 1920 Act a present of the annuities was made to the Six County Parliament.  If we had accepted the 1920 Act I daresay the same present would be made to this State by the British Treasury and it would be ours.  That is the only shred of a claim on which the President can make a case.  The financial settlement was made.  The North of Ireland Parliament have assumed certain financial responsibilities.  They were put on a different footing.</P>
