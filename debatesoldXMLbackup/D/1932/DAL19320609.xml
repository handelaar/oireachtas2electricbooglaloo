      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply given on the 11th ultimo to a similar question standing in the Deputy's name.  The situation has now been re-examined by the Law Officers and it is hoped that discussions will be resumed at an early date with representatives of the British Government with a view to arriving at an interim arrangement for the administration of the waters of the lough without prejudice to the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State over the territorial waters of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state how he proposes to allocate the sums promised in his Budget statement in respect of: (a)  Extra road works, £1,000,000; (b) Public Health and housing, £550,000; (c)  milk for school children, £100,000; (d)  rates on agricultural land, £250,000; when the money under these several heads will be available for local authorities, and whether, in view of the immediate need for employment throughout the country, he will expedite the allocation and take all necessary steps to ensure that the new works shall be proceeded with during the summer months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards (a), the grant will be allocated on the basis of the extent of unemployment throughout the Saorstát, statistics of which are being compiled; it is understood <Col N="936" /> that the compilation will not be completed before the end of a fortnight. I have already indicated to the Department of Local Government and Public Health that proposals may now be entertained on the basis that a £1,000,000 grant will be available, and, on this understanding, the local authorities have been invited to submit skeleton schemes in advance of specific allocations as between each county.</P>
      <P>As regards (b), the sum of £550,000 to be placed at the disposal of local authorities for the carrying out of public health and housing schemes will be advanced from the Local Loans Fund towards the financing of schemes approved by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  Advances will be made as schemes are formulated and approved.</P>
      <P>As regards (c) it is intended to distribute this grant between the different local Poor Law authorities in proportion to the numbers of children in respect of whom home assistance is being allowed in the different areas.  I understand that the preparation of appropriate schemes will require about a month.</P>
      <P>As regards (d) it is contemplated that the additional grant will be directed particularly to the relief of rates on the first £10 of the valuation of holdings in each county.  Statements have already been called for from the different local authorities to enable a suitable basis of apportionment to be worked out.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may rest assured that the necessary money will be available to provide for schemes as they are formulated and approved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out that the Deputy asked a question which it was quite obvious need not have been asked at all.  I am more concerned with the rates of pay to be paid under the scheme or schemes, and I want to ask the Minister has he or the Department <Col N="938" /> given any consideration to that aspect of the matter?  I am asking this question in view of the personnel of the Department.  We are told that Deputy Hugo Flinn is to be put in charge of this allocation.  Is the Minister prepared to state the rates of pay proposed to be given to labourers under these schemes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the number of vacancies that have arisen in the Official Reporting Staff of the Oireachtas during the last twelve months; whether it is proposed to fill those vacancies; if so, when, and who is to determine the scales of pay and conditions of service of the new entrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Three vacancies on the Official Reporting Staff have arisen during the last twelve months.  Applications for the filling of one of these places were invited some months ago, but the competition did not result in any of the candidates then available being appointed.  It is proposed to fill the three vacancies on such a scale of pay and conditions of service as are agreed upon between the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister for Finance. Official authority has already been given for approaching the Civil Service Commissioners with a request that they should proceed to fill the vacancies accordingly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Civil Service Commissioners were to appoint two persons, but that only one person in the end was appointed?  Is the Minister aware that there is at the present moment, because of the state of Parliamentary business, a very severe strain upon the reporting staff reporting <Col N="939" /> the debates in the two Houses? Can the Minister say when he expects the vacancies will be filled by suitable persons?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Civil Service Commissioners, who will be responsible for making recommendations to me, will see that a high standard of efficiency will be maintained. With regard to the question as to whether one or two vacancies were advertised, I have been advised that applications for the filling of one of the vacancies was invited some time ago. With regard to the question of providing for the present emergency, authority has been given to secure temporary assistance upon what we consider to be very generous and liberal terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I may inform the Deputy that there was much less delay in dealing with the matter of filling any vacancies since this Government came in than was the case under its predecessor, when vacancies were allowed to remain unfilled for almost twelve months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say, in view of the fact that the House has <Col N="940" /> been meeting continuously since 9th March, why no effort has been made to fill any of the vacancies on the Reporting Staff?</P>

    <P>The Bill is intended to make provision for a period of from ten to twelve days during the present <Col N="942" /> month when the Congress will be held in this city.  As Deputies will have observed, the Bill deals with certain matters coming under the Department of Local Government, some which ordinarily come under the Department of Finance, and there are, I think, three or perhaps four sections which come under the Department of Justice.  This is, as the Title states, a Miscellaneous Provisions Bill.  There is really no principle running through it unless one may say that there is the principle of affording special and unusual facilities to our own citizens and to visitors from outside during this period.  It would, I think, be easy to make a case for the granting of special facilities for that period.</P>
    <P>But so far as the views of various sections of the community have reached me it seems rather unnecessary to labour a case for the granting of special facilities.  It is, if not generally conceded, at least conceded by an overwhelming majority, apparently, of our citizens, that special facilities are necessary for this Congress period.  For that reason, and for the reason that I propose to ask the House to take the remaining stages of the Bill to-day, perhaps, I should ask your indulgence, sir, to make what is really a Committee Stage speech&mdash;that is I will just deal shortly with the various provisions of the Bill rather than put forward arguments as to why the ordinary law should be departed from during this period of about 12 days.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will observe, Section 1 of the Bill is, of course, a defining section. I think we need not trouble to take very much time over it.  Section 2 of the Bill empowers the Revenue Commissioners to allow into the Irish Free State, free of customs duty, a motor 'bus imported by a resident of the Irish Free State if it can be shown that it will only be used here during the Congress period and then exported. The conditions under which this concession will be given will be prescribed by the Revenue Commissioners and will be designed to protect the revenue against any attempt to make a fraudulent use of any concession given under this section.  I might add that an Order has been made by the Minister <Col N="943" /> for Finance giving a somewhat similar concession to motor cars and motor omnibuses imported for the same purpose by persons not resident in the Irish Free State.</P>
    <P>Section 3 to 7 deal, or are intended to deal, with the traffic and transport problem during the Congress period. There will be, if anything like the anticipated numbers visit the city, undoubtedly a problem in connection with traffic and transport.  It seems desirable, and the only practical way, that some persons should get almost autocratic authority for transport and traffic in this city during that period.  It is proposed by the Bill to give that measure of control to the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána.  Probably there will not be any exception taken to that.</P>
    <P>Section 3 enables the Commissioner to make such regulations as he thinks necessary for the control of traffic. There will be the difficulty of supplying adequate transport for visitors, and in order to meet that difficulty Clause 4 has been inserted in this Bill.  Deputies will observe that by virtue of Clause 4 the Minister for Local Government and Public Health may authorise the use of vehicles which have not been licensed&mdash;that is during this period of 12 days.</P>
    <P>The importation of a large number of vehicles is, it is understood, in contemplation, and it is considered that it would not be possible to insist on their taking out ordinary road tax licences.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the registration of public service vehicles.  It is felt that during this period it would not be possible to enforce the ordinary law relating to the registration of public service vehicles.</P>
    <P>Section 6 gives the Minister for Local Government and Public Health power to authorise persons to drive motor vehicles notwithstanding the fact that they may not have driving licences. This again, it is understood, is intended to meet the case of persons from abroad.  It is thought that difficulty would be found in enforcing the ordinary law.  Of course, as will be seen, <Col N="944" /> anyone who has been disqualified from a driving licence is excepted from any benefit conferred by this Clause 6.</P>
    <P>Clause 7 makes a similar provision for the drivers and conductors of public service vehicles.  It will be seen that the general idea of the sections is to empower the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and the police to deal with any situation that is likely to arise during this period of congestion.</P>
    <P>Section 8 has to do with the licensing hours.  It has been conceded by practically everyone who has taken an interest in the subject that the existing licensing hours may not be suitable for the large crowds that are expected here in Dublin and the area immediately surrounding Dublin during this Congress Week.  It was thought at one time that the Bill might contain specific provisions in giving concessions, but it was felt, after a good deal of inquiry, that it was very difficult, if not impossible, to say in advance exactly what facilities might be necessary.  Accordingly, under Section 8, a very wide discretion has been given to the Circuit Judge.  The Circuit Judge may fix different hours for different parts of the area affected by the Congress. Some point may be raised in reference to what is ordinarily called the split hour.</P>
    <P>It would obviously be undesirable in a Bill of this kind to enter into any discussion of the merits or demerits of the split hour.  But it is thought it would be desirable that an officer of the police&mdash;a chief superintendent&mdash; should suggest to the judge that he ought to make an order permitting licensed houses to be open in the county borough of Dublin between 2.30 and 3.30 in the afternoon.  Residents here in Dublin are familiar with the law, but visitors cannot be expected to know what the position is, and they may be seriously inconvenienced by finding licensed houses closed between 2.30 and 3.30 in the afternoon.  An extra hour or possibly two hours in the afternoon might also be granted. The Bill, of course, does not propose to grant this to any licensee; it is entirely at the discretion of the Circuit <Col N="945" /> Judge whether he will grant such concessions.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with exemption orders.  It has been suggested that large numbers of people coming here for the Congress may live in hotels in the suburbs, and in Greystones, Malahide and Howth, it will be necessary to make arrangements for additional facilities.  The section gives power to the Circuit Court Judge to grant an exemption order to any hotel within twenty miles distance of Dublin.  It is an arbitrary radius, but it is felt that in fixing a radius like that it is likely to meet all reasonable requirements during the period.</P>
    <P>Section 10 has to do with catering. It is contemplated that catering centres will be established in various parts of the city and surroundings, to supply meals to people who cannot obtain food in their lodgings and for whom existing restaurant facilities may not be sufficient.  Under the section licences may be granted by the Circuit Judge for such centres.  Under the ordinary law, as I explained recently, in reference to the Cork Fair, occasional licences were granted only for three days at a time and may not extend to Sundays.  These restrictions, under the present Bill, are removed during the Congress period, but the Circuit Judge can attach any provision he deems proper to the granting of occasional licences.  For instance when granting an occasional licence he might make it a condition that a substantial meal should be supplied with the drink, but there it is a matter entirely for the Circuit Judge who will consider the circumstances of each applicant and district.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with ships which may be moored in Dublin Bay during Congress week.  They will, as has been stated in the papers, be large floating hotels accommodating many foreign visitors who will attend during the period.  The section is intended to regularise the supply of intoxicating liquor in vessels moored in the Bay.  There is already provision as to the granting of licences to passenger vessels, such as tenders, that will go backwards and forwards between the liners and the quays.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="946" /> Section 12 has to do with the courts. Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney put a question on that subject but I think he was not present when I answered.  My answer was to the effect that we are meeting the point that was raised by the Deputy in this clause in the Bill. I stated in that answer that the relevant provisions would be found in clause 12 of the Bill; that is the clause I am now referring to.  As will be seen, the effect of clause 12 is to make the days of the Congress period what I might call <i>dies non.</i>  Of course a rule of court could not possibly effect that or affect statutory periods of limitation, for instance, or any period prescribed by statute although it might authorise a variation.  I felt the rules of court were not sufficient to meet the contingency which might easily arise such as I explained already if the statutory period of renewal expired during the twelve days of the proposed period.  I think Section 12 is wide enough and comprehensive enough in its terms to meet every contingency that is likely to arise during this period.  Having now dealt with the various clauses of the Bill and shown that there is a certain basis for them, I would ask the House to give the Bill a Second Reading.</P>
    <P>I may say, apart from any explanation I have given, that the Bill has been the subject of investigation for a considerable time by a joint departmental committee.  While representations from every section of the community may not have been heard I think they have been ascertained and brought to the minds of the members of the departmental committee.  The Bill gives effect to these demands so far as they seemed reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am greatly disappointed with clauses 8, 9, 10 and 11 of this Bill.  Personally I oppose it for all I am worth.  I fail to see why there should be an extension to licensed establishments during the Eucharistic <Col N="947" /> Congress.  Surely it is not for drink or such like that people will come to the City of Dublin in the course of the next few weeks.  I am surprised that the Minister introduced into his Bill clauses 8, 9, 10 and 11 and I ask the House to reject them.  I oppose them because I believe it is not for drink people will come to Dublin during Congress week, especially when you will have floating ballrooms in the vessels that you expect the people of Dublin to go out to see.  It would only encourage them to get drink.  Provision is made for supplying food.  With that I quite agree, but there are plenty of things that people could drink with their food besides porter.  I see some Deputies laugh and it is no laughing matter at all.  If the Government of the country stands for an extension of hours to give more time to people to get drink in the City of Dublin during Congress week, I say it is a public scandal that such a thing should be introduced into this House.  With those few words I oppose the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the Minister is concerned, I presume he has followed out the line of procedure that was in train at the time of the late administration, and that they did not introduce these four sections just referred to without consultation with those who were in touch with the Congress Committee, as it is called. There is just one other point that I would like to raise, and it is this, that, on the last occasion when there was a very big assemblage of people in the Phoenix Park for the Centenary Celebrations, there was a prohibition against the opening of licensed premises for some hours on the Sunday, and, so far as I have been able to find, there is no corresponding restriction in this Bill.  I understood that there was to have been a prohibition against opening during particular hours&mdash;during the hours of the procession, but, so far as I can see, there is no provision here for that purpose. Perhaps the Minister would say something on that subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say <Col N="948" /> that so far as I am concerned I fail to follow Deputy Curran's argument at all.  This Eucharistic Congress is a great Catholic Congress.  It is not a Mohammedan assembly.  I know that Mohammedans prohibit the use of intoxicating liquor, but no branch of the Christian religion, and certainly not Catholicism, prohibits it, and if a very large number of persons come to this city during the Eucharistic week, I cannot see any reason why they should not be able to indulge reasonably in the use of alcoholic liquor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the hours not long enough without extending them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two little points which strike me on this matter, but they are not of very much importance.  Under Section 11, I see that intoxicating liquor can be served on vessels moored in the harbour of Dublin to persons bona fide residing on these vessels.  Since it is only to persons bona fide residing on those vessels, I do not think that Deputy Curran need have any great qualms of conscience about people being brought off shore to drink, I think he said, porter, on these vessels, but I would like to ask the Minister if, for the purposes of the licensing laws, these vessels are to be considered part of the licensing area, so to speak?  For instance, will the Guards have any power, if there was any abuse going on in these vessels, to go aboard and search them?  I apprehend that they would not.  I only saw the Bill this morning, and I have not had much time to look into it, but I am sure that that is a matter which the Minister has considered, and that he will be able to give us information.  I presume that the liquor served on these boats will not be subject to excise duty, or to a duty of any kind, they really being part of foreign territory, which is the reason why liners have to lock up their supplies until they are outside territorial waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to Section 12, I would like to know from the Minister if his intention is that the courts should be closed, because I think there is rather a general feeling that the courts, and all the offices of the courts, should be closed during Eucharistic Week.  This section <Col N="949" /> as I read it, does not effect this purpose. So far as it is concerned, the courts may still be sitting and all the offices, seemingly, must be kept open, because although a person need not avail himself of this particular period for the lodging of papers, there is nothing to prevent a person going in, if he so wishes, and lodging any documents he has to lodge in the office.  I would like to get from the Minister if it is the intention that the offices should be closed and the courts not sitting, because I would suggest that the courts ought not to sit during this Eucharistic Week and that all the offices should be completely closed.  I do not think Section 12 effects that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the general tenour of the Bill that it is intended for ordinary, intelligent, moderate and normal people, and, for that reason, I cannot see the force of the argument that has been raised against the Bill by Deputy Curran. It shows a very reactionary form of ignorance on this matter which I am sorry to see.  Of course, there are persons in this country who are against the use of intoxicating drink, and they are quite entitled to that attitude.  There are two classes of people who are particularly against it&mdash;those who cannot take any drink without making beasts of themselves; who are against it on occasions of this kind, and there are the others whom I would call stone cold, cast-iron reformers, who want to make everyone else like themselves, and who will not look into a barley field for fear somebody would say that they have some connection with drink. I think the Minister is quite right in ignoring the innuendoes of these people.  The people who will come up here are not looking for an opportunity for drinking to the extent at which they will be a disgrace to themselves and those around them, and we may take it that people will observe sobriety, especially on the occasion of such national importance as this.  The speech of Deputy Curran is a terrible reflection on the race as a whole, because it means that we cannot get an opportunity for having reasonable refreshments without <Col N="950" /> making, as I said before, beasts of ourselves.  With regard to another point raised, I would suggest to the Minister that the ordinary opening hours on Sunday, and especially the Sunday of the High Mass in the Phoenix Park, should be moved forward to, say, 4 o'clock.  I think the Bill is very necessary, and I am sure there will be no opposition to any of its clauses from any side of the House, except that founded on ignorance and narrow-mindedness.</P>

      <P>Might I enquire from the Minister whether he considers it necessary to suspend the Shop Hours Act for the period of the Congress, because I think it would be very regrettable if people were not able to get certain essentials by reason of the fact that such a law is in operation here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share the apprehensions of Deputy Curran.  So far as I have any experience or knowledge of the conduct of licensed premises in the City and County of Dublin, I feel forced to pay a tribute to the publicans generally.  Anything I have seen leads me to think that their houses are conducted very well; that they are places of refreshment and not merely for drinking or boozing, even at ordinary times, not to speak of Congress Week.  In ordinary times, very many publicans in the city supply sandwiches; some of them supply meals at the counter, and, I think, there are a few who supply even &ldquo;sit-down&rdquo; meals, if one desires to avail of them. I think when this Congress period ends that Deputy Curran will have no reason to regret the granting of the concessions. If concessions are withheld from these houses very many people who come to Dublin from the provinces may find themselves on the footpaths on a wet and inclement evening.  It is easy to speak of their having other beverages to partake of, and to be able to obtain food in other places, but, of course, the ordinary restaurant and tea house accommodation of this city is designed for the normal needs of the city.  I doubt very much if it would cope with the needs of even a fraction of the floating population that we may expect here during the Congress period.  Accordingly, I hope the House will accept the provisions in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave has referred to the <Col N="952" /> clauses to which Deputy Curran objects. It is the fact that save for, I think, the introduction of one subsection in regard to the outlying hotels, the clauses are substantially the same as would have been introduced as a result of the deliberations of the Joint Committee which had commenced sittings under the previous Government. This Committee heard the views of a great many persons interested&mdash;in fact, I think everyone really interested &mdash;in the holding of the Congress, and the Bill as it stands is not repugnant to the views of any section of those who are concerned in promoting the comfort of people coming to attend the various ceremonies.  Deputy Cosgrave referred to the provisions as being somewhat analogous to those in the statute passed for the Centenary Celebrations here, in which there was, as the Deputy stated, a provision against opening during certain hours. The Joint Committee had that present in their minds, and deliberated upon it, and felt that the balance was in favour of the drafting of the Bill as it stands.  I have accepted that.  I have not attempted to weigh the thing for myself, because I feel that it has been dealt with more satisfactorily by the Committee.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney inquired if the Guards would have power to go on the liners in Dublin Bay and to search them.  I think the Guards will have such power but I doubt very much if it will be necessary to avail of it.  The liners that will be moored in the Bay will be in charge of highly responsible officers, and the captain, the officers and the members of the crew are not likely to allow one of these great ships to be turned into a mere drinking saloon.  I feel that that is the real safeguard against what Deputy Curran apprehends, but I feel almost sure that the police will have power to enter a ship in the same way as they have power to enter a public-house.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney asked if the liquors served would be subject to duty.  It is not so intended.  It is intended that the ships will be treated as, what they really will be, ships on the high seas.  I do not think that the <Col N="953" /> Deputy referred to any other part of the Bill with regard to licensing.  He referred to clause 12 and asked if it was intended that the Courts shall sit. It is not intended that the Courts shall sit, but there is nothing in the Bill which prohibits a Judge from sitting.  I feel that it is not necessary to put that in.  I have assumed that it is <i>dies non</i>, and that the Judges will adjourn the Courts.  I have very little doubt that the Courts will be adjourned and, on the whole, I feel that it might be better to leave control of the Courts to the Judges.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the offices and asked is it intended that the offices shall not be open in the ordinary way.  Of course, it may be desirable in the public interest that an office or officer should be available for that period, just as it might be desirable in a certain event that a Judge should be available, and should be able to sit in one of the Courts. Deputy Moore and Deputy MacDermot advocated the suspension of the Shop Hours Act.  The suspension of the Shop Hours Act has not been recommended to me by the Committee and I am afraid that nothing said by Deputy Moore or Deputy MacDermot has persuaded me to ask the House at a later stage to accept any amendment of this Bill with a view to suspending the Shop Hours Act.  Of course, I am in the hands of the House.  I think the other Deputies who spoke merely commented on the Bill, and that I have answered the various queries that were put.</P>

Would it not be desirable to safeguard the position by providing that these vehicles are to be used only for passenger purposes? <Col N="955" /> Does the Minister not think that the definition leaves it open to vehicles such as we see at big football matches being brought in here and then being used for purposes other than those for which they are intended to be used under the Bill?</P>

I called the Minister's attention to the definition of &ldquo;motor omnibus&rdquo; and I asked had the Minister in mind that vehicles improvised for the occasion would be used and whether an abuse of the privileges accorded by this Bill might not arise by these vehicles being used for haulage purposes here. It may be a small point but I thought it was one to which I should draw attention.</P>

      <P>I wish to draw attention to a matter which involves Sections 4 and 5 as well as this section.  Sub-section (1) permits the <Col N="956" /> importation of omnibuses free, as I understand, of customs duty.  Sub-section (1) of Section 4 permits the use of unlicensed cars and vehicles&mdash; that means, I presume, cars and vehicles that have not paid the road tax.  Sub-section (2) of Section 5 prohibits the use of these vehicles in the City of Dublin for the purpose of plying for hire.  If the omnibus is imported for the purpose of the Congress only, it will, of course, be re-exported.  Is it intended that the road tax shall be paid on it before it comes into the City of Dublin? If it is not, then, assuming that a vehicle brings a load of passengers from Cork, when it comes within the city boundary it is plying for hire under the section.</P>

      <P>In reference to Deputy Moore's comments, I may say that it is difficult in any Bill to provide for calculated, deliberate, well-planned violation of the law in certain very exceptional cases.  In a Bill dealing with quite a long period, it is desirable that an effort should be made to leave no possible loophole. In a Bill of this nature, dealing with a short period&mdash;a very exceptional period during which a large number of persons will be coming here for whom it is desired to provide transit&mdash;you must look to the main purpose, and if you overload a clause like clause 2 it is doubtful if the overloading is really worth while.  As this clause deals with the importation of motor omnibuses, it is unlikely that ramshackle vehicles of the type referred to by the Deputy will be brought in here.  It would be scarcely worth while.  Very few of them, I think, will be brought in. The vehicles brought in will be,.  I venture to predict, what we would refer to in the ordinary course as motor omnibuses and will not be of the type described by Deputy Moore. A further safeguard is that the Revenue Commissioners under sub-section (2) of Section 2 have power to prescribe various conditions.  I am sure that the Revenue Commissioners will avail pretty liberally of the powers conferred on them by sub-section (2) to protect the public <Col N="957" /> against abuses such as Deputy Moore has given by way of illustration. Deputy McMenamin inquired if sub-section (1) of Section 4 referred to the road tax.  It does.</P>

      <P>As Deputy MacDermot states, the taking out of a 10/- licence or the paying of 10/- for a driver's licence is not a very great burden.  At the same time, it is felt that it might preclude some persons who are quite competent to drive a car from being allowed to drive it, persons who may be required under the exigencies of the situation to drive a car, from being available to drive it.  As the House is aware, the possession of a licence to drive a motor car is not evidence of any degree of skill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Anyone who has not been disqualified by the order of a competent court and who is within certain prescribed limits of age is entitled to obtain from the licensing authority a licence to drive on payment of the 10/-.  I am now <Col N="958" /> speaking generally.  If the possession of a driver's licence ordinarily ensured that the driver has experience or skill in driving, I would see a considerable objection to this section.  But as it stands, it seems to me that it is merely the loss of 10/-, and no objection has been made by the parties concerned to the granting by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health of permission to drive during the 12 days though the man has not paid the 10/- for the licence.  It is a matter that scarcely concerns the public as a whole.</P>

      <P>Am I not right when I say that the objects of allowing unlicensed cars to run, and in allowing persons who have not got a licence to drive cars, are that it is hoped there will be a very large influx of country visitors into Dublin during the Congress period; that cars not ordinarily in use will be called into use for this week or for, possibly, one day, and that drivers who are perfectly skilled drivers will not, because they happen not to have a licence, be prevented from being hired for that week or, possibly, for a day or two?  I take it that it is because you are going to have cars that will only be pulled out for that week, and that you are going to have drivers who will only drive during that week, that you propose to make this extension for both motor car licensing and drivers licensing for the Congress period.  I am in favour of this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully realise the advisability of exempting cars from the necessity of being licensed under these circumstances, but as regards the drivers' licences the situation is different.  Is it not a fact that a man who does not ordinarily drive a car, but who takes out a car for one day only, as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney suggests, is not apt to be as good a driver or as careful a driver as the man who is usually driving a car?  I should like to ask this question: if the necessity for taking out a driving licence is waived, will the system that takes its place ensure that the identification of drivers will be easy and that we shall not have a <Col N="959" /> lot of people careering about the countryside with cars during that period, people, perhaps, who should not be driving them, but who, during that week, may get away with what they would not get away with on an ordinary occasion?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacDermot has raised what seems to me to be a quite substantial point as to the identification of drivers.  I feel sure that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health will take such precautions in granting permission under this Section 6 as will enable drivers to be identified in the event of a collision.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has given one illustration of the class of persons that this section is intended to assist. Deputy MacDermot mentioned those coming from abroad.  Many of them may be quite competent drivers who may be willing to assist us over here while resident in Dublin, and yet may not wish to take out licence.</P>
      <P>May I say also that the police will have a great deal to do in the regulation of traffic during that period? They will have various other duties which will necessarily arise where there is a large concourse of people. I doubt very much if it would have been possible, strictly, to enforce the law requiring every driver to have a licence even if that were the law. There would be very great difficulty for the police during that period of rush in ensuring that the law would not be broken.</P>

      <P>There is a general question raised by Deputy MacDermot and that is that the fact of having a driver's licence would do no more to ensure identification than it would to ensure the competency of the driver. The fact that drivers' licences can be exchanged does away with any certainty of their being useful in the way of identification.</P>

The whole House will agree with me, I am sure, that it would be very unpleasant indeed if the licensed premises along the route which the procession is going to take were open while the procession is passing.  I do not say that there should be any suggestion for any necessity for legislation for closing them, because I daresay the good sense, the good taste and the good feeling of the owners will, in fact, keep them closed.  I should like to ask the Minister if the owners have given any undertaking that they will keep them closed.  I am sure if they are approached that they will give such an undertaking.</P>

      <P>I wonder would the Minister consider the advisability of extending the distance. Sub-section (1) of the section says &ldquo;within a radius of 20 miles from the General Post Office.&rdquo;  Would the Minister consider the advisability of having that radius extended, because if the numbers which are expected to arrive at the Congress will be as great as is supposed, certain persons will have to stay outside the 20 miles area.  We know that with modern facilities for road traffic 20 miles will only mean a half an hour's journey now.  I am sure that many of the visitors will stay in places like Wicklow, Glendalough, Navan, Drogheda and several other <Col N="961" /> places outside the 20 miles radius.  I should like to know if the Minister would give favourable consideration to this point and consider the desirability of extending the radius beyond 20 miles from the General Post Office.</P>

These are some of the few words or figures in this Bill, apart from clause 12, for which I am responsible.  But if the general sense of the House is that it should be 25 miles, there is really no argument which can be used for 20 miles as against 15 miles or 25 miles.</P>

      <P>There is one point arising out of the fact that the Minister says that these vessels may be liable to visits by the Gárda Síochána.  I presume that it is really intended that the management of any sales of liquor on these vessels will be really left entirely under the control of the vessels' authorities.  There may be occasions upon which persons who have come to Dublin and who are residing on these vessels will bring their friends on board either for their own personal talk, or perhaps for a little dance in the evening; and I think it would be reducing our proposals to absurdity if a person who was a guest of anyone on board one of these vessels could not be treated to a glass of sherry.</P>

      <P>As far as I know it would not be possible for them to sell tobacco on board a vessel unless some provision is introduced into this statute.  I think that if people are going to stop for a week on board a vessel, as they are liable to be, moored out some distance from the shore, they ought to be able to purchase tobacco on board their vessel.  I know that there is this objection that, of course, tobacco sold on board a liner of this character would not pay duty, and that, therefore, it would be very much cheaper <Col N="963" /> than tobacco bought on shore.  But I do not suppose that many people would bring it off to their friends.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess that the observations of Deputy Mulcahy have force.  As I stated, while the Guards have, in my opinion, power to visit the vessels, my own feeling is that the control of the vessel will be really exercised by the captain and those under him, and that order will be ensured by the captain and the crew, that they will be very jealous of the reputations of the liners while they are here in Dublin and that everything is likely to go off all right.  Of course the difficulty is that once you extend it beyond persons who are <i>bona fide</i> residing on the vessels, it is not easy to prevent abuses, and you, probably, then might make it needful for the Gárda Síochána to visit the liners.  I feel that they will have a great deal to do during that period.  If, as I said in another connection, the sense of the House is in favour of extending the provision by the introduction of words that will include the guests of persons residing on the liners, I would not resist it. In reference to what Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney says regarding tobacco, I feel that facilities for the sale of tobacco would be much more liable to abuse, much more likely to be abused than facilities for the sale of drink. Personally, for that reason, I would hardly support the introduction of a provision enabling tobacco to be sold. Tenders will be plying to and from the liners at frequent intervals; and very little difficulty will be encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of tobacco, cigars and cigarettes by the persons on the liners.</P>

I will ask the Minister to consider this matter with the object of seeing whether it might be advisable to alter the section in the Seanad so that it would be much clearer and so make the intention known to the general public.  This particular period might be made part of the Long Vacation.  During the Long <Col N="965" /> Vacation all offices are closed.  If the Minister agreed to that, there would be no court sitting.  Of course, if there was anything urgent such as a <i>habeas corpus</i> or anything of that sort a judge would have power to sit during the Long Vacation, as is customary.  Perhaps the Minister will consider if that would be necessary to effectuate his real intention.  If, after consulting his advisers, he comes to that conclusion, he might insert an alteration of the section in the Seanad.  I am not opposing the section.</P>

However, I will consider the introduction of the words suggested.

      <P>I would like to make certain references to them.  With regard to my first amendment, which is to Section 4, I would like to point out that in the Bill it is proposed in Section 5 of the Act of 1911 to delete the words &ldquo;United Kingdom&rdquo; and to insert the words &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  My amendment seeks, instead of inserting the words &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann,&rdquo; to replace the words &ldquo;United Kingdom&rdquo; in Section 5 of the Act of 1911 by the word &ldquo;Ireland.&rdquo; On the Second Reading I pointed out that the restriction of the reading of that section to &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; as against &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; would mean that an old age pensioner living in Monaghan, or born in Fermanagh, Tyrone, or Armagh, who desired to cross over the Border for a short time to the place of his birth or to see some friends, would have his old age pension stopped for the period while he was on the other side of the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 of the Act of 1911 sets out that a sum shall not be paid on account of an old age pension to any person while absent from the United Kingdom or if payment of the sum is not obtained within three months after the date on which it becomes payable. The section as amended by the Bill will mean that no sum shall be paid <Col N="967" /> on account of an old age pension to any person while absent from Saorstát Eireann.  I hardly think that the Parliamentary Secretary, in the spirit in which he suggests the Bill is drafted, means to impose such a restriction on an old age pensioner.  I suggest he should consider the matter and, with the powers he possesses, he ought to make such an amendment as I suggest, on the Report Stage.  He can do so by recommitting the Bill.  That would prevent such an occurrence as I have indicated.</P>
    <P>The second amendment bears on another matter.  The Bill makes provision for an old age pension even to the full amount to persons who may be very comfortably situated, particularly in rural districts.  A person may have a large farm, running into 100 to 200 acres.  That person may dispossess himself of the farm and pass it over to his children.  He may even have capital up to £337 and yet he may receive an old age pension, widening the scope of the Old Age Pension Acts to a very great degree.</P>
    <P>We are faced with another aspect of the restrictions in the present position bearing particularly on town dwellers and persons who earn their living by a trade or craft.  Most of the old craft organisations or unions had a scheme by which, after a certain number of years of membership, and paying the necessary fees, on reaching a certain age the member of the union or craft received a small pension.  As the Old Age Pensions Act stands at present that pension was taken into consideration from the point of view of means, and any sum paid to such a person as an allowance or pension from one of these trade unions or craft bodies of over 6/- a week was taken into consideration. The proposal I make here is that it is inconsistent with the spirit in which the present Bill is drafted that members of some of those old societies, that continue to give small pensions to those of their members who have been members of the society for a period, should be subject to the restrictions to the extent they at present exist.  There are many such societies&mdash;the Woodworkers do it I <Col N="968" /> know; the Bricklayers, I think, and some others; and I think it is inconsistent with the spirit in which the Minister said this Bill was drawn that such workers who are not in the position that they can live in the comfortable surroundings of a large farm, by which they could amass a capital sum of money up to, say, £300 or £400 or £500, should be penalised by the taking into consideration of the sum they receive from their society.  It would be only in keeping with all that the Minister has said from his side that if&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for the purpose of explaining the tremendous discrepancy in the Bill as between different sections of the people that I am discussing this matter now and asking the Minister to investigate it and to consider, between this and the Report Stage, whether it would not be entirely out of keeping with the spirit that he has enshrined in this particular Bill to have, in the case of those who have earned their living by a craft, who are of old age pension age, and who are drawing a small pension from their society&mdash;that pension taken into consideration in so far as it may be above 6/- a week in deciding whether they should be entitled to the 10/- a week as regards the old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, in order to put it in its proper perspective, take the case of the person with 200 acres of land. Such a person can divest himself of his farm to his children according to this Bill.  He may have a capital sum of £337 10s. and get an old age pension of 10s. He might say to himself: &ldquo;Well, I have a ten years' <Col N="969" /> lease of life and I can exist on my capital at the rate of £30 or £40 a year&rdquo;&mdash;and such persons can spend £30 or £40 a year out of their capital and can still draw their old age pension of 10/-, whereas the town dweller, living by his craft, and living in very much more restricted and poorer surroundings, has no capital and can draw no more than the 6/- a week he gets from his union if he is not going to be cut in his old age pension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I meant to raise this point on the Second Stage, as I am familiar with one particular aspect of it.  That is the custom of certain trades unions of making a certain superannuation allowance.  I want to put it to the Parliamentary Secretary for Local Government and Public Health that the old age pensioner who deserves most sympathy is very emphatically the dweller in Dublin, or in any other city, who is dependent entirely upon the 10/- a week. More than any other type of pensioner in the State, it has always seemed to me that the particular person I am referring to, such as a working trade unionist in, say, the building trade who, from the nature of his work, does not get regular employment, and is not able to save money, particularly if he has a high standard in the raising of his children, deserves our sympathy. When such a man comes to the age of 70 it is very difficult indeed for him to get employment of any kind, and the law sets the allowance which he may get from his union in the way of superannuation against his old age pension.  At any rate, that particular sum is counted against his getting his pension&mdash;it either prevents him from getting it at all, or ensures that he gets only a portion of it.  It is a most inequitable thing that that class of person, who has worked at a craft all his life and been a member of a trade union and, therefore, acted decently and honestly by his fellow workers all his life, should be at a loss when he comes to the age of 70 to the extent of the superannuation allowance over a certain figure he is getting from his union.  It is <Col N="970" /> impossible to understand that the Parliamentary Secretary should have drafted a Bill which allows one type of person to get rid of a large farm and does not make full allowance for the type of person of whom I speak.</P>
      <P>Further, there is the case all over the country, and certainly in Dublin, of well-established firms who are good employers and who at a certain age put their employees out and pay a small pension.  Very often they are reluctant to do that because if they do it the State either does not pay, or reduces, the old age pension.  It is really a substantial lessening in the standard of life of these people and it seems to be altogether out of harmony with the arrangement the Parliamentary Secretary makes in the Bill for those in the country in the cases I have mentioned. I would like to know also about the case of a person in the city or elsewhere who owns a house.  Am I right in saying that, if an applicant for an old age pension owns a house in the City of Dublin, when his means are being calculated for an old age pension, the house is valued under the Bill at 5 per cent. of the capital value of the house, and that that is taken into consideration? But a person in the country, as Deputy Mulcahy has said, may have a sum of money which is not taken into account, and it seems to be entirely ridiculous that a farmer can dispose of his farm to qualify for a pension and that a town dweller who has worked all his life and succeeded in buying a cheapish house in the poorer part of Dublin, worth, say, £300, should have the valuation taken against his pension.  It is quite inequitable.  On the specific point raised by Deputy Mulcahy there seem to be incomes of that description and other things not provided for in the Bill.  Although the Parliamentary Secretary himself cannot do it I think he could bring pressure to bear upon the Minister to move an amendment with a view to meeting the case that Deputy Mulcahy has raised so that persons with very small incomes should not have these calculated against them when their means are being calculated in connection with the granting of old age pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the point I wanted to make.  In the Official Reports, Volume 2, 31st May-3rd June, 1932, Column 67, I said in welcoming this Bill &ldquo;many persons make provision through the medium of trade unions and other agencies, such as insurance companies, for benefits or allowances when they reach a certain age.  In the majority of cases they are struggling workmen or workwomen who pinch and scrape to make provision for old age.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the type of thrifty person referred to by Deputy Mulcahy.  I understood on that occasion, judging by a gesture the Parliamentary Secretary made, that he would amend the Bill to include the persons I indicated on that occasion.  I have actual contact with the type of persons suggested in the amendment, which appears in the name of Deputy Mulcahy.  I am an unpaid person who is administering and advising in matters of this character.  I belong to a trade union which has ramifications all over the world, and where they provide, amongst other things, for superannuation for members of this trade organisation by means of weekly subscriptions towards the superannuation fund.  The vast majority of these, in fact all of them, are men of some education.  They are not overpaid, but a very large number of them make provision for their old age.  That is the kind of thrift that is going to be penalised.  Whereas the farmer, who is prepared to hand over his farm of twenty, fifty or five hundred acres, to his son, can be brought within the ambit of this Bill, the poor working, professional man, or craftsman, and a good many hard-working skilled and <Col N="973" /> unskilled labourers who contribute to such funds are to be penalised.  I understood from the Minister when introducing this measure that, in the largeness of his heart and the spaciousness of his outlook he would not debar such persons as I have mentioned from coming within the provisions that apply to farmers and others.  The type of persons mentioned by Deputy Mulcahy are those with whom I have come in contact. Many of them, debarred in law from obtaining the old age pensions, were looking forward to the introduction of a Bill, on the lines of this introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he might, at least, extend the same terms to the hard-working and thrifty tradesman and craftsman in the cities and towns, that he is extending to some of the well-to-do people in the country under this Bill.  I have, in brief, outlined the type of persons who will be ruled out of this Bill, and I ask the Minister, when he touches upon the matter again to give some indication, because I believe he has no intention of ruling these people out, that he will include them.  This is not the stage at which he could bring in a Money Resolution to include them, but I hope to hear from him again upon the subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words on behalf of a number of workers.  I am not familiar with the provision made by trade unions for craftsmen, but I know that there are a number of employers in the country who, when they find employees that have been in their service for 30 or 40 years are no longer able to continue at work, give them small pensions of anything from 8/- to 10/- per week.  That has happened in a number of cases in my own constituency.  I think it would be very hard that where employers, who have been grateful for the services of men who had been in their employment for 30 or 40 years, decided to make them a payment amounting to 10/- a week either in cash or in kind, that that should be brought up against those men when making <Col N="974" /> application for an old age pension. As one who welcomes this Bill, I would urge upon the Parliamentary Secretary that if a person with a capital of something like £300 is entitled to a pension that the unfortunate employee who, because of his faithful service over long years, has got an allowance from his employer, should not have that calculated against him.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider that matter very carefully.  I am quite satisfied that the Parliamentary Secretary does not want to differentiate between the old age pensioners in the towns and cities and those in the rural areas, and I think that if he is to be consistent he will have to have some regard, at any rate, to the points that have been made on the Money Resolution regarding this particular type of person.</P>
      <P>Another point which, of course, can be made is this, that it is much more essential that these allowances should be made to applicants in the towns and cities than to applicants in the rural areas.  We all know that applicants for old age pensions who are living in rural areas, whether farmers or farm labourers, have many advantages, from the point of view of the cost of living and other things, over the person living in the City of Dublin or the City of Cork or in any of the provincial towns, and I think that if the case can be made&mdash;and I believe a good case can and has been made&mdash;with regard to the small farmers and farm labourers in the country, a much better and a much stronger case can be made in respect of applicants from the towns and cities, and I would ask the Minister to consider this matter carefully and see if he cannot meet the views put forward by Deputy Mulcahy and other speakers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Morrissey.  Deputy Morrissey mentioned employers who, after old and trusted employees have reached the age at which they become entitled to an old age pension and the age at <Col N="975" /> which they are, generally, no longer able to give their service, give these employees a certain weekly pension. If these pensions&mdash;if you like to call them pensions&mdash;are to be used against an applicant for an old age pension it is unfair and will very often militate against the just treatment of a good citizen and a good worker.</P>

      <P>I also wish very shortly to endorse what has been said by the last speakers.  I can never see the morality or the justice of estimating in the means of a retired labourer or a retired worker a voluntary contribution granted by a late employer, by a relative or by a friend.  Like Deputy Morrissey, I have known numerous instances where such voluntary contributions have been granted by employers or by friends or relatives, but, whether granted by friends or relatives on the one hand or by an employer on the other, I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that it would be entirely inequitable to count that contribution in calculating means.  I have seen cases in which this occurred, and I have seen cases, not at all infrequent, where the flow of charity has been stopped by the fear of interference with an old age pension.  I have known people to say: &ldquo;There is no use in my helping him or her, because if I do it will only be interfering with the old age pension,&rdquo; and the money is kept in the pocket of the employer or of the friend, and is not allowed to go where it ought and could go if the ordinary dictates of charity were free to operate.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to make it clear in the Bill, clear beyond doubt, that voluntary contributions, no matter from what source they come, are not to be counted in estimating means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already provided that temporary absence from the Saorstát area for a period of six months shall not cause the pension to be interrupted. We have also provided, that, in calculating &ldquo;residence&rdquo; for old age pension purposes, absence during which contributions are made to the support of dependent relatives in the Free State area, shall count as residence for old age pension purposes.  I think that these two provisions ought adequately to meet the matter of residence that Deputy Mulcahy has in mind.  I do not think the Deputy himself realises the reactions that the suggestion contained in his amendment would create.  The other amendment put forward by Deputy Mulcahy, and supported by other Deputies, would in actual fact secure that a person with £1,000 invested at 5 per cent. would be entitled to the full old age pension.  It is argued that because a farmer is allowed to divest himself of his farm, and to hand it over to his son, it is unfair to deprive <Col N="978" /> a town dweller, who is in receipt of £1 weekly, or who has £1,000 invested at 5 per cent., of a pension.

If a farmer divests himself of his farm at 70 years of age and hands it over to his son it should be remembered that that son has worked there for thirty or thirty-five years, and has given his labour free. If that labour was estimated at its normal value the son has already bought out that farm, and the father has ceased to have any moral claim on it.</P>

      <P>It is an amazing argument to find Deputies, who insisted two years ago that charity should be taken into account when estimating claims, arguing that a man with £1,000 in the bank, or £1 a week, should in addition get the old age pension.  That is amazing to me.  It is an amazing thing on the part of people who insisted that, if persons entitled to the old age pension had to enter a poor law institution, they had to become paupers when they entered, had to remain paupers while there, and had to take steps to apply for the old age pension again when they came out. These are the amazing things that have come out in this day's debate.  I do not think Deputy Mulcahy or Deputy Hayes are aware of the full reactions of the repeal of paragraph D of the Act of 1911:</P>
      <P>Account shall be taken of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by the claimant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that by the repeal of that section the class of pension mentioned by Deputy Hayes, and I think that mentioned by Deputy Morrissey &mdash;a pension to which the claimant is not entitled as a legal right; a pension that is given as a matter of sentiment, or as a matter of kindness by an employer&mdash;will not be taken into consideration in estimating the means of <Col N="979" /> a claimant.  That section insisted in taking into consideration charity as means.  I think that ought to go a long way to meet the point raised by Deputy Hayes.</P>

      <P>That is the point I want to raise, and I think the Parliamentary Secretary has forgotten it.  I was dealing with thrifty persons who, through trade unions, have provided for their old age.  I feel also that the Parliamentary Secretary was not addressing his remarks to me when he said that there were certain people unsympathetic towards the previous Bill he introduced.  At the time I supported the Parliamentary Secretary, and I am supporting the present Bill, but I am very much concerned indeed about the position of men who have, perhaps for 30 or 40 years, contributed to trade unions towards superannuation schemes.  There seems to be considerable sympathy for men who work for nothing.  I have not met any of them. I met thousands of farmers, but I have seldom met a man who worked for nothing.  I do not know any farmers' sons who work for nothing, even in County Monaghan.  They are fed and clothed.  I am concerned with those who contribute to trade unions, and that is the point I ask the Parliamentary Secretary not to lose sight of.</P>

      <P>It is possible that in some cases he is not entitled as a matter of right, but the Parliamentary Secretary has machinery to discover that.  Will he undertake to discover whether that superannuation benefit is legally payable, in the full sense of the word legally?  It may not be as simple a question as Deputy Anthony thinks.  If it is legally payable will the Parliamentary Secretary take steps to see that it is not taken into account?  There is no use telling us he wants to do something and then to discover when the Bill is passed that it cannot be done.  The Parliamentary Secretary has machinery to discover what &ldquo;legally&rdquo; means in the context.</P>

      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary has put the position very clearly.  He has told the House&mdash; and I respectfully agree with him&mdash; that where allowances are voluntary and not legally enforceable they are not to be counted.  On the other hand a man's legal income must be calculated against him unless it is provided to the contrary by legislation.  There is another case of which I have known one or two instances, and that is where an old employer has made provision in his will for an employee.  From the Parliamentary Secretary's answer an employee will be prevented from excluding in the calculation of his means the pension under a late employer's will.  In the present position I do not see how the Parliamentary Secretary could get rid of it in such a case as I mentioned.  The Parliamentary Secretary will see that it would be legally enforceable.</P>

      <P>Many points have been referred to with regard to means.  The pension officers in rural areas act on <Col N="981" /> a wrong basis of assessment, inasmuch as they value things, not at the rate current in the locality, but on the basis of what they would be worth in a city or a provincial town.  I would respectfully suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary to bear that in mind and that in future, when the new Bill will be in operation throughout the country, the pension officers should adopt a fair basis of assessment.  The other point I wish to mention is in regard to the residence test.</P>

      <P>I think I have made the position as clear as I could.  There was just one point which Deputy Hayes raised that I did not refer to&mdash;the case of a house in the city where a man has put his life's savings into it.  The income from that for old age pension purposes is to be calculated at 5 per cent.</P>

      <P>Deputy Wolfe wants to know whether emoluments would be taken into consideration in estimating means.  I am not taking it upon myself to define who is legally entitled to a pension in this State.  I do not think it is part of my business in connection with the Bill or the Money Resolution, but I will say this, that if a person is legally entitled to a retiring allowance of 30/- or £1 per week, and that that claim is legally enforceable, I do not feel it is up to us to provide a pension for such a claimant.  I do not think that anybody in the House could assume in approaching this question that any such amendment could be acceptable to the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary must remember that there is a class whose superannuation or pension allowances range from 6/- to 15/- and in some cases £1 per week. An allowance from 6/- to 15/- per week is a sum which might be considered by the Minister as coming within the scope of the Bill.</P>

      <P>(An Clár): This is the greatest bogey raised in this House for some time.  We heard a lot of talk about trade unionists making thrifty provision for themselves in their old age.  Would Deputy Anthony say how many trades unionists in this country are paying into that particular fund which gives them superannuation allowance in their old age?  It ought to be clearly understood by people who are not conversant with the ramifications of trade unionism and trade union funds that you pay into one fund for the protection of your conditions and wages and that you pay into another fund which, by actuarial tables, are made to guarantee that you will receive a superannuation allowance.  How many such trade unions are operating in this country at present and how many citizens of this country are affected by the point which has been referred to by Deputy Anthony?  Deputy Anthony might as well tell us that the employees of public bodies, who pay into a superannuation fund, are in exactly the same position.  This is honestly the greatest bogey raised in this House for as <Col N="985" /> long as I remember.  Information as to the exact number of people paying into this particular fund and the exact number of trade unions operating here which make provision for a superannuation allowance on retirement on old age would be very valuable to Deputies before they decide this question.</P>

It would be impossible to compute the number of persons affected, but the Engineering Union, the Amalgamated Woodworkers' Society, the Bakers' Society, the National Union of Coachbuilders, the Typographical Association, the Dublin Typographical Provident Society with other Unions which I cannot recall at the moment make provision in this way.  I should like to know whether Deputy Hogan, who has just spoken about trade unionism, is a trade unionist.</P>

I should like him to confirm that.  I understand that the provision made is that the six months period of absence will not count to break the period of qualification for an old age pension.  If the Parliamentary Secretary can point out to me that the six months' absence will not deprive a person in receipt of an old age pension from receiving the pension during that period, it will completely meet the purpose for which I put down my amendment.  It will meet my point if the Parliamentary Secretary will look into the matter and secure, if provision is not already made, that such a period of absence will not deprive a person in receipt of an old age pension of the pension for that period.</P>

That is the present law.  What I propose to do is to substitute for that one-tenth, one-twentieth of the capital value up to the sum of £400, and if the capital value exceeds £400 one-tenth of the capital value of such amount as is more than £400.  That is getting back to the method of calculating the means and income from such property investments or property capable of being invested as operated under the 1919 Act.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1933, for a grant in aid of the Irish Olympic Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This estimate is being introduced in order to make a grant of £1,000 to the Irish Olympic Council towards the expenses of sending an Irish team <Col N="992" /> of athletes to compete in the Olympic Games in Los Angeles next month. The Council, which comprises the Irish Cycling, Athletic, Handball and Swimming Associations of Ireland intends to send 14 competitors to the Olympic Games, and they estimate that it will cost £150 each, or a sum of over £2,000.  The Council has sufficient funds to train and equip the team, but it is unable to pay the expenses to Los Angeles.  This, I think, will be the third occasion upon which Ireland has had separate representations at the Olympic Games.  The first occasion was in 1924, when a small team was sent to Paris and when the expenses were defrayed by public subscriptions.  In 1928, however, there was a departure from that, and £1,000 was contributed towards the expenses of the team which went to Amsterdam that year. We have felt, after a great deal of consideration, that in view of the fact that certain important decisions are to be taken to represent the status of this country in the athletic world, and in view of the fact that an attempt is being made this year to have handball recognised for the purpose of Olympic contests, and also because the Games this year are being held in a country in which the Irish population is very extensive, that it would be inadvisable for us to depart from the precedent which has been established by the previous Government and to have refused to assist the Irish Athletic Council.  Accordingly we are recommending this grant to the House.</P>

      <P>Handball is not an item in the contests this year, but a team is being sent out.  It is on trial, so to speak.  I understand that steps have been taken to secure the same status with regard to hurling, but the <Col N="993" /> suggestion has not advanced yet to the same stage as in the matter of handball.  It is much more expensive to send out a hurling team than a handball team, and that may have had something to do with the attitude of the Olympic Council.</P>

      <P>The vote of £1,000 is required to give effect to the decision of the Executive Council to make an advance to the Council of Aonach Tailteann in respect of the Games to be held from 29th June to 10th July next.  This is merely a continuance of the policy which has always been adopted with regard to these Games.  They have received very generous support in the past when any such generous support was required. On the last occasion in 1928 the State advanced £2,000, which sum was repaid following a financial success.  It seems to me that in view of the history of the Games in 1928 the amount which is now being provided will be used more in the nature of a guarantee than in the nature of an actual loan&mdash;a guarantee against loss.  The conditions of repayment will be imposed by the Minister.  From the assurances which I have received from the members of the Council of Aonach Tailteann and in view of the special circumstances of this year, I have no doubt whatever that the £1,000 will be repaid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister for Finance whether, in regard to this proposal, he or the Department of Local Government has examined any scheme which would be directed towards providing work in lieu of benefit for the unemployed. This scheme, I understand, is designed principally for the purpose of providing employment for as <Col N="995" /> many of the unemployed, who are in serious need, as is possible.  I mentioned in this House on a previous occasion the possibility of the Minister for Finance, acting in collaboration with the Minister for Local Government and with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, examining into certain schemes that might be laid before them, of regarding those schemes as schemes of emergency and seeking to secure the co-operation of the representatives of Labour to allow of the employment of men in receipt of unemployment benefit at rates which would produce for them a larger income than the unemployment benefit, but at rates which, admittedly, would not be a standard for trade union wages.  It is a difficult and a delicate point, because, as I understand, the position of the Labour Party and of the Labour leaders in the country, generally, is that it is dangerous to admit of the policy of labour on any Government scheme except on the basis of trade union rates, as the rates paid by the Government might be used for the purpose of pulling down the rates of wages generally.  On the other hand, we are faced with an enormous number of unemployed; we are faced with an enormous amount of work to be done; and in this city the bulk of that work will be the rebuilding or the building <i>de novo</i> of houses for the poor, for the labouring classes, and for the unemployed themselves.  The Government have put their hands to that work.  They will be constrained in the carrying out of that work only by their resources.  I suggested on a previous occasion that the community should be asked to make a contribution. I think the Minister has taken that suggestion in a very literal way, and he has asked the community to make a very substantial contribution towards the solution of the present problem of housing and the other work that he has undertaken.  I ask him to ask Labour to make a contribution, and to ask such other sections of the community as will be in a position to help to do so.  I ask him now to consider a scheme whereby he might provide persons on <Col N="996" /> the unemployed register with work at special rates, on enterprises which, in the opinion of the Executive Council, are enterprises of urgency and enterprises largely directed towards the end of lifting up the social standard available for the working classes themselves, and for the poorer sections of this community.</P>
      <P>It would be too elaborate to attempt to outline a scheme, but I hope I have made myself clear to the Minister. What I am suggesting is that where a man goes on the road with the unemployed, instead of becoming eligible only for unemployment insurance benefit he would have the benefit and, in addition, a further modest sum in consideration of the placing of his services at the disposal of a public authority, designated by the Minister or the Executive Council, which would be engaged on works of social improvement. Instead of having to exist merely on his unemployment insurance benefit, he would have the addition of a small wage, which would not be governed by trade union considerations.  For that additional small wage and the unemployment benefit he would place his services at the disposal of public authorities in connection with housing or other such schemes as the Government would certify to be schemes of urgency, calculated to relieve the very class of person to which the man belongs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is desirous of relieving unemployment and to that end he has asked that those who are unemployed should register in the Labour Exchanges, in the local Gárda Stations and in the Post Offices.  I want to indicate that the real problem of unemployment exists in the rural districts from about the middle of November to the middle of March. During these four months conditions are very bad in the rural districts.  I suggest that a certain amount of this grant should be earmarked to meet the situation that will obtain during the coming winter.  In the rural districts now there are farming operations going on and they absorb numbers of men. Road-making, tar-spraying and various <Col N="997" /> other activities are in progress.  There is drainage to a small extent being carried out.</P>
      <P>The City problem is a different one. There is unemployment in the City and it will probably have to be met immediately. The Minister will get no indication of the rural problem from the returns of the labour exchanges at the moment or from the comparative few who may register now at Gárda Stations or Post Offices.  He will get a true indication of the problem in the winter time and I think it is desirable that portions of this grant should be allocated to meet the necessities of the country at that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am glad to see £150,000 allocated for the relief of the unemployed, I desire to point out that the sum is entirely inadequate to meet the existing situation.  Judging by the reports on unemployment in the City of Dublin, it would take fully £150,000 to relieve the situation, not to mind the rural areas.  I do not agree with Deputy Kennedy's suggestion that a certain portion of the grant should be earmarked for next winter.  County Westmeath is different from the area I represent.  In my constituency there is very little tillage and, consequently, there are large numbers of unemployed agricultural workers existing on home help. The amount proposed to be granted is scarcely adequate to meet the situation and I do not see how any portion of it could well be left by until the winter time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister should take his courage in his hands and face a situation which is one of the most serious with which the country has to contend.  Let him not worry about large taxpayers like Deputy Good or others; let him consider the poor people who are dependent on charity and who are anxious to get work. Amongst the schemes suggested in connection with this grant of £150,000 clearance of sites and sewage have been mentioned.  The Minister does not indicate on what conditions the grant will be made.  There are numbers of public bodies already overburdened and it is their desire to alleviate the <Col N="998" /> sufferings of the unemployed by providing useful work if they could afford to put schemes in operation.  If schemes are put forward on the basis that local authorities will have to make a substantial contribution, then I am afraid the poor unemployed will have little hope of relief.  The fact is that local authorities in many instances will be unable to make any contribution towards the completion of schemes.</P>
    <P>So far as road improvement work is concerned, no doubt there are many local authorities anxious to put schemes into operation so as to give employment, but if they have to bear a certain proportion of the charge, I am afraid the schemes cannot be availed of.  I fully realise the difficulty from the Minister's point of view, but at the same time I think it is well to point out the condition in which many local authorities find themselves.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing to the members of the Labour Party to find such a small amount being allocated to meet the existing needs of the people.  I believe the present Government are more sympathetic than their predecessors in this matter.  I appeal to the Minister not to consider Deputy Dillon's suggestion, given no doubt with the best of intentions, about having a low rate of wage and other conditions for men who are looking for employment under relief schemes. The suggestion is that they should accept something less than the current rates.  That is a dangerous thing.  We all know that when Deputy Mulcahy was Minister he sent out an order fixing wages at 22/- and 25/- a week in various rural areas.  We know the effect it had on employers all round the particular localities concerned.  I am aware that in the case of certain contracts, even Board of Work jobs, they wanted to establish the rate of wage ordered by the Minister.  In my area I will not agree to workers engaged on public works, such as housing or sewerage schemes, accepting a lower rate of pay than they should receive under local trade union conditions.</P>
    <P>With regard to sewerage schemes preparatory to the development of <Col N="999" /> housing sites, I agree that the Minister might suggest certain conditions to local authorities in the way of bearing a certain proportion of the cost.  I suggest, however, that in relation to the development of sites and the making of roads, the Minister should consider the financial position of each local authority before deciding upon any conditions.  He should not compel local authorities that have had to face during the last four or five years, £40,000 or £50,000 a year in the way of home help, big overdrafts and a large amount of outstanding rates, to accept the same conditions as local authorities in Cork, Limerick or Dublin where there are high valuations and where the burden will not fall so heavily on large ratepayers as it will on the poorer residents in rural districts.</P>
    <P>I will ask the Minister not to delay with any of the schemes before the public boards but to sanction them immediately so as to prepare the way for some relief to be given to the unemployed during the next two or three months.  I am sure the public bodies will co-operate in every way and I hope there will be a further Vote put forward for a further amount to relieve the distress.</P>

      <P>I wish to appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to do something for the relief of unemployment in County Mayo.  There are from 5,000 to 10,000 men out of employment in that county.  Fully 2,000 men are out of employment in the island of Achill. Useful works could easily be started down there to absorb a lot of that unemployment. There is great necessity for drainage in the county, particularly <Col N="1000" /> the River Robe in the Claremorris area.  Thirty-five thousand pounds was supposed to be allocated for that work four or five years ago, but nothing has been done.  Fully 500 men could be put to work on that.  In the lower part of the county there are three rivers requiring drainage and a scheme has been in the hands of the Board of Works for the drainage of these rivers. The County Council has already passed a resolution giving the necessary guarantees and still the Commissioners of Public Works have done nothing.  I understand, of course, that the present people could not do much in the three months in which they have been in office, but I wish to point out that this is the time for drainage, so I hope they will do all they can to get this started.</P>
      <P>The fencing of land is another question and the making of roads there&mdash; that is, lands in the hands of the Land Commission for the last four or five years.  Nothing has been done in regard to road making or fencing or drainage of those lands and the people in possession of them are very anxious and there is a good deal of unemployment. I hope the Minister will do all he can to get some work started in this connection.  In the case of the Clare-Dalgan River the County Council also gave the necessary guarantees, and yet nothing has been done, and I hope the Commissioners for Public Works will see to this also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be rather a good idea if in the rural areas the portion of this unemployment grant devoted to road making were not spent on the roads usually maintained by the county councils.  In every county in Ireland&mdash;at any rate in the county I come from, I know there are certain areas in which a considerable number of ratepayers live who have no facilities for getting down to the public road.  They send letters to us here in Dublin and they appeal to all and sundry to have something done for their roads.  When they go to the County Council they are told that they can do nothing for them.  The roads have never been in contract, or if so they are not of sufficient importance, in view of the growth of motor traffic, to do anything for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> Under such a scheme as this these roads could be dealt with.  I am not suggesting that they should be put on the County Council register, but the people in these areas would be quite satisfied if a fair amount of preliminary work were done on the roads and they were put into such a condition as would make it possible for them to maintain them themselves.  Any Deputy here, who is a member of a County Council, will agree with me that time and again we have been compelled to turn down appeals from people who, we knew, were really in a bad way.  I know of people who are unable to come out of their farm. They have to come across fields and in wet weather their condition is pitiable. The ordinary road work of the County Council, that is on the main roads, can be done in the ordinary way.  It is only fair to the ratepayers in those districts that something should be done for them, and under such a scheme as this that could be done.</P>
    <P>Complaints are made from time to time that certain gangers employed in connection with these works employ pets of their own.  This is a matter which should be watched also.  I think it should be made a condition that, in the first place, married men should get preference and after the married men, single with dependents. Very often young men are seen working on the roads and it is complained that older men should be working, but in such cases the young men very often have people dependent on them. The only thing that should rule employment is that married people or single people with dependents should get first preference and the county surveyor or whoever is responsible should see to it that the local gangers should not use personal preference in these matters.  Time and again we have got complaints as to this and, of course, human nature being what it is, the most deserving people are sometimes left out in the cold.</P>

I come from a rural constituency where unemployment is always acute, particularly so this year. In view of the fact that many of the avenues that in previous years were open, such as harvesting in Scotland and England and the fishing industry at home, are now practically closed, especially the fishing industry owing to unfavourable markets for last year's catches, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to hasten on this work.  As I said the unemployment problem in Donegal is very acute.  It is acute in the congested areas at all times of the year.  I agree with Deputy Everett that public bodies in the Free State are overburdened with their present liabilities.  I suggest to the Minister that he might see his way to put into operation sewerage and drainage schemes so as to lighten the load put upon those public bodies.</P>
      <P>I take exception to the statement made by Deputy Dillon in regard to the wages to be paid to the workmen employed on these works.  If we set out to employ men on these works we should give them a living rate of wages. I agree with Deputy Everett that men engaged on this work are entitled to a living wage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One is naturally inclined on an occasion of this sort to concentrate one's mind upon one's own constituency.  I hope that the Minister in administering this wretchedly small sum, but relatively great sum for this State, will have regard to the interests of each borough and county borough.  While I feel that the amount is small I rather sympathise with the officials who are to administer it.  I find that the sum of £19,000 has already been eaten up, that £25,000 is allocated, leaving something like £106,000 to be disposed of. I want to know from the Parliamentary <Col N="1004" /> Secretary how it is proposed to allocate this money.  I heard the Minister state that the departments&mdash; I am speaking from memory and am open to correction&mdash;would co-operate with the County Councils and other bodies in the administration of the money.  I feel that the whole administration of this money is beset with a lot of difficulties.  I hope in its allocation regard will be had to the necessities of each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have in Cork City a very large number of unemployed.  I do not want to put the claims of Cork before that of any other city, but I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that it has been admitted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the reports of the various exchanges are not a true indication of the state of unemployment.  If an exhaustive examination was made it would be found that there is a greater proportion of unemployed in Cork City than in any other borough of the Free State. Because of that I hope regard will be had to the necessities of the case when this scheme comes to be administered. In connection with the hope expressed by Deputy Dillon in this matter that the trade unions will not insist upon certain rigid conditions, and that their regulations will be translated freely in regard to wages, I would remind him and others that while these people, labourers and other workers in this country, are prepared to make sacrifices such sacrifices should not be asked all the time from this particular class of workers.  I have no doubt that accommodation will be found, but I should not like it to go forth from this House that men are to be asked, because it is a relief scheme, to accept wages that will not give them a decent or fair living. Nobody regrets more than I do the necessity for these relief grants and I hope these things will not be recurring.  While we all have the desire to relieve unemployment by these temporary expedients, we would prefer some larger, bolder, and more spacious scheme by which we could put an end to unemployment.  I am not suggesting that the Government should work wonders.  I said some time ago in this House that if 40,000 people were <Col N="1005" /> put to work, that had previously no work, I would be satisfied, and I would pay the Government a wonderful tribute for having done it.  Any attempt they make to solve this problem, or alleviate it in any way, will have my strong support. I remind the House, again, that while I feel that the persons to whom this grant will apply will not be found unreasonable, still they will demand all they possibly can in order to get what is commonly known as a living wage.  I speak for a class of men that are not organised. The majority of men employed in these relief schemes are not, as a rule, members of any organised trades union.  I do not think that the bogey of trade unionism need have been trotted out at all, because I do feel that these men who are unfortunate enough to be unemployed, and many of them lucky enough to be drawing unemployment insurance, together with those of them who are not drawing unemployment insurance, will be found very reasonable indeed, when it comes to discussing their conditions and rates of pay.</P>
    <P>I do suggest, however, that those men should not be used to exploit the position of other workers, who are already in employment, because we cannot get away from this fact that, no matter how accommodating these workers may be&mdash;and they will be very largely unskilled workers&mdash;and no matter how accommodating they are found to have been, the position has always been exploited.  I could give ample evidence and ample proof to the Minister, or to the Parliamentary Secretary, that what I say is a fact. The reason I stress this point is that I feel the impression might get abroad that certain exorbitant demands will be put forward, on behalf of these people, who will get relief by way of employment under this scheme, and I want to disabuse the mind of anybody who labours under the delusion, all the time remembering, that, no matter what sacrifices they make, they will not be taken in the spirit of sacrifices at all, but other people will use these sacrifices and exploit the whole situation to undermine the position of <Col N="1006" /> the organised trade unions in this country.</P>
    <P>I look on this merely as a moiety, a small attempt, but a worthy attempt &mdash;I do not want to decry it in any way&mdash;but it is a very small sum of money, and I do not know, considering all the difficulties that have to be met, how the Department is going to satisfy all the representatives in this House, representing 26 counties.  Even if you took it county for county, and divided 26 into it, you would not keep 2,000 people at work for a week at £1 a week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKiersey" hpid="Mr. Kiersey Mr. Kiersey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiersey</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I can see, the difficulty before the House is to try to allocate this sum of money to relieve the unemployment that faces us. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary when he is allocating this money to weigh very carefully the schemes put before him, and to see that the work done under this grant will be the most reproductive work, and that the money is applied in the best manner possible.  In the rural districts of the county I represent, there are certain roads, as was pointed out by my colleagues on the opposite benches, which have come up for discussion at the County Council for years past, and in respect of which we have received deputations. We know that the work is badly required, but, as Deputy Goulding pointed out, the legal difficulty is there that they were not under contract in olden days, and that in the case of 70 per cent. of them, they were not up to a particular width, and, also, that they were cul-de-sac roads. I hope that in the allocation of this grant, or in the Bill providing for its allocation, all these legal points will be wiped out.  All that these people want is a road over which they can do their business.  They do not require a road 14 or 15 feet wide.  They want a reasonably good road, and they will be satisfied with that.  A good deal of useful work could be done over a large district of the County Waterford at a reasonable expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the City of Waterford, I know that unemployment is rife, and I know <Col N="1007" /> that as a member of the Board of Public Assistance.  It is for that reason that I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see that this money is spent in something reproductive, or something that would be of benefit later on. I presume several schemes will be put up, and the Minister, with his expert information, will know, more than the ordinary man in the street, how best that can be brought about.  I do not believe in paying a man to take clay out of one place, and to put it into another, in order to set him at work. I do not want to ask any man, and I have never asked any man, to work for anything less than a living wage, but I would appeal to the Labour Party to agree, that, when a work of public utility is started, the workers at least should continue that work at the local rate of wages, and that local rate I would take as what was being paid to the county council workmen.  I do not think that would be unreasonable, and I do not think that anybody could say that the workmen under the county councils of Ireland are not getting an economic wage.  It is suggested in some county councils&mdash;I do not say all of them&mdash;that the county council men are getting too high a rate of wages, and it is pointed out that one member of a family is working for a farmer at 25/- a week, while another is getting 35/- a week from the county council.  Some of us do not agree with that, because I know that, in our county, a man working under the county surveyor has to be a more energetic and younger man than the man working for a farmer.</P>
    <P>The only regret that I have is that there is not more money available, and that we have, unfortunately, to cut our cloth according to our measure, and that a sufficient sum of money cannot be put up by the country to relieve all the unemployment.  Another matter that I would point out to the Parliamentary Secretary is with regard to the sanctioning of grants for public utility schemes.  The borrowing power of one particular district in my area is exhausted.  It could not borrow £500, and certainly could not borrow £1,000.  They would be prepared <Col N="1008" /> to go on with a scheme and to do it on a fifty-fifty payment, but they could not possibly do it.  It would be like putting them in the same position that I heard a friend of mine describe once, of the man who was offered a coat and vest on condition that he would buy a trousers.  He could not afford to do that, and he would have to go naked.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will probably understand what I mean.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed at the amount of money it is proposed to allocate for the relief of unemployment. When the amount is divided up amongst the Twenty-Six Counties it represents about £5,000 for each.  As one Deputy stated, when the gangers employ men they select friends.  Some counties will get very little of this money.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will see his way to have the grant increased.  No matter how small a grant is made, I hope that the spending of it will be left to the discretion of the county council, the urban council or whatever local authority is in charge.  I hope it will not be made a condition, as it was under the late Government, that where grants are given wages will be reduced and that people who have been unemployed for months will have to work at practically starvation wages.</P>

I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give preference to cul de-sac roads, of which there are four or five in County Dublin.  An appeal was made to the ex-Minister for Local Government to deal with three of these roads in order to facilitate the farming community, but nothing could be done. On one of these roads in County Dublin £1,600 is paid in rates by farmers and nothing has been done with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>A road in the village of Clondalkin.  There is another road in the village of Finglas and another one in Irishtown, Lusk.  I hope these roads will be attended to if County Dublin gets any money under this grant.  The Board of Health in County Dublin has undertaken work on roads, also sewerage and water supplies, representing an outlay of £70,000, and other schemes are under consideration.  I notice that £30,000 out of the £150,000 has been already distributed, so that there is very little left to relieve unemployment. I hope whatever work is to be done will be undertaken at once and not postponed.  The workers are clamouring at meetings of county councils and boards of assistance for employment.  It is a pitiable state of affairs.</P>
      <P>I want to call the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the conditions that prevail in works in Co. Dublin, particularly in Rathmines and Pembroke, undertaken out of unemployment grants.  These townships have been taken over by the Dublin Corporation and men are sent out from Dublin to Dundrum and to Milltown to work on sewerage schemes, while local men have to look on and to walk to James's Street to ask for relief.  These local men have to go to the Labour Exchange in Gardiner St. a distance of 7 or 8 miles to register. Some of them have been doing so for two years.  They complain that builders' labourers who have been fairly constantly at work are employed.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will see that men in the locality are taken on, and that men who get employment from the Corporation are not sent out. Two of the men that I am referring to refused to seek relief.  The men I am speaking for are honest men. They want work and they say that they would prefer to starve and to die on the street before seeking relief. I hope that in a short time another grant of £150,000 will be available for the relief of the unemployed.</P>

      <P>In the allocation of this grant I hope the Parliamentary <Col N="1010" /> Secretary will remember the position of counties that are affected by the stoppage of emigration.  There is a surplus population in County Mayo for the past one or two years owing to that fact, and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will see that it gets its share of this money.  Most Deputies would prefer if the amount of the Vote was larger, and they have hopes that, perhaps, in a short time, another grant will be available for the relief of the unemployed.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should see that piers along the seaboard which are used by the fishermen are repaired. Some of the piers that are used are not suitable for the development of fishing.  Some work might be done in that way.  I impress upon the Parliamentary Secretary the necessity of giving special consideration to counties with growing populations.</P>

      <P>On the discussion of the motion that was before the House in the name of Deputy Morrissey I represented to the Minister that the unemployment problem was serious in Limerick.  I can say to-day, as I said last night, that I have never seen it so serious.  I suggested to the Minister that roads, drainage and housing schemes should be immediately tackled for the purpose of relieving the situation.  I further suggested that if it was the intention of the Government to experiment with turf as against coal the bogs of West Limerick should be utilised because certainly the problem of unemployment there is serious.  I have intervened in this debate for the purpose of referring to a suggestion made by a Deputy on the Government Benches because I was under the impression that his remarks might be taken as representative of the condition in all rural areas.  He asked that a certain sum of this money that is about to be voted should be ear-marked to relieve his constituency in the winter time. That may give an impression to the Minister or to the Parliamentary Secretary that the conditions in his county exist in all the rural areas.  I say with a full knowledge of the rural areas at the moment, at least as far <Col N="1011" /> as my county is concerned, that they are as much in need of relief as ever they were and I hope that when the Minister is allocating the money he will relieve the areas needing relief immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that first attention should be given to the fishing areas or to areas where the fishing industry has failed, particularly those in County Kerry.  Three weeks ago, I approached the Department in connection with the allocation of a grant for the relief of the people in Brandon area.  The position in that district is appalling.  The fishery industry has failed and there is no source of employment. In the extreme portion of the Dingle peninsula, the fishing industry has also failed and the people are in a hopeless condition.  One important point as regards wages should be borne in mind.  Relief work has been started in the Maharees and the rate of wages announced was 21/- per week.  The result has been that the men went on strike and the work has been held up.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that the principle on which the wages should be fixed in future should be the fair rate of wages as prevailing in the district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a good deal to be said as regards the allocation of the relief grant to local authorities.  For instance, local authorities make provision for the expenditure of certain sums on road making with the proviso that the Land Commission should contribute half the amount.  There is a certain amount of over-lapping in that respect because the Land Commission engineers come along first and carry out their portion of the work.  The engineers of the local authorities come along later and carry out their portion. The result is that there is not that united effort to complete the work as it should be completed.  As a way out, I would suggest that local authorities should get complete power to carry out what we might describe as Land Commission work, or that they should carry it out in future in conjunction <Col N="1012" /> with their ordinary work as local authorities.</P>
    <P>As regards the point about valuation and the number of unemployed in each county, I think that in so far as Kerry and other poor counties are concerned they should get special consideration. Looking at it from the point of view of rateable capacity, Kerry could not, out of its own resources, nor could any other poor county like it, raise the necessary money for road making or other improvement works in the same way as richer counties.  As an instance of that I might point out that Kerry must tax itself to the extent of 3s. 7d. in the £ to provide the same amount of work per mile of road as Dublin does for 1d. in the £.  Kerry cannot, therefore, out of its own resources provide the same amount of work as these richer counties.  Further, under a proper allocation of the grant, the amount to be given to Kerry should work out at £3 14s. for every £1 Dublin gets.  That would be the proper basis in future.  The poor law valuation in each county in conjunction with the number employed in that county should be the determining factor in making allocations.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that that would be a fair and equitable basis on which to proceed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certainly pleased that this £150,000 is being made available by the Government.  It is certainly needed and indeed much more would be needed at the present time. In allocating grants I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will take into consideration works that were previously in hand by the Land Commission in the way of village roads and roads into turbary.  A good many of these works were taken in hand, but for some reason or other in many instances there was not sufficient money to complete them.  At the present time some of them are not of much use.  I might also point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that at the present day you have hundreds and hundreds of acres of turbary which are still undivided in the hands of the Land Commission.  I believe that if roads were made and the turbary divided the price that <Col N="1013" /> would be eventually obtained for the turbary would account for a good deal of the money expended on the roads.  In fact, I saw one instance in my own constituency some few years ago where there was very little lost on the road when the turbary was divided and sold.</P>
      <P>The Minister will probably be allocating some of this money to local authorities and I should like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to what are known as district roads.  We all know that in the past district roads suffered at the expense of main and trunk roads.  You have a number of district roads in every county used by farmers, particularly tillage farmers, which have been neglected.  If they were taken in hands they would afford a good deal of employment. I believe that a light rolling and widening, something say that would cost about £200 or £250 a mile, would be a great advantage.  I should also like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to proposals that have been before the local authorities for the past two or three years. They have found it very difficult to provide money for the carrying out of certain works.  Those works were what we may call big village roads which connected two main roads.  In several instances, if these roads were made available, it would shorten the journey of the farmers.  In one instance, the farmer has to travel eight and a half miles to his market town.  An expenditure of £600 would bring him within two and a half miles of the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several instances of this nature.  I shall just mention one in north Galway.  The estimated cost of the road from Cahermorris to Cummer is £600.  The County Council have agreed to grant £450 for that work. That means that in or about £250 of a Government grant would put that road in order.  Those works would give a good deal of employment.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will see his way to make grants available for water and sewerage schemes as well. In the small towns and, indeed, in some of the larger towns in the western counties, the water and sewerage systems are very poor and very <Col N="1014" /> ancient.  In a town with a population of 3,000 in Co. Galway, the sewerage system consists of a flagged drain going through the principal portion of the town.  I refer to the town of Tuam.  The health of the people is bound to suffer when you have such bad sewerage, combined in many instances with a bad water supply.  I believe that if the sewerage and water schemes were taken in hands seriously the rates would be much relieved, because in all these places there are frequent outbreaks of fever of different types and these involve great expense.  The question of drainage does not come under this Vote, but if the Parliamentary Secretary could assist in that direction it would be of great benefit.  Several schemes of drainage have been voted on already and nothing remains but to start the work.  In Galway there are four dredgers working on the Ahascragh drainage scheme.  Another scheme in the Mountbellew area is ready.  The fear of the people is that the dredgers will be taken away and the work delayed. The Craig Abbey drainage scheme near Athenry is in the same position.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will take these schemes in hands because the next five or six months will be the proper time for drainage work.  The work would also relieve unemployment to a great extent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with the Parliamentary Secretary in dealing with this problem. There is a rather limited amount of money at his disposal, considering the total requirements and the inroads that have been made upon it.  It seems to me that some Deputies are more concerned for those already in employment than for those who are out of employment, and who, we are told, and, I believe, are hungry.  I take a different view altogether. Every week five or six men pass through my place looking for work. I have eight or nine men and I cannot afford to take on others.  If I consulted my own convenience, I would keep two or three less and I may have to do that within the next few weeks. If I had to make a choice between <Col N="1015" /> one man at 35/- and two men at £1 each, I would prefer to give the two men work at £1 each.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, I am sure, realises the stress of the times we are living in and the financial and economic condition of the country.  I am sure he also realises that the agricultural workers who are not dieted in the farmers' houses are paid about £1 per week.  In very few cases are they getting 25/-.  Men are working for 8/- and 9/- per week, the farmer supplying their food.  Ten shillings would be a common wage for good men.  He would have to be a good man to get it.  We should realise the position and deal with it as it is and not be living in a fool's paradise.  There is talk of men already in employment.  Here is the mentality that is shown in some places. I quote from the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo;&mdash;I have not the date:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The dispute between the Council and the local labour association in reference to the removal of the debris lying beside the main thoroughfares after the drainage of the River Fergus has ended in the U.D.C., against the advice of their surveyor, deciding by a majority to surrender to the workers' demand for 16/- a day, 12 standard loads to be removed per day.  A local carter, who had been expelled from the union, had accepted a lower rate of pay but could earn 18/9 per day because (he wrote to the Council) he found it easy work to remove 15 loads in an eight-hour day.  He was, however, only allowed to work for one day, as the Workers' Association would not tolerate a man doing so much work.  The Council's decision was reached after a long discussion at a special meeting&mdash;the second within a week to deal with the question&mdash;and &ldquo;the man that works too hard,&rdquo; together with the officials of the Workers' Association, were called in.  The hard-working carter was appealed to by the councillors to rejoin his society and to conform to its rules, whilst the officials of the society were requested to reinstate him.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I cannot give it to you.  My idea is that these relief measures in the times in which we are living ought to reach as many as possible and ought not to be confined to any favoured few.  If two people are hungry and if we can reach the two people, the Parliamentary Secretary should not be influenced by those who are in sheltered employment.  The farming community can only employ labour at the rates which it can afford. These rates are very small.  The good men are employed and the men not quite so good are out of employment for one cause or another.  Generally, the better men are in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is rather an unpleasant job for the Parliamentary Secretary to try to <Col N="1017" /> please everybody in the matter.  The object of this vote is to relieve hunger and distress, and if the Parliamentary Secretary does not relieve hunger and distress in the largest measure in which he should meet it, then he is not meeting the situation in a Christian spirit. It is not being met in a Christian spirit.  I deny that it is a Christian spirit that one man is to demand and receive 60s. or 55s. or 50s. or 40s. a week while numbers of other men are hungry. That is not a true Christian spirit.  The statement has been made here that they would not be asked to work except at a wage that will give a man a frugal means of living.  This is an emergency Vote and it is meant to deal with an emergency situation.  It is not meant to be bound by any trades union rules or regulations or rules about output or rules with regard to hours.  I think Deputy Dillon took the right note in the House.  This is a Christian House and in dealing with a question like this it should act in a Christian way, but some of the men who were talking about a Christian spirit here do not know anything at all about a Christian spirit.  Their idea as to what constitutes a Christian spirit is to give one man a good wage and let others starve. That is not a good Christian spirit and it is the sort of spirit that I have a very poor opinion of.</P>
    <P>The resources of third country are not inexhaustible.  They really are limited.  There is very little question about that and the present Government, in trying to frame their Budget, has found that out.  The shoe is now pinching in that direction.  This country is a country of limited resources as compared with other countries. It is a question of cutting your coat according to the cloth.  It is a question of passing legislation for the whole people and of helping the whole people.  One man in this country has as much right under our laws and under our Christian principles as the other man.  I will not stand for the aristocrat in labour or for the aristocrat in employment while another man is starving on the roadside unable to get employment.  Deputy Flynn, of Kerry, referred to the <Col N="1018" /> wage of 21/- a week, but even with that wage you could not still absorb into employment all the unemployed in the country, taking into account the limited amount of money at your disposal. You cannot do it.  There would still be people unemployed even at that figure, but you have only to go as far as you can on the road.  That is the duty of any Government animated by a Christian spirit.</P>
    <P>With regard to my county, the Minister has recently, I understand, received a deputation in connection with drainage works.  We know that this is the season of the year when drainage works can be engaged in most profitably.  In the fall of the year and in the winter time, work may be done on the roads, but the present summer season is really the time for drainage works on the lands and on the rivers. Drainage is a work that depends on seasonal conditions, but work on the roads can wait for the winter months. I say to the Deputies here who have drainage schemes in their counties that it would be much better to have men employed now on those drainage schemes than to be turning them on to road work.  Road improvement and road construction can be carried out in the winter, but drainage schemes cannot.  Where it is possible to carry out drainage schemes in any country they should be undertaken now, and road improvement left over for the winter period.  I am sure every Deputy here will agree to that.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister had deputations waiting on him from my county in connection with some big schemes of drainage.  These are big drainage schemes that no individual farmer or group of farmers could carry out.  These are schemes even that no one individual county could be held responsible for.  There is the drainage scheme of the Dinan and the Nore and this is a scheme for which any one county could not be held responsible. The Dinan comes down from the mountainous district, bringing down with it in the rainy season thousands of tons of rubble and gravel.  All this matter is brought down with every flood and it would be impossible for <Col N="1019" /> one county to deal with a problem like that.  The whole map of that district has been changed in recent times.  A farm that at one time was on one side of the river is now on the other side of the river.  The land along the Dinan and the Nore has been changed because of the action of these rivers. That is a big job for the Parliamentary Secretary to consider.  With this money at his disposal I would urge him to use a considerable portion of that money to improve the position down there.  That is a very urgent position&mdash;urgent from the point of view that there are hundreds and thousands of acres along the Nore under water because of this flooding.  I understand a few schemes have been submitted to the Parliamentary Secretary, and if the work is going to be done at all it ought to be done so as to make a good job of it, otherwise the country will be continually spending money and continually coming to the Dáil asking for more money in order to deal with it. If this flooding is not dealt with it will be a source of trouble every year.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of Thomastown.  That can easily be dealt with.  It is only a matter of sinking near the bridge.  The flooding in Thomastown has been caused every year for want of having that done. I take a different view from other Deputies in saying that we ought have an eye on the prevailing wages in the sheltered trades.  That ought to be the view of all Deputies here.  In my opinion we should set ourselves against that attitude entirely.  In the relief of unemployment we should consider first relieving the most distressed.  We should aim at relieving destitution. This is an emergency situation, and we should try to secure relief for the greatest number of people, and not try to help a few with the implication &ldquo;to hell with the rest.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be helpful if the House would possibly keep to the general question as distinct from particular question in particular constituencies. If we simply deal with a series of possible relief schemes in each particular constituency we cannot get <Col N="1020" /> very far.  We could all agree to add up the cost of a given number of works in each constituency and then one would get a figure larger than you could possibly provide money to deal with.  A general consideration of general relief schemes would be more valuable and helpful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. B. Maguire Mr. B. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I think a good deal of useful work could be undertaken, or rather useful work might be supplemented somewhat by giving the county councils certain powers in the handling of this money.  In addition a good deal of saving could be effected in home help by local bodies as a result of the spending of this money, and perhaps augmenting what the bodies contribute themselves by what is available from Government sources.  The Board of Works might be able to supplement the money available in some districts by special grant.  I do know that local bodies are ready and anxious to avail of any opportunity they get to relieve themselves of the burden of home help. But where the necessity is great, where the urgency is great, and where the demand for employment is great, the need for grants of this sort is so great that it might be well if the public bodies could supplement in this way grants that are available from the Government.</P>
      <P>I was more than interested in hearing the solution offered by Deputy Gorey to this House in the matter of relief.  It was most interesting.  He would solve the problem easily if it were left to him.  He is a man with a great mind, and he has no difficulty in handling the situation.  Where he had one loaf he would divide that loaf into two, and instead of giving it to one man he would give him half the loaf, and give the other half to the other man who had no share.  He has seven men employed, and if the choice were given to him he would prefer to employ twice as many.  Why does he not divide the wages he is giving to the seven between fourteen men?</P>

      <P>That is not the question that we are dealing with now.  To show the magnanimous man with the Christian outlook we will see how he deals with the position when it comes to the dividing of the money down in this own county.  He says to the Dáil: &ldquo;Let us divide our loaf in a Christian spirit.&rdquo;  But his actual demand was that a considerable proportion of the entire contribution by the State should be allotted to his county.  There is the man with his magnanimous mind dividing his loaf in two.  If there is only one loaf for distribution he will see it divided between two.</P>

      <P>I am only contrasting it with the general statement which the Deputy made earlier.  I do not believe that it would be good business that we should adopt Deputy Gorey's suggestion, that in dealing with the unemployment problem we should proceed by the way of reducing wages generally.  The standard of wages should be the Christian standard.  The wage should be a fair wage such as would allow a labourer to provide for himself and his family in decent comfort. These are the lines that we propose to go on, and anything that Deputy Gorey may say will not induce us to depart from those lines.  Deputy Gorey suggests that a solution of the problem may be found in reducing the workmen's wages according to the general needs.  In that event another aspect of the case may probably have to be looked at, and some person may say that there are other persons who have an excess, and that he is entitled to have it.  I do not believe that these will be the right lines to follow, and I should be sorry to allow that particular policy to be placed before the House without urging on the House that the method of tackling the problem with which we are confronted suggested by Deputy Gorey would be a bad method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in introducing this estimate, offered very scant information to the House as to the manner in which he proposed to expend the money and as to the particular schemes that he has proposed to undertake. He did make the bald statement that it was intended to utilise this grant for the purpose of clearing old sites, and erecting new building upon them.  I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary whether it is intended to spend the greater portion of the money in clearing derelict sites in Dublin, or whether portion of the money will be allocated to the different cities and towns throughout the country, for similar work and for house building schemes following on the clearances.  I understood also from the Minister that the expenditure of this money will be under the control of the Department of Local Government, <Col N="1023" /> and that the portion of the grant which is to be spent on road making will be administered by the county councils throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that the county councils are the very best body to administer a grant of this kind for the purpose of making new roads or improving existing roads.  I think that the money could be very much better spent by a Department, let us say, like the Land Commission.  I think that the Parliamentary Secretary has discovered by now that the Land Commission is not the sort of institution that it was represented to be by him and his Party when in opposition.  He has now discovered that it is one of the most efficient Departments of the Government. And I think that in that Department of the Land Commission they have got a machine by means of which it will be possible to carry out an enormous amount of work in constructing a number of very useful bog roads and roads generally designed to improve the holdings that were acquired under the earlier Land Acts.  I mention this fact primarily for this reason that most of the sales that took place in this country under the Land Act of 1903 were direct sales effected between the landlords and the tenants, and consequently at the time of these sales no money whatsoever was spent in improving particular holdings and particular estates; and in many cases these holdings have deteriorated in value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some cases, at all events, these holdings have deteriorated in value since the sales actually took place for certain reasons.  One reason, of course, is because no drainage work, or very little drainage work, has been done since.  And in some other respects the holdings have not been improved very much.  In connection with the sales of a good many of these estates new roads were necessary at that particular time, and in many cases it was necessary to carry out certain drainage work.  I consider that in the case of a grant of this kind portion of the money should certainly be set aside for such purposes as these.  I do not believe that the money could possibly be spent in a <Col N="1024" /> better way, and I agree with Deputy Gorey that at this season particularly a certain portion of that money should be spent on small drainage schemes. The Parliamentary Secretary will find, in the Land Commission offices, estimates of small drainage schemes for almost every part of the country, so that he has this particular source of information readily available for his purposes.</P>
    <P>There is unemployment not alone in the urban areas but in the towns and cities as well.  I have made one suggestion as to how it is possible to relieve unemployment in the rural areas, and that is by undertaking drainage schemes or drainage work, a description of work which, I say, is particularly suitable for this season of the year.  In undertaking road work, I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should exercise discrimination.  I know very well that if the county councils are charged with the responsibility of carrying out road schemes all sorts of absurd proposals will be made to them.  Perhaps the county councils will be very anxious to carry out works regardless of merit and quite regardless of utility.  There should be some standard laid down by which it will be ensured that the works undertaken are works of real utility and of some advantage to the community.</P>
    <P>There is another means of spending money for the purpose of relieving unemployment, and that is on waterworks and sewerage schemes.  I do not think myself that the importance of schemes of that kind in country towns could be overstressed.  The sewerage arrangements in some of our small towns are really a scandal.  They are potent sources of disease.  And I think that the Parliamentary Secretary should see that portion of this money is set aside for the purpose of enabling local authorities to carry out waterworks and sewerage schemes in towns where the conditions are suitable and where the local authorities are agreeable to undertake schemes of this kind.</P>
    <P>I know many country towns, a certain number at all events, where the sewage arrangements are exceedingly <Col N="1025" /> primitive, where there is undoubtedly a possible source of disease, and where there is the possibility at some future time of a serious outbreak of disease. I think the installation of a suitable sewage system in these towns would be one means of spending this money very usefully and effectively and in the very best interests of the county.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned two items of expenditure already undertaken.  He referred to £19,000 for the Board of Works schemes, but he did not indicate what those schemes were.  I assume they were undertaken since the new Government took over control. He also mentioned a rather intriguing item of £25,000 for mineral exploration. The Minister offered no explanation as to the type of mineral exploration that is being carried out.  I assume the Parliamentary Secretary will explain the sort of minerals in the exploration of which this money is being spent.  It is a pity the Minister did not go into detail beforehand.  He would have given Deputies an opportunity of discussing these two items more completely, and he would have also given a lead in the discussion on this Vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite certain Deputies are sincerely anxious to do anything they can to bring to the notice of the Ministry the serious conditions existing in their own particular counties.  If anything should influence the Minister, everything else being equal, it should be the real question of unemployment as it exists in each county, and the fact that there are useful works urgent at the moment.  I am glad that there is every intention to get on with the work.  Where you have in a county 25,000 people, and where you find home help to the extent of almost £2 per head of that number, you will observe that it is a very serious situation.  I believe the Board of Works are already undertaking schemes in Co. Kildare where the unemployment situation is very serious, the number of unemployed being the highest in the whole 26 Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to bog roads, I believe much useful work can be given.  I hope <Col N="1026" /> the time is at hand when the Land Commission will be able to rid themselves of that responsibility.  It is time that work was handed over to the Roads Department so that it can be attended to expeditiously.  I make that recommendation, and I hope it will be adopted, if it is at all possible to do so. Bog roads have been very much under discussion of late, and it is very desirable that they should be given immediate attention.  They perform a very useful function, and are of great utility to the people who reside in their vicinity.  I urge the Minister to give every consideration to bog roads and to the schemes submitted by county councils and urban authorities when he is allocating this grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this particular Vote.  No matter how small it may be, it is a step in the direction of removing a particular grievance that exists in the country.  We all welcome any attempt to remove that grievance. I must confess I am just made a little bit suspicious by the Minister's statement when introducing this Vote, that portion of the money would be spent on clearing derelict sites for the erection of new buildings.  We can all sympathise with the unemployed in the cities.  It is in the cities in the main that we have derelict sites and that there is opportunity for building.  If we are to believe all we have heard here for some months back, then there is a prospect other than relief votes for the relief of unemployment in the cities. We have read our newspapers day after day.  We have listened to Ministers week after week.  We have heard of the number of applications&mdash;frenzied applications&mdash;to start factories or to purchase sites in cities for the building of factories.  If all that is to be believed, then the main portion of a Vote such as this should be expended in the areas where there is real depression and real widespread unemployment, namely, the agricultural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sympathise with any Minister and with any Parliamentary Secretary who is faced with a situation in which you have approximately 80,000 unemployed and with a sum of £150,000 to spend on the relief of unemployment, a sum <Col N="1027" /> which would really mean £2 a week for the lot of them for one week.  I sympathise with the Parliamentary Secretary in any attempt he may make, faced with 80,000 unemployed, to put that £150,000 as far as he possibly can. I sympathise with him also in his appeal to us to view the thing from a national point of view rather than from a constituency point of view.  At the same time, each of us outside the cities must be conscious of the conditions in our own constituencies and our particular duty here is to call attention to the conditions which exist in our constituencies. Without urging the claims of one constituency more than another, it is our duty to call attention to any claims that exist in our own areas and then leave it to the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister to decide how best to allocate this grant.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the constituency of Leix-Offaly I might remind the Parliamentary Secretary that once upon a time, and not very many months ago, he addressed a meeting in a place called Wolfhill, together with a Minister of the Executive Council.  In connection with this outline of expenditure on the mineral resources of the country, I might remind him that on that particular occasion the Deputy, as he was then, who is now a Minister, made a promise to the unemployed in the Wolfhill area and to the general voters of the district that, if a Fianna Fáil Government was elected as the Government of this country, the Wolfhill coal mines would be re-opened. I do not remind the Parliamentary Secretary of that particular speech by a Minister of the Executive Council in order to score any political capital.  I merely call it to his attention in order to remind him how some expenditure of this Vote may be made.</P>
    <P>There is another situation existing just a couple of miles away from Wolfhill. This is a matter which I think is receiving the serious consideration, and has been receiving the serious consideration, of his own Department, I think, for some six months.  That is, the drainage of the Douglas river outside of Ballylynan.  I am not sure but <Col N="1028" /> I understand that money spent in the way of labour in connection with drainage schemes goes furthest.</P>

      <P>Anyway, it is a source of very considerable employment, and employment of such a nature that the people on the spot can be brought in, in order to work on that particular type of work, because it is a type that does not require skilled labour.  These are two sources of employment, two opportunities for expenditure of some of the money out of this particular grant in a particular area, where the Parliamentary Secretary and his colleagues were most impressed and most impressive in their language with regard to the volume of unemployment.  For that particular reason, and merely for that reason, I transgress the Parliamentary Secretary's request not to deal with this from a constituency point of view.  But I think that if he jogs his memory backwards and looks up the records of that area and thinks of the history of that particular area he will find that there is a strong enough claim for special consideration &mdash;strong enough even to outweigh his request that we should forget to view this from a constituency point of view. There you have a part of the country which within a few short years back was a hive of industry, a coal area with a busy railway line carrying coal from it, with every young boy in it a worker with his future assured so far as was possible, with a bright prospect, and suddenly the whole thing closed down, the railway line removed, the people without a hope in the world.  Surely, that is a place where some little portion of this Vote should be spent, and seeing that a portion of it is to be devoted to an examination of mineral resources, I think it could not be better spent than in that particular area.</P>

      <P>In view of the appeal of the Parliamentary Secretary asking Deputies not to take up the time of the House by bringing particular appeals to his notice, it is with reluctance that I stand up here to bring one grievance before you.  I wish to draw attention to a part of the constituency <Col N="1029" /> which I represent, which I can say here was sadly, and I may add, wilfully neglected by the late Government. That is, the district near Banagher, where the people are driven from their homes three times annually owing to floods.</P>
      <P>Representations were made in this House on various occasions about this condition and the result was that the Land Commission sent down their officials to investigate; but the only thing ever carried out in that particular area was an election road that was half finished at the election of 1927. Not only are they driven from their homes three times annually but they have lost their crops and stock every year.  They have no access to any town except by means of boats on the Shannon.  Their children going to school have to cross a foot-bridge over the canal, where the water is 30 feet in depth.  They asked that a bridge would be constructed across the canal. The Galway County Council set aside a certain amount of money but the Land Commission would only give something like £2,000.  The architect said it would take £2,500 to put a bridge across it.  In any case, I believe a Mr. Keenan, of Dublin, agreed to put a bridge across it for £600.  I think that that particular area where these visitations occur should be attended to and that a portion of this unemployment grant could not be expended better than by erecting that bridge across the canal.  Such a bridge is sorely needed.  These floods affect at least 30 families.  I would also draw his attention to the fact that in certain cases the unemployment grants were given almost entirely to areas that were not in such need, and I would suggest that the present one should be given, as far as possible, to the districts neglected in the past.</P>

I would be glad to have an approximate figure.  I think, and I <Col N="1030" /> daresay he will agree with me, that nothing really can be worse than to stir up hopes which will not be realised.  In the course of this debate, we have heard from Deputy after Deputy of the various things that ought to be done in his particular constituency, and every person in every part of the country wishes that particular bit of work which would give relief to unemployment and at the same time benefit himself to be carried out.  A grant of this nature naturally leads, and always will lead, to a certain amount of disappointment, and for hopes to be raised and disappointed is very bad for everybody concerned.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to let us know how much of this grant will be available for rural areas, so that the people in rural areas may not have their hopes unduly raised&mdash;hopes which will afterwards be dashed to the ground and disappointment follow.  I gathered that a considerable amount of this money is to be spent in the clearing away of buildings on derelict sites in order to make those sites available for building purposes.  Obviously these are practically all city sites.  How much money of this grant will be spent for that purpose?</P>
      <P>I would like also to bring home to the Parliamentary Secretary the fact that, as far as the building trade in Dublin is concerned, it is going to have, for the next two or three years, a very prosperous time.  It is going to reap, rather unexpectedly, a golden harvest.  I suppose a sum amounting to something between £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 out of the sum which will come to the hospitals, as a result of the proceeds of the Hospitals Sweepstakes, will be spent in building in this city in the immediate future.  As far as I can understand, Holles Street Hospital is ready to commence building operations.</P>

      <P>I am reminded that it has commenced.  Other hospitals are also considering putting up new buildings.  Therefore, as I say, the building trade in Dublin is going <Col N="1031" /> to enjoy an excellent time for some years to come.  Quite apart from Government building, as a result of the Hospital Sweeps the building industry in Dublin will be in a most flourishing state.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not.  But I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to keep before his mind that there is a very excellent time coming for that trade.  Deputy Good admits that, as far as one hospital is concerned, something like&mdash;I am not quite sure what the cost will be&mdash; £100,000 will be spent on the new building.  The Parliamentary Secretary can verify the figures if he desires. There are various other hospitals that will also be re-building.  Therefore I think that a very reasonable amount of this sum of £150,000 can be allocated to rural areas, because, undoubtedly, the farming community, and especially the small farmers, are going through a very bad time, the worst, almost, in human memory, owing to the terrible fall that has taken place in the price of live stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary made an appeal to the House that we would not attempt to go through the various things in our constituencies that we think ought to be done, but it has been always customary on Votes of this kind that Deputies get up and mention the different things they wanted done in their constituencies.  I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that this is a matter that will be honoured more in the breach than in the observance. He was not very sanguine that it would be observed, and I am not going to observe it at the present time.  I would like to indicate to the Parliamentary Secretary what, at any rate, is my view as to how any sum of this nature that comes to a constituency like Mayo might be expended.  It might be expended on drainage, and I shall come back to the question of drainage in a moment.  It might also be expended on some of the larger roads which would not only give employment <Col N="1032" /> in these districts, but might help greatly to develop the tourist traffic. There are some very fine roads in that area that would enormously benefit by steam-rolling.  I shall give examples of two, one partly in my own constituency, the main road from Headfort to Cong, which would give a great deal of employment and would bring tourists in comfort to very good fishing. Another would be a road like that from Westport to Louisburgh, which is one of the most beautiful drives and seascapes one could possibly imagine.  I consider these as two schemes on which money might be spent; and, having now committed the very minor breach of the arrangement suggested, I pass on.  I have indicated the kind of work that might be done in South Mayo, but to come back now to the question of drainage.  I see that a sum of £19,000 is allocated to the Board of Works.  We have not heard how that is to be spent.  I take it that it will be spent principally in drainage schemes.  I do not know how the Board of Works will spend it, or whether they will spend it on piers or harbours, but I venture to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that if he would tell us roughly&mdash;I do not want details&mdash;how it is to be spent, that would give the country an idea of what to look for, and it would prevent false hopes that the money might be spent in other directions.</P>
    <P>I saw that when Deputy O'Higgins said that drainage gave more employment than anything else the Parliamentary Secretary shook his head in dissent.  I would be perfectly in agreement with him in connection with money spent on very big drainage schemes where the bulk of the work is done by machinery as in the case of the Barrow drainage.  Where a huge amount of work is done by machinery there is not as much spent in wages as there would be if the same sum were spent on roads.  But if you take the smaller drainage schemes, like the river Robe, where £50,000 was to be made available, a very considerable amount of employment would be given because machinery which is used in a drainage scheme like that of the Barrow would not be used there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hugo Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would allow me, because this question is causing a certain amount of trouble. I was under the same illusion, but it is one of the illusions that I have scrapped.  The position as regards drainage schemes is that in any of them which has any pretence to be economic, a large amount of the work has to be carried out by machinery which gives very little labour and no local labour.  As far as schemes carried out by hand are concerned, they are very expensive, and as a rule are very difficult to defend on the ground of economy.  I shall give an example.  I have had two or three schemes which would be carried out by machinery estimated for as carried out by hand, and in each case the cost has been about 300 per cent. more than the other figure.  You can find schemes 100 per cent. labour content in the way of drainage, but if they are anything like large schemes they are probably uneconomic; but there are some small schemes practically drains which are very valuable both from the labour point of view and the labour content.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in complete agreement with the Parliamentary Secretary, so far as that is concerned, because I heard that the Barrow schemes cost less now than in 1870, when the rates of wages were half what they are now.  But I have been always under the impression&mdash;I am open to correction&mdash;that schemes done partly by machinery do pay a very considerable amount of wages, and I know of schemes carried out that did, in fact, give a very considerable amount of employment.  I pass from that. There is only one other matter, and that is a question of a sum of £25,000 which is for the exploration of the mineral possibilities of this country. As far as I see, that will not be ready to give any employment for a very considerable amount of time, because, before any employment can be given, I take it that the very best experts must be called in, and that they will only begin very tentatively, and with a very small number of employees, at any particular place, until they get indications that the place is worth probing further, and, therefore, for a <Col N="1034" /> very considerable time the expenditure on employment must, of necessity, if the scheme is going to be carried out intelligently, be comparatively small under that heading, and that £25,000 will take a very long time to expend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>In this matter it would appear from the claims put forward by individual Deputies that everybody here represents part of the most distressful country that possibly exists on this earth, and an appeal to us to get away from what I would call the parochial outlook, and to regard this problem as a national one, I am afraid, is vain, because it is impossible for us to forget, when we come here, the problems we were sent here to rectify, and for which the people who live around us are clamouring for a solution.  However, I shall do so, as far as possible, in regard to any observations I have to make on this matter, because the Parliamentary Secretary himself will know part of the country to which I shall be alluding, and some of the problems I may incidentally mention.  First of all, with regard to the expenditure of this money, the suggestion has been made that it should be carried out for the most part through the county councils. From my experience of county councils, I do not think that they are at all the best bodies to administer relief schemes, except in one important particular, road making.  They have the machinery and the officials for the making of roads, and, furthermore, road-making has this one particular feature, that it is the one thing that we can suggest that will give the greatest amount of physical labour in proportion to the amount of money spent on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a part of the country, which I shall not mention&mdash;a very important county&mdash;there are about 6,000 miles of roads already in existence.  They are nominal roads, and there are only about 1,000 miles of very good roads. There is a big field there for the expenditure of some of that money, and, with all due respect to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, it contains some of the most beautiful scenery in any part of the world.  A beginning has been made through a pass, called after a very famous Irishman, who shall be nameless, for obvious reasons, and, in <Col N="1035" /> the future, when the present little depression in the world has blown over, we hope to bring back to this country a very large proportion of the tourist traffic that is at present being diverted to the Continent and other places.  That is all I have to say with regard to administration through county councils, but I think the problem of the small town in Ireland is a problem that is crying out incessantly and most urgently for redress. The small town is the centre in which the greatest amount of unemployment at present exists.  The small town in Ireland has suffered severely in the last ten years through various political changes, and also through the economic changes that have come about.  The local market in the small towns has ceased, in some cases, to exist, owing to the facility with which the travelling shop or lorry brings requirements to the farmer's door, and takes from him his produce in return. The local market has suffered in this way, and as a consequence, local employment has suffered.  Furthermore the railways have lost their traffic, and the railway employees have lost their labour, through the decline of these towns.  So far, there have been two branches of the railway shut down in that part of the country, which shall be nameless.  That is a very serious matter.  These railway lines have shut down simply because these little towns, which were the distributing centres for merchandise in a region of about ten miles around the town, have ceased to exist as such distributing centres, owing to the manner in which goods are brought to the farmer's door.</P>
    <P>There are towns on the seaboard especially, and towns that were garrison towns, which have suffered severely.  One of these garrison towns, with which the Parliamentary Secretary will probably be well acquainted, has lost, through the loss of its garrison, an annual sum of £200,000, a very large sum for a town of 4,000 or 5,000 people.  That was the price that the little town had to pay for its freedom.  Some of us, perhaps, were glad to pay the price, and others thought it too high a price, but, at <Col N="1036" /> all events, the result at present is dire unemployment, and unless something is done to relieve that unemployment, these towns will go into decay.</P>
    <P>There is another class affected in what I will call the coastal fishing towns, which are to be found along the seaboard, both on the east and south coasts.  In some of the parts of the Gaeltacht there are fishermen with little plots of land, who, when they are not fishing, are able to eke out an existence by their activities on the soil, but in these coastal towns there are certain fishermen, mostly old men, who follow no other avocation but that of the sea.  That calling at the present time is very precarious.  In fact, as the Parliamentary Secretary will understand, fishing on the Irish coast, for the last five years, has been practically a failure, and these old people in the coastal towns have suffered accordingly. What we could put forward to alleviate their position it is impossible for me, at the present time, to suggest, but some time later, if I have an opportunity of speaking to the Parliamentary Secretary, with his knowledge of these conditions, a knowledge which is better and more experienced than mine, we may be able to hit on some way of solving their problem. The providing of boats does not seem to solve it, because there is no use in providing boats at a time when fish do not seem to exist in certain places.  The town problem is the problem of unemployment, because in the rural districts there is always something to be had, and no Deputy has ever known of anybody in a rural district going hungry.  Such is not the case in the towns, where actual distress exists and actual want is rife. That is the position in the towns, and particularly the small towns of 4,000 to 5,000 people, and I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, in dealing with any scheme that may be put before him, the problem of the small towns, with which the national life is most closely identified, will be treated sympathetically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): The most obvious feature of this Vote is its inadequacy to meet, or even to make an impression <Col N="1037" /> upon the problem that presents itself to the Government to-day&mdash;the solution of unemployment.  It will not make much inroad on that problem, and certainly will not relieve it to the extent that every Party in the House would like to see it relieved.  I think it is up to Deputies to give all the help they can to the Parliamentary Secretary in devising schemes by which money can be usefully employed in absorbing the largest amount of labour. Deputy O'Neill spoke about tourist roads and an influx of tourists.  What strikes one as most remarkable up to the present is that whilst we were always engaged in providing velvet roads to bring tourists to tourist districts, to some extent the condition of the roads in these districts was ignored. There are velvet roads to the tourist districts but, when one goes to these districts one finds the roads there in poor condition.  That is the reason why I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give particular consideration to that aspect of the question, and to see that there is some consonance between the condition of the roads leading to tourist districts and the roads in the districts. It may be no harm to say that work on the roads is probably the best means of finding employment.  I might mention that there are some roads in tourist districts maintained by county councils under which the sea has eaten. It is obvious that county councils with limited resources cannot meet all the demands that are made upon them. This is a matter where the Board of Works or some Government Department should give assistance that would provide employment.  As to roads through villages in a county the argument will be that many of these are under contract and that contracts of that kind could hardly be interfered with when endeavouring to relieve unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, I am sure, whether in the Land Commission or the Board of Works, many schemes for roads to isolated hamlets.  People are paying in some cases rather large annuities to the Land Commission, and yet they have not the same advantages in the way of roads to their houses as people <Col N="1038" /> who are paying smaller annuities.  That is a position that should be considered. There are propositions before the Land Commission that were previously turned down for some reason.  People get buff forms stating that these matters will be considered when the lands are vested.  I do not know how long it will take before the vesting is completed, but, in the meantime, people have to struggle through mud, briars, and undergrowth in order to get into houses in parts of the country.</P>
    <P>In the Department for which the Parliamentary Secretary is responsible there are many drainage schemes which were turned down because they were regarded as uneconomic.  Is that going to stand between the Parliamentary Secretary and the employment that might follow if these schemes were put into operation? Deputies connected with local bodies are aware that letters are received from the Board of Works by these bodies intimating that certain schemes are uneconomic unless county councils are in the position to undertake a large percentage of the expenditure. Everyone knows that county councils are not in a position to do that because of local burdens.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have a search made in his Department and to have the schemes for the various counties examined. He will find many schemes which, if put into operation, would give a good deal of employment.  Notwithstanding the fact that, possibly, a good deal of machinery would have to be used in drainage schemes, a good deal of labour would also be employed, and in that way relief would be afforded to the unemployed.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will consider these suggestions, and will make whatever investigations are necessary, so that employment will be given as soon as possible.  As I said, the most obvious feature of this Vote is its inadequacy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney when he said that the bulk of this grant should be expended in the rural areas rather than in clearing building sites in the cities. After listening to the speeches that <Col N="1039" /> were made on both sides of the House I must candidly admit that my sympathies go out to the Parliamentary Secretary, who will have to deal with this unemployment question with £100,000. I think he might truthfully be called Minister for Unemployment. What can he do with £100,000 in the way of drainage, site-clearing, road-making, and the other things that were suggested? I presume that County Cavan will get at least its share&mdash;I am not asking for any more&mdash;of the £100,000, but that share will not amount to more than £2,000.  If £2,000 is allotted to County Cavan, that works out in employment for 25 men for 12 months, 50 men for six months, and 100 men for three months.  I cannot see that much drainage schemes will be carried out, or that the small towns in the county will be supplied with sewerage from such a small amount.  Having regard to that fact, it is my opinion, in which I will be backed by my constituents, that this money could be most profitably spent, and give the greatest amount of employment, if spent on the by-roads, or, as the Parliamentary Secretary called them, cul-de-sac roads. In my opinion there is no other way in which the largest amount of employment could be given with the amount of money available.  I know of many places, and I expect the Board of Works knows of them, where drainage could be carried out, but I would not insult the Parliamentary Secretary by asking him to bring drainage under this Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said that my sympathy went out to the Parliamentary Secretary.  Perhaps I was wrong.  I can see promotion for the Parliamentary Secretary if he is able to wriggle through with £100,000, or to satisfy one per cent. of the Deputies or the people outside.  It would not be a precedent if the Minister for Unemployment here failed in his task and got promotion, because we had a visitor here a few days ago who undertook to find a solution of the unemployment problem in England, and not alone did he not find a solution, but he utterly failed in his task.  During that Minister's period of office unemployment <Col N="1040" /> figures soared.  I hope that will not be the case with the Parliamentary Secretary here.  Whether the Parliamentary Secretary fails or succeeds in his task, he will, I hope, get the same promotion as the late Minister for Unemployment got in another country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>My observations on this question of the allocation of money for the relief of unemployment will be brief, because I believe no good purpose would be served by going into schemes in detail here.  Finally, these schemes will rest with the local bodies, and it is up to them to get suggestions from the people in their areas as to how the money should be allocated.  I am in agreement with some of the Deputies who stated that any great percentage of this money should not be given to the cities or big towns.  In every discussion that has taken place about unemployment, the cities and big towns have loomed largely, but we heard nothing at all about the rural areas.  It happens that the people in the rural areas are not as loud in their complaints as the people in the cities and towns.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that it is not because these complaints are not forthcoming from these districts in the rural areas he should not apportion as good a percentage of the money that is being given under this scheme for the relief of unemployment to these rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle made a very wise suggestion when he said that the time has come when the roads in the tourist areas should be improved. After all, it is very little benefit to have the roads leading to those places inviting if the conditions in the places themselves are not inviting. I know that in my own county, Kerry, some of the roads in what I might describe as the most beautiful parts of Ireland are impassable, and tourists who might be inclined to spend their holidays there are loath to enter these areas on account of the bad condition of the roads.  I think it would be a very wise move to spend some of the money on the improvement of those roads in the tourist areas.  Cul-de-sac roads should also be <Col N="1041" /> taken into consideration.  In my part of the country the people are chiefly concerned with the making of roads into turbary.  There are places where people have to struggle against terrible odds to save their turf.  If short roads were made here and there it would obviate the difficulties with which they are confronted.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the question which has not been touched upon by any speaker yet, and that is that those responsible for the allocation of this money should make sure that the proper people will get employment and that big farmers will not get employment. In my own area, for instance, lately it has happened that a big farmer has got employment to the utter exclusion of a good many labourers living around him.  That is a state of things that should not be permitted any longer.  The motto should be to provide employment for the unemployed and not to expedite work by placing it in the hands or under the directorship of men who happen to be in a position to do the work more speedily than those who are entirely dependent on such a scheme for their existence.  I would also suggest that the time has not yet come to undertake the big drainage schemes that we have heard about recently, because the money allocated under this heading is not sufficient to carry out these drainage schemes.  I think it would be better to confine the money to the making of cul-de-sac roads, roads into turbury, and the improvement of roads in the tourist areas.  I am sorry that Deputies are disappointed with the amount of the grant.  We are all disappointed, but it cannot be helped under the circumstances.  At any rate, it is a beginning, and we hope that the time will come when another grant of this kind will be made for the carrying out of other schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I believe the Parliamentary Secretary made a bad tactical error when he expressed a wish at all that Deputies would not turn the debate into a discussion of their own particular bog roads, no matter how necessary they might be. I express sympathy with him because I have had to listen to this type of <Col N="1042" /> debate in the past.  I shall, myself, carry out his wish in that respect.  I am not going to refer to any matter in my own constituency in any way in this debate, no matter how necessary it may be.  I believe that leads nowhere, that discussions on a relief Vote should be on the general matter rather than on the particular matter, and that the particular matter should be sent up to the particular department in the ordinary way.  I have always felt, and I still feel, that when you discuss this bog road or that bog road, that particular drainage scheme or this particular drainage scheme, it is purely and simply for the local Press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not, unfortunately, able to be present when the Parliamentary Secretary made his opening statement, but I believe he said that there was £19,500 allocated for expenditure by the Board of Works and £25,000 for mineral exploration, about which we would like to hear a good deal.  That leaves a sum of over £100,000 unallocated, if I am rightly informed.  Presumably, that amount will be divided as between the Local Government Department, or the local authorities if you like, and the Land Commission for expenditure.  From my experience in the past, there are a few things that I should like to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary in connection with that expenditure.  One of them is that many schemes on roads were started under former relief schemes.  Certain roads were started in various places all over the Saorstát. The amount of money available at the time was not sufficient to complete these particular works.  I think that those should be taken right away as the first charge on the present relief Vote, and, where the Department is satisfied that the work is of sufficient importance, uncompleted work should be at least completed.  Deputy Corish raised the question here, I think, yesterday on another matter, that the making of an allocation to a particular area should not be contingent on the giving of an equivalent vote from the local body.  A point I would like to stress is that there are many roads that have been made by the Land Commission, for instance, into bogs that are public utility roads.  I should <Col N="1043" /> like the Parliamentary Secretary, as far as he can influence it, to insist that if the local authority is not compelled to make a contribution to the making of a given road, it at least should guarantee to take responsibility for the maintenance of the road after it has been made.  The completion of existing roads and the getting of a guarantee from local authorities that roads made under these schemes will be maintained are the two points I should like to stress.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I should like to mention, although probably it does not come under this heading at all, is minor marine works.  They have been referred to by certain Deputies.  I think there is an estimate in the Parliamentary Secretary's own Department, the Board of Works, to deal with minor marine works, as recommended by the Department of Fisheries. I can deal with them under that Vote rather than on this Estimate. There was one in particular to which I intended to refer.  I know there is a report in connection with it, but I shall wait until the Minister's vote is taken.</P>

      <P>I shall.  Mr. MacNeill made the report.  Amidst what we might call Deputy Curran's perpetual disappointment&mdash;Deputy Curran suffers from being perpetually disappointed on everything that is brought forward&mdash; he raised one point that appealed to me.  It had apparently been raised before by the Parliamentary Secretary. That is, that moneys should be allocated, so far as they will be given to local authorities, to roads that do not come under the ordinary purview of other grants.  Cul-de-sac roads may be a good description.  There are certain roads which are not dealt with by the county council and which have not reached such a low grade that they have benefited by former relief votes. I think it would be a good idea if some of this money was allocated for putting these roads into the repair <Col N="1044" /> they were in, say, a few years ago&mdash; again, if the local authorities were prepared to maintain them in the future. Many by-roads which were not repaired by the county council have been allowed to go out of repair.  They were in such a position that, under former relief grants, the Land Commission was unable to spend any money on them and the local authorities were unable, or unwilling, to spend any money on them&mdash;I think they were unable under the conditions on which they got the grant.  These roads were between the devil and the deep sea, one might say.  They were not helped from either end.  Some of these roads are really useful not alone in my own constituency but in other constituencies. They have been, more or less, abandoned by their own county councils and have not been helped by former relief votes.  I think the most necessary of them, as the Parliamentary Secretary would be advised, should be put into a decent state of repair under this scheme if the local authority is prepared subsequently to maintain them in repair.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Unemployment, having heard the speeches from all parts of the House, must be impressed with the necessity for taking back this Vote, bringing it before the Cabinet, and convincing them, as he can in his usually eloquent language, that the Vote should be considerably increased.  If I had the right to do so, I would feel inclined to move the reference back of the Vote.  I feel that I would get the unanimous approval of the House in so doing for this particular purpose.  Deputy Lynch has rightly reminded the Minister for Unemployment that the total sum likely to be made available for the various relief schemes is in or about £100,000.  I do not know whether or not the Minister has read a speech delivered at a recent meeting of the Dublin Corporation by Deputy Briscoe, who promised the Corporation, presumably on behalf of the Government, that they would receive a grant of £40,000 in addition to the grant of £10,000 already made.  I ask Deputies who represent rural constituencies to realise the position we are <Col N="1045" /> in in taking part in this debate if the statement made by Deputy Briscoe was made with the authority of the Government with which he is associated.  A sum of £150,000 is, on that basis, to be made available to local authorities and the Land Commission to carry out schemes which will relieve unemployment in the country.  I wonder if that represents the Government point of view regarding the extent to which unemployment exists outside Dublin.  On what basis have they arrived at £150,000?  Has the Minister for Unemployment called for any returns from the Land Commission of the schemes lying in the pigeon holes of that big Department for the construction and maintenance of bog roads. Every Deputy who takes an interest in his constituency can truthfully say that there are many schemes in the pigeon holes of the Land Commission, approved by inspectors as a result of visits to the areas concerned, for the construction of bog roads which are absolutely necessary.  Neither the previous Government nor this Government has made the necessary money available for the construction of these roads. The repairing or constructing of bog roads is a national necessity.  There are many bogs in the Midlands to which the people could not gain access last year to get out their turf.  Money should be made available in almost every constituency for work of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister for Unemployment has not got that return, I would ask him to request his colleague, the Minister for Lands and Fisheries, to provide him with such a return as soon as possible.  He will then realise the extent to which useful work of that kind can be carried out.  I agree with Deputy Lynch that people who are likely to benefit as the result of the carrying out of such works should make a contribution in some way. Until such roads are taken over by the local authorities, it is impossible for the local authorities to impose a rate to effect that.  In any case where the Land Commission or the Minister for Unemployment under a Vote of this kind makes provision for carrying out these works, they should also provide, <Col N="1046" /> as suggested by Deputy Lynch, that the future maintenance of these roads should be undertaken by the local authority.  The Minister for Unemployment is in charge of one of the biggest Departments of State.  I believe I heard him, when in Opposition, refer to his present Department as the &ldquo;Board of No Works.&rdquo;  I am sure he will convince everybody that since he was put in charge of that Department it has really become a Board of Works.  That being so, I hope he will take off the red tape that surrounds many of the drainage schemes in the pigeon-holes of the Department, that he will come to the assistance of the local authorities who are prepared to make contributions to start these schemes and get on with the work.  There are yards of red tape wound round some of the schemes which have been lying there for three or four years.  Deputy O'Higgins referred to one scheme, and suggested that it should be carried out without further delay.  I believe that representations have been made already to the Minister for Unemployment in connection with that matter&mdash;presumably by other Deputies as well as Deputy O'Higgins.  I hope the Minister will review the particulars of that scheme and see if it cannot be set going without further unnecessary delay.  In that area unemployment has been created for reasons which the Minister is well aware of.  He accompanied the Minister for Defence into that part of my constituency before the last general election.  He announced that Wolfhill coal mine would be opened up if Fianna Fáil were returned to power.  I hope now that that promise will be carried out.  I can assure the Minister that he will get the support of the seven Labour Deputies in encouraging and, if necessary, coercing those responsible to do as suggested.</P>
    <P>I thought it desirable to intervene in this debate, because I think the amount provided for in this Vote has been put before the House in a thoughtless way, without consideration of any kind as to the extent to which unemployment exists in the country, without regard to the number of waterworks schemes <Col N="1047" /> lying in the Department of Local Government and without regard to the other schemes in the Land Commission and Board of Works which could be carried out without delay if reasonably generous assistance were forthcoming from the Government.  How many schemes are there lying in the pigeon holes of the Department of Local Government for the provision of provincial waterworks which cannot be carried out unless reasonable financial assistance is available?</P>

      <P>I understand that there were a few grants made to Donegal, and I hope we will hear Deputy White eloquently supporting the demands which this Party are putting forward. Speaking with the limited knowledge of such schemes as I have, I do know that there are many such schemes at present in the Department of Local Government and Public Health, and I do know that many of these schemes should be carried out in the interests of the public health of the country.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary call for a return of the number of schemes of waterworks and sewerage schemes for which plans have been already prepared and for which the local authorities have paid their engineers?  Will the Parliamentary Secretary call for an estimate of the carrying out of these schemes and state the extent to which he is prepared to help in the carrying out of these schemes?  I do not believe that the ratepayers of a dispensary district should be expected to find the money for the cost of carrying out these schemes.  I think that the local rate for these schemes should not exceed, at the furthest, 6d. in the £. There are many good schemes which, if carried out at the cost of the local rates, would amount to 2/-, or perhaps 3/- in the £ on the rates, and under present circumstances I am not prepared to see the ratepayers of the locality called upon to find such huge sums.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary for Unemployment to call for certain returns from the Department of <Col N="1048" /> Local Government and Public Health and the Department of Fisheries, and I am certain that the Departments will furnish him with the returns I have indicated, and having those returns, he will very soon come to this House and ask us to provide money for the carrying out of these necessary relief schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the first return that the Parliamentary Secretary will call for will be the grant that Deputy Davin secured for the carrying out of the Rathdown waterworks.  The Deputy wangled £12,000 from the late Government for the carrying out of that scheme.  There is only £150,000 in this Vote, and the part of it that can come to any one county will, in relation to the various schemes, be much the same as dropping a needle into Lough Swilly.  After the smiling exchanges that I saw between the Minister for Unemployment and the Cumann na nGaedhael Deputies for Cork, I am of opinion that there will be very little consideration given to Donegal under this Vote.  In this I am going to take a broad national view of this question, and I am going to suggest to the Minister, and I will be as brief as possible in bringing it under his notice, that portion of any money that is allocated to the Land Commission should be earmarked for schemes of afforestation.  I am not going to go over the same drainage, reclamation, sewerage and waterworks schemes that other Deputies have brought before the House.  I have a great amount of sympathy for the Minister.  I join with Deputy O'Hanlon in offering him my sympathy, because I believe he is faced with the problem of putting a quart into a pint jug.  I would specially ask the Minister to earmark some of the money that has been allocated to the Land Commission for the proposal I have made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSheridan" hpid="Mr. Sheridan Mr. Sheridan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheridan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad of the announcement that it is the local bodies who are to operate this grant and not the Land Commission.  I say that because, being representative men and in touch with local conditions and having their officials on the <Col N="1049" /> ground, I think they are the proper bodies to operate it.  I, too, like the Deputy from Donegal, am going to take the broader national view of this matter.  I think that instead of putting forth constituency grievances my idea has always been that whatever is best for the largest number of the community must be best for the whole. Unlike some of the Deputies who have spoken and have advocated the making of cul-de-sac roads and by-roads, I would be more in favour, at this season of the year, of going on with drainage works.</P>
      <P>In the County Cavan there are either one or two bodies known as drainage trustees.  And in one particular area anyway there is a body called The Lough Oughter Gowna and River Erne Drainage Board.  I think that is their designation.  I do not know how these trustees came to be appointed.  I have only a vague idea of the Act under which they operate.  I think it is a very antiquated one.  One thing I do know anyway and that is that these trustees meet once or twice a year or perhaps it might be four times a year.  They strike a levy on a particular area.  Last year that levy was £700.  This year it is £1,300 I think.  The unfortunate people in that area who have to pay that money in annuities or drainage rates find after the money has been paid that the work which these drainage trustees are supposed to see carried out is practically nil, or at least very little of that work has been done. I would like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to this matter.  I do not know whether it is a matter over which he has control or not, but I do know in any case, and I say it with a full realisation of the consequences that these drainage trustees and their officials are the greatest set of rascals with which any country could be burdened.  I do not think that I can add any more.  I know the kind of body they are.  I have nothing more to say except to add that at this season of the year the carrying out of drainage work is far preferable to the making of roads.  These can very well wait for the winter months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a very pleasant <Col N="1050" /> surprise for me when I entered the House to see the Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Government Benches.  I had very strong reasons for congratulating myself because I have come up from Cork where they are preparing an elaborate list of relief schemes in that particular county.  I emphasise that particular county because not one penny of the last relief grant was allocated to the County Cork.  Therefore I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary's Department will consider very favourably our claim at present, particularly as the area that I have the honour to represent has a very considerable number of schemes awaiting.  I refer particularly to Cobh, Fermoy, Buttevant and Charleville.  I know there are other Deputies who will put forward claims for these areas. As the Parliamentary Secretary is well aware there are some of the finest roads in the country passing through tourist areas and these could be very materially improved.  At the same time the intentions of the grant would be carried out and thus a double purpose will be served.  I am rather disappointed to find that the grant has been reduced instead of being increased. In view of the position of unemployment, one would have imagined that a very much larger sum would have been added to the grant instead of having a big reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no better way of assisting unemployment than by roadmaking, and if you can serve the purpose of improving roads for traffic, particularly where unemployment is most rife, you will be spending the money to the very best advantage.  Money can be spent usefully in another form.  I have in mind arterial and minor drainage schemes.  More work could be given on minor schemes than on large arterial drainage schemes.  Such schemes would be serving a purpose which unquestionably must enlist the sympathy of the majority of Deputies. As most people are aware, in the days when the landlords had control they were able to carry on improvment works of this nature on their estates and farmers had no responsibility. Now the farmers are in possession of the land; they are in an independent <Col N="1051" /> position; there is no cohesion and they cannot carry out these necessary works without Government control.  A very useful purpose would be served by relieving unemployment and at the same time bringing back to its original productivity land which is naturally good but which, at the moment, is unproductive because it is overloaded with water and undrained.  By draining such land you will make it a big national asset which will practically repay all that has been expended on its drainage by reason of its productive qualities.  It will certainly add to the country's wealth.</P>
    <P>I feel those two works are the most important that could come under the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary. I have in another fashion drawn his attention to a very fine work in my area, for which we received a considerable grant from the last Government. They gave us 50 per cent. of the expenditure, the local authority contributed 25 per cent. and the remaining 25 per cent. fell on the farmers.  There is a minor scheme prepared for a district in the vicinity where two villages were flooded, together with a considerable area of land.  I will ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider carefully the scheme which has been forwarded to the Department and I would like him to give a substantial grant towards that scheme.  There are large numbers of schemes prepared all over the country and the survey of them would indicate the enormous wealth which would accrue to the country, the increase in the value of property and general productivity if the schemes were carried into effect, with Government assistance.  Such schemes would go a long way towards relieving unemployment. Nothing will be gained by allowing our people to be unemployed. We have to relieve them from the rates.  I believe a grant from this fund will relieve the rates and at the same time carry out a huge national work which will eventually add to the wealth of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinConlon" hpid="Mr. Conlon Mr. Conlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it gives the Parliamentary Secretary much satisfaction to have received so <Col N="1052" /> much sympathy from all sides of the House.  He certainly deserves the sympathy of the House when he has to distribute this comparatively small sum of money.  When the debate will be reported in to-morrow's papers hopes undoubtedly will be raised throughout the country.  Unfortunately it is quite evident very little can be done to satisfy those hopes.  During the next few days every Deputy will receive dozens of letters, and I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that most of those letters will have reference to the repairing of old roads. The most useful purpose to which the money could be devoted, the purpose which would please people most, is the repairing of old roads, particularly cul-de-sacs such as were mentioned by Deputy Kissane and roads leading to bogs.  I would like to emphasise the desirability of applying as much of this money as is possible to the repairing of those old roads.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is very much use in talking about arterial drainage. There are different methods by which arterial drainage could be carried out, if it were at all economic.  Under the Minor Drainage Schemes Act 25 per cent. of the cost is provided by the Government in the case of any scheme that will be carried out by local authorities.  On the other hand, as much as 50 per cent. is given by the Board of Works in the case of larger schemes.  Notwithstanding that, in a great many cases occupiers of the affected land, when they are asked to vote for or against these schemes, although they are promised in some cases 76 per cent. of the cost by way of free grant, very often vote against them.  In such circumstances it is very difficult to have arterial drainage carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are numerous small drains running between townlands, and if some of this money could be applied to them it would be decidedly useful, because the work could be carried out under the inspection of a Land Commission inspector, and thereby the cost of carrying out a detailed scheme, which ordinarily is very high, would not have to be reckoned with.  At this time of the year one of the most useful <Col N="1053" /> works that could be carried out is the drainage of the smaller drains.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has asked us to take the broad view and, in the circumstances, I am not going to mention any particular schemes. There is no necessity, in any case.  I have personal knowledge of hundreds of schemes tabulated, typed and numbered and they are all lying, as Deputy Davin says, in the pigeon holes of the Land Commission office.  Some of the areas with which those schemes are concerned have been inspected and approved; the inspectors have reported that it would be very useful if those works were carried out.  I am not going to refer to those matters in any detail.  All I will say is that if I got half the amount proposed in this Vote it could be usefully applied in the County Roscommon in carrying out urgent necessary works on old roads. I sympathise with the Parliamentary Secretary in the task he has facing him.  I will emphasise, in conclusion, that the most important works in rural areas are the repairing of old roads and the clearing up of the smaller drains.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Deputies who have spoken on this Vote, one would imagine that we were dealing, not with a sum of £100,000, but with a sum of at least £100,000,000.  If all the schemes which have been suggested, or even one-millionth part of them, were to be given effect to, we would want at least the sum that I have mentioned.  We have had references to trunk roads, county roads, cul-de-sacs and bog roads.  All have to be put into proper condition with this £100,000.  We have had references also to drainage schemes.  We are to have enormous schemes of drainage, both arterial and minor.  Then we are to have elaborate sewerage schemes. It must be remembered that sewerage schemes are very expensive.  We are also to have waterworks schemes. Necessary waterworks and sewerage schemes in the constituency I have the honour to represent would take up much more than the £100,000.  As it is, there are more than enough calls on that money.  We are told it could <Col N="1054" /> be utilised for the clearing of sites for houses.  I was expecting some Deputy to say that the grant would solve the housing problem in the Saorstát. Afforestation has also been mentioned. I wonder what becomes of the revenue of the country if this £100,000 will do so much.</P>
      <P>There are just a few points that I would like to refer to.  It has been stressed that there is no unemployment in the country as compared with the towns and cities I am well aware of the amount of unemployment existing in the towns and cities, but I would like to remind one of the speakers, who made the point, that there is not so much hunger and unemployment in the city that anybody would be allowed to go to bed hungry, and that in the very constituency which I represent an unfortunate family died from hunger within the memory of us all.  I only mention the matter to show that such conditions are rampant in the country as well as in the towns.  With regard to the disposal of this money, the Parliamentary Secretary would be well advised to hand over that amount&mdash;it is not so large&mdash;to the people who have the machine ready at hand to do useful work and provide the most employment. I refer to the local authorities. They know where unemployment is most rampant in their own particular areas.  They are impartial judges, and in my opinion would be the right people to carry out work that would give the best return?</P>

      <P>I wondered, when listening to Deputy Davin, what transformation has come over the Labour Party in this House.  I remember, when, on former occasions in this House, those who now sit on the Opposition Benches introduced a Vote of more than double the amount now introduced by the Ministers.  That Vote was absolutely derisively received at the time by those who now sit on the Labour Benches to represent the working people of this country.  Deputy Davin, in the course of his speech, stated that he hoped the Minister would listen to a very reasonable demand. I never thought, from my own experience of the Labour Party in the old Dáil, that we would ever hear such views expounded on behalf of Labour in this House as the views Deputy Davin has expressed.  I can only compare the Labour Party to a party of tame mice since they fell in behind the new Government to carry out any and every scheme, no matter how inadequate, or how insufficient, to deal with the problem for which this money has been introduced.  Labour is behind the new Government, and what justification have they for being behind it on a vote for £150,000 to deal with the problem of unemployment.</P>

Yet, Deputy Davin gives the Department a new name.  Formerly, he said, when the Parliamentary Secretary was on the Opposition side, that it was the &ldquo;Department of No Work,&rdquo; but now he refers to it as the Board of Works.</P>

I cannot understand what has happened to the Labour Party in this House.  I have no doubt whatever that the Parliamentary Secretary will be quite delighted with the very reasonable demands that Labour has put forward because they have not put forward demands which the serious nature of the problem would justify.  Deputy Davin says his demands are reasonable.  I quite agree.  But what did he say when £250,000 was introduced?  Did he say it was reasonable?

      <P>I suppose that I am just as much entitled to say I am a Labour Deputy as any of the Labour Deputies on these benches, for I have the interests of the labourers as much at heart as any of them.  I am grievously disappointed with the attitude taken up by the Labour Party in this House, if the attitude of the Labour Party is expressed in the views just announced by Deputy Davin.  We are told that local bodies are going to operate this grant.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to say if that is true, because I had occasion last week, in the interests of an unemployed man who has been idle for the last eighteen months and whose family has been living on poor relief, to approach the Dublin Corporation to see if work could be obtained for this idle man.</P>
      <P>I was informed by the officials of the Dublin Corporation that they were no longer carrying out any relief scheme work, and that the relief scheme work was being administered by the labour exchange.  What I want to know about this munificent tribute to the Fianna Fáil Party for this £100,000 is, what portion of it is to be earmarked for the City of Dublin. We have been told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that at present in Dublin City there are something like 35,000 men unemployed. We all know the contribution of Dublin City, under the Dublin Poor Law Relief Act, is steadily going up. It was over £4,000 a week and it has now risen to the £5,000 per week mark, yet Deputy Davin and the Labour Party think this vote is their vindication. How do they justify the position they took up when they derided the idea when this Party introduced a vote for £200,000 when they were in office?  I want to see some consistency on the part of the Labour Party towards the labour problem that they are facing up to.  I say there is no consistency in an attitude of that kind. I cannot see how Deputy Davin can face his constituency in Leix and Offaly if he has been returned by the labour workers, as he says, seeing the attitude that he takes up in this House.</P>

We have the principle accepted by the new Government which was never accepted by the old Government&mdash;either work or maintenance for the unemployed. I, for one, although not a labour representative, will do everything that in me lies to see that principle put in force, but it is a mere travesty to introduce a Vote for £100,000, which gets the benediction of the Labour Benches, to deal with these problems.  Dublin City is the storm centre of unemployment, and nobody knows that better than I do.  Deputy Cooney, who represents another division of Dublin City, is content with the introduction of a vote for this sum of £100,000, but he has not told us what that is going to do for the 35,000 workless people in Dublin City.  What is it going to do towards reducing the distribution of £250,000 per annum in poor relief?  This is the policy of the Party that was going to create a new heaven and a new earth, and it is supported in this House day after day, and week after week, by the submissive Labour Party which we are told stands up for the rights of their constituents.</P>

      <P>I would remind the House that at the present time things are at a standstill in Dublin.  On a former occasion I referred to the fact that a feeling of insecurity was created by the advent of the new Government <Col N="1059" /> to office.  It is admitted that it has had the effect of increasing the problem of unemployment in Dublin city.  The building trade, for instance, is at a standstill at the present moment in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not afraid to repeat what I said when I was sitting on that side of the House, and I stand over it. I say that the problem of unemployment is increasing since the advent of the new Government.  Uneasiness has increased in commercial circles and in trade circles, and if Deputy Cooney is an honest man he knows that.  He knows that so far as solving the problem of unemployment is concerned, the solution of that problem is now more remote than when the Government of this country was in the hands of those who are now sitting on this side of the House.  We are told that a sum of £2,000,000 is to be introduced in another Estimate, but on examination the amount to be found for unemployment in that Estimate is of almost negligible proportions.  We are told we did nothing to deal with the unemployment problem, but the fact is that more houses were built when our Party were in office than would be built if the present Government were in office for double that length of time.  When we were having houses built to the extent of £11,000,000 we did not boast that we <Col N="1060" /> were solving the unemployment problem. When the Shannon scheme was undertaken, and gave work to thousands we did not say that we had solved the unemployment problem. We brought in a relief scheme for £250,000, but we did not say we were solving the unemployment problem. Why the Party opposite, when it brings in a Vote of this kind, should receive the benediction of Deputies on the Labour Benches passes my comprehension. Let them turn to their speeches on former occasions in the records of the Parliamentary Debates and compare them with the speeches they have made to-day, and let them try to give a reasonable explanation of their attitude to those they represent in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well to talk in this mild fashion, but if Deputy Morrissey's motion is accepted in theory let us have it accepted in fact also.  If the new Government have undertaken the principle of work or maintenance for the people it is time that we had an instalment of that put into operation. Will the leader of the Labour Party suggest that this vote for £100,000 is a reasonable instalment of the promise made to Deputy Morrissey?  Will he contend that the proposal of the Parliamentary Secretary is dealing honestly with the problem of unemployment? The Parliamentary Secretary has been called by Deputy Davin the Minister for Unemployment.  Probably that is his title.  He is the Minister for Unemployment in essence and in fact, but certainly he is Minister for Unemployment if this paltry scheme of £100,000 is to represent all the things that we are told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and by the Minister for Finance, that Deputy Hugo Flinn had up his sleeve to deal with the workless people of this country. I want to know what value is this £100,000 when it is asserted by the Government that there are 80,000 unemployed in the country.  I am told that the great tariff policy of the Government is going to prove the true and correct solution of the unemployment problem.  I agree with the leader of the Labour Party who stated in this House that if the Government rely <Col N="1061" /> upon tariffs for the solution of the unemployment problem, they would be very speedily disillusioned.  At least, the leader of the Labour Party has some practical knowledge of what he is speaking about.  What practical knowledge have these men who occupy the Front Bench of the new Government Party?  They know that there are so many men idle and they are relying on a policy of cast-iron tariffs that has been demonstrated in this House, on more than one occasion, to be more productive of national injury than national good.  Then, they come in calmly with a vote of £100,000 as a splendid thing that should satisfy the needs of the hungry and the workless in the country to-day.  I want to know, and I ask it honestly, if this money is going to be operated by local bodies?  If it is to be operated by local bodies, I want to know whether the information I was given the other day was incorrect, and, if so, will steps be taken to see that the Corporation will be again put in charge of the expenditure of whatever sum of money may be earmarked for Dublin City. Because one thing I can say is, that, under the present management of the Dublin Corporation, every pound that is spent for the relief of the unemployed is spent to the best possible advantage.</P>
    <P>So far as schemes are concerned, I would not think it worth my while to waste half a moment suggesting any scheme to the Parliamentary Secretary under a Vote of this kind.  I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary what justification there is for a Vote of such dimensions?  Is it not a fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he sat on these Opposition Benches, and when a Vote of £250,000 was introduced by the late Government, said that that sum could be expended in Dublin City alone and that it would not be sufficient to deal with the problem of unemployment in Dublin?  The Labour Party meekly submits to a Vote of £100,000, and all I have to say is that that attitude must be justified in the country.  Since the Labour Party came into this House, and followed submissively the dictates of the new Government, they have, I <Col N="1062" /> believe, sold the interests of democracy in that action.  If this problem is to be attacked in a reasonable way, is it not time that something was done in furtherance of the promises given in respect of the motion that Deputy Morrissey introduced?  If it is true, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce said, that £250,000 was insufficient to deal with the problem in Dublin City alone, what justification can the Parliamentary Secretary give for coming into this Assembly and asking it, in the existing conditions, to accept a Vote of £100,000?  I may be told that the unemployed are going to wait for all these new factories.  Anybody who looks at the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; can see nearly two new factories in each of the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>

      <P>Yes, two a day; but I cannot see any new factories in Dublin. I can see, however, the threatened unemployment of 300 employees in Messrs.  Gallaher's tobacco factory in Dublin City, and I can also see the closing down of one firm in Abbey Street with 24 hands completely disemployed, and I can see from 300 to 500 commercial travellers, who never came for any dole or relief Vote, being thrown out of their occupations by the policy of the new Government.  We are asked to accept this Vote as the first reasonable instalment of a sum sufficient to deal with the unemployment problem in this country.  What is to become of these 300 commercial travellers, men who have always brought up their families in decency and comfort and educated them well, and who never came to the State for any help in carrying out that work? It is all very well for the Parliamentary Secretary to smile, but 300 is the figure I mentioned and I adhere to it&mdash; 300 employees thrown out of employment in a business in which £250,000 of capital is invested.  We are all waiting to see what action Labour will take when it comes to the passage of this Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>All I have to say is that when we introduced a vote of £250,000 on a former occasion to deal with the problem of unemployment when it was not nearly so acute as it is at the present day, we had the Labour Party going into the Division Lobby against us.  We want to know what they are going to do this evening on this Vote for £100,000.  Are we going to wait until these mythical factories come into actual operation and absorb the unemployed? Speaking as far as Dublin City is concerned, I see no hope for the unemployed if we are to wait for the operation of these mythical factories. We are told that the 300 hands disemployed from Messrs.  Gallaher's factory will be absorbed elsewhere, but I want to tell the Parliamentary Secretary that they do not want to be absorbed elsewhere.  They want to be allowed to remain at their own work and to stay there, and if the Government have the interests of the unemployed at heart, as they have protested they have, again and again, through the country, such action should be taken as would leave these employees in their employment and not have this sum of £250,000, which has been sunk in a great enterprise, destroyed.  It is all very well to talk about bog roads and drainage and all this sort of nonsense.  What will £100,000 do for schemes of that kind? What are the unemployed people, who have been living on poor relief in Dublin for twelve or fifteen months past, to do, if, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce has suggested, this problem is to be put on the long finger?  Is the Labour Party going to stand still while this problem is put on the long finger?  What we ask the Labour Party to do is to do their duty to the workless people of this <Col N="1064" /> country to-day.  We ask them not to stand for the passage through the House of a Vote of £100,000 that can only be an insult to the wants of the unemployed under existing conditions. I do not know whether there will be a division on this or not, but we shall wait with expectancy to see what action Labour is going to take&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was tempted to intervene in this debate by the speech made by Deputy Byrne, whom I congratulate on his new-found freedom on the Opposition benches.  For many years, while Deputy Byrne occupied these other benches, he sat there like the other muzzled and well-disciplined Deputies of the Cumann na nGaedhael Party, and, during all those years, he <Col N="1065" /> could find no expression of sympathy for the needs of the unemployed.  He sat on these benches and said &ldquo;Hear, hear,&rdquo; to everything done by the late Government, which meant, so far as the unemployed were concerned, saying &ldquo;Hear, hear,&rdquo; to nothing.  In a by-election last year, I happened to be speaking in a certain town with Deputy Byrne, and, it being a cross-road audience, Deputy Byrne gave them very little credit for any intelligence. In the course of a long oration, something similar to what he is accustomed to deliver in this House, he told the assembled people, many of whom were living examples of the inaccuracy of his own statements, that the problem of unemployment under the Cumann na nGaedheal Party had now diminished to such small proportions that it was really not a vital problem.</P>
      <P>He took excursions to New Zealand, to Australia, to Canada, and to other places throughout the world in order to show that the unemployed in this country were not really as hungry as they were elsewhere.  All this was done, of course, just to put a face on the record of the late Government in respect to unemployment.  The Deputy comes along to-night and tells us that the late Government made a grant of £250,000 for the relief of unemployment, but he forgot to tell the House that that grant of a quarter of a million for the relief of unemployment was made on the eve of a general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It was not the first £250,000 nor the first election dodge either.  Although Deputy Byrne imagines that he is the successor of Adam Smith, he is rapidly acquiring the reputation of being an economic jester.  In this House last night when talking of the mentality of low wages&mdash; advocating by inference, if not openly, a low wage policy&mdash;Deputy Byrne, in his usual learned fashion, told the House that high wages had not saved <Col N="1066" /> America from economic depression. Deputy Byrne's memories, however, do not extend very far.  He forgot to tell the House that America can produce in five months all that the American people require; that the productivity of the other seven months must be exported; and he forgot to tell that the low wage policy which he advocated last night&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

      <P>Deputy Byrne forgot to say that it was the low wages in other countries, and the impoverished condition of other countries, that made it impossible for America to secure consumption of the seven months' productivity which, being kept at home, was causing, in a large measure, unemployment and the economic crisis which exists in America.  The Deputy went on to give us another gem this evening, when he told us that if the Labour Party was standing for democracy they would vote against this proposal. What democracy has to do with the proposal in the sense that Deputy Byrne used the word &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; I do not know.  Deputy Byrne is a good judge of democracy, because, not so many months ago, the Government of which he was then a member steamrolled through this House, by a machine majority, a Constitutional Amendment Act which abrogated all democracy&mdash;abrogated every constitutional guarantee the people had.  Then, when he is freed from the responsibility of office, and freed from the Whip of the Party, he goes to other benches to advocate democracy.  One would have thought that his memory would not have deserted him so quickly.  Indeed, <Col N="1067" /> if Deputy Byrne had spoken correctly on the attitude of the Labour Party in connection with this Vote, he could not have made any speech at all, because he deliberately misrepresented the attitude of the Labour Party, and gave the impression that we regard this as an adequate contribution to the problem with which we are faced, and which was largely caused by the incompetence of Deputy Byrne's Government.  His whole speech was built up on misrepresentation of Deputy Davin's speech, suitable, of course, for consumption tomorrow morning in North Dublin.  It was quite inaccurate, in so far as it purported to quote Deputy Davin's speech.  Deputy Byrne told the House that he wondered why intelligent people voted for the Labour Party.  If making noise, a long speech, or using the gestures of the jester are any indication of intelligence, then Deputy Byrne is a mountain of intelligence, perhaps more than any one else in this House.</P>
      <P>So far as the Labour Party are concerned, they make no apology to Deputy Byrne, or to anyone else in this House, for their action in this or in any other matter.  They will decide to do whatever they wish in the fullness of their own mind.  Neither the temporary bouquets of Cumann na nGaedheal nor the rosy promises of Fianna Fáil will induce the Labour Party to do anything other than what they believe to be the correct thing. Having said that, I would like to deal more directly with the relief scheme set out in this Vote.  Some two years ago the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, who was then Deputy Lemass, went to the West of Ireland and there delivered a speech in which he stated that the outlook of the Labour Party was bounded by relief schemes and relief grants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, political mendicants. We have to-day a relief scheme introduced by the Government of which the then Deputy Lemass is a prominent member.  In any case, I hope that the Minister for Industry <Col N="1068" /> and Commerce will acknowledge that, when he made that speech, he made a speech designed primarily to misrepresent the attitude of the Labour Party.  Personally, I am glad that he has been compelled to acknowledge to-day that just as we advocated relief schemes, in order to relieve the immediate needs of the unemployed, so also has the Minister for Industry and Commerce been compelled to do so in the same circumstances in which we advocated these relief schemes. But if this £150,000 is intended to be anything like an adequate contribution for the public health works, the minor road works, and the arterial drainage schemes referred to by the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement then this is a hopelessly inadequate contribution.  It will really make no impression on public health works, to say nothing whatever about minor road works, or arterial drainage schemes.  There are large towns in this State where there is practically no modern sanitation, to say nothing of any other kind of public health schemes.  This contribution of £150,000, which is acknowledged to be a contribution towards works of that kind, and which is described in the Vote as &ldquo;relief of unemployment and distress&rdquo; is an utterly inadequate contribution.  It will not touch the fringe of the unemployment problem, and will not deal in anything like a comprehensive way with the necessity which exists to-day for dealing with unemployment as a problem of urgency, a problem that requires the organisation of the powers and resources of the State in an endeavour to find a solution of it.  Personally, I would prefer if the £150,000 was regarded as interest and principal charges on a very substantial loan, because to scatter £150,000 amongst twenty-six counties will simply make no impression whatever in the relief of unemployment and distress, or on the public health, minor road works and arterial drainage schemes which were referred to by the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say definitely that so far as the Labour Party is concerned, it regards <Col N="1069" /> this provision as inadequate. We believe that something more substantial could be done and should have been done, even making generous allowance for the fact that money will be provided under other heads for the relief of unemployment in other ways. I hope this is not to be taken as an indication that unemployment and distress are going to be dealt with in the same manner by this Government as they were dealt with by the late Government. We want to see unemployment tackled as a matter of national emergency.  Just as the nation would organise all its resources to deal with an armed invasion or to deal with civil commotion on a large scale, so should all the resources of the nation be organised to grapple with unemployment, not on the basis of small relief schemes of this kind but on the basis of the principle enshrined in the resolution passed in this House recently, on the basis of guaranteeing to each citizen work, or failing work, adequate maintenance. Nobody who has a sense of Christianity left in him could possibly suggest that our unemployed people should be allowed to starve.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gorey, although his Party voted for the provision of work and maintenance, now jokes gleefully at the idea of work and maintenance being provided.  It just shows perhaps the element of humbug that enters into political life when a Deputy can accept a motion and plead for time to discuss a motion, and then laugh and jibe at the sentiments enshrined in the motion.  The main purpose of my intervention was to deal with some of the inaccuracies of Deputy Byrne and to express definitely the view of the Labour Party in the most formal and official way that we regard this grant as wholly inadequate.  I want to express the hope that unemployment and distress are not going to be dealt with by this Government in the same piecemeal, haphazard fashion in which the last Government dealt with it.  We want unemployment tackled as the biggest problem confronting the nation to-day.  I am prepared to give the <Col N="1070" /> Government time, and to help them to deal with that problem, although I believe that in some respects they are not working along the right lines.  Still they are making an effort to face up to the problem.  I hope that in reply we shall be assured that this is not anything like the end of the Government's resources to deal with the problem of unemployment.  I hope we will have a promise from whatever Minister replies on behalf of the Government that so far as unemployment is concerned they will continue to come to this House for more and more money if it is necessary to provide a decent standard of maintenance in lieu of work for the unemployed people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire very briefly to deal with two aspects of the discussion.  One of them is that I understood various Deputies suggested to the Parliamentary Secretary that when roads are being made under a grant, a condition should be imposed on local authorities that these roads should be maintained by the local authorities when made.  I am afraid that these Deputies overlooked one fact, and that the Parliamentary Secretary also overlooked it when he was evidently giving his assent to their proposition that local authorities should maintain these roads, cul-de-sac roads and bog roads, when made. I would like to remind the Parliamentary Secretary that it might be dangerous to impose this condition, and that it might hold up the expenditure of this grant if he adopted that attitude, because until the law is changed, local authorities cannot put on the county a rate for repair of any road that does not connect two main roads.  I should be very sorry if in their eagerness to impose this condition on the issue of the grant Deputies overlooked that fact.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will keep that in mind and that he will not impose that condition in making grants to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter to which I should wish to call the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary is this.  An appeal has been made by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and Deputy O'Hanlon on behalf of the rural areas as against <Col N="1071" /> the cities and urban areas in the allocation of the grant.  I wish to support that appeal and I do so for this reason: Deputy Davin quoted a speech, apparently made by Deputy Briscoe at a meeting of the Corporation or at some other place, that a sum of £40,000 under this Vote was being earmarked for the City of Dublin for the relief of unemployment.  I do not want to be taken as in any way opposing the granting of any sum that can be made available for the City of Dublin.  When this Vote was originally introduced, I forget by whom, on behalf of the Government, he stated that it would be used for the clearing of sites in the city.  Perhaps Deputy Briscoe was speaking from his brief when he said that a sum of £40,000 was going to the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary, if that is the policy that has been decided upon, to reverse it somewhat for this reason.  I think it is generally understood that at the end of about three years the Hospital Trust, as a result of the Sweepstakes, will have realised the substantial sum of money that the hospitals require. Immediately thereafter the proceeds of the sweeps, if they are continued, will be devoted to the purposes of housing.  If that be so, and I think it is very probable that it will be so, a substantial amount of the money will go to the City of Dublin.  For that reason I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to put aside for a moment the question of clearing sites in the City of Dublin.  Let it remain in abeyance until the question of housing can be adequately and efficiently dealt with under the money which the country will receive from the Hospital Sweeps.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to divert the largest amount possible to rural areas.  I support the pleas put forward from every side of the House for the improvement of roads that are not main or trunk roads in various parts of the country&mdash;they will be nameless for the moment&mdash;roads running along the beautiful valleys in counties which we all can name, and also for the making of bog roads and the improvement <Col N="1072" /> of what have been called cul-de-sac roads.  These are the two matters to which I wished to refer&mdash; that the Parliamentary Secretary should not impose the condition of maintaining bog roads on local authorities, because the County Council can not, as the law stands, accept that condition, and if the Parliamentary Secretary attaches it to the grant it will only result in holding up work, and secondly, that the Parliamentary Secretary will go as far as he can to divert as much money as possible to rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The chief portion of the discussion, in my opinion, has been conducted under a misapprehension.  It is a question of the adequacy of this amount.  I am afraid this is only a prelude to the swelling theme of unemployment provision.  I wish it was not necessary that larger provision should have to be made, but it has to be made, and this is only the beginning of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, there is provision of £350,000 intended for other works which require further consideration. There is provision of £100,000 for meals for necessitous children.  There is provision of £250,000 in relief of rates on agricultural land.  There is provision of £100,000 for additional housing subsidies. There is provision of £550,000 for loans for public health works and there is £1,000,000 borrowed on the Road Fund, so that the £150,000 with which we are dealing to-day is merely what might be described as the beginning or opening of the emergency work. I need hardly say that I do agree with the House that, having regard to the actual conditions with which we are faced, the problem of attempting to distribute £100,000 or £150,000 to meet even immediate necessities is very difficult.  But that sum is not intended to be adequate.  It is to be used until we can get on to the proper and complete campaign.  Generally speaking, the discussion has run as if we were on the broad unemployment policy. Certain suggestions have been made.  A speech made by Deputy Fionan Lynch contained some very practical suggestions which we will take into <Col N="1073" /> account.  Every other suggestion made will be considered in relation to the main scheme to see if we can get even a better and more economic result than we have been looking for.  The object has been to distribute this money in a way in which it will nearest fulfil the requirements&mdash;in the first place, that it will give, as nearly as possible, an economic return, because this country cannot afford to waste any money on unemployment.  The person who, in my opinion, suffers most in this country from waste or extravagance of any kind whatever is the working class person and the unemployed person in the working class who is seeking for employment. It is for that reason that we are trying to make this £2,000,000 unemployment scheme as nearly economic as possible.  The second consideration is that the labour content of the work shall be high&mdash;that the largest possible amount of the total amount of money which is spent upon nearly economic work shall be money which will go directly in wages.  The third condition is that that money which is nearly economic and which has a high labour content shall be spent in the districts in which there is unemployment as nearly as possible in proportion as there is unemployment.  That is the basis of the whole of the work and that is what we are trying to do.</P>
    <P>In relation to that, we will welcome the co-operation of every man on every side of the House, who may have some little knowledge in respect of his own district, in bringing that to a head. One of the big difficulties is in making what I might call an unemployment map of the country.  That would seem, at first, to be a very easy thing to do. I asked that an unemployment map should be prepared, coloured, and otherwise marked from the figures available from the unemployment exchanges. When I saw that map, I noticed that there was one very remarkable thing about it.  There was no unemployment west of the Shannon. Taking the unemployment figures, the main indication on which we have been going, and mapping them out in relation to the country, we found that very remarkable fact&mdash;that there was <Col N="1074" /> no unemployment west of the Shannon. On investigation, it emerged that 75 per cent. of the people west of the Shannon, whether they were employed or unemployed, would never appear upon an unemployment map. They were small farmers themselves or were engaged as members of families on farms or with relatives on farms, and not more than 25 per cent. of them could possibly come on the unemployment register.  The second line we took was a line very commonly taken in debates here&mdash;the home assistance figures.  These are being analysed to see if, with the aid of the unemployment figures, they would enable us to get that map.  The difficulty in using the home assistance figures is that they are not an indication of unemployment <i>per se.</i>  They are practically an indication of unemployability.  Not more than 25 per cent. of the total number of people who come under the home assistance survey&mdash;I have the figures here and at any time I shall be very happy to show them to any member of the House and go into them with any member of the House who would be able to increase my knowledge by criticising them&mdash;are any indication whatever of the condition of unemployment.  But there is a big trend, if you take out the individual counties and graph them over a year. You can see some indication there, and I am not without hope that from those two figures we may be able to get something in the nature of a reliable map.  Even then, in my opinion, the result is not satisfactory and it is urgently necessary that someone should find some other means of giving us more accurate information than we now have of the distribution of unemployment, so that we will be able to place the relief which is available in the areas in which it is required. The second question raised, which struck me as being of a general character, was that certain moneys should be put aside now for the rainy day which is coming.  I do not know whether or not Deputies can see the graph in my hand.  That represents the seasonality of unemployment in the country in a year.  We are now practically at the lowest point of the ordinary <Col N="1075" /> seasonality of unemployment, and in any scheme which we have to work out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The seasonality is, in all probability, correct, though the figures representing the total are probably quite incorrect.  The suggestion is that this Vote of £150,000 is inadequate. It would be if it meant that this was the maximum of our effort.  But we have to get away somewhere in this period, and we have to regulate somehow the total amount which is going to be spent in relation, to some extent, to that graph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is upon lines of that kind that we are trying to work.  I will now show the House another graph which may interest Deputies.  It is a seasonality graph of Home Assistance, which Deputies will notice is slightly different.  There is undoubtedly a common characteristic of a rise in the Autumn and a rise for the Winter periods.  Due to the fact that there is a certain amount of employment at agriculture in the summer, and in part due to the fact that the pressure or bitterness of unemployment in the warm summer weather is probably not as bitterly felt as at other periods, this extra element of seasonality of unemployment makes it necessary that the money should be distributed to some extent according to records of that kind.  I put the proposition to the House that our desire is that the Deputies will give us their help in this matter of using the money which the taxpayers of this country are providing on the basis of an economical scheme&mdash;a scheme of high labour content, a <Col N="1076" /> scheme which will be administered in the unemployment areas, and to some extent according to the seasonality of unemployment.  There you have the basis of the scheme on which we are working.</P>
    <P>As to the suggestions in regard to the different schemes that are of value, I think turbary roads are of the highest value in this connection.  Small drainage schemes which include the drainage of turbary areas are very valuable schemes.  Cul-de-sac roads which do open up valuable transport lines which are now closed have much economic value.  These cul-de-sac roads are of value to minor drainage, that is to say, smaller drainage schemes even under the £1,000 limit.  There are numbers of such small schemes.  In this matter I am speaking as one subject to correction, and one who is anxious to learn.  There are a lot of small schemes for which a relatively small amount of money is being distributed, and these produce 100 per cent. labour content and at the same time they have very high economic content.  The idea would be that in determining the larger amount, consideration should be given to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Parliamentary Secretary, in relation to what he said about the co-operation of the members of the House, to what extent co-operation has been invited or had been given by the county councils?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that later. The co-operation of all the county councils has been invited.  I think it was Deputy Roddy who suggested, as one of the most desirable pieces of work, the work that was left uncompleted by the Land Commission.  His suggestion was that we should complete that work.  At any rate, that was very strongly stressed.  I will take it that there are schemes partly carried through by the Land Commission and that a small amount of extra expenditure would now leave them altogether more valuable than they are.  We will certainly take that into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious to use the Land Commission <Col N="1077" /> as much as possible, but, speaking quite frankly, my difficulty with the Land Commission is this: the capacity of the Land Commission to spend money upon that kind of work is apparently limited.  The Land Commission is carrying through two kinds of work: work of improvement on unvested estates and work on vested estates.  This has been very largely done by unemployment relief money.  The experience in the past was that the money which they were asked to spend upon unemployment relief schemes meant that they had to return to the Treasury practically the same amount of their own normal Vote which had been left unexpended.  The way I look at it, so far as these small improvement schemes are concerned, is: that in the Land Commission engineers we have the experienced people who were dealing with that work and who know it, and we would be very anxious to use the Land Commission for that work as far as we can do that without interfering with their ordinary work.  There have been a whole series of small schemes, bog roads, small drainage schemes and a certain amount of embankment work which for a period of years has been approved of by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Davin who asked if we had sent for these schemes that he said were prepared and held over in the other Departments.  We have these schemes and they will be used as far as possible as the basis of that work.  At the moment the difficulty is that the Land Commission has its own work to do and we do not want to clog the machine by throwing unnecessary work on it.  But we do require their co-operation and I have no doubt we will get it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Neill stressed very strongly the position of the small towns.  In the small towns unemployment under the present conditions is a very big problem.  Broadly speaking we are not spending any of the road money on what are called the main or the national roads for purposes of relief. What we do propose to do is: that wherever any of that is spent on national roads it will probably be <Col N="1078" /> spent on the concreting of the main roads and streets of the towns where you get probably the best results both from the labour content point of view and from the fact that you give work in a number of small towns that you could not otherwise provide.  From the public health and the psychological point of view that, in my opinion, is work of the highest possible value.</P>
    <P>The fact of the distribution of the Sweep money on buildings in Dublin has been taken into consideration.  The estimate of £3,000,000, which was the estimate of the sum that was going to be spent on hospital buildings in Dublin in the next few years, was, I think, a most extreme estimate.  What is happening there is that though there may be £3,000,000 of money for the hospitals, a great deal of that money will be used for the purpose of providing an income to maintain the much less costly buildings which they are going to build out of part of that money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary admit that it is very un-undesirable to concrete roads in towns especially where there is a likelihood of sewerage works and waterwork schemes being carried out there later on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is perfectly correct. Certain places which would in the ordinary course have been concreted have been held up from being concreted until these schemes are completed first. There are places now where these sewerage and waterwork schemes have been completed that we are about to have concreted and these were places that we could not concrete up to this.  There are other places that we want to concrete but cannot do so, because the sewerage and other schemes are to be carried out there this year.</P>

      <P>Has the Parliamentary Secretary taken into consideration that it would be practically impossible for horses to travel on these roads he proposes to have concreted in the country towns owing to the way in which the country cart horses are shod?  The horses would go sliding about on the concrete roads.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney is entirely wrong.  A concrete road is more safe than a tar-macadam road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>You can get such concrete that even Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney could get a horse to fall on it. The object will be to avoid that kind of road.  I think it was Deputy Hogan who remarked that there was no use in making fine tourist roads into tourist districts if the roads inside those districts were unfit for tourists or anybody else.  I think that is a suggestion which should be passed on to those concerned.  I will give merely one incident.  I was at Killarney and wanted to go to the Gap of Dunloe. Half way out I had to turn back; I could not suffer the agony any more. We have been providing velvet highways parallel to all the railways that lead into Dublin, but there is a certain amount of truth in the suggestion that when we come to the end of the velvet highway we have not even a softened approach to a very different kind of road.  That is one instance where a good economic content could be found with a good labour content for the purpose of improving certain roads.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flynn suggested a standard for what you might call the necessity value&mdash;the thing which would decide where you put unemployment money.  I should like some members of the House to think over it and see if they could get a better standard. To take merely the number of unemployed and relate it to the population does not seem to be a sufficient standard.  Deputy Flynn suggested that the unemployed factor in relation to the average valuation would be a proper standard.  I would like to consider that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Re-afforestation has been suggested. That again is one of the illusions I <Col N="1080" /> have shed.  Re-afforestation for the purposes of immediate relief of unemployment is practically negligible. The difficulty is that re-afforestation has to be part of a settled scheme over a period of years, with at least two or three years of preparation.  While, undoubtedly it is a good work of a somewhat permanent character, and while it would tend to relieve the residuum of unemployment which one would get even in a prosperous country over a period of years, it would be quite useless from the point of view of dealing with immediate and critical unemployment.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Mulcahy who asked about the £19,000 which is being allocated to the Board of Works.  That is being used generally over the country. It has been divided deliberately amongst skilled and unskilled workers. It includes such skilled work as the stone work on the Museum and the National Gallery.  It includes such completely unskilled work as preparing the approach road to the Royal Hibernian School.  It includes even the model school in the county which Deputy O'Neill would not violate the rules by mentioning.  There are various other activities of that kind.  It has all been calculated to give a high economic content and a high labour content.  It is all work which in the ordinary case would be done if the country had the money.</P>
    <P>As far as the £25,000 for mineral investigation is concerned, I am going to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to give at a later date more information upon that subject.  I do not think it is necessary to have too long a discussion on these matters.  All the suggestions which have been put forward by Deputies will be taken into account and will be utilised, if possible, for the purpose of assisting the scheme for the relief of unemployment which has been undertaken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary give us a rough approximation of how much of the £150,000 will go to cities, to country towns and to rural districts?  I think it would be very bad if hopes were raised too high.  It would be desirable <Col N="1081" /> if the people could have an idea of what will be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We have decided to work as far as possible through original sources so far as this unemployment grant is concerned.  There was an idea of dealing with it <i>ad hoc</i>, as a separate organisation, but when we came to analyse the actual sources of unemployment relief they mostly fell into categories already covered by existing organisations.  The intention is that all schemes relating to housing, roads, small drainage schemes, etc., shall be done through their respective departments up to the point at which the strain put on the existing organisations might seem to clog them.  To that extent an attempt will be made, not to duplicate, but to strengthen and help existing organisations.  All these different schemes will come together at the finance end.  The fact that it will have to be financed through the Finance Department will bring about the co-ordination.  I have here a quotation to the effect that hunger grows by what it feeds on.  If I am to judge by the amount of hunger for more money which has been produced by the existence of £150,000, I am inclined to think the appetite of the House for unemployment money will be much greater than even the most optimistic Minister for Finance in a Budget statement could possibly provide.</P>

The feeling is that the strain will be terrific on the ordinary officials in view of the numerous schemes that will be submitted, as distinct altogether from their ordinary duties.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to use his influence to see that county councils will not be overburdened with work.  Urban councils should be asked to co-operate to a greater extent than <Col N="1082" /> in the past.  The trouble has been that the county councils did too much while the urban councils did too little. If the urban councils co-operate it will relieve the strain on the county councils in the future.</P>

      <P>In the devolution of work to urban councils and smaller bodies in relation to drainage and other schemes we are anxious, if possible, to get down to the co-operation of smaller units.  In certain counties they have competent drainage engineers who were appointed for the purpose, and in other counties they have not.  In certain counties they have very efficient and expert people in connection with the local maintenance of roads and drainage areas.  To the extent to which we can possibly use those people for local drainage and other work, our ambition is to do so, which is, I think, what Mr. Minch wanted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the co-operation of the county councils is concerned, they have been asked to put forward, through their officials, schemes which they themselves have approved and can say are things of value in themselves and in relation to their own knowledge of the unemployment conditions in the particular areas with which they deal.  On these lines I think we can ask their co-operation. After all, people do know more about their own county and their own housing and their own necessities than anybody else can teach them, and we are very anxious to secure their advice and co-operation.  As far as local loans are concerned, I am going to leave that &mdash;as it may be a dark secret&mdash;to the Minister for Local Government, who will tell you about that when he comes to deal with local loans.  The desire, however, is to provide you with money at a cheaper rate than before and in such a way that you can use it better. Many local councils and authorities who are very anxious to do work, <Col N="1084" /> cannot do so due to the present borrowing position, or, on account of the increase in the rate in paying loans, are afraid to tackle such work.  We recognise that it is holding up their activities in the matter and the idea is to relieve them.</P>

    <P>I received a reply to the following effect: &ldquo;Three vacancies on the Official Reporting Staff have arisen during the last twelve months.  Applications for the filling of one of these places were invited some months ago but the competition did not result in any of the candidates then available <Col N="1085" /> being appointed.  It is proposed to fill the three vacancies on such scale of pay and conditions of service as are agreed upon between the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister for Finance. Official authority has already been given for approaching the Civil Service Commissioners with a request that they should proceed to fill the vacancies accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, sir, I would not raise this question on the Adjournment were it not for the fact that the reply of the Minister for Finance is both inaccurate and misleading.  In addition to that, it is rank discourtesy to suggest, as he did this morning, that he would not be present when this question would be raised on the Adjournment.  In view of recent events in this House, I consider it to be part of the fixed policy of this Ministry to treat with contempt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied, and bow to your ruling, sir.  I am always an obedient member.  I should like to remind the Minister that the salaries of members of the Editorial and Reporting staff were fixed by a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas as the result of an agreement with representatives of the Staff.  That agreement is embodied in a White Paper laid on the Table of this House and available to any member who wishes to consult its terms.  The scales of salaries were fixed for Reporters at £275 to £375, plus bonus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a number of occasions the reporting staff of the Oireachtas made representations to the effect that the pressure of work was endangering the health of their members.  But, in fact, no steps were taken to relieve that pressure.  I had personal experience, as a member of the Public Accounts Committee, when one of the reporters almost died in the room, and did actually die a few minutes after being taken ill in the Committee Room.  All that was due, in my opinion, to excessive work over a long period of hours during the time the <Col N="1086" /> Oireachtas was in session.  I should like that the Minister for Finance, if he has not already done so, would contrast the rates of pay, salaries or emoluments&mdash;call them what you like &mdash;of the Oireachtas reporting staff with those paid to staffs in other countries.</P>
    <P>Let me make a comparison with the British House of Commons.  What do we find there?  The official reporting staff of the British House of Commons numbers 12.  There is a special staff for the House of Lords.  The staff here numbers 12 for both Houses, and here I have to enter upon what I may term a highly technical matter.  It is the opinion of experts that the number of words spoken per minute in this Dáil ranges from 20 to 30 more than the number of words spoken in the British House of Commons or elsewhere. That is a matter which, perhaps, may not make a very strong appeal to those unconnected with note-taking, but it must make an appeal to anybody with any kind of human sympathy with the men who have undertaken this work since the institution of this House.  I have never known, after thirty years' contact with the business in all its branches, of more marvellously accurate reporting than that done by the Dáil reporters in the most extraordinary circumstances.  I think no Deputy in this House has had any complaint to make of the accuracy of the reports by the men reporting in this House.</P>
    <P>In the British House of Commons, the editor of debates gets an initial salary of £550, rising by certain sums, at stated intervals, to £600.  In this House, the corresponding official, namely, the editor of debates, begins at a salary of £400, rising to £500 by annual increments.  The assistant editor in Britain gets from £400 to £450, beginning at £400, rising to £450, as against the assistant editor here, who begins at £300, rising by annual increments to £400.  In Britain the reporters begin at £330, rising by annual increments to £400, whereas here they begin at £275, rising to their maximum of £375 by certain figures at stated periods.  It cannot <Col N="1087" /> be said, therefore, that the Oireachtas errs on the side of liberality in payment for those very worthy services rendered to the House.</P>
    <P>I concede that perhaps this question should not be asked of the Minister for Finance.  It is a question that might more properly be asked of the Ceann Comhairle, because I understand that the Speaker is in control, as head of the staff of the Oireachtas, of the reporting staff, ushers, or any other branch of the Service in this House.  Another point I should like to emphasise is this.  Four members, not three, as the Minister for Finance suggested in answer to my question&mdash; that was another of the inaccuracies &mdash;of the Oireachtas reporting staff have died within the last twelve months.  Strictly speaking, the period might be a week or so over twelve months, but let us take 370 days, and within that period four deaths took place, not three, as suggested by the Minister.  These men were certified as medically fit seven years ago by the chief Civil Service medical officer.  Is it not an extraordinary thing that 33? per cent, of the Oireachtas reporting staff, as I suggest, died as a result of overwork during the last 12 months? I do not want to stress that too much, but it is a point to which the Minister, at least, should have some regard.</P>
    <P>I come now to what is really the most important portion of the matter.  Since the demise of these men no steps were taken to fill the vacancies for a period, I think, of some nine months.  Then it was proposed by the Department of Finance to reduce the scale of salary for men by £25 per annum at either end.  The reporting staff, having seen the notice, pointed out that this was a breach of an agreement honourably entered into, and that it was an assumption on the part of the Department of Finance of certain rights that they were not entitled to, according to the White Paper, and the agreement reached, to which the Ceann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach and the Minister for Finance were parties&mdash;that they should decide these matters.  Eventually, this proposal <Col N="1088" /> from Finance was withdrawn, and an advertisement was issued, asking for reporters at the old rate. On that occasion, only half a dozen applications were made.  A few nights ago, we heard from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that we are supposed to have in this country a corps of journalistic geniuses, and yet, to satisfy the requirements of this House, only one man out of that lot was considered to be up to the standard required for the position. That was not such a great number of applicants for these jobs.  It cannot be, therefore, that they are a great attraction for men who have any kind of decent training in this country.  And the remaining vacancies have not yet been filled.</P>
    <P>But steps are in contemplation, I understand, to fill these vacancies by some other method, a method that has not been adopted hitherto in selecting men for the Reporting Staff.  I want to suggest to the Minister that if he had consulted with the Cathaoirleach and the Ceann Comhairle, and they, in turn, had consulted with the Reporting Staff of the Oireachtas, much trouble would be obviated.  That is a system I have advocated on more than one occasion in this House and outside it.  I have found that the best method of approach, wherever you have a dispute between two parties, is that representatives of these two parties should sit down at a round table and discuss these grievances.  It is the safest method, and it acts, if you like, as a safety valve, as I suggested here in discussing the Civil Service proposals, some couple of years ago.</P>
    <P>Now, in private employment, if an agreement is entered into between the two parties&mdash;on the one side a group of employers, and, on the other, a group of employees&mdash;it is usual&mdash;I do not say it occurs 100 per cent.&mdash;before that agreement is broken, or before any changes take place in that agreement, for the parties to come together and discuss matters, but, in this case, an attempt is made to recruit men at reduced rates of pay, and, possibly, to bring women on to the Reporting Staff of this Oireachtas at reduced <Col N="1089" /> rates.  I admit that there is no attempt to reduce the salaries of the present Reporting Staff, but I want to put it to the one representative of the Labour Party I see sitting on the Labour Benches: would the Labour Party stand by if in the case of an industrial dispute, or even in the absence of a dispute, an attempt were made to introduce into any given industry in this country, in which a trade union operates, an arrangement by which new entrants to the business, trade or occupation would be brought in at a lesser rate than that paid to those who are carrying on the business?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>That they believe that an agreement, honourably arrived at, should be maintained until at least there could be approach by way of discussion. I want to give the Minister time to reply, but I want to point out to the Minister, and to those concerned, that a very big principle is involved in this matter.  As I have pointed out, there is no attempt made to ask the present Staff to accept reductions, but there is an insidious attempt&mdash;and I want to warn the Labour Party about this&mdash;to bring in underpaid labour, and I want to suggest, too, that I do believe it will fail, because you cannot get women reporters to do the job now done by male reporters who have broken down under the strain.  I would ask the Minister to consider this matter, not that I want to suggest that any disturbance will take place on the staff, but I do suggest that a disgruntled or dissatisfied staff is not a good thing for this House, nor is a disgruntled staff good for any House. We have here a most capable body of men, some of whom have given up lucrative positions to come in here, and all I can say to some of the persons who aspire to come in here, is what I said before, when people approached <Col N="1090" /> me on the matter and asked me what I thought about the job&mdash;&ldquo;for God's sake, keep out of it&rdquo;&mdash;and they took my advice.  I want to be fair to the Minister, and to give him plenty of time to reply, but I want again to put it to the Labour Party, if they are not altogether pledged as the tail-end of the Fianna Fáil Party in this matter, that this is a matter to which they must give their very earnest consideration and which will not be allowed to rest here if I have any say in the matter.</P>

      <P>While I have no enthusiasm for this particular method of raising this matter, I want to point out that the Minister said to-day that there were at present three vacancies, which, I think, is correct, but he said that one post had been advertised and that nobody had been appointed.  My recollection is that, on the 15th December last, two Parliamentary Reporters on the Oireachtas staff were advertised for, and I think that as a result of that one person was appointed.  I have had an opportunity since of reading the Minister's answer in which he said: &ldquo;It is proposed to fill the three vacancies on such scale of pay and conditions of service as are agreed upon between the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;  If an agreement has been reached between the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister for Finance on the matter, I do not know what good purpose will be served by debating it, but perhaps the Minister would say for the information of the House what the conditions of service and scales of pay are.</P>

      <P>I regret, a Chinn Comhairle, to have to say that the speech we have just listened to from Deputy Anthony fully confirms me in my original opinion that this was not a matter which should have been raised in this way in the House.  I should like also to make clear that, whatever our proposals are in regard to the filling of existing and future vacancies on the reporting staff, they do not in any way affect the existing staff.  Their scales of pay and conditions of service will remain as heretofore, except in so far as they <Col N="1091" /> may have to be affected by the special sacrifice which the Government are asking civil servants as a whole to make, in view of the existing Budgetary position.  I should also like to make it clear that the alteration in the scales of pay does not arise out of any feeling of dissatisfaction with the way in which the reporting staff has served the Oireachtas.  I am sure that no matter how high the tribute that might be paid to that staff from any side of this House, it would not be too high for me to concur in it. I know that in great stress and in great difficulty, the existing staff has served the Oireachtas excellently well.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disguising the fact either that when the Oireachtas is in session their work is heavy.  But, taking all these facts into consideration, we have to relate this, and every other matter of public expenditure in the House, to existing conditions in the country, and we cannot fix our salary scales here by relation to the conditions of service which exist in the much wealthier community across the water.  Neither can we say, in 1932, that the standards which were set up, in times of especial difficulty and of comparative prosperity, for those engaged in the public service should apply now, having regard to the condition of the general mass of the people who have to meet the bill, and we cannot say that a Government nine years later, in times of especial difficulty, are not entitled to revise the schedule laid down in 1923, because, apart from the particular circumstances in which we find ourselves, that schedule has already been revised in many important respects by our predecessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, the number of senior clerks has been reduced, the scale of the Clerk of the Seanad has been reduced, and also that of the Clerk Assistant in the Seanad.  The salary of the assistant librarian has been reduced, the salaries of senior translators have been reduced and their scale re-fixed, the scale for junior translators has been reduced at the minimum and increased <Col N="1092" /> at the maximum, so that there had been, even before the change of Government, many alterations already in that schedule.  The alterations were made as vacancies occurred, showing that the original schedule was a provisional schedule only, and was drawn up with special advertence to the circumstances which existed here in 1923, when, as I said, the public service was carried on under especially difficult conditions.</P>
    <P>What is the history of this matter? Deputy Anthony said that my reply to-day was both inaccurate and misleading. It can only be described as inaccurate upon the basis that when Deputy Anthony says twelve months he means thirteen months.  The question which the Deputy asked was:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Finance if he will state the number of vacancies that have arisen in the official reporting staff of the Oireachtas during the last twelve months.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Anthony wanted to know the number of vacancies that had arisen in any longer period he ought to have asked that question.  I can only assume when a Deputy puts down a question, has a number of days to prepare the question, makes a number of shots at it, that, at least, he knows what he wants and what he is asking.</P>

      <P>The Deputy got the answer that the number of vacancies which had arisen in the last twelve months was three, so that the reply was not inaccurate or misleading.  The Deputy said that no effective steps had been taken to relieve the pressure. I do know that one of these vacancies arose in May, 1931.  I know that the second arose in June, 1931, and that the examination under the Civil Service Commission to fill these two vacancies was not held, and was not arranged for until February, 1932, but this Government was not in office during that period, and Deputy Anthony did not think it worth his while to raise that question during the whole of the ten months.  What is the position in relation to the present vacancies?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On 4th March, a request was put up, pointing out first that the vacancies existed, and asking for authority to employ temporary assistance.  The necessary authority was given on March 9th, the day upon which the new Government came into office, and nothing more was heard of the matter in my Department until May 10th, when a further letter was received stating that in the circumstances it had not been found possible to secure temporary assistance upon the lines laid down in the Department's letter of March 9th, and suggesting:</P>
      <P>The Editor of Debates points out that the only way he can obtain further assistance is to take on Pressmen to do notes for half an hour, on certain terms.  Several competent reporters will be available for this class of engagement.</P>
      <P>On 14th, the proposal put up on May 10th was accepted and authority was given to secure the additional staff in accordance with the suggestion that had been made to us.  Step by step with that, arrangements were made to have the vacancies filled in the only regular way in which they can now be filled, through the Civil Service Commission; not by any backdoor method, as Deputy Anthony seemed to suggest when he said that the vacancies were now going to be filled in a manner which hitherto had not been adopted.  As a matter of fact, the one vacancy that was filled in February last was filled through the Civil Service Commission.  The three vacancies which now exist are going to be filled through the Civil Service Commission, the only regular way in which they can be filled, and the only way in which jobbery will be avoided.</P>
