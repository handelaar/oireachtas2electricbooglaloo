      <P>We are accepting amendments 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, with a slight further amendment, that is, that the last line but one shall read &ldquo;shall be deemed not to operate.&rdquo;  We propose to delete the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; and to insert the words &ldquo;be deemed not to&rdquo; in that line. We are also accepting amendments 12, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 29. We are, therefore, rejecting amendments 1, 4, 13, 15, 16, 25, 26, 27, and 28.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the Committee do not agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>Section 1, sub-section (2).  Lines 26-27 deleted and the following substituted therefor:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  a person born in Ireland or a person born outside Ireland whose mother was a resident in Ireland but temporarily absent from Ireland at the time of his birth.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment really deals with the whole problem of citizenship.  As Deputies will see, Section 1 (2) states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Each of the following persons shall for the purposes of this Act be a national of Saorstát Eireann, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a person born in Saorstát Eireann or the area now comprised in Saorstát Eireann;</P>
      <P>(b)  a person who at the relevant time is and for not less than seven consecutive years</P>
      <P>&mdash;that is being amended to &ldquo;five&rdquo;&mdash; immediately preceding that time has been resident in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment would simply mean that any person born in Ireland, whether in the Six Counties or here, or who had been resident in the Six Counties, and was still resident in the Six Counties, would be a citizen of the Saorstát for the purposes of this Bill.  It also suggests that a person born outside Ireland whose mother was a resident of Ireland, but who was temporarily absent from Ireland at the time of his birth would be a citizen.  We feel that it creates a very anomalous position, and would, I think, be entirely out of keeping with the spirit of the Bill itself.  I might point out that the child of a French-woman born in France, a French-woman married to a Frenchman, but having a residence in Ireland, would be a national for the purpose of the <Col N="1693" /> Bill if this amendment were carried. It goes far beyond the scope of what we intend under the Bill.  The difficulty mainly arises owing to lack of a proper definition of citizenship, and for that, of course, we again at the moment take responsibility.  We have defined what we think is reasonable in sub-section (2), and I think the House will agree that it would not be advisable to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points in the amendment.  The Minister moving its rejection says that the amendment itself establishes a test of citizenship.  The answer to that is that the Bill establishes a test of citizenship. One would not have objected if the test of citizenship now laid down in the Constitution had been accepted in the Bill, but that is not so.  A change has been made by the Minister, and a further change is now requested by the Seanad, and as between the two the Seanad recommendation comes nearer to the Constitution than the provision in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister also urges the point against this, that it is an anomaly that possibly a Frenchman who has a residence here could become a citizen for the purpose of the Bill.  Under the Constitution there are people who cannot claim anything in the way of Irish nationality, who are citizens. There is that anomaly in the Constitution, one recognised as such, and the Bill goes further away from the Constitution than what those who founded the State asked to have laid down as a preliminary condition for the acquisition of citizenship.  Leaving over the other matters, until such time as legislation on the question of citizenship is introduced, the status quo, in accordance with the Constitution, should be preserved.  There are two other points. I notice the Minister, in speaking in the Seanad, said that the peculiar position had arisen that a great number of people born since the Constitution was framed were not citizens.  I should like to have some explanation of that, particularly with reference to the phrase &ldquo;a great number of people.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last point of all is that the amendment contains one valuable extension. I leave out the very much <Col N="1694" /> smaller point contained in the second part as to whether or not a person should be counted Irish for the purposes of the Bill whose mother, being resident, is temporarily absent when the birth takes place.  The main part of the Seanad's recommendation is in the first five words: &ldquo;A person born in Ireland&rdquo; instead of a person born in Saorstát Eireann.  I notice that the Minister in the Seanad confessed that he did not know what sub-section (2) (b) meant, but said that he presumed that the legal draftsman thought that there was some point to meet.  If the Seanad want to extend this by saying that they consider as a national for the purpose of the Bill a person born in Ireland, not a person born in the Saorstát, that is in accord with the best doctrines of Sinn Fein.  If we are going to find a centrifugal force here, I suggest that we should accept the words recommended by the Seanad rather than those in the Bill.  I do not know that people in Northern Ireland are in present circumstances likely to avail of this chance, but I suggest that it is one that should be maintained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to my statement in the Seanad, I simply referred to apparent anomalies that existed as regards citizenship under the Constitution, to which the Deputy has also referred.  At the moment I have not just at my finger tips a definition that might satisfy the Deputy.  I might point out that for the purpose of the Bill we think that five consecutive years' residence in Saorstát Eireann, in our judgment, is a reasonable compromise on this position, and that five years' residence would meet the point that has been raised by Deputy McGilligan.  The lack of definition of citizenship, even the definition in the Constitution, I am advised is very unsatisfactory indeed, and it is to be hoped that a proper definition of citizenship will be reached before long.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Sinn Fein idea of all Ireland, I am quite in agreement with Deputy McGilligan.  He and I both know how desirable it would be to have the people of the Six Counties citizens of this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By birth and otherwise, both he and I <Col N="1695" /> might have been debarred from being citizens here.  It is purely on the residence test that either of us is a citizen here, but we have to remember the conditions and the position that has been created.  We cannot close our eyes to the fact that there is a Six-County area partitioned off from part of this country.  Legally and politically that territory is outside the scope of our jurisdiction.  We surely could not claim to legislate for people who of their own will remain outside our jurisdiction.  Nobody would welcome more than I the removal of that barrier or the removal of partition and having the people of the Six Counties citizens here, but we have to take things as they are and under the conditions that prevail it is quite impossible for us to legislate for or to apply the operations of this Bill to people resident in the the Six Counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a question seeing that the Minister founded his statement on the basis that this was making a change in the law with regard to citizenship, that is, what he called citizenship legislation.  I wanted to know how far he understood the present regulations in regard to the acquisition of citizenship ran to.  He has shown by two answers that he does not know.  I asked would he state how he would back his statement that a great number of people born in this country since the time of the passing of the Constitution were not citizens.  He has not answered. The fact is that nobody born in the country since the date of the passing of the Constitution is a citizen of the country.  I do not know how he made the statement with regard to me that my citizenship here was derived from residence.  I have my citizenship by reason of a birth test.</P>
      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Dáil disagree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1&rdquo;&mdash;put and declared carried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the amendments the rejection of which is to be moved, it has been put to me that it is desirable that a very short period should be given to the discussion <Col N="1696" /> of these to allow the other discussion to come on.  For the sake of the recommendations from the Seanad, I should like that House to know how the recommendations are being treated.  If I do not propose to call for divisions in a formal way on these amendments, it is simply to save time. I am vehemently of opinion that the amendment which has been rejected should be carried.</P>

      <P>I move: That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 2 as follows:&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>This was insisted upon in the Seanad.  I see no purpose in it.  The word was inserted against the judgment of our legal advisers and despite my protest.  The Seanad seemed to imagine that it will strengthen the provision legally or make it more easily understood.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee do not agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 4 as follows:</P>
      <P>Section 2, sub-section (1).  After the figures &ldquo;1932&rdquo; in line 6 the following words and figures inserted:&mdash;&ldquo;or by a body corporate formed as the result of a reconstruction without change of control of the body corporate by which it was owned on the 1st day of June, 1932.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment would really allow an existing company to continue although, by reconstruction, it had changed as a legal entity and it might increase its <Col N="1697" /> capital indefinitely no matter what its nationality might be.  This would be an unreasonable extension for existing companies.  Existing companies are already catered for by the fact that those in existence before 1st June, 1932, are not interfered with in any way.  We do not feel that it is wise to go beyond that.  If the whole personnel of the directorate or if the whole share-holding capital were changed and if these companies wanted to extend their activities, we would have practically no control over them if this amendment were accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to envisage only the case of a company which wishes to reconstruct to evade some of the provisions of this Bill.  In the times we are living in, many companies are forced to reconstruct with quite a different object.  As time goes on it looks as if more and more companies will be forced to reconstruct. It seems as if we were at present crystallising a very small band of companies which, from year to year, will be steadily getting less by reason of reconstruction and other causes. It seems to me that, in their endeavour to protect manufacture, the Government will protect it so well that it cannot be carried on.  It is absurd to suggest that a company will reconstruct merely for the purpose of getting over some provision of this Bill. There is quite a larger field for reconstruction and I ask the Minister to reconsider his decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt very much if the Minister has properly understood the amendment in the context in which it was proposed to insert it.  This amendment is to be inserted in lettered paragraph (d), sub-section (1) of Section 2.  Lettered paragraph (d) lays down broadly the conditions for continuing the manufacture in the company. The first condition is that the business was carried on 1st June, 1932.  That still remains as a condition. That limits the number of businesses to which this section may have application.  The second condition of the paragraph is that the business at the time such thing is done is owned by the body corporate by which it was owned on 1st June, 1932.  It is proposed <Col N="1698" /> to make a slight change by inserting the words &ldquo;or by a body corporate formed as the result of a reconstruction without change of control of the body corporate by which it was owned on the 1st day of June, 1932.&rdquo; That is a simple process of reconstruction which does not change the ownership. The third condition, which still continues and overrides everything else is, that &ldquo;the doing of such thing would, if it had been done on 1st day of June, 1932, have been in the ordinary course or formed part of such business as then carried on.&rdquo; You have these three conditions laid down in lettered paragraph (d).  The business must have been in existence on 1st June, 1932.  It must be owned by the same body corporate which owned it on 1st June, 1932, and, thirdly, whatever it does must have formed part of the business which was being done on 1st June, 1932.  It is proposed to keep all these three things, particularly the first and the third, and to enlarge the second simply by saying that a slight change may take place by way of reconstruction which does not operate to change the control.</P>
      <P>The Bill is aimed at control.  The control is to be allowed under two circumstances&mdash;a time limitation and a limitation by way of operation.  The time limitation still remains.  As regards the other limitation, it is proposed to bring in a slight change so as to provide for reconstruction which would not, at the same time, mean change of control.  It is proposed to reject that.  I have heard no reason why it should be rejected.  As Deputy Dockrell mentioned, many companies may want to undergo a process of reconstruction in the ordinary course of business and, with the two overriding considerations to which I have alluded remaining, there is no weakening of the Bill by this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is not quite so simple as Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Dockrell make out.  I am legally advised that such a reconstruction might affect the beneficial ownership of the shares of the company even though nominally the control would be the same and the direction of the <Col N="1699" /> business would be the same.  That is the real reason why we object to this amendment.  The reconstruction of the company might very well be operated to ensure that what we look upon as the beneficial ownership of the company would be changed entirely, so that any group of foreign capitalists could come in and have the beneficial ownership of the company.  While nominal control would be possible, or apparently possible, under the same management the actual beneficial ownership might be changed if this is accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment does not say nominal change and control. It says &ldquo;change of control.&rdquo; That there is change of control and that the controlling influence has gone, or the previously owned management does not apply.  The amendment deals with change of control and the Court will have to decide what that means. We are told that there might be such change that the beneficial ownership has passed.  This Bill is founded on the point that it does not matter who owns the shares so long as the control is in the hands of nationals.  That runs through the Bill.  It is the control that is owned.  I was told that it does not matter how much foreign capital there was so long as the purpose be national. There is no weakening of the phrase which reads: &ldquo;or by a body corporate... without change of control.&rdquo;  If there is no change of control and the beneficial ownership happens to be outside nationals it has got to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out that the whole spirit of the Bill is that the foreign shares in any company are not to be over fifty per cent.  That is running through the Bill and it is very definitely in the measure.  What I said is that the beneficial ownership might pass out of the hands of nationals.</P>

      <P>Section 2, sub-section (1).  After paragraph (e), line 20, a new paragraph inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f) such business was carried on in Saorstát Eireann on the 1st day of June, 1932, and such business is, at the time such thing is done, owned by a body corporate the issued shares of which are beneficially owned to an extent exceeding one half (in nominal value) by the individual or individuals by whom the business was beneficially owned on the 1st day of June, 1932, and the doing of such thing would, if it had been done on the said 1st day of June, 1932, or within one month immediately preceding that date, have been in the ordinary course or formed part of such business or have been a reasonable extension of such business as then carried on in Saorstát Eireann; or&rdquo;</P>

      <P>What does this amendment mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The real purpose behind this amendment was to insert the words &ldquo;or within one month immediately preceding that date.&rdquo; There was a good deal of discussion with regard to the inserting of the definite date, the 1st day of June, 1932. It was assumed that by some chance a business might not be operating on that date.  I thought the amendment <Col N="1701" /> was quite unnecessary, but at any rate the amendment was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to find out more about this now.  This is a new special paragraph and does not displace (e) or (f), because there is nothing in it dealing with these paragraphs. So far as putting in the words &ldquo;or within one month immediately preceding that date,&rdquo; they are already inserted in paragraph (e) by amendment 8.  I think there must be something more in this amendment than we have been told.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It also deals with the extension or any development of the business.  Senator Douglas was very anxious to provide that there could be a reasonable extension of the business and that that would be covered by this section.  His case was that a certain business might wish to adapt itself to further extension.  There was a good deal of discussion as to what was extension or development in a new business, or a transfer from one business to another.  We agreed, so long as it was to be taken as a reasonable extension of such business, that that would cover it.  The insertion of the words &ldquo; one month immediately preceding that date&rdquo; was the main object Senator Douglas had in view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>But the words &ldquo;one month immediately preceding that date&rdquo; are already inserted in paragraphs (e) and (f).</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In what?  This is a new paragraph.  It is not ordinary procedure to insert words and then bring them up again merely for the sake of repetition.  There must be some idea in the new paragraph and I would like to find out what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I must protest. This is a new paragraph and it takes up and deals with most of the matters in the two preceding paragraphs. The Minister said the new <Col N="1702" /> paragraph is a necessary extension by way of the insertion of the words &ldquo;one month immediately preceeding&rdquo; for a reasonable extension of business, but in paragraphs (e) and (f) we have already dealt with these points.  This new paragraph seems to me to be an entire repetition.</P>

      <P>Let us look at the general words: &ldquo;business carried on in Saorstát Eireann on the 1st day of June 1932.&rdquo; As I said the same is in paragraphs (e) and (f).  The next paragraph is &ldquo;owned by a body corporate.&rdquo;  This is the preamble to the second part of (e) and (f).  Then it comes boldly away from (e) and (f) and says &ldquo;owned by a body corporate the issued shares of which are beneficially owned on the 1st day of June 1932.&rdquo;  Does the Minister see a glimmering of sense even in this amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, it was insisted on by the Seanad, and the main purpose, as I explained, was, or <Col N="1703" /> at least what was conveyed to me was, that it was intended to cover a reasonable extension of this business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Has not the Minister the advantage of the advice of the Attorney-General and some other legal officers to explain what it means so that he could explain to this House what it means.  The explanation he has given to-day does not show what it means.  Let us take an example. A particular company has a distribution of shares on 1st June, 1932, in the proportion, let us say, of 60-40 per cent.&mdash;that is, 60 per cent. national and 40 per cent. non-national.  It wants to start a new business on 1st August.  If 51 per cent. of the shares have been unchanged, and the distribution not affected thereby, they can go on with the business according to this sub-section.  In other words, if the business was manufacturing soap and they found that as one of their by-products they could manufacture explosives, they can go on with that even though the share capital has come down from 60 to 49.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite get the Deputy's point.  The fact of the matter was that this new sub-section that we proposed to add was also the cause of a great deal of controversy in the Seanad, and it was felt that a bank owning shares or having shares as collateral would be deemed the owner. Accordingly, the argument was that the banks might have to make an investigation with regard to all their shareholders to find out if they were a body corporate within the meaning of the Act.  This further amendment yesterday was put in at the request of the bankers to ensure that there would be no difficulty regarding their holding shares either as owners or as collateral.</P>

      <P>I thought the Minister said that (b) was a misprint and should be (c).  I want the Minister to deliberate on what he is doing.  He is transferring the whole of the provisions of paragraph (c) and paragraph (b).  Is that what he really means?  I suggest for his consideration&mdash;and, if necessary, we can adjourn this to have it considered&mdash;that what should be done is to say &ldquo;for the purpose of paragraphs (b) and (c) of the immediately preceding sub-section.&rdquo; because if the Minister looks at it he will see that what is left here, paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d), all refer to paragraph (b) of the preceeding sub-section, but that the new thing we are putting in <Col N="1707" /> refers to paragraph (c).  Clearly, the new paragraph we are putting in has no reference to (b).  It must have reference to (c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the draftsman that a printer's error did take place in this and that what is printed as (b) should refer to paragraph (c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very absurd. Let us read any one of the sub-sections referred to.  It stands at the moment &ldquo;for the purpose of paragraph (b)&rdquo; and a number of things follow.  It was paragraph (b) as the Bill was introduced in the House.  It was argued in its reactions on (b), and it was sought to extend it to (d), I think, but that was refused, and, all the time, the argument and the Bill and the framework of the whole operations have proceeded on this, that whatever is in sub-section (2) of Section 2 has relation to paragraph (b) only.  A change has been made in the Seanad, and, if the Minister looks through sub-section (1) of Section 2 he will see that the clearly relevant portion is paragraph (c) of that sub-section, but that the other paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) still remain with all the relevance they had heretofore to paragraph (b) and that the change that should be made is not at all the change of amending the letter (b) with the brackets, to the letter (c) with the brackets, but by making the change &ldquo;for the purpose of paragraphs (b) and (c).&rdquo;  If the Minister will look at it, he will see, I think, easily enough, that (a) refers to a national dying who is the beneficial owner of shares in a body corporate. Paragraph (b) refers to the man who becomes a bankrupt and the operative words are &ldquo;and at the time of his bankruptcy was the beneficial owner of shares in a body corporate.&rdquo; Surely that refers altogether to (b). It does not refer to (c).  We have in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) death, bankruptcy and trusteeship, and (d) refers to shares held in proportion of holding as between different people and it clearly has reference to (b), but the new thing introduced is &ldquo;the <Col N="1708" /> issued shares of a body corporate are transferred to a bank being a body corporate by way of security for an advance.&rdquo;  I think that has clearly reference to (c) but it is such an important point that it would be a good thing to have it brought before the draftsman.  We can pass it for the moment and take it up again before the sitting ends.  I think it is a matter of great importance.</P>

      <P>There was only one point in the Minister's remarks which struck me as peculiar.  He talked about the banks having to go over their shareholders' lists.  Surely this amendment refers to quite a different matter. It is not the holding of the bank's own stocks that it refers to but to the pawning of other stocks with the bank. I think the Minister was in error in his reference to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to explain that what were concerned were shares transferred to a bank as collateral, and, in many cases, these are transferred to the ownership of the bank in order to secure the necessary banking facilities.  Senator Jameson raised the point that, if the amendment stood without the words &ldquo;be deemed not to,&rdquo; the question arose, then, as to whether a bank could be considered to be the owners of them.  I pointed out that the introductory paragraph of the section &ldquo;for the purpose of paragraph (b) of the immediately preceding sub-section, but not further or otherwise&rdquo; seemed to me to be adequate covering for a bank, that is to say, that collateral, registered in the ownership of the bank, was owned by the bank, but not for the purpose of this Act, and these words were inserted, after a good deal of discussion, to ensure that it was only for the purpose of this Act that ownership of the shares was not supposed to be in the hands of the bank.</P>

      <P>Section 2, sub-section (4).  After the word &ldquo;section&rdquo; in line 25 the words &ldquo;and <i>prima facie</i> evidence of such offence has been given&rdquo; inserted.</P>
      <P>We are resisting this amendment on the ground that the Minister will have to prove that manufacture is being carried on.  The company or individuals will then have to prove that, for some one or more of the matters mentioned in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e), a licence is not required.  We are not clear as to what <i>prima facie</i> evidence the Minister can give.  This is a legal point which, I must confess, I do not understand, but the legal point of view in the Department is that the amendment seems to be almost meaningless. We cannot understand what <i>prima facie</i> evidence the Minister could give. We, therefore, feel that it is quite unnecessary and we propose its rejection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment, together with Nos. 15 and 16, are the most important amendments that have come down from the Seanad, and No. 13, I think, is one that should be pressed.  This Bill is setting up a completely new system with regard to manufactures in the country and breaking into the ordinary freedom of contract that heretofore operated in the country and the privacy of people's business.  That being the case, it seems that the Minister should have the onus of proof put upon him, even though he has only to establish in a <i>prima facie</i> way&mdash;a term that is well understood&mdash;that an offence has been committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must remember that manufacture has been carried on, and therefore the onus of proving (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) would lie on those carrying on the manufacture and the Department does not <Col N="1711" /> know what <i>prima facie</i> evidence there is of any of these things.  Such <i>prima facie</i> evidence might be given by the Minister.  Take (d).  This business was carried on in Saorstát Eireann on 1st June, 1932.  Under the Companies Act a body corporate would be registered and would have to register with regard to the date.  It is the easiest thing in the world for the Minister to establish a good <i>prima facie</i> case that the business was not carried on on 1st June, 1932, by that body corporate.  That is all that is asked in the amendment.  The same thing applies to the other paragraphs. Surely it is easy for the Minister to raise the presumption that the business is not the same, is not owned by the body corporate, and is not in beneficial ownership, and the onus shifts back to the manufacturers.  As far as most of the paragraphs are concerned this is an interference with business already established, and under these circumstances I think the rule should be that the Minister should have the obligation put upon him of making a <i>prima facie</i> case. That is all that is asked.  There are heavy penalties for contravention. In addition to imposing penalties, and imposing a completely new system, sub-section (4) says that the onus of proving the matters mentioned in the paragraphs shall be on the person so charged.  I should not have minded if the Ministry had put in this section at all but let the ordinary rules apply.  As far as I can understand generally, where matters are regarded peculiarly within the knowledge and control of the people engaged in the manufactures, the onus would naturally shift by the ordinary rules upon these people.  Where that case cannot be made, and where matters are not supposed to be within the knowledge and control of the persons charged, the onus would be on those making the charge.  If there was no such paragraph in the section the ordinary court rules would apply.  The Minister may impose penalties and in addition the onus shall be on the person charged, which is a complete <Col N="1712" /> reversal.  The Seanad objects and with a very moderate amendment says that the onus should lie on the person charged where the matter is within his control or information and once the Minister has made a <i>prima facie</i> case.  That is all that is requested.</P>

      <P>I would point out to Deputy McGilligan that there seems to be a good deal of relief afforded in amendment 14, where we are asking the House to agree that the certificate will be accepted.</P>
      <P>(a) that he is the beneficial owner of such shares and is a national of Saorstát Eireann, or</P>
      <P>(b) that he holds such shares on behalf of another person and that such other person is a national of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
      <P>Those will be accepted as <i>prima facie</i> evidence if the facts are certified.  This is a legal matter and I am advised that the position should be that the onus shall be on the person proceeded against.</P>

      <P>I would like to press for consideration for this amendment. It is very important from the commercial point of view, because I take it all the proceedings under this Bill, when it is an Act, will not come into court.  It will be a great help to manufacturers who have not the benefit of skilled legal advice, to get some sort of <i>prima facie</i> evidence given to them when a charge is made.  It also leaves them in the position that they feel they cannot be harassed by undue inquiries because&mdash;while it might not be the case here&mdash;when they get a couple of inquiries or a couple of <Col N="1713" /> requisitions from the Government they usually ask themselves why the Government has a spite against them.  I am very glad the Minister is leaving the matter for decision by the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was first introduced I drew the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to this point, and stated that this proviso could deeply reverse a vital principle in well-established common law, that every man is innocent until proved guilty.  If the proposal brought a man into court, and possibly into the dock, on a charge of misdemeanour, and if it is on him to prove that he is innocent of the charge brought forward by the State, that reverses the whole principle of jurisprudence, as practised at present.  It may look insignificant under this Bill but I suggest to the House that what has to be remembered is that once we adopt a principle of this character, it will be quoted as a precedent by every succeeding administration, and probably by this administration for a similar proviso in perhaps much more pressing circumstances. I think we should appreciate very warmly the attitude of the Minister in leaving this to a free vote of the House. I would appreciate it much more if he would accept the recommendation. I sincerely hope the House will do so.  We are accepting the recommendation simply on the ground that in the present form of the section we are making a serious inroad on a very great protection to civil liberty. If the Minister at a later stage produces an amendment we should facilitate the Government.  I am sure the House would go a long way to meet him if he could meet the situation here without infringing on liberty.</P>

      <P>With the lawyers, I have gone into the particular method introduced in the amendment, and it seems to me that it is purely a legal business.  Some say it does not mean anything while others, such as Deputy McGilligan, say it does.  I am disposed to agree with both of the last speakers, that if there is a principle, whereby anything that is now the normal course of law has been set <Col N="1714" /> aside, that should not happen. Therefore I accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>The following amendment (14) was agreed to:</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 3 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3. (1) In any proceedings against a body corporate for an offence under the immediately preceding section, the production of a certificate in the prescribed form and containing the prescribed particulars and verified in the prescribed manner, under the hand of a person registered as the proprietor of shares in such body corporate certifying&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) that he is the beneficial owner of such shares and is a national of Saorstát Eireann, or</P>

      <P>Section 5, sub-section (1).  The words &ldquo;in his absolute discretion&rdquo; deleted in lines 54-55 and the words &ldquo;in accordance with provisions contained in regulations made under this Act&rdquo; substitued therefor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may grant a licence under Section 5 if he is of opinion that the granting of the licence is to enable the applicant to do some or any of the things specified in his application.  That is the policy of the Bill and we feel that this amendment would be in contradiction to the whole principle of the Bill. The same applies to amendment 16. <Col N="1715" /> We are dealing with amendment 15 now and I ask the House to reject it.</P>

      <P>The Seanad want the words &ldquo;in the absolute discretion of the Minister&rdquo; deleted.  They want these deleted and we feel that the nature of this Bill and the conditions of this Bill leave it absolutely necessary that the Minister's discretion should operate in the administration of this Bill.  We feel that no other method but the discretion of the Minister could be exercised.  It was argued elsewhere that a Commission should be set up or that a Special Committee should be set up and we resisted that because we feel that after all the Minister administering the Bill is responsible to the Executive Council who are in turn responsible to the Oireachtas, and that the Minister is the person to exercise the discretionary powers given to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are told now that the principle of the Bill really requires that the Minister should have absolute discretion.  That is what the Minister's talk comes to.  I want to point out what we are asked to do by the Seanad.  We are not cutting out &ldquo;absolute discretion&rdquo; and to have everything brought before the House.  What is being asked is that, instead of having the Minister acting absolutely in his discretion in each particular case, he will act still within his discretion, whatever discretion the House allows him in accordance with the regulation.  The House wants to protect the State from this, that the Minister is to deal at his own will and pleasure with the industries one by one.  The amendment wants to have that done by general regulations. The Minister can make regulations but the regulations must be laid down. The regulations when made must be laid before the House.  The majority supporting a Government can always get regulations made but they must get regulations made not one by one but in a general series.  We are told <Col N="1716" /> now that the Minister must have absolute discretion; that he cannot even bring the regulations before the House even though the regulations would be in general terms.  One thing you could provide by the regulations would be that you would save preferential treatment as between firm and firm, unless the Minister in each case was able to bring forward evidence that the necessities of the situation demanded preferential treatment for one firm as against another.  All that this amendment says is that the Minister must act &ldquo;in accordance with provisions contained in regulations made under this Act&rdquo;; and that he must bring these regulations before the House.  He may act on the regulations before the House.  He is to bring in regulations afterwards.  If he cannot get them approved, the regulations will go by the board.  That is all that the Seanad asks&mdash;not to wipe out the discretion of the Minister absolutely and entirely but to substitute for these words that before the Minister is to act he must have laid down the regulations for his own guidance and that those regulations must be promulgated to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the amendment.  There is a point that is not being brought out sufficiently with regard to the regulations as opposed to the absolute discretion of the Minister. You are dealing with firms who are making application for new licences.  Those presumably in a great number of cases may be foreign firms. It would be a great advantage in considering the possibilities of manufacture in the Free State for manufacturers to be able to get the Act, to sit down and read it over and then to read the regulations so as to see if they were able with those regulations to get the permission granted and to secure the licence.  It would be a great advantage for a manufacturer to know that under the regulations he would be able to see beforehand that the licence would be granted.  But take the position as the Government wish it.  The Government wish that the foreign firm should go to the expense of preliminary <Col N="1717" /> negotiations over here and then to make special application to the Minister which might or might not be granted.  I suggest that there ought to be general regulations on reading which anybody can find out whether he is entitled to get his application rejected or accepted.  I think it would be desirable for any manufacturer who had to make a preliminary survey of the possibilities of manufacture in this country to have that knowledge to start with.  That manufacturer could then go ahead. But if the Minister were to take out of his pocket something and consider whether the application of the manufacturer ought to be accepted or rejected it would be quite a different matter.  I suggest that that is not the way in which legislation should be carried out in this country.  This House ought to make its rules so that the people would be able to see what the prospects were of getting permission granted.  There are far too much special exceptions and special rejections possible under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out that there are many things embodied in this Bill which clearly indicate what manufacturers requiring a licence have got to do.  But there are many other things that must be left to the discretion of the Minister.  There are, for instance, conditions in a particular industry where a new manufacturer may want to come in; where a firm may be in a position and be willing and ready to apply for permission but where it would not be desirable to give the licence.  Regulations will be laid down but these regulations should and will be in the hands of the Minister.  The Minister is always responsible to the Oireachtas. It is impossible in a Bill of this kind to foresee all the possibilities, all the evasions, the possible operations and the various methods and means that may be attempted to get inside the terms of the Bill.  Therein lies the need for the discretionary power of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>For all sorts of reasons.  We have a number of manufacturers, say, whom we have induced to go into industry here.  It may not be desirable that we should allow a foreign manufacturer to operate through dumping an association and creating 51 per cent. of the stock.  It might not be desirable to let such a company come in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill in its operation will require the utmost discretion of the Minister and I suggest that this amendment would limit his discretion and it would be against the whole spirit of the Bill.  The Minister is more likely to be responsible to public opinion and to criticism than he would be under any other method that might be devised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1927" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the objections which the Minister has raised with regard to this amendment inserted by the Seanad are not at all well-founded. The main purpose of the amendment is to ensure uniformity of practice within which the Minister may exercise his discretion.  The Minister has given one example as to the necessity for having an absolute discretion. The example is this: A company which came within the provisions of the Bill might apply to the Minister to carry on a certain species of manufacture in the country.  The Minister, having regard to existing industries carried on here, might desire to refuse such an application.  So far as I can see, a regulation would presumably be needed to meet the case which the Minister puts forward.  It would be very easy for him to say that licences may be refused on certain grounds.  The first ground he could set out would be where the particular class of manufacture proposed to be carried on would be, in the opinion of the Minister, hurtful to existing industries of that class.  If a regulation <Col N="1719" /> of that type were passed by the Dáil, then within the terms of that regulation the Minister would have full discretion which could not be questioned by anybody.</P>
      <P>I think, from the Minister's own point of view, it would be a great saving to him to have specific regulations which would be known to the public and which would be approved by the House.  It could not then be said that for some fantastical reason or other, some underground reason, the Minister was refusing particular people permission to carry on business. If the wording of the Bill is left as it is, it will come back on the Minister. Perhaps a perfectly <i>bona fide</i> exercise of discretion by him might be ascribed to improper motives.  The Bill gives power to make regulations and ten or twenty different sets of regulations can be framed.  It is not necessary to make one set of regulations to govern procedure for all time.  The Minister has every power to make regulations which can be exercised by him from time to time.  The Interpretation Act of 1923, in accordance with which this Bill when passed into law must be construed, indicates that where any power is given to the Minister it can be exercised from time to time.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of people desirous of engaging in industry here it is absolutely essential that there should be some settled, uniform grounds upon which the Minister may exercise his discretion.  That will not in any way impair the discretion which is given to the Minister.  The regulations can set out in a perfectly clear manner the grounds upon which the Minister can exercise his discretion.  If he thinks a particular case comes within these grounds, his exercise of discretion is absolute and final.  From the point of view of the Minister, it would be a useful change to import into the Bill the suggestion made by the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, before he went to Ottawa, communicated to this House that he had been approached in advance <Col N="1720" /> by certain firms desiring to set up immediately and they requested him to indicate if he would, in face of the then existing situation, grant them a licence when the Bill became law.  He informed the House that he was obliged to say &ldquo;No.&rdquo; I asked him why.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to-day mentioned that there is security under the Bill as it stands to the extent that the Minister must answer to the House for his decision.  When I asked the Minister why certain firms were given that negative reply he said he could not answer that question as it might not be fair to the firms and it was not in accord with public policy.  I sympathised with the Minister.  I realised that he might have had confidential information from firms&mdash;they might have made a full disclosure to him-and it would not be fair that he should reveal that information.  But if he had sets of regulations that had been already approved by the Oireachtas he would be in a position to assert: &ldquo;I satisfied myself that this firm does not comply with the regulation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Under the wording of this Bill, I do not think the firm could contest the Minister's decision, because his decision is final.  It would, in my opinion, be a much more desirable situation if the Minister were in a position to say.  &ldquo;There are the regulations and this firm does not come within them.&rdquo;  It would be open to a Deputy to produce facts in the Dáil to prove that the firm did come within the regulations.  A firm might authorise a member of the Dáil to do that and give him confidential information. That would relieve the Minister of the obligation not to divulge secret information. The Minister, under the Bill as it stands, is given possession of certain information and, when he is called to produce the safeguards promised to the Dáil, he is obliged to say that it would not be fair to the firm to divulge the information and it would not be in the interests of public policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the Committee do not agree with the Seanad in amendment 16:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 5, sub-section (2).  The words &ldquo;the Minister thinks proper and states in such licence&rdquo; deleted in lines 20-21 and the words &ldquo;shall be in accordance with provisions contained in regulations made under this Act&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is felt that it would be quite impossible to get any blanketing regulation that would cover all the terms and conditions for the various companies, and that there would, inevitably, have to be different terms <Col N="1723" /> applying to different licences.  That will probably be as much in the interests of the intended manufacturer as in the carrying out of the Act.  It is felt that it would not be possible to lay down any general regulation covering the terms under which any particular company would act and we, therefore, ask the Dáil to reject the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not lay down regulations for the guidance of his own Department so that we may have continuity of action?  Will regulations not be necessary in that case for the guidance of his own Department?  Surely some regulations are necessary for guidance in a matter of this importance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Regulations will be necessary and are provided for under Section 11, but this would limit the power of the Minister with regard to the conditions under which a licence would be granted, and certain conditions will be necessary in certain licences.  There will be no uniformity of regulation embodied in the licence. We have had already one or two cases that are under consideration where manufacturers coming in would want almost certain guarantees before they would start operations, and such a clause would inevitably have to be embodied in such licence to give the manufacturer himself the necessary protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is consequential on the last but there is a point of difference and the point of difference is important.  What is at issue is not the difficulty of making the licence fit new circumstances or different occasions because that can be done under the regulations.  These points need not be foreseen.  They can be dealt with as they arise.  The regulations can be framed so as to meet the new circumstances but the regulation after the event of the granting of the licence should be brought before the House.  There is no question of hardship involved and no question of holding up the Ministry in the praise-worthy work of promoting new industries. <Col N="1724" /> The only issue is secrecy. Bring the regulations before the House.  Make them as specialised to the circumstances as is necessary but bring them before the House.</P>
      <P>I want to point out that the Minister in making his regulations is making offences because this Section 5 must be read in conjunction with the next Section 6 which states:</P>
      <P>If any person who is the holder of a new manufacture licence fails or neglects or refuses to comply with the terms and conditions subject to which such licence was granted, such person shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds.</P>
      <P>The Minister is creating an offence in so far as he is creating conditions and putting them in the licence.  Although these may have to be proved in court for the purpose of a summary conviction, it is not thought desirable to bring them before the House after the event.  That is the only thing that is at issue.  The whole thing is that the Ministry wants secrecy, not the secrecy that is understandable because the secrecy that is understandable appertains, say, to the collection of statistical information for an individual business.  You require a certain amount of confidence in these matters and therefore would require a certain amount of secrecy but that secrecy can be covered by a regulation of a general type.  All these regulations even though of a general type should be brought before the House.  Again, I repeat, after the event of the granting of the licence.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>The following amendments were agreed to:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 6.  After the word &ldquo;thereof&rdquo; in line 26 the following words inserted:&mdash;&ldquo;in the case of a first conviction to a fine not exceeding twenty-five pounds or in the case of a second or subsequent conviction.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1728" /> The Minister said there was not any penalty in answer to Deputy Cosgrave. If the question is a proper one to ask, if the information that comes back does not give a proper return, then there is an offence committed.  This is the Bill that was violently boosted about, a Bill about which the Minister made such pother and he does not yet know that this is an offence.  I am making this point.  It is apparently considered desirable to have the Minister empowered to ask for certain information and it was at one time considered desirable to have him empowered to ask for this information&mdash; is a certain man or is he not a national of Saorstát Eireann?  It is now proposed not to give the Minister power to ask that question.  This is a fundamental question and all the others that may be asked may well turn on the point as to whether he is a national or not.  Why is it proposed to except this from the questions that may be asked by the Minister?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>We acceded to the urge of the Seanad that we should not ask this question.  That is all I have to say about the matter.  We agreed to their proposal that these words should be eliminated.  With regard to the question raised by Deputy Cosgrave, I misunderstood him when I stated that there was no penalty.  I assumed that he asked whether it would be a penalty if we asked the information which it is now proposed to eliminate.  If these words are eliminated that question does not arise.  If the Dáil insists on leaving the Bill as it is and rejecting this amendment we would be all the happier and there would be a penalty.</P>

      <P>I agree.  I have always given the Deputy a turn.  The Deputy has exerted his legal ingenuity to find out little, trifling, legal technicalities on which he can trip a non-legal person. I have made up this Bill.  It is a most intricate and difficult Bill and there is not a section of it on which an astute and clever lawyer could not trip up anybody operating it.  One thing one has always to remember about the Deputy is that any Bill not drawn up by him for the Department of Industry and Commerce or the Department of External Affairs is condemned.

When laid on the Table of the House, if either House wishes to annul these regulations, they have that power without prejudice to anything done previously under the regulations.

As it is, the Ministry can do anything at its discretion, but if the Minister chooses to submit himself to the process of regulation the regulation may come before the House.  It is rather evidence of the type of mind under which we have to live at the moment when we are told that to change the form of regulation-making into that desired by the Seanad would enable the Oireachtas to hold up its Minister.  I did not know that the Oireachtas had any other purpose than to hold up the Minister when they thought he should be held up and to give him freedom when they thought <Col N="1732" /> he should be given freedom.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the drafting of this amendment which makes me curious.  I can understand the omission of agriculture by a special amendment put in in Section 14, which already exempts milling.  &ldquo;This Act,&rdquo; the section states, &ldquo;shall not apply to the process of milling wheat or the adapting for sale at a mill any product of wheat milled at such mill&rdquo; or to agriculture.  We come on to the other matter of altering or repairing by a retailer of an article intended to be sold retail by him.  I ask those interested to look back at the definition section. Previously, we had not a definition of &ldquo;adapt for sale.&rdquo;  At some stage of the passage of the Bill through this House, the definition, as it now stands, was put in&mdash;&ldquo;the expression adapt for sale includes pack, bottle or label for sale, but does not include the packing, bottling or labelling by a retailer of an article intended to be sold retail by him.&rdquo;  At that time, an effort was made in this House to find out whether this was intended to apply to manufacturers as ordinarily understood or to the retail business.  We were told that it was intended not to have application to the retail business.  An amendment was put down to exclude the retail business as such but that was not accepted.  Later, we find ourselves in the peculiar position that Section 2 &mdash;the operative section&mdash;does bring in the very words which are now taken out in part&mdash;altering or repairing. Section 2 says &ldquo;it shall not be lawful for any person who carries on a business by way of trade for the purposes of gain to do any of the following things in the course or as part of such business, that is to say, to make, alter, repair, ornament, finish or to adapt for sale any article, material or substance or to adapt for sale any article, material or substance...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now come back to the position where alteration and repair goes into the operative section without any relation to manufacture.  Alteration or repair may be done as a separate operation when the goods are sent back. It might be done in cases of retailers. We have an extension of the whole measure by the phrase &ldquo;adapted for sale.&rdquo;  Now we exclude where necessary <Col N="1734" /> in Section 2 the general words. We had a refusal to accept retail, as such, or any one of those smaller matters as done by the retailers on goods for retail.  Now we find that we have this back again in the last section but one.  What is to be the repercussions of this upon Section 2&mdash;the main section of the Bill?  The Minister gave us as an explanation that the main contention upon which his mind turned in accepting this amendment was on the repair of articles of clothing. That very example was brought up in this House when a similar amendment was not accepted.  What is it that has changed the mind of the Ministry?  Why do they extend alteration if done by the retailer for the purposes of sale?  Do they intend to limit it or is it to be comprehensive of all retail goods?  If so, why give the definite suggestion here: get it out of retail?  It was an obvious suggestion at one time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the suggestion, all through the Bill, was it had nothing to do with the retail trade. In spite of that it was pointed out by a Senator that quite a number of large manufacturing firms who could be considered manufacturers and wholesalers could, at the same time, be considered as retailers if they kept limited staffs for altering goods already on show, and on sale, for retail here.  It might be argued that they were evading the Act, that they were manufacturing outside and that these alterations and repairs would be carried on for the purpose of the Act.</P>

      <P>On amendment 11, I want to know what is going to happen to that.  It is a matter, I think, that still requires a little bit of consideration. <Col N="1735" /> If the Minister comes here with the suggestion that he wants to get the letter, instead of the paragraphs in sub-section (2) of Section 2, changed to (c) that is not provided for in the amendment.  It does not come as an amendment from the Seanad because the whole Bill was argued as if Section 2 (2) had reference to paragraph (b).  If it is amended an amendment of that kind is not provided for. The amendment is one of substance and should again come before us.  If it merely changed by putting in an additional (c) then I agree.</P>

      <P>I think it was Deputy Cosgrave that referred to Communism yesterday.  He made a statement that this was an effort at Communism and Deputy Fitzgerald said that we were being pushed and that the I.R.A. and other bodies in this country were pushing us.  In so far as the communistic business is concerned I think that Deputy Cosgrave, when President, found that that argument was a failure.  I do not think there is any progress to be made along those lines.  There is nothing at all communistic in what <Col N="1736" /> is being done in the introduction of this Estimate.  It is purely a precautionary measure.  As far as being pushed by the I.R.A., or any other organisation here, the policy of the Government is not at all pushed by any organisation, but it is definitely being pushed by this nation.  Ninety-five per cent. of the nation are definitely pushing this Government to do what we are doing now for them. They feel they have been deceived, and that, really, now is not the time that this should have been done, but that it should have been done previously.</P>
      <P>We have to-day some pronouncements from, I think, Sir Thomas Inskip.  He seems to have taken the place of others.  He has made various pronouncements but much akin to the little whisperings you hear round about this country.  Great men evidently think alike in these matters. He declared that President de Valera has rattled the sword; that the £5,000,000 was nothing and that if it was only a question of £5,000,000 he would settle immediately.  Money is nothing at all to him.  We know things are not as they were long ago. These statements made by that gentleman are not going to be accepted in this country in the way the British Government thinks they will be accepted, and in the way a number of people in England want them to be accepted.  That means that, latterly, the English people are beginning to open their eyes to the facts, that they are now accepting the situation, and that they believe the steps which Sir Thomas and others took are not the steps that they would like to have been taken.  As far as rattling the sword is concerned I honestly can see no indication whatever of any sword rattling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This question of land annuities has been before the country since 1926.  It has been reported in the newspapers. The big English newspapers had it. I take it that the intelligence department of the British Government would have been notified of the fact.  This is not a question that cropped up yesterday.  It is a question of long standing.  In fact, I daresay the <Col N="1737" /> source of it was what took place previous to the Land Act, 1923.  It is this sort of agreement that Mr. Thomas bases all his calculations on, which undoubtedly influenced the 1923 Land Act and all land measures since, and which, further than that, influenced our capacity to hold our own, as I said last night, in the British market.  What took place after all that we heard here so many times? The ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce on many occasions explained to us the co-equality which we had, all the power which we had and all that sort of thing.  Certainly we had all that sort of power until we tested it.  The very moment that any attempt was made to take advantage of that power you found that you could not go on.  Mr. Thomas may be right or he may be wrong, but certainly he is a responsible Minister of State and the official statements which he made in the British House of Commons do not indicate at all that the treatment which we are supposed to get is the same treatment as any of the rest of the colonies get.  In fact, as far as his official statement is concerned we are not at all in the same position.  We have no co-equality and he would not at all give us the same treatment as he gives the other colonies.  What does he want?  Has he made a mistake?</P>
    <P>Now the question is that these five million pounds, according to another speaker, are nothing at all&mdash;that there is something else behind it.  I believe that there ought to be something else behind it.  I believe that there is something else behind it and I hope that there is, because there is one thing that I am satisfied about, and so is everybody in this House, and that is that the system that has been carried on in this country since 1922 is a system under which we could not continue to exist here.  If we cannot get some way out of the difficulties, and if we cannot get some way out of the impossible marketing conditions under which we have had to live and to get our living, there is not any use in going on.  There is not a bit of use in a man reading all these big figures <Col N="1738" /> about £30,000,000 or £35,000,000, the volume of our exports, and so on. The question is how do the individuals fare who made that sum.  They fared extremely badly.  They got no opportunity. In other words, they did not get a fair deal and they could not continue.  The position to-day is that 85 per cent of them are practically out of action.</P>
    <P>The policy of the British Government economically towards us is to a large extent the same policy which she adopts towards her other colonies as far as her economic policy is concerned. She has a teeming population, a great deal more than she will ever be capable of holding or feeding under the present conditions.  Her policy towards the colonies is &ldquo;you may grow cattle and produce fats and feeding stuffs for us and we will return you all the manufactures which you require.&rdquo;  At any rate, that is a perfectly reasonable proposal until it comes to be examined, but there are people in those colonies who cannot be all engaged in agriculture.  If there are, there are quite a number of them like the people here who do not care to be engaged in that industry without getting something for it.  I think that nobody here will deny that we, as producers of agricultural products in this country have suffered loss&mdash;that no person practically in this country in the last nine years got paid for their work.</P>

      <P>The result is, if the thing is examined, that we can come to the conclusion, I think, that as far as our agricultural industry is concerned, as far as paying wages is concerned, we employed more people in England and in Scotland in the distribution of our agricultural produce there than we employed or paid wages to people in <Col N="1739" /> this country to produce those products. That is the position.  We could not continue, and I believe that in this country we must have an opportunity here, and that we must seize on the opportunity, of developing our industries and getting a proper balance.  We must seize and develop the market that exists here for agricultural produce and, furthermore, I believe that we ought to try to find out what our markets are outside and develop them. To do that, we must buy from those markets.  To do that, we must get, as far as possible, ships to come from those countries.  If we get ships to come from those countries here, they will not always go away idle.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt him.  I thought the Deputy might want to say something.  As far as that is concerned, it was not the British market that caused all the damage. Quite a number of restrictions, and rules and regulations, imposed by the Department of Agriculture, caused a lot of the dislocation here.  Is not that right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government in power at the time told the British people: &ldquo;Look here, you know nothing at all about what you want.  We know all about it. We will see that you will get the right article and this is the right article for you.&rdquo;  The farmers here were told: &ldquo;You know nothing at all about this business of cattle breeding but we know all about it.  We will put restrictions on you and we will do away with these scrub bulls.&rdquo;  What is the result? We are supposed to have improved the breed of cattle going to the British market and for the last nine years in Dublin market&mdash;it may be through hunger&mdash;there are more cattle tied to the rails at 12 o'clock, 1 o'clock and 2 o'clock in the day unfit for anything than there have been in any period in the past.  Nobody will deny that.  Those were the developments. <Col N="1741" /> The same thing occurred with butter and every time that we obeyed the legislation passed here, all we got was a lower price.  Every effort that was made to improve the quality of the article resulted in a loss.  That is the record, and the fundamental part of it, taking production into account, is that under the 1923 Land Act we were paying at least three times more in rent than could possibly be met.</P>
    <P>That is a good deal off the question at issue.  To return to the question at issue, Mr. Baldwin talking on the Free State and what she paid out, on more than one occasion, gave it as his opinion that this country paid more out of its income to other countries than any country he knew of.  How did he arrive at that?  He knew perfectly well that we could not continue to pay these five millions that we were paying. It is quite true that, when this agreement was signed, monetary conditions were quite different from what they are to-day.  It is quite true that, in 1926, the gold standard had been adopted in England and hopes were high that the world would have changed completely and that economic conditions would have been different. I admit that that is one excuse that could reasonably be put forward for the signing of such an agreement as was signed at that time.  But what happened?  It was found that the gold standard was unsuitable and there was another change.  We got on to what they now call the sterling or paper standard.  All the time markets were dropping.  The value of produce was dropping, as it had to drop.  I do not think that at any time we could agree that meat should be kept up at 1/- or 1/2 a lb. to the consumer.  I do not think that that was possible and most people knew that the fall would take place and that it was inevitable that the price of meat would come down to what it was pre-war.  There was no thought of anything like this so far as the then Executive Council was concerned. They signed a fixed, hard and fast agreement which, to-day, everybody, I think, no matter what the moral or legal obligation is, agrees should not have been made.  We are not making <Col N="1742" /> this case because we know that we have a definite legal case to make and because we know that there is a moral case to make and because we are absolutely satisfied that that sum of money cannot be met, just as they are satisfied across the water.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gorey yesterday spoke about 500,000 cattle having to be sold between this and November.  That is the case.  The figure would be in or about 400,000 or 500,000 but it would certainly be less than last year. These cattle, or a great portion of them, at least, have to be marketed&mdash; whatever portion of them is fat cattle undoubtedly have to be marketed&mdash;and that is one of the reasons why this measure was introduced so that we would have it to assist marketing that quantity of cattle.  It may, however, be that it will not be necessary to market that quantity of cattle.  We have, as I said last night, an enormous amount of hay in this country that will have no market&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We have very few fat cattle in this country.  The Dublin market would not have 100 such cattle at its best market.  The rest are common stores, and I do not suppose that I ever saw 100 fat cattle in the Dublin market at any time.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald, I understand, yesterday, in addition to talking about the I.R.A., spoke about certain steps the farmers were taking not to pay bank debts.  He said that some organisation was developed here with that avowed object.  I have not read of any organisation of that description nor have I heard of any such one.  I did hear of an organisation, which does not intend to repudiate debts, but which holds that it will pay the debts it can pay and that these debts should be reduced&mdash;I understand this is what they state&mdash;to the point at which they can be met.  That point brings us down to the whole situation that we have here.  We have not been able, for the last nine years, to meet any of the liabilities that were imposed on us, so far as land annuities or other payments were concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not been able to pay for goods purchased abroad.  Anyone who goes to the country and speaks to shopkeepers will be told quite plainly that they have enormous debts outstanding, and they have very little hope of recovering them, certainly not in the near future.  These people are being forced into the position that they cannot meet their debts to distributors here, or, perhaps, in England. That indicates definitely that we are not able, out of our agricultural production and out of our exports, to pay for what we are buying.  I hope <Col N="1744" /> that, as a result of the position we are in, we will be able to rectify that state of affairs.  If so, it will have brought salvation to this country.  I think Deputy Hogan stated that we could get a really good settlement now&mdash;a damn good settlement.</P>

      <P>There must be something very seriously wrong when you did not get the opportunity.  There was a good opportunity of making a bargain but the Party opposite did not make an attempt.  Any attempt that was made was a fiasco.  The attempts that were made have been the cause of all the misfortune and of the supposed crisis that exists now.  We have Lord Inskip and others trying to take all the advantage they can out of it. This is not an economic question!  It is a political question purely!  As far as we are concerned the question is an economic one.  We must be able to get a living in this country, but the debts we pay must be debts that we are definitely satisfied we owe, and not debts about which there is any doubt. That is the question at issue and the sooner the British nation and the British Government realise that position properly the better by taking the necessary steps to see that those debts are properly proved.  If they satisfy us in any suitable court that those debts are due they will be paid. If they do not take such steps then, as far as I am concerned, I certainly would not agree that these debts should be paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Galway): Deputy Gorey has handed me a note which in view of Deputy O'Reilly's speech I will read to the Dáil.  &ldquo;The farmers&mdash;ninety per cent. of them&mdash; are behind the Government, and are ready to pay tariffs, annuities, debts, subsidies, twenty-nine million pounds odd, plus two million pounds in the present Vote, plus British imposts, <Col N="1745" /> plus loss of goodwill, plus loss of preference and to fatten their cattle on O'Reilly's hay and get nothing back.&rdquo;  I think that is a fair statement of the Deputy's speech.  I did not intend to refer to Deputy O'Reilly. I must say that he talked with the authentic pose of the weakling, of the variety that you find in this country. When I listened to him, the amiable old gentleman, and the junior grade economics of Senator Connolly, I realised that that is the sort of information behind President de Valera.  They are his advisers.  I read <i>Who's Who</i> recently, and I found that Deputy O'Reilly was supposed to be an expert on agriculture, that he had a certain amount of expert knowledge of agriculture. When one realises that President de Valera&mdash;who knows nothing about the cattle trade, and literally nothing about any other business in the country&mdash;has to listen to Deputy O'Reilly on agriculture and to Senator Connolly's junior grade economics on the general economy of the country, I do not wonder we are in the present position.  I do not propose to follow that very far, nor do I propose to follow Deputy Flinn, who made an attempt to make a case for the Government last night.  I only want to say about Deputy Flinn that he is a humbug, he is a windbag, he is a cheap-jack who would sell any goods, Cumann na nGaedheal, Fianna Fail or Labour, provided he got into position.  I have more respect for Deputy Corry, far more respect.</P>

      <P>Would the President address himself to a few simple points which emerged from the debate and which are very relevant.  We were told by the President, and certainly by Senator Connolly, that the game of the British is clear.  He said that they want to put out the present Government and that they will then be able to make a settlement with some other Government, the other Government obviously being a Government from the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  Personally I do not think that is so with the British.  I will tell you why.  It <Col N="1746" /> would suit the British better to make a settlement with the present Government. I am not going to make any political point of this.  The Cumann na nGaedheal Party speaks for a certain section in the country and always did speak for it.  The present Government speaks for another section.  We have said our say.  We have made agreements.  We have delivered the goods so far as the British are concerned. It would suit the British Government better to make an agreement with the present Government.  I am not saying now whether they are right or wrong but, clearly in their opinion a settlement now would be more lasting in the sense that they would have got a new body of people here to make a settlement with.  The present Government would be speaking for a different class.  If I were in the inside counsels of the British Government, which, strange to say, I am not&mdash;but I can look on and I can use my commonsense&mdash;I say in my opinion it is perfectly obvious that it would suit the British Government better to make a settlement now than with another Government.  I have no doubt the British would like to see this Government out unless it makes an agreement, because to realise this, it is really in a crisis like this you talk truth to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not in the interests of the British Government that this quarrel should go on, and for that reason the British Government are anxious to make a settlement.  Equally for that reason, if you are unwilling to make any settlement, naturally the British Government wants to see you out.  I want the President to get down to the point&mdash;and the country should be told this&mdash;that in a great many matters the interests of the British and our interests are the same.  In this matter the interests of the British and our interests are the same.  It is the interests of the British to trade with us.  It is even of greater interest to us to trade with them and, at this stage, when we are entering into a quarrel that is going to have such serious effects, the country should be told that.  All the silly pseudo patriotic platitudes should be dropped, on the <Col N="1747" /> lines that anything that the British do not like is good business for us.  Their interests and our interests more or less mean the same thing.  Is that right&mdash; perfectly right?</P>
    <P>Of course it is right and perfectly right.  Why does not the President get his back-Benchers down to the country to tell the people that?  Then if that is right why raise up the green flag to fight England, leaving the people to the assumption that a fight with England is always good business for Ireland?  The question for this country is not whether this economic war would injure England.  The question is what are our best interests in this doubtedly our best interests in this matter are to end this quarrel.  Put it in that way and it does not matter what the British think.  Everyone knows without being in the pay of the British Government that the British Government wants to trade with this country.  That is the very thing that the President should appreciate in this matter.  There was a reference to Sir Thomas Inskip, the British Attorney-General. His pronouncements are important because he is a member of the British Government and the British Government are used to negotiate.  The British Government could buy and sell the best of us.  They have been a long time in the job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the President losing his temper?  They did not buy us in the sense that he means.  He knows what I mean.  The British Government are efficient and disciplined, which, unfortunately, we are not.  They know how to get things done, and when Sir Thomas Inskip speaks he is to be taken seriously.  Sir Thomas Inskip has made a statement which, if the President likes to make use of, as a basis of business, he can make good use of.  I am not one of those who think that you are going to make any use of that statement to get £5,000,000.  I am not one of those who think that you are going to get anything like £5,000,000 under any circumstances.  I am not one of those who think that there is <Col N="1748" /> anything soft for any country in the present situation.</P>
      <P>I think we are in the same position as individuals in each country.  There is no soft living, there is no soft money anywhere.  I do not think at all myself that there is anything like £5,000,000 going to be got.  I do not think Sir Thomas Inskip said there was.  I think we would be foolish to count too far in that direction, but I do think that a settlement of this dispute could be made if you drop political humbug.  Perhaps I should not say political humbug.  Perhaps the President thinks it is not political humbug. Perhaps he thinks it is a fight.  Very well, if he does let him tell the country that.  Let him tell the country &ldquo;I will not settle this question of the land annuities on the basis of this money. I must have a settlement of the Oath question.  I must have my views of the Treaty accepted by the British.  We have to gain concessions.&rdquo;  Let him tell the country that.  Let the country face up to that issue knowing what it is they are facing up to.  If the country is willing to face up to that issue; if it is willing to look to France for markets for its butter, for its eggs, its bacon and its strippers let it do it. That is not what he is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The country is asked to go into this quarrel on the basis that it is purely a quarrel about money, whereas everybody knows that the quarrel is on a totally different issue and on a totally different basis.  That is what I complain of.  The country is being deceived and I want to tell the President then whether he agrees with our point of view or not, the mere fact that it is in the English interest to settle this quarrel does not preclude the truth of what I have to say now, and that it is that it is in our interests also.  I say that whether he agrees with it or not. We say that in the present situation it is perfectly clear from the attitude of the other side, namely, the British, that if the President confines himself to the financial side he can get a settlement, but if he insists on introducing political matters which the British regard as very much higher political issues he cannot get a settlement. Let him deny that if he wishes. <Col N="1749" /> Let him say that he represents people in this country who must have concessions; that it is absolutely essential to establish a republic here; but if he wants to do that he should let the country know that that is the issue and that that is what he is doing.</P>
    <P>We are told that in any event at the present moment the farmers of the country are unable to pay this money and that for the last nine years they have made no money.  We are told that the British markets are worthless to them.  We are told that there were no profits in selling cattle or in selling any agricultural produce on that market. We are told that this economic war is a blessing in disguise.  We are asked why if a settlement can be made now did not the Cumann na nGaedheal Government make it?  I will tell the President why.  What settlement were we supposed to make?  A settlement under which we meant to hold the annuities?  We made an exact opposite settlement.  We made an agreement under which we were to pay the annuities. That was the agreement we made. Start with that.  We made that agreement in consideration of this country being relieved from a share in the British war debt, in the United Kingdom war debt.  That is the settlement we made.  We put this country in 1926 in a position in which no European country was put.  This country had been committed to the Great War by at least as good an Irishman as the man who now leads the majority Party in this State.  He was at least as good a man as that.  This country in 1926 was relieved of all liability for the war debt and all liability in respect of the British National Debt.  In consideration of that we agreed to pay the annuities. It was a first-class bargain and there is no question of doubt whatever about it.  If it was not a first-class bargain, then what have we to say of the position of every other country in the world?  Every country in Europe, and not only France, Germany and England, but all the countries that kept their territorial integrity after the Great War, have their war debts.  All the countries such as Czecho-Slovaki, Jugo-Slavia, and all the new countries that emerged <Col N="1750" /> after the Great War, had every single one of them to take over a share of the national debt which was owing by the countries of which they came.</P>
    <P>We put this country in a different position.  If there is any tendency to smile at that proposition now and it is countenanced to-day in any way, I want to tell the President that so far as that is genuine it is due to the belief in this country that we are a soft people and incapable of standing up to the strain and the stress that other people have to stand up to.  We could never make a bargain like first-class countries; we can never be a first-class country unless we are prepared in open competition in the world to shoulder the burdens of independence and liberty.  We must be prepared to do that and if there is any tendency now to smile at that, that tendency is decadent.  But why go back on it?  We got so much; and now it is clear that the present Government are in a position to get a bit more. They are in a position to get a little bit more because there is no doubt about it in order to gain the goodwill of the electorate for whom the Deputies on the opposite side speak, the British Government would be prepared to give certain concessions.  The whole question is now whether the President is willing to accept that genuinely and to try to obtain these concessions or whether he tries to make it impossible to obtain these concessions by raising other difficulties apart altogether from the issues which have any interest for the farmer, the labourer, or for the trade of this country.  We are told that at the moment the farmers are unable to pay.  Deputy O'Reilly stated that the farmers were unable to make a profit out of their agricultural exports for the last ten years.  I think it was Deputy Cleary who said that the present Government took over a legacy of arrears of land purchase annuities.</P>
    <P>We are told that the present situation is the fault of the last Government. I am exactly of the same opinion to-day as I was before the election with regard to the land annuities. I am entirely convinced that there is no legal case; that whether or <Col N="1751" /> not there is a legal case is a consideration that does not enter into British calculations.  That there is no legal case, I am quite convinced.  Further, I am entirely convinced that if the President persists on his present line of keeping up the pretence that there is a legal case, he is in the position of a client who might come to me as a solicitor and who might say: &ldquo;I got a certain sum of money and I agreed to repay it.  I signed an agreement to that effect.  There is no question that the agreement was signed to that effect, but I believe the agreement is faulty in law and I want to get out of it.&rdquo;  His position is exactly similar to that if he pursues his present line of policy.  My answer to a client who would make that case to me would be the answer of any honest man or any Britisher.  My answer would be: &ldquo;If there is a legal flaw in the agreement, far from it being your right to take advantage of it, it is your duty to mend it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Government adopt that basis there is no hope.  On that basis, this country will be put in the position of endeavouring to bring off a piece of sharp practice.  I do not care what the President says.  I believe the lawyers have done their job.  They have confused the electorate and that was what they were meant to do.  I believe the President knows very well there is no legal case.  I believe that is the reason he tacks on to this legal case what he calls a moral case.  He refers to the way the landlords got their land.  The history of British confiscation in this country has nothing whatever to do with the legalities or the moralities so far as they exist at the present day.  The farmers are in arrears now.  The big percentage of the farmers are in arrears and are in a very bad position financially.  Who is to blame?</P>

I say it is nothing short of the most arrant <Col N="1752" /> humbug, cant, and hypocrisy for Deputies on the opposite benches to deny what everybody knows&mdash;that at every cross-roads in the country they told the farmers: &ldquo;Vote for us and you will not have to pay your annuities.&rdquo; I heard that half-a-dozen times and there is not a Deputy on these benches who did not hear it.</P>

      <P>Denials after the event will not save the situation.  In the face of that it is nothing short of sancti-monious and almost nauseating cant for the President to advise us the other day to practise the simple virtues and pay our way.  Our policy for the last ten years could be summed up in the one sentence: &ldquo;Work hard and pay your way.&rdquo;  So far as the Fianna Fáil propaganda got&mdash;it is the most damnable propaganda and it will take centuries for the country to recover from it&mdash;to the electorate, it ended up in one thing&mdash;&ldquo;Do not work and do not pay&rdquo;.  The election took place last March and immediately after the election a very significant thing occurred in my constituency.  I am a solicitor and a farmer.  I was Minister for Agriculture and I knew what was happening in the country.  In my constituency, after the election, Civil Bills were issued wholesale for arrears of land purchase annuities.  Out of every 100 Civil Bills issued, at least 99 of them went to the people who supported this Government.</P>

      <P>Sit down.  Personally, I would prefer the attitude adopted by the Deputies who told the farmers that at the cross-roads than I would the attitude adopted by President de Valera. I much prefer the man who throws the balls than the man who makes them. The President makes the balls.  That is his line since 1922 and I am a close observer of his career.  President de Valera knew perfectly well that even his own statements could be interpreted in no other way than that the farmers need not pay.  He is a fair judge of politics and a fair judge of psychology&mdash;he has proved that&mdash;and he knew perfectly well when he told the people &ldquo;We will not transfer the annuities to the British; we will give them back to you in the shape of relief of rates, etc.,&rdquo; that the hard-headed farmers interpreted it only in this way:&mdash;Once you withhold these annuities from the British there is absolutely no case for collecting them from us.  He knew his own statement would be interpreted in that way, but in order to make it absolutely certain he allowed practically every member of his Party to declare expressly to the farmers that they need not pay the annuities. That is the difficulty we are in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no case on the land annuities. Every time I addressed myself to this question before the election I always made the point that we could make a case&mdash;it is the case he is making now, so far as he can make any <Col N="1754" /> case, and that is the case with which the British will deal&mdash;that there has been over-taxation of this country. The case could be made that the country is unable to pay and that there has been over-taxation of the country. If you can get the British to agree on that&mdash;and it looks as if they would agree on that&mdash;there is no difficulty in getting them to agree to liquidate whatever debt there may be by taking over a liability for a certain share of the land purchase annuities.  That would be an honest course and it would be consistent with the high national tradition of this country.  But that course was not adopted.  They very discreditable course was taken that has landed us in our present difficulties. The course was taken that will probably land a big proportion of the farmers in financial difficulties.  Already it has landed some of them in financial difficulties.  It is untrue to say that farming did not pay during the last nine years.</P>
    <P>Farming, of course, did not pay as well after the war as during the war. Farming did not pay as well in 1926 as in 1924.  It did not pay as well in 1930 as in 1926.  It paid worse in 1931 than in 1930.  But if there was a fall in prices here, there was a similar, or even greater fall in other countries. Some farmers had built up a certain amount of reserves during the war. There were many small farmers with their own labour making a bit of money up to 1929 and 1930 who were in a position to face the really bad years that looked like coming in 1930 and 1931, but they were to a certain extent demoralised.  In other countries, such as England and France, which are the two notable countries, you had all parties trying to keep the people honest and at work; trying to get the people to pay their debts as they accrued due, knowing perfectly well that it was a bad policy to put them off; that money would become more scarce and more valuable later on.  You had all parties in these countries endeavouring to do that.  The one notable exception was this country. The attitude of the Party opposite was undoubtedly a wrecking attitude.  Their attitude was to demoralise the country, <Col N="1755" /> to endeavour to prevent the people from paying their debts, to endeavour to prevent them from working.  If there is at present the very serious financial situation in this country, it is a legacy not of the last Government, but of the damnable propaganda that was carried on by Fianna Fáil under the patronage, and with the consent of President de Valera during the last four or five years.</P>
    <P>Let us leave that behind us, however. Let us come back to the present quarrel and face up to it.  Is it not perfectly clear that you can make a settlement?  I think it is.  I think there is nothing more clear in the situation.  For the moment, blame us, say we are traitors and failed to make it the last time.  Take that line.  We will accept that rôle.  Brand us in that way and finish with it.  You are the Government now.  It is perfectly clear you can make a settlement.  Why not make it?  Why should the country be asked to suffer all these sacrifices.  For what?  The country should know it. Here we are now with an Estimate for two millions to meet the present emergency and we are not told how it is to be spent.  When we ask how it is going to be spent we can get no answer.  We are told it is to find new markets.  Even Deputy O'Reilly realises that no new markets can be found that will absorb like one-tenth of our agricultural produce.  We are told it is to be used to build up new industries. Is it not perfectly clear that the Executive Council have no plans? They have rushed us into what they call this economic war without any plans.  Has the President any prospect of finding any alternative markets?  Do not get away with the line that it is a shocking state of affairs that there are no alternative markets.  Will he tell the country that there is any prospect whatever of any other alternative market, either here or abroad, during the next five or six years?  If there is not, what are we going to do with the £30,000,000 export able surplus?  He ought to address himself to that.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs <Col N="1756" /> tells us that we will win the fight if the people do not let the Government down.  What does that mean?  This is an economic war. Who are the soldiers?  The farmers, traders, shopkeepers and labourers. They are in the front line trenches. They are doing the fighting this time.  If they do not let the politicians down we are going to win the fight.  What is the meaning of that?  They are thrown into this fight without any plans, without any ammunition, without any help, without any prospect of success. This two millions is not ammunition. The loss to the country will run into twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty millions. They are thrown into the fight in that way, without any plans; into a fight that, if it continues, is absolutely hopeless from their point of view.  Then, they are told that if they do not stand the massacre they will be letting down the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  What is the meaning of the whole thing?  Does the President want to settle?  I put this to him: Even assuming he has a legal case&mdash;he will agree that it is doubtful&mdash;there are two sides to it.  Suppose any business man consults a solicitor on a case which is doubtful.  If the solicitor knows that while the litigation is going on the man is going to suffer tremendous financial loss on a very doubtful issue, what advice should he give him?  I want to put this straight to the President. If he is the sort of man who wants to shelter behind the verdict of some judge and come back to his client afterwards and say: &ldquo;What more could I do?  The judgment went against us,&rdquo; he will tell him to go on.  If he has the real interests of his client at heart he will tell him to settle if he can get a fair settlement. Is not that the present position?</P>
    <P>If the President forgets his own reputation, forgets the impossible commitments he has made; if he thinks of the real interests of the country at this moment; a country that is bound to suffer, and that cannot win this war in the long run, even if he gets all the annuities, because the loss would be <Col N="1757" /> too great; if he thinks of the nation as made up of farmers, labourers and people of one kind or another, all trying to carry on and pay their way&mdash; if he thinks in that way there can be no doubt whatever that his duty is quite clear. Let him forget all the decadents and neurotics, all the work-shys, who cheer him at Dun Laoghaire because he has not settled, who do not want a settlement, who believe in failure, who want the political and economic agitation to go on for ever until this unfortunate country is bled white.  There are many of them in this country, though they would not admit it.  Let him forget them.  Let him remember the example we gave them when we negotiated with the British. We could have thought also of who would meet us at Dun Laoghaire.  We could have thought of your propaganda outside.  We could have thought that we would be put in the wrong by every organisation which was hostile to us; that it would be pointed out that we surrendered to the British; that we made an agreement; that we were seduced by hospitality or by rubbing shoulders with people in silk hats.  We could have thought of all that.  We could have earned the plaudits of the neurotics who travel from Dun Laoghaire to the gallery of this House occasionally.  We could have done all that.  We could have funked it but we did not do it.  We got good solid advantages for the country.  We took responsibility for getting them and stood up to the criticism.  We brought the country forward and we made not only a State of it, but we made a nation of it by what we did&mdash;for the first time a homogeneous nation.  You quote Tone.  I do not think an awful lot about Tone.  I often heard the quotation &ldquo;Not Protestant or Catholic but Irishmen.&rdquo;  That is what we did in this country, and we were the first to do it.  We went very nearly making &mdash;I was going to say a nation of the country.  Do not undo all that work. You can make a settlement now.  If you think more of your duty to the people who work hard, and less of your own reputation, less of your commitments, if you forget the idea that English interests are always opposed to Irish interests and <i>vice versa,</i> if you <Col N="1758" /> take advantage of the fact that the English are anxious to settle, a good settlement can be made.  I do not say that five millions can be obtained, but the possibility is there and it should be explored.  Then you can go to the country with added prestige.  You will get a big prestige and a big satisfaction in the country for making such a settlement, for saving the country a big sum of money in bad times.  Do not mind who are responsible for them or what is causing them.  You can go to the country after that.  If you do that this country can progress in the only way in which any country can progress.  It can progress in peace and harmony towards whatever goal the majority of the people want it to proceed to.</P>

      <P>I do not suppose that any member of the House is going to vote against this Emergency Fund grant but we are all anxious to hear from the President what he is going to do with this £2,000,000.  Deputy Hogan spoke of the President making balls for his back benches to fire.  I want to suggest that in the making and the firing of the balls it is the common people of the country who are going to suffer.  It would appear to any casual observer in this country that the ordinary working class people have not been taken into consideration in what I can only look upon as a war of attrition between the two countries. Has the President got a mandate from the ordinary working class people?  I do not refer to the work-shys although I do know they form the vast majority of his followers in the cities and the country.  The work-shys and the ne'er-do-wells form the vast majority of his followers, particularly in the cities.  I recollect in my school days reading of Pandora's box, from which, when it flew open, everything flew out except hope.  To-day I think in President de Valera's box even hope has nearly gone.  What are we going to offer the people of this country in this war of attrition between this country and England?  I again put the question: who are to suffer in this war of attrition but the common people of the country and many of these people are not making themselves vocal to-day.  I <Col N="1759" /> do hope they will make themselves vocal to-day.  The people never gave the President a mandate to make the people endure, to endure more than what they have already suffered.</P>
      <P>I ask is it the function only of our people to suffer and endure?  Enduring and suffering have been the lot of the Irish people for many years.  I, representing a city which gave birth to Terence MacSwiney, have regard for endurance and suffering when it is done in a good cause but I do feel that this generation of Irishmen and women have suffered quite enough and that they should not be called upon to endure and suffer further.  I listened carefully to the rather laboured address of Deputy O'Reilly here to-day for over an hour, and if his arguments are the arguments of his Party, if this is the policy which his Government proposes to adopt and which it is adopting, then I say in all sincerity, &ldquo;May God save Ireland.&rdquo;  I look upon this vote as a war chest if you like and I am wondering how long it will be before the President comes back to the House again and asks us to give him another two million on account. Again, I would ask the President where is all this money to come from.  The ordinary working class people will be taxed on their tea, their sugar and everything that enters into the life of the working class.  Almost every commodity will be taxed in order to gratify the ambitions and to satisfy the spites and the malice of some important, if rather malignant, people in this country. I am personally aware that it is because of the spite and the malice of some people who wield a very definite interest in this country and are the strongest supporters of President de Valera to-day.  Is that the lesson we have been taught during the Eucharistic week?  Is that the true Christian spirit which we are all taught to regard as something to be aimed at?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I state here very specifically and openly that much of this agitation is the product of the malice and spite of certain individuals in this country, who wield a very bad and insidious influence in the Councils of State at the present moment.  I have no hesitation <Col N="1760" /> in making that statement. Some of them were conscripted by Britain and because of that this country is going to be thrown into the maelstrom of an economic war with Great Britain.  Are we going to be sacrificed because of the hatred and malice of these people?  Is it because there are people on the Front Bench who have a grudge against the late Minister for Finance because, forsooth, he did not treat them courteously when they went to visit him?  Is it because of this the honest working class of this country are going to be made suffer?  I would ask the President to give us some information as to how he proposes to wage this economic war with England.</P>
    <P>It might, perhaps, be illuminating if I related just one incident that occurred to me within the last two or three weeks.  In speaking of the present economic position brought about by the breakdown in the negotiations. I heard a gentleman say that now we would have plenty of cheap food for the people.  That doctrine has been preached by members of Fianna Fáil at all the crossroads of the country. I am told that potatoes can be bought at 4d. per 28lbs., fat hoggets at 20/-each, young pigs at 10/- or 12/- each. And we are going to have plenty of good food cheaply!  I put myself in the position of John Farmer, or to be quite up-to-date, Seán Farmer.  I ask myself how long do these people think that I, Seán Farmer, am going to produce pigs, sheep and cows and give it to them well under the cost of production?  I ask any Deputy here is it not his experience that that mentality is abroad in the country, fostered by Fianna Fáil Deputies at the crossroads?  I want to ask them to be honest with the people, if it would not be asking too much, and to let the people know where they stand in this matter.  Is Seán Farmer going to continue to produce for Seán Citizen bacon, beef, pork, eggs, etc., under the cost of production?  I want to know what the reaction of Seán Farmer will be, unless, of course, we use compulsion, or that blessed word coercion, which was so much abhorred by the present Government when they <Col N="1761" /> were in Opposition?  Unless Sean Farmer is coerced to produce foodstuffs for our people and to give them foodstuffs under the cost of production, what is going to happen the people of the country?</P>
    <P>We are told that we have plenty of beef, mutton, pork and so on.  But is not the natural reaction to the state of affairs I have related that Seán Farmer is going to go into business for himself and himself only.  He will produce what will satisfy his own wants and needs and no more.  In this war of attrition, I ask President de Valera to weigh up seriously all the consequences and not have so much regard for the cheering, thoughtless multitude.  The farmer was told that he need not pay any annuities.  Then he was told that he should pay the annuities but that they would be kept in this country and used for the purpose of full de-rating.  I feel that the doctrines preached in this regard will have a very bad, lasting effect on political morality here.  They will make it impossible for any future Government to govern or to recover these annuities. I suggest, more ironically than seriously, that Fianna Fáil instead of having as its motto &ldquo;Do not pay the land annuities&rdquo; should choose the motto &ldquo;Do not pay anybody.&rdquo;  There is more morality behind that than there is behind the cry of &ldquo;Do not pay the land annuities.&rdquo;  The ordinary citizen can make just as good a case as the farmer for not paying his rent. It must be the experience of many Deputies that their incomes have decreased within the last ten or fifteen years.  I know that that is so in my own case.  I could make a very good case for the non-payment of my rent and the non-payment of my debts&mdash;the same case as can be made for the farmer.  Many other people could show that their revenue has been decreasing within the last few years and they could urge that that connotes bad times, reduced purchasing power and all the other things that have been mentioned.  That argument could be used in favour of Seán Citizen.  I suggest very seriously&mdash;not ironically this time&mdash;to Fianna Fáil that they should go the whole hog for a wiping out of <Col N="1762" /> debts all round.  I believe that would be a very good thing.  Let us have a clean slate all round.  I should like to go back with a message of hope&mdash; perhaps it would be suggested that it comes out of Pandora's box&mdash;to those citizens of Cork who owe a few pounds and to tell them that we have a new morality, that they have as good a case for not paying their ground rents, their butcher or their baker or their candlestick maker as can be made for the farmers.  I stated before in this House that there is no man in this country who cannot claim, through blood ties or otherwise, relationship with the farmer.  We are all sprung from the farming stock.  It is only human to accept the line of least resistance. It is a very attractive doctrine, especially at a time of economic stress, to place before the farmer, that he need not pay the moiety of his land annuities.  That moiety may be represented by a sum of £10, £20 or £30. Any of us who has even a slight acquaintance with farm life knows that that sum can be put to very practical use.  It is only human to be attracted by the doctrine that one should put £20 or £30 in his pocket and devote it to some other use than the discharge of what is, after all, an honourable debt.  I do not like to misquote the President, but I remember reading, before the 1926 negotiations were opened, where President de Valera stated that this country would not get out of its commitments to Britain under £19,000,000 per year.</P>

      <P>If it is, it should have been contradicted in the Press.  The plenipotentiaries or ambassadors from this country settled for a sum of £5,000,000.  Somebody said it was a damn good bargain.  Personally I believe it was a good bargain.  We cannot have it both ways.  Our people rejected the 1920 Act, under which we were to be relieved of the land annuities and placed in the same position as Northern Ireland.  President de Valera wants to get all the fat out of the 1920 Act, and, at the same time, to get the advantage of the ultimate financial agreement.  I think that that is not <Col N="1763" /> playing the game with the people of this country.  The ordinary working class people who will be the greatest sufferers in this war of attrition should be told plainly what they are up against.  They are told, in rather vague and general terms, that they will have to tighten their belts and adopt the policy of the hair shirt.  The policy of the hair shirt is already in operation amongst our unemployed, but the number of people who will have to wear hair shirts in the near future will be multiplied very considerably.</P>

      <P>I have suggested, on more than one occasion, that it would be well for all of us to get down to the realities of the situation.  This vote of £2,000,000 means £2,000,000 of extra taxation on the country.  I am not opposing it.  The thing has gone so far now that we will have to give the Government plenty of rein.  If I were to oppose this, I believe I would not be acting in the best interests of my constituents, or in the best interests of the State.  But I ask the President to take the people into his confidence.  Let us know how he proposes to spend this £2,000,000.  Does he propose to build up institutions for the housing of our people on a huge, communal scale? Does he propose to imitate the systems that are in operation in Russia?  These are things which are agitating the people.  There is considerable unrest and anxiety, and the President and his Party have done nothing to allay that unrest and anxiety.  Who suffers as a result of this condition of affairs?  The ordinary working class people of the State.  The people are patient.  We all admire the patience and endurance of the poor of this country.  The one thing that keeps our people in subjection to-day is their faith.  It cannot be denied that if any other people were faced with the misery and poverty that our people are told from the Government Benches they will have to face, they would not accept the position with such patience and with such humility as the Irish people are accepting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How long does the President think our people will continue to endure and suffer?  The breaking point may be <Col N="1764" /> reached at any minute.  And there are signs and indications all over the country that the breaking point is very near.  We are aware that we have a growing population in Ireland for the last few years, not because of any great patriotism, or love for Ireland, as some people would like to translate it, but because Uncle Sam has cut the quota of emigration allowed into his own country.  That is what has caused the increased population in this country.  We will have, possibly, at the next general election 90,000 or 100,000 extra people in this country for whom little or no employment can be found.  We will have an extra 100,000 people, in this economy programme outlined by President de Valera, to be dealt with.  You have in addition the number of people who have been referred to as &ldquo;work shys.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is the practice in this country, nowadays, to be misquoted.  We are misquoted in the Press.  We are being told that we are acting an anti-Irish part in this crisis.  If one does not go all the way with this Government he is told he is anti-Irish.  Not only are you told you are anti-Irish but you are told you are other things much worse.  The Government should take notice of the fact that snowball resolutions are published in the Press, passing from public bodies in one county to another, suggesting, that not only should we support the Government in their economic proposals, but that we will be shot if we do not, because that is what it means.  Were it not for the fact that there is in this country more moral cowardice than in any other country in the world these statements would not be allowed to appear by the Minister for Justice.  I charge the Minister for Justice with not doing his duty because he is afraid to do it.  We know that the power behind President de Valera is not represented by the most influential men and women in this country, but that it is made up of the potential robber and bank robber and everything that is bad and evil in our people, constantly playing up to the cupidity of our people, making speeches inflaming the passions of <Col N="1765" /> some of our young men and some of our old men as well.  I want to suggest, very seriously, to this House, and I am not afraid to say it here or in Cork City which I have the honour to represent, that there is more moral cowardice in this country than in any other country in the world.</P>
    <P>It may be President de Valera's ambition to make a second Mexico of this country, but if he does he will reap the whirlwind.  I charge the President that he is not exercising the influence that he should exercise.  He has a Bench of Ministers some of whom are as irresponsible people as ever sat on any Front Bench in any Parliament in the world.  We have the Minister for Defence, who, instead of telling the Army that they are the servants of the people tells them that they are being kept for one purpose only&mdash;to achieve the full freedom of Ireland.  I want to tell the Minister for Defence, and every other Minister on the Government Bench&mdash;and especially those, at any rate, who come from the North and frequently express the hope that there should be unity between North and South&mdash;that the people who most accentuate that dividing line between North and South are the people sitting on the Government Front Bench.  These people, who, as I have said, are actuated by spite and by malice, are now not satisfied with having a border between Northern and Southern Ireland, but they are actually attempting to estrange from us our best customer, next door to us.  Does anyone think for a moment that, in this war of attrition, we are going to come out on top?  Some people say it is patriotic to shout&mdash;but I never understood their mentality&mdash;&ldquo;My country, right or wrong.&rdquo;  Up to a point it is good, but I tell my fellow-countrymen that public men and others are fully satisfied that the danger that besets the path of the present Government and of our people is the absence of the higher tradition of Irish nationality and patriotism.</P>
    <P>I have asked the President to give some indication of the way he proposes to spend this money.  We have no information whatever on that point. <Col N="1766" /> He has not told us that he wants to erect large institutions in which the people may live, with communal kitchens, and other things, that exist in a Communist State like Russia.  It may be that he is going to raise a third army. A third army, I think, has been evisaged by the present Minister for Defence.  A third army, in this small country, must be wanted to act as a kind of buffer between our National Army and an army outside.  If the President told us we were going to spend this £2,000,000 in a way such as providing food for our people and accommodation for those thrown out of work because they cannot pay their way, I would be very pleased to support this Estimate.  I am supporting this Estimate, but I would have more confidence in the President, and in some of his Ministers, if he told us what he proposed to do with it.  That is the position in the cities and in the towns.  It is a position of uncertainty and unrest and I ask the President, in his reply, to show the manner in which he proposes to allay that unrest and uncertainty.</P>

      <P>During a previous debate in this House Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald insinuated that on the question of our right to retain the land annuities it was my view that we had no legal case.  Last Sunday in the country he made a much more definite statement when he said that it definitely was my view that we had no legal right to retain the land annuities.  I have not had any personal conversation with Deputy Fitzgerald or any communication with him for the past six years.  How, in view of that fact, he purports to be able to get my views, on a matter of this kind, passes my comprehension, except, of course, that Deputy Fitzgerald adds the faculty of telepathy to the many other extraordinary qualifications for which he imagines he holds certificates.  I want to say very definitely&mdash;and Deputy Fitzgerald can read this in the Official Report&mdash;that I believe we have a strong case and legal ground for the retention of the land annuities.  I believe we have a strong case also for the retention of many other of those <Col N="1767" /> payments that we make to Britain. When I say on legal grounds I believe that on moral grounds, historical grounds and grounds of equity there is no answer to our claim to retain all these disputed moneys.  I go further than that.  Deputy Gorey last night talked about the plight of the farmer and the bad condition in which he is placed not merely in connection with this crisis but the position in which the farmer found himself for some time past.</P>
      <P>As a matter of political faith I claim that just as I believe the first charge on industry is the maintenance of a standard of decent livelihood for the people engaged in industry, so I say also that the first charge on the land in this country is the right of the farmer to maintain a decent standard of living for himself and his children.</P>
      <P>No State and no bondholder has any right to extract from the farmers annuities which can only be paid at the price of the farmer sacrificing his standard of life and at the price of seeing his family starve.  The State should recognise the fact that it has no moral right to squeeze out of the farmer annuities which, in existing circumstances, he is unable to pay. He can only pay these annuities at the price of sacrificing his standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Estimate, the Government seeks power to spend £2,000,000 for the purpose of dealing with the present emergency.  With me, the problem is not so much one of giving them power to spend the £2,000,000.  My only doubt is, will they use that power adequately and will they, with that sum of money, be able to defend the nation in the existing crisis? Yesterday, President de Valera and the other Ministers who spoke after him, and the other members of the Fianna Fáil Party who spoke, talked rather vaguely and rather airily about what it is necessary to do in this crisis. But there was a complete absence of detail.  There was a complete absence of decisive policy.  There was a complete absence of any kind of a concrete plan for dealing with the present <Col N="1768" /> emergency.  What I want to ask is this:&mdash;What are they going to do in this crisis?  What are they doing in this crisis?  What do they propose to do in order to organise the nation to meet this crisis?</P>

      <P>I will concede that this Government has done things since it came into office which, if Cumann na nGaedheal were in office for 100 years, it would never have done.  I will concede that this Government has done many things that have given a ray of hope to the people, but I want to ask some member of the Government Front Bench where exactly the Government stands in this crisis?  Is it going to give the road to the bolstering up of capitalism?  Is it its policy to repair this rent or that rent in the fabric of the system of capitalism which may break down during this crisis?  Or is it going to evolve some kind of a new social policy which will give to all our people that decent standard of life which is the God-given heritage of all our people?  If it is going to give the road to trying to patch the rents in the capitalist system, then the future of the people of this country is going to be a bleak one indeed. The capitalist system will never stand the shock of this crisis or the rocks that are bound to confront it in this crisis.  Does the Government realise the havoc which capitalism in every country in the world is wreaking upon the peoples of these countries to-day?  According to Deputy Good, the champion of capitalism, it is the only method by which the people can pass to prosperity.  In the world to-day we have 25,000,000 white men and women unemployed under a capitalist system of Government.  That is the same kind of system which, I am afraid, the Executive Council are going to rely on to save the nation in this crisis.  This nation will never be saved by reliance upon capitalism.  During the past ten years, capitalism, plus the blunders of Cumann na nGaedheal, have given us an unemployment problem of 80,000 unemployed in this <Col N="1769" /> State.  Capitalism, plus Cumann na nGaedheal has resulted in the export of a quarter of a million of the cream of our manhood and womanhood to other lands.  Capitalism, even plus Fianna Fáil, will yield the same miserable and disappointing results.</P>

      <P>Look at what capitalism has done all over the world to-day.  An unemployment problem confronts the world of such a magnitude as has never been known in living memory.  Look on every country in the world to-day rocking under the capitalist system.  Roumania is unable to pay its civil servants or to feed its lepers, who broke out of a leper institution recently because of the lack of food with which to feed them. In Jugo-Slavia the cattle were turned out on the roads to fend for themselves. Across in America, a country that can produce all that is necessary for decent human existence every five months of the year, there is an unemployment problem which is described by the American Federation of Labour as extending to 10,500,000. That is the kind of evil that capitalism has wrought in the world in this generation.  Is that the kind of system which the President is relying on to save the country in this crisis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gorey talked last night, and in many respects he talked quite sensibly, on the necessity for doing something in this crisis.  I agree that something must be done in this crisis, not merely for the working class people in the cities and towns and villages of the country, but also for the farmers and especially for the small farmers, in order to assist them to meet and defeat this menace.  This is not merely a temporary crisis.  It has existed for the past ten years and will continue to exist under capitalism&mdash;this permanent crisis of involuntary idleness.  This is no mere temporary crisis in this country.  We have the permanent crisis of the continuous poverty of the poor people&mdash; the crisis of 80,000 unemployed men and women.  If the Government are <Col N="1770" /> serious in their attempt to defend the nation and to equip it to defend itself, they must look upon this not merely as a temporary crisis but as another flaw in a social structure which has brought about the present crisis and which has given us the permanent crisis of 80,000 unemployed men and women.  What is to be the hope for these people in this crisis? I am greatly afraid that in the attempt to grapple with this temporary crisis the permanent crisis is being overlooked.  I am greatly afraid that the Executive Council have not envisaged in any big and comprehensive way the necessity for dealing, not merely with the existing crisis, but with the big problem of keeping our people on the land and putting them into productive employment.  That must be done, no matter what the cost, because there is nothing more costly than keeping in involuntary idleness 80,000 people drawing from the pool of productivity while they are contributing nothing themselves to that pool.  What is the hope for these people in this crisis?  I see too much in the recent tariff orders of a mentality which is dealing with an existing problem, but not dealing with a bigger problem and a wider one.  This crisis is only part of the bigger and the wider problem.</P>
    <P>What the Executive Council has got to do to-day is to face up to the necessity of giving every man and woman in this country the opportunity to earn a decent livelihood in their own land.  Our country is capable of giving all our people a decent standard of livelihood.  The capacity of the Government will be judged by their ability to use this crisis as an opportunity to provide our people with a decent standard of living, and to use it to create, in this country, an economic and social system which will recognise that our chief assets are our human beings, our men and women, and that, no matter what else suffers, a decent standard of livelihood must be provided, as a matter of national guarantee, to every man, woman and child who is prepared <Col N="1771" /> to enrich the nation by operating on the resources of the nation.</P>

      <P>We have listened to a very bombastic and very empty speech from Deputy Norton, but there were certain phrases in that speech which would be very significant indeed, if Deputy Norton and his Party counted in any way in the councils of this nation.  The Labour Party, however, has been reduced, under its present leadership, to such a state of complete impotence that really what Deputy Norton says, or thinks, does not seem to me to be of very much account.  In consequence, I do not intend to deal with his speech at any length, but I will just point out, that even from Deputy Norton, the doctrine which he promulgated, that there was no moral right in this Government, the British Government or any other Government to demand the payment of the land annuities, is a very dangerous doctrine.  It is a doctrine which, if it is preached in this country&mdash; preached by somebody who counts&mdash; will have very serious results.  I might point out to Deputy Norton that the doctrine which he is preaching, that the Government have no moral right to collect the land annuities, is a doctrine which, at any rate, up to this, the leaders of the Fianna Fáil Party have not preached.  We have heard, in this discussion, a considerable amount of talk about this crisis in which the country is now involved. We have heard a great deal of discussion about the payment of land annuities, and how they should go, but I would like to point out what is the issue now between the British Government and the Government here. Certainly from the Government benches, we have heard nothing which would lead us to believe that the Government or their followers, at least, were, in any way, aware of what is the point at issue now between this Government and the British Government or what this fighting is about, why this tax had been placed on our cattle and on our other agricultural produce going into England <Col N="1772" /> or why these extraordinary and unprecedented powers are sought by the administration of this country.</P>
      <P>There is no question at issue now as to whether the land annuities are to be retained permanently in this country or whether they are to be paid into the Land Purchase Fund to discharge the interest on the land stock. That is not the question at issue at all and it has nothing to do with the question at issue.  The question at issue is not who has a right to the land annuities; into which Exchequer, or in what fashion, they should be paid.  It is simply this, where one particular half-yearly payment of the annuities is to be placed temporarily, and before what tribunal is the question of the ultimate destination of the money collected in the form of land annuities to be decided.  That is the sole question at issue.  There is no question now as to who owns the land annuities, or whether they should be paid into the Land Purchase Fund or into the Central Fund here.  That has not been reached.  The whole of this fight is about a preliminary and let us deal, for a moment, with that preliminary.  Members of the Executive Council very seldom speak, and, therefore, when we had a speech yesterday from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on this question, I sincerely hoped that we would get some little enlightenment. However, we got none. We got a discussion on such things as currency and we were given a re-hash of the old thing of how very unfortunate it was for us that we had to go off the gold standard when England went off the gold standard.  That is an argument that has been answered half a dozen times.  It has already been demonstrated that Denmark and other countries that have large gold reserves had to go off the gold standard, so that they could retain their markets for their produce, but, instead of dealing, as one would have expected, with the problem with which this Estimate is connected, we had nothing at all from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and we are still left in a very considerable state of doubt and darkness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1773" /> As I have already stated, we are fighting about preliminaries, and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs informed us that there was one preliminary which, he said, was absolutely hopeless.  He said that the present half-year's instalment of the annuities could not be handed over to be placed in the Land Purchase Fund as had heretofore been done.  I would like to know why not?  What is to prevent it?  What loss of dignity or position will be caused, or how is your case in the slightest way weakened by dealing with this last half-year's instalment in precisely the same way as the half-yearly instalments of annuities have been dealt with for the past ten years?  How could it be weakened in any way? That is what has heretofore been done and you can pay it over now without prejudice, and make it perfectly clear that you are handing these over, without prejudice, to be returned again, provided any tribunal which is agreed upon decides that that instalment should be reimbursed to the Central Fund here.  What is the difficulty about that?  As a matter of fact, as the President is perfectly aware, if he adopted that course, he would not prejudice himself in the slightest, and, at the same time, he would be acting strictly legally.  As the President is perfectly aware, the setting up of this Suspense Account is illegal and contrary to section 12 of the Land Act of 1923.  Taking the other course, he will be acting perfectly properly and perfectly legally, and he will be making a gesture which would show that he was <i>bona fide</i> anxious to have a determination on this question.</P>
    <P>What I cannot see is why the first step cannot be taken by the Administration here.  It does not prejudice their case in the slightest and they can then go on to discuss what tribunal they will leave this question to be finally decided by.  I have not the slightest doubt in my mind that if the President said: &ldquo;We will pay over this half-yearly instalment of the annuities without prejudice, and therefore, you have got no justification in keeping on your tax on Irish cattle,&rdquo; that tax would be instantaneously raised.  I <Col N="1774" /> have no doubt in my mind that that would follow.  It is because the half year's instalment has not been paid that this tax has been put on Irish cattle.  That is the sole reason which is keeping this tax upon Irish farm produce in England, and which, according to the Government, has necessitated the introduction of this very special legislation, conferring upon the Government these very extraordinary powers.  It is simply a case of what appears to me to be mere obstinacy, because I have no reason to think the contrary, on the part of the Executive Council not to hand over without prejudice this half-year's instalment of the annuities.  That is what the fight is about.  That is what this country is called to endure suffering for; that is what the farming community here is going to be broken for, simply because the Government are unwilling to pay over without prejudice the half yearly instalment of the annuities.  That is a terrible responsibility for the Executive Council to take upon itself.  I would like now if I can to bring home to the minds of the President and his fellow-members of the Executive Council, that they are not playing with children.  They are playing with the destinies of a people, they are playing with human lives, they are playing with the happiness, the prosperity, the well-being, and possibly with the very lives of the people of this country at present. It is no light responsibility that rests upon their shoulders.  Our people are being driven into most terrible poverty.  That will come and worse than that.  Possibly starvation and death will ensue and the responsibility rests upon the shoulders of the members of the Executive Council and upon their conscience.  For that reason I appeal to the President, and to the members of the Executive Council, to recognise the position in which they are placed, to recognise how they are playing fast and loose with the destinies of the people of this State, and, as I said, almost with the lives of this people.</P>
    <P>The one main issue, the one thing which makes this economic warfare go <Col N="1775" /> on, is that you are not willing to hand over without prejudice the half-yearly instalment of the annuities.  I am not now going to deal with the question of the land annuities in general.  But I will say this much in response to a statement made here by Deputy Clery the other day, that we contend, and must contend, that it is as clear as daylight that there is no legal right in this State to maintain these annuities.  I go further and say that nobody who has gone into the question can honestly and conscientiously state that any legal case can be put forward.  That is the perfectly plain attitude which we have taken up and maintained.  However, as has been pointed out, there is another way out.  Admit that there is and that there can be no legal claim, but simply go and say: &ldquo;Our farmers are unable to pay.  There is a legal obligation on us to pay, but do not insist upon that obligation.&rdquo;  You can do that, and if you do, you may succeed in that attitude.  As long as you take up the hopeless position that you have a legal case, when everyone knows perfectly well that you have not a case, there is no use in endeavouring to cheat your own mind.  Let us come to the issue.  It is the end of democratic rule in this country.  After all, the one control which any legislative assembly can have is control of the purse.  Recently there was given to the Executive Council unlimited power to raise taxation.  They can raise any amount of money they like by any method they like.  They can declare any single act a man does an act upon which excise duty can be placed.  They can demand that a licence be had for the doing of that act, and for that licence they can demand payment of any amount they like.  They can go to a railway company and say &ldquo;pay over half a million.&rdquo; If the company does not do so they can carry out Deputy Norton's idea&mdash;they can nationalise it.  They can do the same with a bank, saying: &ldquo;Pay us over so many millions.  If you do not, we are going to seize your bank.  We will nationalise it.&rdquo;  They have all these unlimited powers. <Col N="1776" /> They can take the last farthing from every citizen.  They have been given such power.  Up to this they only had power to expend money which had to be appropriated by this House.  Here they are given a grant of two million pounds which for practical purposes is to be expended in any single way the Minister for Finance likes.  What is here is so general, so indefinite, so vague, that there is no control upon any Minister at all.</P>
    <P>There is another thing which is very significant.  That is that this two millions is to be voted before the Government puts up their scheme.  Why not think first and ask for the money afterwards? Why not, when coming to the House, be able to tell it what the money is wanted for; what they have in their heads, and what are their plans.  They cannot do that because they have not thought them out.  They come here in complete ignorance of what they want the money for or how much they want.  They come in in absolute ignorance.  They tell the House that they must have two million pounds to spend before the Dáil meets again, obviously to spend before October.  What is the reason for that? They are going to pour down into some channel&mdash;which channel they do not know&mdash;the national capital at the rate of one million a month.  As it is this country is in a very bad way.  The Government has reduced it to terrible straits.  What of the nonsense that was preached in the very long, elaborate and dull speech that was made by the Deputy from Meath, who told us that the people there were so demoralised, evidently by the present Government, that they would not even cut the meadows.  It is certainly a very terrible criticism of this administration, when Deputy O'Reilly feels that his constituents are so demoralised, and have become so lazy, that they would rather let the meadows rot than cut them.  If that is the moral condition to which the Fianna Fáil Party has reduced this State it is certainly not a thing to boast of.</P>
    <P>The moral fibre of the people of every State must be built up, and if they are so demoralised that they do not consider it worth while to work, an <Col N="1777" /> amount of harm has been done to the moral fibre of the people that it will be impossible to make good.  Deputy O'Reilly boasts about that.  He stated that other things were due to the acts of the previous Government.  The last administration can look back upon its ten years of office with justifiable pride.  The last administration can point out that in one of the worst crises the world has ever experienced this State suffered less than any other State.  They can point out that under their administration this State was the envy of foreign critics, some of whom were very hostile critics.  From the accession of the present administration to power there has been such a change in the financial outlook of this State that instead of being the envy we must be, at present, the despised of the whole world.</P>

      <P>We are asked to give unlimited powers.  The Dáil is to give up all control over money.  You have the Government asking for complete trust.  Are they worthy of complete trust?  What have this Government done to deserve the trust which was never given in any country in which there is a Parliamentary Government and an Executive Council?  What has this Government done?  It has piled failure upon failure; it has muddled every single thing it has taken up and now it asks for unlimited confidence.  And I will point out, too, that this is not a Government that at the last General Election got the confidence of the Irish people.  It did not get a majority at the last General Election and it only has a majority now because a Party which was elected as a proTreaty Party has become an Anti-Treaty Party and has flung in its lot with the present administration.  That is the only reason why the President has got charge of the administration at the present moment.</P>

      <P>We at the present moment are in as bad a position as we could be.  So bad is the position that one would not have thought possible six months ago that the country would be reduced to the position in which it now is. But it is perfectly obvious that the position in which we now are is but the mere forerunner and the foretaste of what is to come in the immediate future.  I say that is obvious.  I agree with Deputy Norton that we are heading for a revolution. We are heading for a revolution as fast as we can head for it.  Nobody who has studied the signs of revolution, the principles put forward and the causes from which it proceeds in any State can hesitate to draw the conclusion that we are heading fast for a revolution.  We have got, as we know to-day, a strong body in this State who have been preaching the establishment of a Republic upon the Russian lines here.  It was stated by Deputy Cosgrave that similar views have permeated the Executive Council. We were told yesterday that this body could not have been in existence before.  It was in existence before.  It was, of course, these principles that were being preached before, but they were not being preached or adopted or helped by the Government in office.  On the contrary, they were being kept down, kept in check and kept back by the Government in office.  The very opposite is now taking place and this Government is heading the country <Col N="1779" /> for revolution.  Out of that revolution can come one thing and one thing only, and that is a Republic upon your Russian lines.  That is where this country is drifting fast.  We are going in for a revolution.  I agree with Deputy Norton.  Deputy Davin, of course, does not know the meaning of the word &ldquo;Socialism.&rdquo;</P>

We are heading this State as fast as a State can be dragged towards something in the nature of a Bolshevic Republic.  We are heading for a State where private property will be non-existent and not only are we going towards that revolution but we are being brought to such a state of poverty in this State by the action of the Executive Council and their friends that you may take it for granted that when the revolution comes it will be more than simply a quite harmless revolution.  It will be a revolution accompanied by violence and I fear accompanied by bloodshed.  I do say to the Executive Council, to those who follow, support and keep them in office and back them up in the wide course which they are now following, that when the fruits of their sowing are reaped, when the country has suffered as it is going to suffer, that for each bit of suffering which the country endures, for every act of bloodshed, and for every piece of political wrong-doing which takes place in this State engandered by the condition of poverty which the Government have brought about, the moral responsibility will rest upon the shoulders of President de Valera, his Executive Council and upon their followers and friends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one Minister who should have intervened in this debate but so far he has not done so. I refer to the Acting-Minister for Agriculture, who for the time being at all events is the official head of the agricultural community in this country. In the present unfortunate circumstances <Col N="1780" /> of the country it was his duty to indicate to the people what steps he proposes to take to relieve them in the existing situation.  The farmers have been advised by members of the Executive Council to hold on to their cattle and to hold on to their stock. The farmers, or a certain number of them at all events, acting on that advice, are holding on to their stock. What provision does the Acting-Minister for Agriculture propose to make out of this Vote of £2,000,000 to the farmers who are holding on to their stock and who will possibly sell these cattle at a loss perhaps during the months of September and October? It surely was the duty of the Acting-Minister for Agriculture in the present circumstances of this country to have intervened in this debate and to have indicated to the farmers of the country the steps he proposes to take in order to relieve them of the losses which they are undoubtedly incurring at the moment and of the greater losses which they will certainly incur during the coming weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another reason why the Minister should have intervened. During the last ten days there was a very brief outline of a butter scheme given to the Press.  The outline was so brief that it was difficult even for men engaged for years in the butter business to understand its terms.  The people who are interested in the butter trade and in the creameries are naturally anxious to know the actual steps the Minister proposes to take for the purpose of enabling them to dispose of their butter.  It was stated in that <i>resumé</i> of his proposal that there should be a guaranteed price in the home market of 117/-.  Is it proposed to continue the export of butter?  There is not sufficient cold storage here to accommodate the stocks of butter for the next two or three months.  If it is proposed to continue the export, who is going to pay the duty?  Has the duty to be paid by the creameries or will it be paid by the State?  These are important matters bearing on the whole agricultural situation.  In my opinion, it was undoubtedly the duty of the Minister to make some statement <Col N="1781" /> for the purpose of enlightening farmers as to their actual position under the new conditions.</P>
    <P>This estimate has been severely criticised, and rightly so.  There was a totally inadequate explanation of its scope and intention given by the President when introducing it.  If the people are to be called upon to make sacrifices it is the duty of the President to take the country into his confidence and to tell the people what steps he proposes to take in order to tide them over the emergency period. It is grossly unfair to ask the Dáil for this large sum of money in the absence of any statement of policy from the President.  The taxpayers, the farmers, the business people and the workers will have to pay for the luxury of the warfare we are engaged in.  As the representatives of the people, we are entitled to know how the President proposes to spend this money.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that if this warfare continues for any lengthy period he will have to approach the Dáil for a number of Votes similar to this. I believe this is the first of a series of such Votes.  This condition of things, I assume, will continue until almost every citizen will be brought to the position that he must look to the State for some form of relief.  I believe we will have a reversion to the conditions that prevailed here during the famine years.  If the farmers' losses were to be assessed to-day&mdash;and these losses did not actually commence with the imposition of duties on our exports by the British, because some of the losses were incurred during the period when the negotiations between this country and Great Britain were in suspense&mdash;they would be found to be very considerable.  I believe they would far exceed the figure which we are asked to vote in this Estimate to-day. If a rough approximation were made, I think it would be somewhere in the neighbourhood of £6,000,000.  I doubt very much that even that figure would recoup the farmers for the losses they have incurred up to the present moment.</P>
    <P>There are certain casualties in the ranks of the farmers already. <Col N="1782" /> Their numbers will be added to day by day, week by week, and the number of casualties will continue to increase as long as this unfortunate warfare lasts.  One is entitled to ask, in such circumstances, what about the country?  If we could look at the country quite independently of political considerations, political prejudices or political parties, if we took a completely detached view and asked ourselves the question: What of the country and its future? we certainly would be driven to the conclusion, no matter in what favourable light we might be inclined to view it, that even under existing circumstances there is no possibility of surviving if this warfare which the President and the Government have embarked upon is to continue for any length of time. Is it to be assumed, when he gets this money from the Dáil, that it is his intention to pursue this warfare to the bitter end, utterly regardless of the terrible consequences involved?</P>
    <P>If one is to judge by the President's speeches down the country during recent weeks, it would appear that he has absolutely bolted and barred the door against the possibility of any further negotiations with the British Government.  No matter from what aspect we view the present position of things, we cannot possibly see any ray of hope.  In view of the sacrifices which have been made by the people during the last seventeen years, particularly during the last decade, and in view of the efforts made by Ministers in the previous Government and by the people who co-operated so whole-heartedly with them, it is certainly tragic to see the country brought to the condition in which it is.  Speaking here recently I said that if this situation had been handled in the way in which such a situation would have been handled in any normal country, we would not find ourselves in our present unfortunate position.  If the elements of statemanship existed amongst members of the Fianna Fáil Government, then surely they would have found some way out of the difficulty&mdash;some way to relieve the country of the onerous burden it has now to bear.  I submit that even yet it is the <Col N="1783" /> duty of the Government to find a solution. The indications even at the moment are perhaps more favourable than they were yesterday or the day before in view of the speech made by the British Attorney-General.  I say it is the duty of the Government to explore the situation as much as possible and find a solution for the present difficulties. The prolongation of this suicidal strife can only lead to a renewal of bitterness between the two countries.  It can only lead to a renewal of racial hatreds and the longer this warfare goes on the more difficult it will be to bring about an understanding between the two peoples.</P>
    <P>If the Government fail in these circumstances to achieve a solution of the difficulty between the two countries, then I submit that they are utterly lacking in any qualities of statesmanship, and history will adjudge them at their proper and true value. If this warfare continues, no one can possibly visualise the financial consequences to the people.  Every individual will suffer.  The workman and the farmer will suffer; the shopkeeper and the manufacturer will suffer; all will be involved in the common suffering. These duties imposed by the British Government, as I said, are directed mainly against the farmer. He is the one individual who will suffer most as a consequence of the operation of the duties.  I ask the President to realise what the position may be in the months of September and October when the farmer will be compelled to send his stock into the fairs and to sell them at any price he can possibly get. If the farmer continues to act on the advice given to him by the members of the Government, he will hold up his stock, with the result that towards the end of September, and particularly during October, the markets will be glutted to such an extent that cattle will be procurable at any price offered by the buyers.</P>
    <P>In this Estimate it is stated that disbursements will be made from this fund for various purposes&mdash;to promote the continuance of trade industry and business, to open new markets for <Col N="1784" /> agricultural and manufactured produce, to establish or assist in establishing new industries.  I wonder what kind of industries the President or the members of the Government have in mind.  Are they industries subsidiary to agriculture or new industries that require a great deal of experience and technical skill for the starting and running of them?  Surely if industries are to be started under State supervision, the President should take to heart the lesson of other countries. State-aided industries of that kind have not succeeded in other countries; in countries that have a far wider and greater experience of the management of business than we have; in countries where there is available a great amount of technical skill.  If they have failed in countries like these, how can the President hope, in any circumstances, to make new industries succeed in this country?</P>
    <P>The question of alternative markets is also mentioned in the Estimate. We have heard a great deal about alternative markets, not alone in the Dáil, but in speeches delivered by Ministers and members of the Fianna Fáil Party throughout the country for the last few years.  I understand that the President and certain members of the Government have been exploring the possibility of finding alternative markets during the last three or four months.  I, for one, would be interested to hear the results of the President's investigations.  If it is possible to find an alternative and a better market than the market we have already got, then by all means secure that market.  But I offer this advice to the President: that he should hold on to the market he has got.  He should hold on to the old market before he transfers his allegiance to the new.  He should make quite certain, if that new market is available&mdash;and I do not believe there is a new market available&mdash;that before transferring the products of this country to that new market, the new market will receive them on as favourable and good terms as the old market.  I do not believe it is possible to obtain an alternative market.  If it were possible to obtain an alternative market <Col N="1785" /> for our products, he can rest assured that we have business men in this country sufficiently energetic and enterprising to have explored during past years the possibility of securing a foothold in these markets.  We do know that certain business men did attempt to find alternative markets for certain lines of our products, and, after some little experience, these men discovered that, instead of these new markets being an advantage to them, they were a considerable disadvantage. They, themselves, as a matter of fact, lost quite a substantial sum of money in the effort to secure a foothold in these particular markets.</P>
    <P>I think the sooner this nonsense about alternative markets is dropped the better.  That sort of nonsense does not deceive any farmer.  Every farmer recognises that there is only one market for his products and that is the English market.  It is the only market where there is a demand for his products; where his products suit the peculiar tastes and the peculiar habits of the people.  There is no use in talking about alternative markets.  Under the Estimate I assume it will be possible for the Government to send ornamental deputations or delegations to various other countries for the purpose of finding out if alternative markets can be opened.  It is possible that a great deal of money will be squandered in that direction.  It is quite possible also, in fact it is certain, that no result will be achieved as a result of the visits of these delegations.  Similarly, a lot of this money may be spent quite foolishly in the attempt to establish industries here.  A great deal of State money has been spent already in an effort to subsidise industries in this country, after careful and minute investigation, and that money, as Ministers of the late Government can inform him, might as well have been thrown into the tide.</P>
    <P>If this struggle is prolonged, if the President still takes up an adamantine attitude and insists upon pursuing this quarrel to the bitter end and refuses, under any circumstances or any set of circumstances, to reopen negotiations with the British Government, then I <Col N="1786" /> ask him to try and visualise the conditions that will be created amongst the farming community.  The President knows perhaps as well as I do the struggles farmers have had during the past few years to make ends meet, the struggles they have had to pay their debts, to pay their annuities, to pay their rates, and the other expenses incidental to the carrying on of farming.  These new duties will drive the farmers under the surface. There is a danger that if this warfare is prolonged farmers may lose all hope and all courage, and it will be almost an impossibility for any subsequent Government, taking over control of the destinies of the country, to restore initiative, character and enterprise in them again.  There is that possibility.  The farmer in this country has a peculiar psychology. The small farmer, particularly, when he finds things going against him, is inclined to abandon hope and just sink.  Can the President calmly visualise the existence of conditions such as those amongst the farming community?  So far as I can see, these conditions are bound to arise if this economic warfare is continued for any length of time.  Farmers are asked to pay their land annuities, their rates, their shopkeepers' debts, and all other debts.  I ask the President where are the farmers going to get the money to pay these debts at present?</P>
    <P>Where are the farmers to get money to pay those debts?  Everything the farmer is selling at present he is selling at a loss, under the cost of production. I do not care what it is, let it be an animal, let it be potatoes, any crop produced on the land, he is selling it under the cost of production. Prices, as the President knows, or ought to know, have dropped considerably during the last three or four weeks, and prices are still dropping. In circumstances such as these, I ask the President to explain how it is possible for the farmer to meet the debts which he advises them so jauntily to pay?  There is scarcely a point that could be made on this Estimate that has not already been made by some other speaker.  I do not propose to say anything more, but in conclusion, <Col N="1787" /> I would ask the President to bear in mind the existing conditions in this country.  If he does bear clearly in mind the existing economic conditions and the existing circumstances of the country, I am sure if he is prepared to face up to the issue involved in this struggle quite straightforwardly and honestly, he will use every effort to secure a settlement of the difficulty between this country and Great Britain at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <P>I only intervene to remind the Opposition Front Bench of an implied promise made here about a fortnight ago by the former Minister for Agriculture and to ask why that promise has not been kept.  Speaking here on the 22nd July, Deputy Hogan of Galway, referring to the secret agreement of 1923, said:</P>
      <P>That agreement contains many clauses.  I am not going into the reason why it was marked &ldquo;secret.&rdquo; That can be explained at a later stage.  I do not want to confuse the issue by dealing with it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I look upon that as an implied promise that the reason for marking the agreement secret was to be explained at some later stage by some other responsible speaker.  No such explanation has been given.  In my opinion it is very important that, if there be an explanation, it should be given because so far as I can see those who are following the debates here, who are reading of this secret agreement and reading further the statement that has been made by Ministers, that not only was the agreement marked secret but that an appeal was made to the British Government not to publish it, are almost a threat to the peace of the country.  They are not only angry but they are furiously angry and it is natural that they should be so looking upon it as they do, that the Ministers whom they had elected to power made an agreement throwing a very serious burden on their backs, that they made that agreement without disclosing the terms of it to them, that the agreement was actually marked secret and that the Government they <Col N="1788" /> trusted appealed to the British Government not to tell anybody about that agreement or publish it.  That is of course as it looks to them.  I do not want to be reminded of the argument that the agreement was not secret from the Irish people.</P>

I think that now, 10 years after the agreement was made, the members of the Dáil, especially in this crisis, are entitled to be told what is the reason for that.  I think that those who profess an anxiety for peace on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches ought to insist that that explanation be given, because in my opinion until it is given and until it is accepted we are going to have a very angry people.</P>
      <P>I have very little to say in regard to the general subject.  The only thing I would say is that I am sorry that this meeting of the Dáil ever took place, and that some of the speeches that have been delivered have been in very bad taste in relation to the present crisis in the country.  Up to yesterday morning I believed that the Opposition was genuinely anxious to be helpful and I for one did not encourage the phrase &ldquo;playing England's game&rdquo;.  As a matter of fact I discouraged it, but after listening to several of the speeches made from the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches within the last two days, I think the accusation can now be made with a great deal more truth and a great deal more justification. Listening to the speeches of Deputy Hayes, Deputy Hogan and another Deputy I could not help thinking what on earth is the reason for such speeches at the present juncture.  We may be sure that the British Government is watching every word uttered here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have it stated that the present Government got its majority by immoral methods and that the great bulk of its supporters, to quote a particular Deputy, are people of dishonest instincts, that they are work-shy people who do not want to pay their debts or to fulfil any useful function in the State.  What is the reason for telling Sir Thomas Inskip and all those other gentlemen over there that this Government is the expression of the dishonesty and the immorality which prevail in this country, that the half million voters who voted the Government into power are people of immoral inclinations, and that it was <Col N="1790" /> by appealing to their dishonest and immoral instincts that the present Government was able to get into power?  Is that helpful in the present crisis?  Surely Deputy Hogan would be better employed in explaining what he promised to explain in the quotation I have just given than in repeating that statement here to-day. How does it help for him to repeat that he heard it stated or that it was repeated at various cross-roads by every Fianna Fáil T.D., &ldquo;If you vote for us you will never have to pay annuities.&rdquo;?  Whom does it help?  As a matter of fact during the last election it was reported in the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; that Deputy Hogan made a speech in one of the towns in Galway, I forget which, in which he said that he had been for the first time in his life attending a Fianna Fáil meeting.  To-day he said he heard half a dozen Fianna Fáil candidates, and at present presumably Deputies, telling the people that, if they gave these candidates their votes, they would not have to pay their annuities.  I was in half a dozen counties during the last General Election and I never heard a suggestion of that kind.  If there is any criticism that could be levelled at the Fianna Fáil meetings it is that there was too much of a rather absurd type of idealism.  I felt sorry for the belief that prevailed amongst younger members of Fianna Fáil that by a very liberal use of Government action they could transform this country into a paradise in a few years.</P>
    <P>Listening to Fianna Fáil speakers, I have always felt that they were rather hoping for too much in that respect.  That, however, is a thing that is apt to prevail in every country. I must say that I never attended a Fianna Fáil meeting at which any suggestion was made that the annuities should not be paid.  Again, practically every Deputy here took part in the Kildare by-election.  That was the by-election which really brought this matter of the annuities to an issue. We were listening to one another at every cross-roads and at every church door.  Why does not some Deputy <Col N="1791" /> mention a cross-roads or church door at which this statement was made?  There was no truth in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The President asked for £2,000,000.  Members of the House from the country districts pleaded for consideration for the farmer.  They pleaded justly and not an hour too much has been devoted to the consideration of the agricultural industry in connection with this proposal. I venture to ask whether any of that £2,000,000 will be devoted to the relief or assistance of the 8,000 people in the City of Dublin who are living on a small food ticket, provided not from taxation but through the rates of the city.  We have, in Dublin, iron workers, painters, builders and unskilled men living in the tenements and receiving a food ticket valued 10/-per week to support themselves, a wife and two children.  These men have the landlord clamouring at the door for his rent.  The Dublin landlord has been very reasonable and very tolerant in granting time to his tenants but even landlords must get paid.  After two or three months arrears, these people, in receipt of 10/-for themselves, a wife and two children, must pack up their belongings in a perambulator and go out to search for a basement dwelling.  When all this talk is going on about the farmers, I ask the President if he will give some consideration to these unfortunate people.  Our shipyards are at a standstill.  Our docks have slackened down.  There is little or no building going on.  With a great feeling of insecurity present, those who have a little money will not spend it, with the result that there is continued unemployment and grave hardship for the people for whom I speak.  I believe that if the political history of the last 12 or 14 years could be forgotten and if our President would go to England and negotiate, there would be a considerable change.  Deputy Norton said to-day&mdash;very few, I think, noticed his words&mdash;that the bond holders in England or elsewhere have no right to take from the struggling farmers the annuities that they are unable to pay.  I ask Deputy Norton, if that is so, what about the suspense account?  If we all admit that they are unable to pay, would it not be better to go over to the other side, meet the <Col N="1793" /> people there, drop any idea of getting a political victory over those at home and ask the people on the other side, in equity, to forgive the debt?  Negotiate with them on that basis.  At all events, give it a trial and see what the result will be.  If you could settle the land annuities question on these lines, employment would improve and the hardships our people are now suffering would be relieved.  Would that not be a splendid day's work for the President and his Executive?  Deputy Norton says that the farmers are unable to pay.  Why not make that the issue with the people on the other side and ask their consideration of it?  I believe some good would come of such a suggestion.  Instead of that, we are faced with giving our money to other countries for their goods, while they will buy nothing from us.  Deputy Norton referred to the conditions in other countries and he especially mentioned Belgium.  Do we hope to get a market there?  Do we hope to get any trade with them in exchange for the goods we may buy from them during this crisis?  With other speakers I ask where is it all going to end?  There ought to be no more talk of casualties. Something ought to be done to relieve the people.  Food prices are going up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asks is income from the Royal Liver going down.  The Royal Liver Society gives employment to 2,000 good Irishmen, some of whom fought with, and were in goal with, Deputies on the Government Benches.  The Royal Liver pays good wages and gives good pensions. If the Deputy opposite refers to my association with the Royal Liver I may tell him that I am very proud of being associated with that society and with the workers in it.  I do not intend to be put out by these interruptions. I ask Deputies from country constituencies to remember that there <Col N="1794" /> is such a place as tenement Dublin. I ask them to remember the conditions I have just described to them, and I ask is there any farmer in the country suffering in the same way? A man with a wife and two children gets 10/- a week in food tickets.  He has to find his rent wherever he can. These are the conditions that exist. Eight thousand people on that kind of relief; 3,000 on indoor relief, and thousands not eligible for any kind of relief because they travel up from the country, and they come to Dublin and are not entitled to any kind of relief. Is that a proper condition of things for a country like ours?  When may we hope to reap the fruits of the great week that is past?  When may we hope for the fruits of the greatest of all weeks, the week of the Eucharistic Congress?  As a result of that, one would hope for something good.  Is it too late to hope for something good and that the political issues will be dropped&mdash;political abuse, and all the talk about who is a traitor and who is not.  There are threats to people to keep their tongues quiet and so on. Who cares for threats?  &ldquo;Keep your tongue quiet or else.&rdquo;  Is there a man in the House who cares, remembering the last fifteen years in Dublin?&mdash;&ldquo;Or else.&rdquo;  I appeal to the President to give consideration to the poor and the unemployed, to men who are in precarious employment and who may lose it after another week or two; and for God's sake, let us have no more.</P>

I want to say that I am quite satisfied that the efforts the present Government are making are being made in the best interests of the majority of the people of this country.  Other methods have been tried in the past. The 8,000 destitute people of whom Deputy Byrne spoke, in the City of Dublin, are the result of the methods tried by the predecessors of this Government. Whatever point of view one may have about them individually or collectively, even if it were admitted that they did their best, nevertheless, their position from the point of view they held brought no results of which <Col N="1796" /> the people in Dublin or in any part of the Twenty-Six Counties can be proud.

Now there are some and I think they will be guarded and protected in that way until we can be sure their lives are safe.  We want to see every section of the people, from every point of view, giving expression to their views, without fear of intimidation.  We are heading in that direction and I say that the present Executive Council are doing their level best to bring about a situation where all shades of opinion can be expressed in public or in the House without any fear of intimidation one way or the other.</P>
      <P>As regards the Deputy's suggestion that I should go to a certain place, I will leave that to himself, or, as a colleague of mine here beside me has said, I will leave it as an outburst as a result of the benefits he has derived here in the last few months where a little more charity is evinced than ever he expressed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation which the Deputy put before us has been his experience and my experience in the City of Dublin for a great number of years.  We have hopes now, through a tariff policy and through the attitude adopted by the Executive Council, to try to bring about first consideration for the people of this country.  I do not want to see or hear about farmers suffering unnecessarily.  Nor do I want to see a constitution of the situation which we have and have had for many years in Dublin, but I do believe and I am quite happy and satisfied in thinking that an honest effort has been made and is being made by the Executive Council to grapple with these problems.  What this sum of £2,000,000 will be used for remains to be seen.  It will be seen as it arises. but I am not at all afraid, as some of the Deputies on the opposite side have suggested, that it may be given away to some pals or to some friends.  I say this&mdash;that we will have in the very near future a change.  We will have <Col N="1798" /> industries springing up in the Twenty-Six Counties and employment given to greater numbers than before.  We will have a situation where the people will be able to earn the money to buy enough to eat.  Deputy Hogan has asked what are we going to do with our surplus £30,000,000 worth of food if we lose our British market.  We want to see that the population will be enabled to earn sufficient to eat and subsist on the food we produce and that it will not be a surplus product because nobody is able to buy it.  If there were a good and a decent standard of living, so that the people could afford to purchase all they needed, and if the amount of food which they could consume were to be deducted from the amount we have at present, our exportable surplus would be a great deal less than the £30,000,000 worth referred to by Deputy Hogan.</P>
    <P>A lot of heat has been engendered in this discussion.  Deputy Anthony made ridiculous charges against the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Defence and, in fact, against the whole Executive Council.  He said that the Minister for Justice was cowardly and that he was afraid to deal with a section of the Press that was advocating the shooting of individuals.  I do not know of any section of the Press in this country that has been advocating the shooting of individuals among our people. I think, Sir, that when Deputy Anthony makes a statement of that kind he should be asked to substantiate what he says by a production of the documents in question. Deputy Anthony also says that county councils all over the country are passing and sending snowball resolutions of the same kind.  I have not seen any snowball resolutions, or any other kind of resolution, of that nature.  I certainly have seen resolutions by county councils pledging support to the Government and asking all Irishmen, now that it is a fight between England and the Free State and a case of standing together unitedly for the purpose of getting the best we can for the country&mdash;I have <Col N="1799" /> seen such resolutions asking Irishmen to sink their political differences without sinking their political identities for the purpose of getting the best we can in this matter.  It was admitted by Deputy Hogan to-day that we will get a settlement of some kind.  He even says that it will be a good settlement.  His statement means that through the change of Government a situation has come whereby we are going to have this country some millions of pounds better off than it was when this Government was here.</P>
    <P>What have the Opposition done in this matter?  Instead of keeping quiet while the difficulty is on and criticising afterwards, they are criticising before-hand, and saying to England that the people are against us in this matter, trying to make out that 50 per cent. of the country&mdash;and, of course, the only honest, decent section is the 50 per cent. which they represent&mdash;are with them.  If they do believe that the 8,000 destitute families in Dublin, referred to by Deputy Byrne, are there, if they want to see a change from the existence that these poor people have had for the past ten years, let them give this Executive Council a chance of doing something.  If I found that the policy of this Executive Council would not bring twice as good results as was brought by our predecessors I admit that some other method would have to be tried and that neither Cumann na nGaedheal nor Fianna Fáil could solve the problem.  At the present time, as I see it, we are heading for a better system entirely than the system under which we lived before, namely, that depression in England meant lower prices for our goods here and that if accidental prosperity came to England we got better prices and more prosperity here.  It is up to us to keep our own house in order according to our own needs and according to our own requirements.  We should not be considered hostile to any country because we feel that we can establish an industry here and that, in order to establish it and guarantee its continuity, we have to protect it. <Col N="1800" /> I do not see any hostility to any country in doing that.  Some Deputies have said: &ldquo;No wonder England has struck back.  You put on tariffs.&rdquo; We put on tariffs to protect goods that we believe can be manufactured here and should be manufactured here. It is time enough for these Deputies to kick up a fuss if we are facing disaster and failing in the administration of our own country.  Deputy Byrne said that prices of foodstuffs are going up.  They are not going up. They are falling.  They are getting cheaper.  I do not believe that the Deputy could quote an instance where they are increasing.  It may be argued that they are falling because of the present situation.  I am satisfied to leave it to the Executive Council to settle this difference.  It is a matter that concerns this country and another country.  The Executive Council have the support of the majority of the people of the country and it is up to us to give them that support, and if they fail to make a good bargain it will then be time for Deputies opposite and here to reconsider their views regarding their allegiance to the Government. As regards the internal affairs of the country, which concern me intimately at the moment&mdash;because I am not a bit worried about what will happen in this matter between us and England&mdash;as regards affairs at home I believe there is going to be a better future for the people of this country and for the 8,000 people in the City of Dublin who are at present living on outdoor relief provided by the rate-payers of the city.</P>

      <P>I accept anything the Deputy says, but, at all events, there is nothing of absurd idealism in asking the House to find £2,000,000.  It is a very real fact and one that we have got to consider.  What I am very much concerned about is where this £2,000,000 is to come from.  We are told there is no Minister for Finance was not able to remit even a penny of the tax on the sixpenny Soccer ticket. Yet, a day or two afterwards, we are asked to find £2,000,000 to fight England in this economic war upon which we are engaged.  I cannot see how this country is going to find this £2,000,000.  In his introductory speech on the Budget, the Minister for Finance told us that trade last year was something more than 30 per cent. below the trade of the previous year, and, in face of that, he puts taxation to the extent of an extra 25 per cent. on the country this year.  What the trade returns for the first half of this year are it is difficult to say at the moment, but, so far as we can make them out, trade is, at least, more than 40 per cent. less than last year.  On top of the unfortunate people of this country, with a declining trade, with declining resources and with the black outlook at present before them, an imposition of £2,000,000 to fight this war is being put.  In other words, we are going to arm them for war by taxing them still further.</P>
      <P>What is this war we are engaged upon?  It is a money fight with England and this is the fight behind which we are asked to range ourselves.  We were told here that this Government had a majority mandate.  I would like to remind the President, and the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, that they do not form even a majority in this House.  They could not even form a Government without depending on Kipling's &ldquo;Seven men from all the world,&rdquo; who swallowed every Trade Union principle and every election pledge&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am simply stating what is the truth.  In spite of this, Deputy Matthew O'Reilly tells us that 95 per cent. of the nation is behind them in this economic fight, and the House knows what proportion the farmers form of the population of this country.  Deputy O'Reilly tells us&mdash;he is very fond of the 90 per cent&mdash;that 90 per cent. of the farmers are down and out, and these 90 per cent. of down-and-outs are going to be the soldiers in your first line trenches. How are you going to fight a war when 90 per cent. of your shock troops, your first line trench men, are already casualties in the fight?  Is the thing not absurd?  Why does the House not try to get away from this absurd idealism, to which I refer again, and try to face up to the realities of this situation?  We are going to fight England with money and we are going to buy foreign goods to kill England.  Let us take the realities of this situation.  Here we are, a small island.  The Free State contains something less than 3,000,000 people.  Our resources are small, while across the water, three hours from us, is a big and strong nation of 60,000,000 of people, with boundless resources of wealth.  We speak a common language&mdash;I am very sorry to say that&mdash;and our intercourse naturally flows between our agricultural interests and their industrial interests. There is a natural flow of trade between the two.  That is the real situation and is it not most unnatural that that relationship should be disturbed?  I quite agree that, owing to past causes, political and otherwise, our economic policies have run on parallel lines.  That has not been, as we know, to the advantage of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1803" /> We have been accused here of not developing the real economic policy of Arthur Griffith, but, unfortunately, since the change over, and since we got our own political and civil freedom, we have been unable, by reason of circumstances, to carry out the development of that policy.  It must be understood that the late Government took this country out of the ashes to which it had been reduced through the refusal of the men on the opposite side to obey majority rule.  That is a fact.  I will agree that I, as one with a strong national outlook, am sorry to say that we are bound up too much with England, but I certainly say that a time of economic crisis is not the time to break down our present economic structure and to try to raise a new one.  It is too critical a time, and it must also be understood that this thing has not been forced upon us by England.  We have been told that Mr. Thomas has done this and that.  Mr. Thomas did some very clownish things, I admit, but the House must understand that the policy that has been built up here, from the very manner in which it originated, in its protestations of hatred against England, or against anybody who showed any desire for friendship with England, was bound, some time or another, to eventuate in the present impasse.  We had all this talk and we adopted the policy from Mr. Ghandi of non-co-operation with England.  We have had the little pin-prickings of the tariffs here, and this was bound to eventuate in some sort of impasse.  I do not, for a moment, wish to take England's side in this, and I certainly object to, and protest against, being called pro-English, but I will not, even if I have to do so alone, stand behind any of these resolutions that are going around the country asking me to support a policy which I know to be suicidal, criminal and foolish for this country to adopt.</P>
    <P>I do not want to speak at very great length because most of the ideas I express have been expressed better, perhaps, by others, but I say that the outlook is very dangerous.  Deputy Norton's speech, a while ago, put it to the Government whether they were <Col N="1804" /> going to continue with this £2,000,000 to buttress up the soulless capitalism that was destroying and has destroyed this country.  Take that speech with the other pronouncements that have appeared in the public Press recently and see where we find ourselves.  Three or four weeks ago, in one of the papers in Dublin, Deputy Norton was asked how long would it be before the workers of Gallaher's and Jacobs take possession of these factories.  I saw placards in the streets of Dublin, a fortnight ago, urging to &ldquo;Get a grip on the banks.&rdquo;  Put all those together and what are you making for?  The country is making for a very dangerous form of Sovietism here, which will not have behind it the positive plan of Russian Sovietism, but which will have all its vicious elements emphasised and aggravated.  Then, when all this is over, when we have fought England with this money at a time when even our pound is guaranteed at this very moment in London, what is going to happen? There can be only one end to this unfortunate fight.  In fact, it is over before it is begun, and the misery is already beginning to rise up in our country places and in the by-ways of our cities and towns where workers already find themselves out of work. It is practically over and yet we are deliberately told that we are going in to fight.  I do not mind any of the men on the opposite benches going into fight, but I do not think that we ought to drag the helpless and workless people of this country, the women and children, into a ridiculous fight where they are going to meet with nothing but hunger, starvation and ruination.</P>
    <P>I think the issue is very clear.  We have taken up a position that is untenable and I do not think it would be wrong in our general, or our leader, or whatever he may call himself, to retire from that position so that, later on, when the clouds have cleared away, and when we may have strength in our own resources, we may advance on a new form of social order more akin to our national outlook and instincts.  I think that is the policy that the President has before him, because he says that we are being forced to do, in a <Col N="1805" /> short time, what would take us years to do.  I said in the begining that I think this is not the time to try to start a new social order.  We are bound to fail, because, in addition to our own weakness, we have the strength of the forces of Sovietism and Bolshevism all around us in the country.  There is no use disguising that fact.  When all this has passed away the question of the annuities and the financial settlement with England will still remain to be settled.  They have to be settled some time.  In the history of the world a war never settled anything.  If we go away without doing something now, perhaps in two months' time it will be too late to retract from the untenable position we have taken up.  I appeal not only to the President but to every Deputy to come to the assistance of our common country.  The President went over to London twice and on each occasion his visit did not extend beyond twelve hours.  That period did not give a fair chance to make a settlement on a question like this.  Deputies on the opposite benches represents one interest, Deputies on these benches represent another interest, but we all represent our common country&mdash;the Free State&mdash;and all of us would make any sacrifice to help our country.  There was never a time when sacrifice on Party lines was so necessary.  Would it not be possible to get together a committee representative of all Parties to meet during the Recess to consider the situation?  Let us forget Party bitterness and Party points, while not forgetting Party principles, and little time would elapse before we could get an understanding with England that would be a durable one.</P>

      <P>Deputy the Lord Mayor of Dublin struck a very appropriate note when he referred to the difficulties under which tenement dwellers in Dublin Labour.  That condition of affairs is peculiar to every large town and to many country districts, so that we must try to visualise what will be the effect on those who helped their weaker brethren, when they are unable to realise the surplus production of the farming industry.  Deputy Anthony clearly indicated in his <Col N="1806" /> speech the view that the man in the street is likely to take of the position as it affects the agricultural community. It must be very plain that when a market is not available for our surplus agricultural production there is a tendency on the part of those who take a part in that industry to lessen their efforts to increase production to any material extent.  The income of the country is absolutely dependent upon that industry. Reference has been made to the £30,000,000 of agricultural exports. Instead of having the value of that produce reduced we should try to increase it in order to add to our wealth and to explore every avenue to find more markets.  The President is now asking for two millions of money. If sufficient reasons are given to the House I believe that it should not refuse that demand.  Members of the Dáil had always shown their readiness to attend when summoned.  Although the attendance in the House is sparse at the moment, the divisions have shown that there is practically a full representation available.  To hide from the people the means whereby that money is to be expended is, I think, a negation and a flouting of the democratic principles upon which the Government of any country is based.  Is the money for the purpose of compensating farmers for the twenty per cent. duty that they are losing through no fault of their own? Perhaps the only fault is that they have given a majority to a Government which has brought about this state of affairs.  Is the money for the purpose of supplying capital to farmers whose income has been very materially reduced by the reduction of the twenty per cent. from every form of live stock that they produce? If so, the President is certainly doing something which will perhaps help farmers to keep on producing, and will compensate them in some measure for the losses they have incurred. Practically speaking it is like feeding the dog on a bit of his own tail, because the agricultural community have to bear it in future taxation.</P>
      <P>[<i>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle took the Chair.</i>]</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1807" /> The President in the course of his speech referred to the intention of exploring new markets to take the place of the English market, which we have for many years been accustomed to supply, and to exchange our products for products that we do not produce. It is very questionable if new markets can be found.  At any rate it has to be taken into consideration that no new market will be got unless we take the products of these countries for our produce.  That is the principle which governs trade between countries, that imports are paid for more or less by exports.  Unless an agreement of that particular description can be made with other producing countries, I do not see how the President is going to get alternative markets.  Supposing we exchange our livestock for the products of other countries, will we be able to get them on the same terms as we were getting them from the great country with which we had an export trade?  I question if we will.  If we do, these products must take the place of some industry that the President desired to establish by the large volume of protective tariffs imposed here.  It must be clear to the dullest intellect that if such action is taken by the President then we must suffer the loss and he will fail in his policy of protective tariffs.</P>
    <P>A stop has been placed on imports of British coal.  I heard from manufacturers that they will not be able to use German coal.  In fact it would be a positive injury to the boilers that some of them use.  It also means more expense in carrying on manufactures, and that is certainly a set-back to the volume of production here.  The House should seriously take into consideration the fact that the manufacturers will have to continue using British coal and to pay the tax, because, however we may feel about it, it is what conduces to efficiency in production that we will have to look to.</P>

With regard to the land annuities I am sorry there has been an exchange of bitterness over this controversy, because, unquestionably we ought to preserve friendly relations between the two countries.  In that way I believe we would get substantial concessions with regard to the annuities.  I for one will not feel at all hurt if the President gets completely away with his policy of retaining the annuities.  It will be £3,000,000 to the benefit of this country and I sincerely hope that negotiations will be resumed.  I sincerely trust in the interests of the country that the President will endeavour to resume negotiations and that he will succeed either in getting a portion of this money or else carrying the whole hog in his negotiations with the British Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very glad if the President succeeds in getting them retained; but in view of the consequences which we are experiencing at the present moment when the Irish farmer is not able to pay his land annuities and the consequence of the tariffs imposed on our imports, I think I was perfectly justified in my action in voting for handing them over. The fact is that at the recent election I did not support the principle of retaining them.  I pointed out to the farmers the consequences.  I think the fact that I am here is a very clear indication that a large section in this country agrees with me.  However, that does not change the fact that if the President succeeds by negotiations in retaining these land annuities without imposing on the country the very serious consequences that would be likely to ensue from the present economic war, then I will be very glad and <Col N="1809" /> the President will be conferring a great service on the country.  But if the consequence of retaining them means that no farmer will be able to realise any portion of his produce or to pay any portion of his annuities, rates or shop debts, then all I have to say is that it does not require a very well-educated economist to realise the very serious waste that this will cause to the economic condition of this country and the injury that it will do to the workers and the unemployed and the chaos it will bring about.</P>

On the first occasion, he lost his deposit, and on the second occasion he barely saved it; but it was only when he repudiated the farmers and went on his own as a rag and bone merchant that he succeeded in getting in.</P>

I won, in spite of what Deputy Corry said, and in spite of the hordes of his friends who were out against me.  I do not think there was a stronger barrage let loose on any candidate than that which Deputy Corry turned on me, and I am very glad of the fact that the electors of East Cork had the strength of mind to withstand the eloquence of the policy which the Fianna Fáil Party were able to bring on them.  However, I am here and that does not prevent me from appealing to the President to use all the means in his power to open up negotiations again to bring about a settlement in this country. Otherwise, agricultural and commercial prosperity will be non-existent.  I can only add that I would not like to call Deputy Corry any names.</P>

      <P>Someone has phrased this Vote of £2,000,000 the sinews of war.  It is not that so much as slugs for the blunderbusses.  That is what these histrionics about piling up a war chest amount to&mdash;a war chest of which the President does not yet know the purposes or uses, although in the last debate he said that everybody <Col N="1812" /> must have recognised and that he personally had foreseen that this situation was bound to develop. Whether everybody recognised that or not he was clear about himself; he certainly understood that this situation was developing.  Deputy Flinn knows what the money is to be used for.  He said so last night but added that he would not give away the secrets to the enemy.  Deputy Flinn knows; the President does not know.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows the use that is to be made of these £2,000,000. Leave purposes and uses aside, we have as yet heard no statements as to where the £2,000,000 are to come from. Has any Deputy, willing to vote this money, cleared up that point for himself?</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin in this debate made the criticism that this Vote was on a parallel with a Vote of £2,000,000 moved by me without explanation for the Electricity Supply Board.  Deputy Davin has an errant memory.  So well was the application of that sum of money explained in this House that his leader said he was not prepared to vote for certain amendments which had been put down enormously reducing the sum.  When that same Vote went to the Seanad one of the most prominent Senators of the Labour Party said that after the explanation given by me in the Dáil it would be criminal folly for the Seanad to refuse one shilling of the money asked for.  There were many divisions made of the money in that Vote and lengthy explanations as to how soon it was to be paid out and on what it was to be expended, and the divisions corresponded to subheads ordinarily introduced into an Estimate.  But here and now we are asked for this £2,000,000 and this simple paragraph is all the explanation we get:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Disbursements will be made from this Fund, subject to terms and conditions to be approved by the Minister for Finance, to promote the continuance of trade, industry and business, to open new markets for agricultural and manufactured produce, to establish or assist in establishing new industries and <Col N="1813" /> generally for all expenses arising out of or in the course of the present emergency.</P>
    <P>That is lucidity indeed and that is, in the main, the content of the speech that the President delivered in moving for this sum of money.  Let us fit this into its proper perspective.  The Government came into power, in the main, because they promised to reduce taxation this year by £2,000,000.  So far from doing that, the Minister for Finance boasted on July 14th that the Government took the responsibility of imposing on the country for this year an additional burden of taxation amounting to £4,250,000.  We are therefore £6,250,000 down on the Election promise.  The promised reduction of £2,000,000 has gone and we have had the Government taking the responsibility of adding on an extra £4,250,000.  We are now asked for £2,000,000 more and it is to be presumed&mdash;and I am going on this presumption until it is contradicted and shown to be false &mdash; that this £2,000,000 is new money.  We have therefore, so far, failed to get the £2,000,000 reduction we were promised.  We had £4,250,000 extra imposed by the Budget and now we have a new sum of £2,000,000 being looked for.  We are really £8,250,000 down on the promises which got this Government the possession of Government. And all we are permitted to know about this new money is that it is to be used for expenses arising out of the present emergency.</P>
    <P>If one can believe any of the statements made, the only hope that out of this emergency will come something good rests on the statement made in the Seanad by Senator Connolly that &ldquo;if England does not give us this money England will not get the exemption from debt that she is seeking from America.&rdquo;  That was the statement made by a responsible Minister of this Government, speaking in a most important debate.  I assume he has the authority of the American Minister in this country for making that statement&mdash;that the United States Government has taken up our case and that England will not get the <Col N="1814" /> remission of debts for which she is requesting remission until she has left in our hands and in our safe keeping these disputed moneys.  That statement was made by a man who should at least be responsible.  It was made under circumstances that might induce responsibility, even from an irresponsible person, and it was made in a House and on a debate where he must have realised his responsibility.</P>
    <P>So the big stick of America is being wagged now.  I presume, when it is being wielded in this open way we may gather that America is really going to act on our behalf.  It would be a good thing to know that precisely. Or is it to emerge again and slowly to be driven home that another diplomatic blunder has been committed and that, on top of Governmental rudeness to the French, there has been piled Governmental incapacity for proper behaviour towards the Americans?  The statement, however, stands, for contradiction or confirmation, that we are in the happy position that England will not get that remission from debt for which she is looking unless we are satisfied on this question.  We have an American Minister in this State and there was, possibly, contact with him, and it is to be presumed that he stands for that statement.  Perhaps Senator Connolly will give us some explanation of what it means.  If it is not true it can be repudiated.  If it only means that we are trying to inject our little politics into American politics, I do not think that attempt is going to be successful.</P>

      <P>It is to be noted that Senator Connolly was chosen to publish that statement, as it was he who in an earlier debate about 1929 said, in relation to the Nicaraguan situation, that the American people had been guilty of more atrocities in Nicaragua than the Black and Tans were in this country.  There must <Col N="1815" /> have been definitely a burying of the hatchet between Senator Connolly and the Americans if he is now in the position to tell us that the Americans are on our side and that those whom he dubbed Black and Tan may meet the original Black and Tans if it comes eventually to a contest over this money.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flinn made a point last night which he thought was of substance. If, he says, it is true that England is collecting these annuities by means of the duties, then the annuities are, in fact, being paid.  In that case, he continued, we should not pay the annuities as a lump sum.  He argued that in that case we are absolved from payment. One answer to that is that if you owe a debt which, if you do not pay, your creditor proceeds to take in some other way, that does not relieve you of your moral responsibility in regard to the debt.</P>
      <P>But there is another and a better counter to Deputy Flinn's argument. If, in fact, the country is being bled to the extent of £3,000,000 or £5,000,000 by the new duties, and if the annuities at the same time are being collected direct from the farmer, then the farmer is, according to Deputy Flinn, paying twice.  And it is true that the farmer is paying twice and he will probably pay a third time when we proceed to exact, by our emergency duties, what the Government represent as a payment from the British, but what is clearly going to be a payment from ourselves.  The arguments in connection with all this have shifted from time to time, and as they have shifted it seems to me that certain of the earlier and more nonsensical protestations made by Fianna Fáil have also been abandoned.  It is good, however, to recall them at this time.  It is useful to ponder on what was promised to us, to wonder whether those promises are still being maintained or whether there is any hope of their fulfilment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But before I deal with these promises, I shall clear away one smaller point.  Deputy Moore is anxious to know if anyone can give <Col N="1816" /> absolute documentation as to whether or not the Fianna Fáil policy at one time was not to collect the annuities. I do not want to go to chapel meetings for proof of this.  I will content myself with the debates in this House.  A statement was made here on the 2nd May, 1929, by the then Minister for Agriculture.  He alluded to Deputy Fogarty who, I think, still adorns the Fianna Fáil ranks.  The then Minister, Deputy Hogan, said that &ldquo;he preferred Deputy Fogarty, Deputy Mullins and Deputy Corry.  Their attitude, he thought, was much more honest.  There is not,&rdquo; he said,&ldquo;the same amount of pettifogging about it.&rdquo;  I am quoting from Mr. Hogan's statement in Col. 1347 of the Debate for 2nd May, 1929.  Mr. Hogan went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Here is what Deputy Fogarty said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>When Mr. Hogan, the Minister for Agriculture, was in Clonmel recently, he did not give much heart to Mr. Morris's motion.  The motion we will put forward is to pay no land annuities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That drew from Deputy Fogarty the interruption: &ldquo;And only right, too.&rdquo; Then Deputy Fogarty, apparently, disappeared from the House while numerous columns were spoken.  He made his reappearance later, having probably been coached that his statement was an unwise statement.  He intervened to explain, and the explanation ought to be attended to.  On col. 1434 Deputy Fogarty, in reply to Deputy Rice, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>My view upon this is that until such time as the annuities are retained in the Irish Exchequer the farmers ought not to pay the annuities.</P>
    <P>Apply that to the present situation. What is the policy of Fianna Fáil as understood and announced by Deputy Fogarty?  No payment by the farmer.</P>

      <P>The then Minister for Agriculture also referred to what Deputy Corry and Deputy Mullins talked of.  It is an interesting ringing of the changes.  The motion supported by these two Deputies was:</P>
      <P>That the time has arrived for the revision of the Ultimate Financial Settlement of March, 1921, between Great Britain and the Free State; and that meanwhile, in consequence of the depressed state of agriculture, a moratorium be granted in the matter of the Land Annuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry does not say &ldquo;do not pay.&rdquo;  Being better educated he talks of a moratorium.  However, that is old.  That is 1929.  That was when the enthusiasm was being engendered for the policy.  That was the period when the Fianna Fáil Party decided that they had better take up a gentleman called Peadar O'Donnell, who first <Col N="1818" /> seriously promoted such a policy.  He is the originator of the non-payment of the annuities.  We have that proved in a document, published as a Paper of this House, recording that gentleman as saying at a meeting of people who were Deputies or who had at some time been Deputies and who had not taken the oath, and were not going to take the oath, but some of whom subsequently took it&mdash;a heterogeneous collection of people&mdash;that &ldquo;Government as an idea does not appeal to me, a Government in action is required.  Let us,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;take some form of tribute, such as the land annuities, and refuse to pay it and then we will get strength.&rdquo;  He knew his crowd.  Fianna Fáil got their strength on that, with, of course, an odd man here and there to go around and make himself out as the sainted exception.  Deputy Moore is in favour of making the farmer pay.  But he does not know whether there is a legal case for retaining the annuities. Apparently, he thinks it right that the country should be put into turmoil over the retention of the land annuities, whether there is a legal case or not.  He will vote solemnly for the two million to help the country out of the difficulties he got it into through his supporting the retention of the money.</P>
    <P>The policy moves on.  The papers of August 1st last contained reports of a series of meetings held all over the country.  Although the points are not all the same, I should like to quote a few extracts.  The President, strong for lucidity, went to explain the economic situation to a big meeting at Limerick.  He said:</P>
    <P>Over and above what we can consume in this country in the way of agricultural produce we have to find a foreign market for the surplus. Where should we sell it?</P>
    <P>That was a rhetorical question and nobody in the crowd answered him. This is his own reply on that.  After it, can one wonder the crowd felt bewildered?</P>
    <P>We should sell it to whatever country is prepared to make a <Col N="1819" /> bargain with us for it on the terms that we will take from them what they want to sell if they take from us on decent terms what we will sell.</P>
    <P>However, one point is clear, there is a surplus to be got rid of.  Apparently we are going to make trade bargains on that surplus.  The Press report goes on to say:</P>
    <P>In that connection he reminded them that we bought four or five million pounds worth a year more from England of her manufactured goods than she bought from us.</P>
    <P>If that is so, one of his Ministers will have to be called to account because I had asked a question previously on that very point and had been given two sets of figures which showed that in the twelve months June, 1931, to May, 1932, the balance was two millions against us in this sense that England bought from us two million pounds worth of our stuff more than we bought from her.  That, too, was a bad year from England's angle of view.  If the trade of the years 1928, 1929 and 1930 is averaged, balancing United Kingdom goods exported here against Irish Free State goods exported to the United Kingdom (and Northern Ireland), on the average Great Britain bought from us from seven to eight million pounds per annum more than we bought from her. The President's figures are, however, good enough for a Limerick open-air meeting where refutation is unlikely and so he quite in accurately says:&mdash;&ldquo;We bought four or five million pounds worth of goods from England more than she bought from us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was a second point stressed at these meetings.  The Minister for Defence and the Minister for Justice see eye to eye on at least one thing.  The Minister for Defence still feels that we are in the happy position in this country that we are not going to starve, no matter what action the British may take.  We have more food of some descriptions than we can very well consume.  Listen to this&mdash;manna for Dundalk:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1820" /> If we eat it all we would have to build new doors to get in and out of our houses.</P>
    <P>That is economic truth as it is spoken in this crisis by a responsible Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, who &ldquo;is going to see this fight through,&rdquo; as he announced at the beginning of his week-end meeting, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The worst that can be said is that we will have a superfluity of food. We will have too much to eat. People will eat butter who perhaps have been eating margarine for a long time, and people will get fresh meat who otherwise would have to wait until Christmas to get a bit.  I am dealing with the thing in its worst aspect and I am putting it before you in its blackest colours.</P>
    <P>It is when one understands the mentality that was responsible for that that one can pardon the Minister for Justice as we know him saying this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>At first he favoured arbitration as a means of settling the dispute between the two countries, but now, since the British had forced the fight, and when he saw that wonderful spirit shown by all sections of Republican opinion throughout the country, he was against arbitration.</P>
    <P>What follows here is in inverted commas:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am ready now,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;to see this fight through and I think we will all remember with pride the stand which has been taken spontaneously by the Irish people and by all Republicans.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In that connection I should point out that one paper reports the President as saying at Limerick that the Irish Government had submitted their claim about the annuities to lawyers &ldquo;who staked their reputations on the opinions they gave.&rdquo;  I am assuming that these reputations are now in the Suspense Account with the annuities and possibly their emoluments also are there held.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney-General made his debut in Cork and he announced:</P>
      <P>I do not want to disturb the serenity of the proceedings at Ottawa, but I think we will get very little out of it, and I think you will find that time will tell that we were wise in boldly proceeding with our policy of tariffs and not waiting for it.</P>
      <P>Having said that, the Attorney-General went on to plead in this most extreme way:</P>
      <P>We are entitled at least to ask from the Opposition at this crisis that if they will not give the backing of their tongues, let us have the mercy of their silence.</P>
      <P>He requires more even than that mercy from what we have seen of him. Deputy Flinn had a personal experience. He said: &ldquo;It was the commonest experience of life that so long as the weak would cringe so long would the bully kick.&rdquo;  I am sure his mind then was going back to his old days in the British Army.  The Minister for Justice had this to say to the people at Galway:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;He had got letters and even telegrams had reached him urging him to stop certain people from speaking in public as they were speaking and to stop certain scribes from writing as they were writing, but he had not responded because he had enough confidence in the good sense and patriotism of the Irish people not to fear their listening to any speech or reading any paper.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That can be read two ways.  I also have the same confidence in the Irish people.  Deputy Derrig, the Minister for Education, on one point showed some appreciation of fact, some so-briety of judgment.  He said &ldquo;that the cattle situation was a very difficult problem to deal with, but they hoped to deal with it by intiating other measures that would enable farmers to turn their hand to assist them more beneficially to the country.&rdquo;  He said further&mdash;and I wish Deputy Norton were here to hear this&mdash;that &ldquo;while he was not going to enter into the merits or demerits of nationalisation he would <Col N="1822" /> say that when the State took over and ran an industry, that industry was going to be very expensive, perhaps far more expensive than it would if it were run by private individuals.&rdquo; The Minister for Lands and Fisheries added and obviously had to add an atmosphere of mystery to the whole thing.  &ldquo;I am not going,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to divulge at the moment what those defensive measures will be, but you may rest assured they will be taken to meet any attempt by England to defeat the Irish people.  There is no reason for fear and no reason to beg for mercy.&rdquo; These extracts summarise the policy expounded by the first mob of Fianna Fáil orators let loose on the country after the Government had forced this policy through the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The President is satisfied that we are going to have a surplus of agricultural produce and that there is a problem as to how to dispose of it. The Minister for Education is specially concerned about cattle.  For the rest of them, the Minister for Defence is happy in the thought that everybody is going to be rotund and merry, and the Minister for Justice feels also that the worst thing that can happen to us is that we shall die from satiety.  The Minister for Lands and Fisheries has defensive measures up his sleeve which will not be divulged until the proper time comes, and the Attorney-General all the time demands the mercy of our silence.  What is all this rubbish about having more food than we can consume?  What does it amount to?  There is probably going to be cheap food of various types in the country.  Who is going to bear the brunt of the cheapness but the man who produces it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>And he is going to get none of the £2,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And if he is going to get none of the £2,000,000 and if, as producer, he gets not what he is accustomed to get, but something less than the cost of his production, is next year going to see him continuing his production?  Apparently we are all going to be like camels piling <Col N="1823" /> up sufficient in our humps to last until we get to ordered conditions again. The Minister for Defence has said and he is now joined by the Minister for Justice that we have more food than we can consume and the implication is that though we may lose our exports we are going to be better fed. It must be obvious to the merest tyro in economics that, if I have a surplus in production and if I have to sell it at less than the cost of production I will go out of production next year, and that is well known to those Ministers who put before the public this nonsense about having more food than we can consume.  The President, at any rate, is perturbed about the surplus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me recount three phases through which we have gone in this matter. First, it used to be said that, though it was recognised that Britain could impose taxes on the surplus we exported to her markets, the British never would in fact put such taxes on, that they never would dare do this.  The phrase used in this connection was: &ldquo;They do not buy from us for the love of us.  They get from us only what they cannot get elsewhere, and they, therefore could not tax our produce.&rdquo;  But now we know that they have taxed them so we must hastily shuffle off that track.  The next move is to the argument that we can discover alternative markets for our produce.  But I notice there is now used in this connection a phase and a setting that were not used before the beginning of this month. There was an exhortation by the President in Limerick last Saturday to the people &ldquo;if they saw an alternative market, let them grab it.&rdquo;  There was also his statement yesterday that while we are searching for an alternative market we need this money. Apparently we have not yet got those alternative markets although when Fianna Fáil was politically in the wilderness its paper every week discovered a new avenue to new purchasers. We were then advised that we could get our surplus produce disposed of anywhere we liked.  It was so good that there were people who, on <Col N="1824" /> economic grounds, were ready to buy all that we could send to them. Wher are they now?  The third phase we have now reached.  Since our first hope has not been fulfilled and Britain has in fact taxed our goods and because our second also has led to disappointment and we realise we cannot get an alternative market, we have got to work a huge economic change, a complete change in our production so that for the future we will not be depending upon foreign sources for some of our supply and will not have to sell abroad as much as we are now selling.  That will be probably found in the end as false and as deluding a suggestion as either of the other two.  For I must repeat and stress again that there was a time, and not so long ago, when there would have been an uprising of back and front benches of Fianna Fáil if anybody dared to assert that England might find it impossible to tax goods of ours going into that country.  It was regarded as the last word in treachery, and equally it was regarded as the height of folly, to say such a thing in the situation as it then existed.  The facts are there now to provide the answer.  It was equally a subject for mirth if one suggested that if there were alternative markets they would have been found out by good business men long ago.</P>
    <P>We were told again and again that it was only because of certain shady influences that were around and about the Government and the country that these markets had not previously been found, and the statement was made by a man who is now a Minister that if it were not for actual dishonesty on the part of the Government these markets would have been found long ago.</P>
    <P>Now we cannot, as we have a new Government, attribute the failure to find these markets to any of these shady influences.  Where are we to find a market for anything we have surplus to our own requirements?  What does this surplus amount to?  A sum of £28,000,000 used to come into this country as payment for goods produced here which we could not sell at home.  We received, as a matter of fact, more than £28,000,000, but allowing <Col N="1825" /> for supplies of agricultural produce that were imported into the country, the balance that remained after paying for these supplies was £28,000,000. We had an income of £28,000,000 annually from that market.  That market has very nearly gone completely. We are just on the brink of its complete and entire annihilation. We are going to feed the people of this country with that £28,000,000 surplus and neither the Minister for Defence nor the Minister for Justice appears to think that there will be any reaction from that on the producer.</P>
    <P>This debate has centred mainly round the land annuities.  I want to bring the House to a realisation of the fact that if the land annuities were out of the way, if the land annuities question were settled and done away with, we still are faced with the loss of that market in which we ordinarily disposed of £28,000,000 worth of goods. We have conferences going on at Ottawa.  We sent a delegation out there.  We sent them out unprepared. We sent them out having received no notification from any Government except Australia and Southern Rhodesia. We are going to do everything on the spot.  We are going to have conversations and memoranda passing while things are allowed to drag along here. The Conference meetings have been proceeding, and in their proceedings where are we?  I must say that, when I first heard that this economic conference was to be held at Ottawa, while I realised the precarious position in which we had placed ourselves by our antics on the oath, I had believed that Ottawa might not, in the end do us much harm, because I thought that all the discussions at Ottawa were going to be coloured over by one great anxiety&mdash;a drive on the part of the Canadians and Australians with regard to the entry of wheat into the British market&mdash;and that in the wheat melée our other interests would not be prejudiced.  The Conference has been under way now for nearly a fortnight and we have this surprising fact suddenly emerging&mdash;that both the Canadians and Australians have made up their minds that wheat is no longer the pivotal point upon which deliberations <Col N="1826" /> are to move, so far as they are concerned.  They have both stated&mdash; although one more resolutely than the other&mdash;that neither preferences nor quotas for wheat matter much to them any longer.  The Australians have stated that through their farmers and through their representatives at the Conference.  The Canadians have stated that clearly through their farmers, but not so clearly through their representatives at the Conference.</P>
    <P>If Deputies read the papers, they will see that there is still a push being made with regard to some small preference or quota in respect of wheat by Canada.  But what has the Conference turned upon in the main?  In the main, it has turned upon meat and dairy produce.  The Committees divided themselves on the first day of the Conference along the following lines: that where Britain was to argue her points to the Dominions, Britain preferred to meet the Dominions singly, and for these discussions would not meet the Irish Free State at all. When it came to the Dominions urging any point, the arrangement was that the Dominions were to argue that point&mdash;whatever it might be&mdash;as one combined group.  For that combined group the line of division there was a division on the views on the subjects to be discussed and Committees were set up (1) on meat&mdash;that is to say, beef&mdash;and certain other products of a meat type, (2) on butter and eggs, cheese, bacon and (3) on other things in which we are not interested and which I shall leave aside for the moment.  The Dominions were to make their case on each of these subjects and present their reports as a group to Britain as to what preferences in each subject they wanted on the British market.  What was the Free State position in that respect?  We are told that, on their own initiative&mdash;I suppose they got in first by a short head&mdash;they decided that it would be embarrassing for the British, while present conditions lasted, if they took part in these discussions, but they intimated that they would like to be associated with the Committees because it would give them information on which they could found trade <Col N="1827" /> agreements with the other Dominions, excluding Britain.  And so the situation out there developed to the point &mdash;day after day, one can follow it in the papers which record what has happened&mdash;that the Committee upon beef has almost reached conclusions and is presenting these, probably to-day, to the British Government and that the Committee dealing with butter, eggs, cheese and bacon has reached conclusions upon the first two of these things and is likely to reach conclusions on the others at once. These memoranda are being presented to the British.  In these memoranda, we do not join because we are not permitted to join.  A conference therefore that, to anybody who had experience of previous conferences and of the controversies that went on between the Dominions and Britain, appeared certain to them upon the position of wheat on the British market, has now suddenly turned into a drive by the Dominions to get in Britain a preferential position for their meat, bacon, butter and eggs.  New Zealand is pressing her case on those points.  Australia is pressing her case vehemently on those points, and Canada is pressing her case most vehemently on cattle, but also with some vigour on the other points.  The Irish Free State on these points of vital importance to her economic existence has no representations to make because she will not be allowed to make them. One other point must again be stressed.  It is not the land annuities that is stopping progress at Ottawa. If the land annuities question were completely cleared off, the Ottawa problem would still remain.  The British say &ldquo;You broke one agreement, that about the oath, and we will make no further agreements with you; why should we imagine that a treaty made in Ottawa would have more sanctity than a treaty made in London?&rdquo;  This House may be witnessing, without knowing it, the complete annihilation of our cattle trade.  It is certainly witnessing, if not the annihilation, the partial destruction of our trade in butter and eggs and everything allied with bacon, a <Col N="1828" /> new and surprising item that should be taken into consideration when Ottawa is being thought of.  The English made great preparations for this conference.  They had committees going upon it.  Their economists wrote about it and, in the main, the economists' views as to what might emerge from the conference were summed up in the monthly review that appeared in June.  Most of them had the same point of view&mdash;that there should emerge from the Conference a Commonwealth group, tied together by material bonds, by mutual preferences given at that conference, one to the other.  But it was also asserted on behalf of the British group that there were two other groups that had to be borne in mind.  One was in the Argentine. It is stated that the amount of British money located there is not less than £500,000,000 sterling.  The other was the Scandinavian countries.  The Scandinavian countries were only dragged into the argument by these writers because they believed that, possibly, Denmark with some shade of difference in the preferential treatment would have to be allowed a good and secure footing in the British market. Towards the end of last week, the trade supplement to the London &ldquo;Times,&rdquo; summing up the results of the Conference to that point, said that there had emerged this, as the big item.  It was recognised that there was every likelihood of a preference being given on meat and the only point left for consideration was whether they would get from within the Common-wealth all the meat they wanted.  And in that contest this phrase, which must sound very ominous to Irish ears, or some suggestion like it&mdash;I do not pretend to quote accurately&mdash;was used: The British consumer for a long time past has come to realise that chilled meat is a great deal better than frozen meat, that chilled meat commands a better price than frozen and has better qualities than can be looked for in frozen meat and that if it is not yet commercially possible for New Zealand and Australia to send meat in chilled condition rather than in frozen condition, there was, luckily, the Argentine, where £500,000,000 of British capital <Col N="1829" /> was sunk, willing and able to supply all the chilled meat that Britain could eat.  We are footing around with the oath and the discussions at Ottawa are going on the basis of a preference in the British market for meat, butter, eggs and all pig products while we are not being asked by the British what our views are on anything.  We have ourselves, in an excess of delicacy, decided not to put forward to the British any demands as to what we want on the British market.  There was a delicacy that was late in coming but, at any rate, it shows that those who had no appreciation of the position when sitting in a Government front bench here have, in Ottawa, an appreciation of the ludicrous position in which they have placed themselves.  They there realise that you cannot damage your best customer in his pride or break an honourable engagement with him and hope to get a favourable trade agreement with him while that is going on. According to the last account I have read in the London &ldquo;Times,&rdquo; three points fall for consideration almost immediately at Ottawa.  Is any larger preference than 10 per cent. going to be given to Dominion products?  The answer to that was, undoubtedly.  The second question is to what range of goods not now brought under these preference rates must the preferential rates be extended and that is also why it is clear that the preferential rates should be extended to articles coming within that preference and the third was to the operative date and as to whether that could not be brought nearer again extending this period to the earlier date of the 15th November.</P>
    <P>Let us now see our side.  There is going to be a preferential rate for beef in the English market, and we are not going to get that preferential rate, which means that there is to be a preference against Irish beef in the English market, even if the land annuities were out of the way.  A higher percentage than ten per cent. can be given in this preference, and where the preference is higher than the ten per cent. already given it will be against our goods if the land annuities were out of the way.  That is a situation in which we meet to discuss giving power to the Executive <Col N="1830" /> Council to spend two millions of money in any way they like&mdash;two millions of money raised from where we do not know, but probably raised by those new tariffs devised and which means raised by the people of this country.  Hence it means that instead of getting a remission of two million pounds from us this year we will have two million added with the additional four and a half millions mentioned in the Budget which are to be paid by the people, so that we shall find ourselves down eight and a quarter million from what was promised.  No longer do we hear they cry that Britain dare not tax our exports or the reassuring cry that there are alternative markets.  Now we are to have a new situation.  The whole economy of the country is to be turned topsy-turvy from which it is hoped that something new may emerge.</P>
    <P>What are the new plans?  Deputy Norton tells us there are none.  Everybody knows that there are none.  Their plans, of course, will be new tariffs with what result they do not know.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Neill dragged in appropriately enough reference to the Russian situation.  I find it impossible to equate what is taking place there with what is likely to happen here. What has happened in Russia?  There you have a country with resources that are illimitable in comparison with what we have.  The people joined their forces under a military bureaucracy. They had a plan for ten years' time and they are depending upon confiscation to a great extent.  I fancy in Russia also they did not find the peasants there were threatened with having too much to eat.</P>
    <P>The peasant who is only a serf has been brought under the machine of the bureaucrats.  They have been thrown out of their homes to rot and die; their farms confiscated, and more fortunate people put above them.  And in the end, what happened to Russia? They have year after year to impress upon the farmers the necessity of supplying the Government with enough goods to send abroad in sufficient quantities to purchase their imports. Why does Russia now want these goods for export?  Because it became <Col N="1831" /> plain to her that she must send something abroad to get the machinery and other materials that she wants for the re-creation of her State.  They have robbed the peasantry of their property and their goods and of their food.  The Minister for Defence thinks that we will have enough food to force down the peasants' throats.  The Government will create new markets and a highly organised industrial State will be erected upon what there was before. Russia has not been able to do, despite her illimitable resources, in ten years what this country sets out to do in two years and with the expenditure of £2,000,000 in two months while the Dáil is out of session.  There is to be an expenditure of £2,000,000 of money in two months.  I wonder is the rate to be progressive and is there to be an extra £12,000,000 a year, and when will the end be.  As Deputy O'Neill said in Russia at the back of the revolution and at the back of the Russian movement you had people who thought all this; they had some plan.  They were noted throughout the world as the Intelligentsia in that particular area.  We have not seen any evidence of that profundity, of that experience in business or of that capacity in handling anything that would make us believe that the group opposite has either the knowledge or capacity of the Intelligentsia in Russia backed up with the illimitable resources and food crop and business plans applied to the objects to which they set their hands.</P>
    <P>That is one example.  I will now take another.  Some of the Central European countries have been the bane of Europe's existence for years past because of their instability that expresses itself there in money wasted economically and politically as a result of all these things.  Only a couple of years ago the whole of the countries of Europe were brought together in order to try to rehabilitate Austria.  Plans were concocted and presented to them at a meeting at Geneva for their approval.  The plan was that Austria had unfortunately founded herself upon the production of cereals and the markets were saturated. And the countries that seemed <Col N="1832" /> best able to weather the storm that had burst upon European communities were the countries that had gone in for the production of live stock and live stock commodities.  Therefore the economic friends of Europe gathered together there decided that Austria must be given the help required to enable her to change over from wheat growing to cattle raising.  And the League of Nations by means of funds at its disposal rendered assistance, financial, economic and agrarian to that country.  A couple of years passed and yet Austria was not much nearer to a change over from cereals to cattle and now they have no League of Nations help and no money except what they gathered from their own people.  They had experts but we have only those to be found on the front bench opposite and yet we are to get this country turned round from its present methods of production to something else whatever that may be so we will not have to look for markets for export of agricultural produce and will not need to buy some of the other stuffs that come in here to-day.</P>
    <P>According to the peculiar statement made by the President in Limerick &ldquo;We should sell to whatever country is prepared to make a bargain with us on the terms that we will take from them what they want to sell, if they take from us on decent terms what we will sell.&rdquo;  Where is the place that will do that? What are we going to sell? Whatever we sell we will not be selling it to Governments unless we sell it to Russia.  What Government is going to make any agreement with us?  What is likely to happen is not that Governments will buy from us but merely that we will have to go to the best possible trade in whatever country it may be.</P>
    <P>There is no country in the world which at the moment has not got most favoured nation agreements, and if that is so how can we get better prices in these countries?  We have only to turn to the trade returns to see what, in the face of the most favoured nation terms, we have been able to sell to those countries.  Of course there are countries with which we could make special agreements, assuming <Col N="1833" /> there is a country that wants to make an agreement with us about any item of our production and wanted to give us favourable terms.  Every one of those countries, it must be remembered, is tied to its surrounding countries by most favoured nation clauses and whatever they give to us, in the way of special treatment, must be immediately given to every other nation with whom they have most favoured nation agreements.  And do you think that the nation that has erected a tariff barrier against butter is going to come forward to give us a lower tariff for our butter?  If they did that for our butter it would automatically break down their regulations for all other butter coming into their country.  I do not think these things have been thought of.  It is a case of going ahead helter skelter; new markets are to be opened up and all the rest of it.  Do they expect that new tariff barriers are going to produce new markets?  What is the new system of production going to be?  I see that the wheat nonsense that we heard so much about at one time is now being resurrected.  I see that the wheat nonsense, which we thought had been overlaid for all time, has now been resurrected, and the people in the West of Ireland are going to be helped to grow wheat and efforts are to be made to enable them to direct energies to a new form of occupation. The Limerick people also are to grow wheat.  As Deputy Norton asked, is there any plan?  The one glimmering of sense that there has been since the Dáil rose last was the statement that came from the Minister for Education that if there was going to be nationalisation it meant more extravagance and more expense in the long run.  I only hope that it will be borne in on Deputy Norton's mind that the Government is against all these policies of nationalisation that that Deputy seems to favour so much.  We are told often about the mandate that Fianna Fáil looked for from the electorate. I want to read one that they may have forgotten.  Item 6 of their programme was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>To negotiate trade agreements that would secure for our products <Col N="1834" /> preference in foreign markets, always subject to the condition that the protection required for the maintenance and development of our own agricultural and manufacturing industries will not be lessened.</P>
    <P>Then this follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The people of Britain and ourselves are each other's best customer. Our geographical position, and other factors, make it unlikely that this close trade relationship will rapidly change.  Machinery and other capital equipment for our industries will have to be purchased from abroad.  We can in these purchases accord a preference to Britain in return for a preference in her markets for our agricultural produce.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A later poster, which promised security to everybody in the country, promised this specifically to the farmer:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A guaranteed market and guaranteed profitable prices for a large part of his marketable produce, increased competitive power resulting in increased exports.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now we are against increased exports, only because it has been found to be folly.  We are going now to saturate the home market with everything produced and to buy only from the home market.</P>
    <P>We have got no indication from anybody as to how this money is to be raised, nor have we got, from those responsible for the plan of the two million pounds fund, any idea of how it is going to be spent.  Does the House know that Senator Connolly has nailed America to our mast? America, it seems, is going to help us in all this struggle!  Senator Connolly is regarded as the economic brains of the Ministry.  We had a little specimen of the protrusion of those brains to-day in the Bill that dealt with the Control of Manufactures, and it was not a pleasant spectacle. Worse than all, we have this in addition, that behind all this talk and footling arguments there is this&mdash;the most dangerous thing which we have to contend with.  There is a belief that members from these benches <Col N="1835" /> opposite are inspired.  They do not need to think out plans; that it is only human frailty to think out the road on which they propose to travel. The divinely inspired man can set his feet anywhere.  The divinely inspired man&mdash;the enthusiast&mdash;is the most dangerous man that any country has to deal with.  The enthusiast and his doing run all through the pages of Greek and Roman literature.  He is always depicted as the man who did the most damage&mdash;the man who believed himself inspired by God to do certain things.  In our times that is the type of man who fills the asylums and mental homes.  That is the kind of mentality which we are dealing with, the mentality that scorns plans, that believes it can do anything.  We cannot even take example from nations around us, for people who believed themselves divinely inspired found to their country's cost that the inspiration was lacking when the moment of trial came.  It is not an unusual feeling that runs around.  I quoted in this House before, and I want to quote it again, that there are people who believe that &ldquo;politicians as a whole believe that if only they can be possessed of sufficient political power, they can do anything.&rdquo;  And then the single phrase follows &ldquo;Even to the avoidance of the logical consequence of their own economic actions.&rdquo;  It is said further by the economist who wrote that &ldquo;that the politician believes that, given complete power, he can in a short space of time bring about a complete change in the institutions of the society in which he finds himself.&rdquo; Then, as this economist remarks at the end of that phrase, &ldquo;this naïve idea will be found to be at the root of every modern Utopia and every modern aim.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That is what we are up against.  The Deputy is one of the enthusiasts&mdash;the men who believe they are inspired.  Let them continue to believe that they are inspired if it will give them aid, but let them be a little more lenient with this House and give <Col N="1836" /> us some glimmering of their plans, some idea of their objectives, some idea of the time which we will have to go through before the new situation arises and some definite idea of the amount of money that will be required to keep people sustained before the change over takes place.  Two million pounds we are told.  Yes, that is during the period that the Dáil is out of session.  That is a period of two months.  I asked before, is it going to continue at that rate?  Is it going to be a million a month and, if so, for how many months?  We are going to raise it by tariffs, probably.  And there used to be an argument that these tariffs would only hit our opponents and not ourselves.  I ask, what is the difference between the tariffs for the purposes of the Budget and the new tariffs which are going to raise some millions and that off our own people's backs?  In that connection, I would like to end with a quotation from a phrase used by the greatest anti-tariffite this House has, Deputy Dowdall.  Deputy Dowdall accompanied the Attorney-General on the platform when the Attorney-General pleaded for the mercy of silence, and after the usual preamble that we were winning and were bound to win, he said:</P>
      <P>There was one happy condition in their fight and that was that they had got the common people behind them, pretty well the whole of them.</P>
      <P>He continues:</P>
      <P>The people who were with the enemy in this fight were the people who had money, who had businesses, who had something to lose.  Well, he did not mind if they did lose it.</P>
      <P>That, from Deputy Dowdall, is good.</P>
      <P>It was out of the common people of this country that they made their money and it was their duty to join in with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want this last phrase to sink into the minds of the people who heard the Minister for Industry and Commerce elaborate arguments to show that tariffs would not be taken out of the people here and that tariffs would not bring benefit to the industrialists, but only benefit to the country and to the <Col N="1837" /> employee.  Deputy Dowdall said:</P>
    <P>And of the firms who had got tariffs, who were waxing fat on them and were getting more money than they ever expected, he would say, without putting any tooth in it, that they were damned swine if they did not back up the Government to win this fight.</P>
    <P>Let us end on that.  Tariffs are going to be used to get this money and there are certain people waxing fat on them and they are what he called them if they do not back up the Government in this fight&mdash;the people who have anything to lose, with businesses and with money are what Deputy Dowdall described them if they do not back up the Government in this fight.  That is the best answer I can make to what I started with&mdash;the other cry that people were acting treacherously in this whole matter if they spoke out their minds and said that, clearly, this was not a national issue but mere sordid grab in order to get certain people's reputations made and to legitimatise a certain person's past, and that we do not conceive it to be any way on our national consciences that we should speak our minds out on such a matter as that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has ranged over such a wide field that I do not propose to take the points in the order in which they have been made by the different speakers.  I can only deal with a few of the more important matters that have been referred to.  The first criticism has been that sufficient information has not been given to the Dáil as to the purpose to which the money that we are asking for in this Vote will be applied. It is not possible to give, as I indicated at the very start, any detailed estimate of the amounts that may be required as the emergency develops, and, in a sense, it is not advisable that we should indicate, in advance, the exact nature of the steps that may have to be taken.  Everybody recognises that one of the difficulties in a democracy shows itself most clearly in times of crisis and, particularly, when these crises affect relations with an outside State.  I have heard suggestions made during the debate that we <Col N="1838" /> are aiming at a dictatorship of one kind or another, and suggestions, particularly, that I, personally, had always leanings in that direction.  I want to say, at the very start, that, so far from having any belief in dictatorial forms of government, I am a firm believer in demo racy as the only form that is able to last through.  I am a firm believer in democracy as the best form of government in the long run, and it is because I believe in democracy in the long run that I do not want to see the hopes of democracy in general blighted by trying to persist in times of crisis in what is, in fact, an unreasonable demand upon democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody who has given any thought whatever to forms of government has realised that democracy is weak in times of crisis of this kind, and special provision has almost always been made in democratic forms of government to give the Executive powers which will make it stronger than it would be under ordinary democratic rule in these particular times and for these particular occasions.  If we have got to reveal, in advance, to those who are opposing us, to the external opponents of this State, every step that the State proposes to take in its self-defence, it means that, for the most part, these measures can be countered and they will not, in fact, be measures of defence at all.  Therefore, even if it were possible, and I candidly admit that it is not possible, to give in detail any estimate that could be depended on in relation to all the various measures that may have to be taken, I would say that, in a time like this, it would not be advisable to give it, and I have given the reason.  You will have, in times like this, either to lose your chances of success or you will have to give to the Executive ample powers to take protective measures.  The Executive will have to come before you afterwards and give an account of its stewardship. Within two months or so, the Dáil will meet again, and the Executive Council will have to give an account before the Dáil of whatever steps it may take and of whatever money may be spent.  What we are asking for, then, is not an unusual measure of trust.  You are, <Col N="1839" /> as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Flinn, said, expressing your democratic rights here and now in giving over, for this time, discretionary power to the Executive in accordance with the terms of that Estimate.  The general purposes are indicated.  It is not possible and it is not advisable to give more information than we have given.  If you have not an Executive Council worthy of trust, then you should get some people who are worthy of trust.  Whatever people you get, if they are to deal with a crisis like this effectively, they must be trusted for the time.  That is our case as regards the giving of information.</P>
    <P>With regard to the emergency itself, most of the hardship that has been referred to as existing at present is not in any way due to this emergency. It is the result of conditions which have been gradually getting worse for years.  It is not now we have indicated that we thoroughly realised the plight the farming industry was being reduced to.  We have been trying for years to get the people, and the Executive that was here, to realise that the condition of the farming community was getting so bad that it could not possibly continue, and leave our farmers with anything like a decent chance of getting a livelihood.  We begged the former Executive Council to use the resources of the country and, particularly, to come to the help of the farmers.  For instance, that was the plea we made when we brought in our de-rating proposals, that the very existence of this country depended upon the condition of our farmers, and that it was the duty of the community as a whole to stand in and to prevent that industry from being destroyed.  That was the purpose of the Stabilisation of Prices Bill which was introduced a short time ago.  That has been our attitude for the agricultural industry the whole time.  I say that the conditions that have been referred to by Deputies on the other benches are conditions, in so far as they exist at the present moment, that have been developing, and that would have been here in any <Col N="1840" /> case, whether this particular state of tension with Britain existed or not. If we had speeches such as were made here, in two or three months time, then it might certainly be argued that the condition was one that had directly arisen out of the present situation.  It is not possible to state truly that the depression and the distress in our agricultural industry are due directly to the present situation with Britain. We saw that situation developing, and it was one of the reasons that made us make part of our campaign in the last election that moneys which were not due from this country were not to be paid, because the country could not afford to make these payments.  The magnitude of these payments relative to our income was stressed in speech after speech.  The statements of British Ministers admitting that were adverted to.  The statement of a former Prime Minister of Britain, Mr. Baldwin, was quoted, in which he admitted that we were exporting, on our revenue, sums far greater than sums Britain herself would export.</P>
    <P>It was because we could not afford to make gifts of this character that we said to the farmers, that if there was to be any relief these moneys must be retained here, because we cannot give the help required to this principal industry if we are compelled to export such large sums every year.  We asked why we should export these moneys, if they are not in fact legally due. Notwithstanding the assertions made on the opposite benches, I still hold that they are not legally due.  I hold to that after having studied as much as a layman could the opinions expressed on both sides.  Here and now I contradict the suggestion made by Deputy Fitzgerald, and I think by Deputy Hogan, that I believed in my heart that these moneys were legally due.  I believe quite the contrary.  I believe the case made by our lawyers is a sound case.  The British themselves did not attempt to take the opposite view.  If they did, then their attitude would be a different one. I take up the attitude that this country cannot be committed without the consent of Parliament to payments such as were made.  Parliament was <Col N="1841" /> not consulted.  This was a secret agreement. It was marked secret.  That does not matter.  Several documents are marked secret.  They are secret until revealed.  I am not making any point about what is written on the face of the document.  That document as a whole was not revealed to the Irish people.  It was not revealed to this Parliament.  You will find nowhere on the records of this Parliament that that document was discussed, or that the consent of the Parliament to the agreement was got.  Is it not an extraordinary thing that this document of 1923, which is made by the British the basis of their claim, was never once referred to in the case which was made by the late Attorney-General and by the lawyers on the other side?  Their plea was quite a different plea, the plea that Deputy Hogan makes, until this agreement was brought to light. It was only brought to light, as far as I was concerned, when it was mentioned in Mr. Thomas's dispatch.  A search had to be made for it in the files.  It was not extent until published in the British and the Irish records. In no volume of records can you find that agreement published.  It is not a White Paper.  It does not appear in the Dáil records.  There was a passing reference to it when an estimate which was on the Order Paper was brought in in 1923 in which Deputy Cosgrave made some excuse for not bringing it in until the Dáil was about to adjourn. He said that it was a small matter and not really worth talking about. &ldquo;In this estimate,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we are going to pay the annuities for a little time.  This estimate is one which is concerned solely with accounting transactions as to which no controversy can arise, and I hope that the Deputies will accept the estimate and enable me to make the payments.&rdquo;  That estimate appeared in the House when there was in the offing the Ultimate Financial Settlement, to which the people were looking forward as the final clearing of accounts between the two countries.  I have spoken to some Deputies who were on the opposite benches at that time, and they admit that they did not understand the full significance of what they were then <Col N="1842" /> doing.  This estimate was passed as lightly through the Dáil as it was possible to pass it&mdash;an estimate for paying over £3,000,000 in land annuities every year.  Nowhere in the Dáil records and nowhere in the public records can you find that agreement as a whole.  It was referred to in passing a piece here and a piece there. I think the British Government, as I said already, asked that it should be submitted in some case or other, and that certain parts were to be pasted down.  Why was this kept from the Irish people?  The ex-Minister for Agriculture will say &ldquo;Oh, they did not implement it.&rdquo;</P>

As the President himself said, whether it was secret or not does not matter twopence; for the purpose of this argument, the other clauses of that agreement do not matter twopence.  What we are concerned with here is whether that part of the agreement dealing with the land purchase annuities was brought before the Dáil.</P>

      <P>What is clear on the face of this is that by the device of getting an estimate passed for a single year the Dáil was led to commit itself, apparently in Deputy Hogan's view, to the payment of these annuities. That is a position that I, for one, will not accept.  The position we take up is that the people of the Free State cannot be committed by the Executive Council to continue payments of that kind without the ratification and full approval of the House.</P>

      <P>There was the appropriate fund, but the appropriate fund might mean anything, and it was held by some people to be the ordinary fund until the final settlements were made.

      <P>That was not the line of policy the Deputy proposed to take.  The line of policy was this&mdash; that the British Government is only a broker.  They said that this is only between the stockholder and the farmer. On the one side, the Irish farmer, and on the other side the stock-holders, and if the land annuities are not handed over, the Irish farmers are breaking one of the Commandments. That was the case made and not once in the whole dispute until it was revealed by Mr. Thomas did this document appear in the arguments of the people on the opposite side as a legal basis on which the British were entitled to the land annuities; I refer to this document of 1923.</P>

      <P>Apparently, the members on the opposite side and others have quite misunderstood. There was no intention in my mind of conveying that those who spoke were making the British case at all.  I was not following on that line.  I was simply stating that Mr. Thomas was making the British case and, as Deputy Hogan has stated, they were making it quite well.  They have relied on a document that was never mentioned by the people who are making a case here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What were the lawyers in for? Was it to state a moral case the lawyers were engaged by the last Executive Council?  They were to state the legal case, and not once in that whole case has England's right to keep the annuities, based on that agreement of 1923, been referred to. It was not referred to once.  What was referred to was the Ultimate Financial Settlement.  The Ultimate <Col N="1845" /> Financial Settlement is the form that the British rely on for the payment of these moneys, and the Ultimate Financial Settlement is referred to, and how?  As if it had no effect whatever. I forget the exact words, but it meant this: That it had nothing to do whatever with the payment of the land annuities&mdash;that it was only concerned with the payment of income tax, or something like that.  Yet this document is put away quietly by the lawyers who advised the preceding administration as to the basis of this claim&mdash;that is, the secret document of 1923.  Our answer is that the people can only be bound in matters of that kind by their Parliament, that no Executive Council and no Minister has a right to give away the revenues of this country without full Parliamentary sanction.</P>
    <P>That is our position.  The British Government may take up a different position.  I know that their Executive in regard to treaties and foreign relations has very extensive powers.  We are not accepting their constitutional practice as it applies to this or to any other matter.  A week or two before the Ultimate Financial Settlement of 1926 was signed you had a resolution amended and passed here in the Dáil.  The former President, Deputy Cosgrave, himself, introduced an amendment which was of a declaratory nature, to the effect that the Executive Council could not, in matters of that kind, commit the State without the sanction of Parliament. A week or so after bringing in that amendment in the Dáil, and after having it passed by the Dáil, members of the Executive Council go over to London and sign an agreement called the Ultimate Financial Settlement. They keep that Settlement hidden for eight or nine months from the Irish people and the Irish Parliament.  It was only revealed here after it was first revealed in the British Parliament in answer to some question. Now the British may say &ldquo;that does not concern us; that is an internal matter as to what may be your constitutional practice or rules.  We have got your signature here to a certain document and we are going to hold you <Col N="1846" /> to it.&rdquo;  Where are we to come in?  Are we going to continue a payment of that kind?  Is the nation going to continue that payment under an agreement executed in that fashion?</P>
    <P>I gave an example here before. Suppose you had a company, and that the manager of that company, believing that certain moneys were due, paid over these moneys and agreed to continue the payment.  Supposing a new manager came along and, on examining the matter, doubted whether these payments were due, took legal advice on the matter and the legal advice given was that the moneys were not legally due.  Supposing the first manager, in attempting to sign any agreement of that kind, acted ultra vires, what would the new manager be expected to do?  What would the Board of Directors, charged by the shareholders, so to speak, be expected to do?  Would they be expected to continue the payments? Would they not, naturally, take up this attitude: &ldquo;These payments are, we are advised, not due from us.  The party that claims the payment has to make good his claim and until he makes good his claim we will not pay the moneys&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>That is the attitude we took up.  We said that the Irish people cannot be justly committed by that agreement. It was referred to in the British House of Commons, where it was partially revealed on one occasion as a purely provisional agreement.  This is the purely provisional agreement, confirmed by a document which one of the representatives of the late Government said had no reference whatever to these payments.  It is in such circumstances that we are expected to continue to pay this money.  We said to the Irish people: &ldquo;We do not believe this money is due.  You cannot afford to pay it; you cannot afford to make a gift of that magnitude.  It is bad enough to have to pay it if you are committed to it, but when you are not committed to it why should you pay it?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We went before the electorate and we said, as a part of our programme, that, convinced as we were that these <Col N="1847" /> moneys were not legally or morally due from the Irish people, we would not pay them until Britain had made good her case.  We proceeded, the moment we were elected as a Government, to carry out that programme with scrupulous regard to the pledges we had given.  We said we would not pay until Britain had made good her case and as long as this Government is in power we are not going to pay until Britain has made good her case. That is the position.  That was known to the world pretty well.  The British might not have had what you might call official notice of our intention until I gave it in a dispatch.  That is true. It was in a dispatch of mine I brought that matter up.</P>
    <P>The Oath has been mentioned here to-day.  Until it was brought up here again the other day there was not a word heard about the Oath.  There was not a word about the Oath from the British when I saw them last.  It was not referred to at all; there was no reference whatever to it, but now it is being brought up once more.  As the Oath has been brought up again, our attitude with regard to it is and will remain this, that it is purely a domestic matter, that it is not an infringement of the Treaty.  The issue, so far as we are concerned, is this, that it means for us internal peace to have that Oath removed.  My attitude towards all oaths in matters of this kind is that even if we had a Republic in the morning and there was a question of taking an oath to the established form of government which would exclude any member of the community from being represented in that Assembly, I would object to the Oath. I believe that is consistent with right democracy.  I believe that oaths of that kind are contrary to the real, fundamental nature of democratic government and representative government and, on principle, with the knowledge I have got of the working of these things, I would object.  I say once more that the Oath has nothing to do, good or bad, with the question of secession.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the other challenge that has been put up.  It is suggested <Col N="1848" /> somehow that if there was not this political background to the present situation there would be no difficulty. What exactly is the political background? Since we were elected as a Government we have tried as scrupulously as we could to honour our pledges.  Of course, Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald sneers at mandates.  He sneers at us because in a matter that affects the interests of the people generally we go forward as a Party and ask the people to elect us to carry out a certain programme.  The people elect us and we proceed to carry out that programme.  If we do that we are sneered at.  I am quite willing to admit that if a Government has been elected to carry out a certain programme and if it fails to carry out that programme, having really tried&mdash;if it is incapable of doing it&mdash;it has nevertheless done its duty.  I can easily conceive occasions when one's duty to the people would best be done by saying definitely to them, &ldquo;I cannot carry out that mandate,&rdquo; by telling the people plainly and flatly that you cannot do it, by saying to them, &ldquo;I was wrong when I thought I could do it. I have tried and I have failed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Speaking for myself, I have not come to that position either with regard to the land annuities or any of the other issues&mdash;I am very far from it.  I believe we can implement our policy by pursuing it determinedly, by not expecting to have omelettes without the cracking of eggs.  There are, of course, some people who would always like to have their omelettes but not to crack any eggs.  I, for one, fully realise, and I told the people more than once, that it will require determination on our part to succeed with this programme.  If we have that determination and if we go ahead with it, we can succeed That is the position.  If we fail, it will not be because the thing is impossible in itself but because, for some reason or other, we thought we were going to have an easier road than we are going to have and then, when we find out the real nature of the road, we give up.  No nation can make progress if it enters lightly on difficult tasks and then gives up.</P>
    <P>We have to survey as best we can <Col N="1849" /> the road ahead.  It is possible we have not all foresight enough to anticipate every difficulty.  There is no human being who has.  Unexpected difficulties will crop up, but the main difficulties, at any rate, ought to be apparent to any person.  It ought to be apparent to anybody that the British Government were not lightly going to surrender the £5,000,000 a year which they were getting easily.  They were only going to surrender it when the securing of it meant hardships or difficulties for them of one kind or another, which they were not prepared to face.  That is the truth.</P>
    <P>In holding these land annuities I knew perfectly well that we were going to be faced with a situation somewhat like this.  This situation, remember, might have arisen if there was never a question of land annuities.  I pointed that out before.  Deputy Fitzgerald said that Great Britain in doing this was only exercising her sovereign right.  I suppose no matter what coercion one State exercises on another it is only exercising its sovereign right in doing it.  Leaving that sort of argument, the full force of which I do not understand, aside, it is obvious that Great Britain, if she wanted, could have put on tariffs against us for any reason.  Owing to the fact that we were, in order to build up industries, putting on tariffs that were shutting Great Britain out to a certain extent from our market&mdash;it was not done in any spirit of enmity to Great Britain, but because it was vital for the maintenance of our people here that it should be done&mdash;there is no doubt that the British by that would be losing to a certain extent their present market, and the British might have in retaliation started a campaign such as they have started about the land annuities. If we are not prepared to defend ourselves in the case of the land annuities, and to put up with the hardships that arise in connection with the campaign, would we do it in case of retalition for the system of tariffs we were forced to adopt in order to build up our industries?  If we are not prepared to stand by our rights in matters of this kind, then it is quite clear that <Col N="1850" /> the British, any time they want to force us into any line of action that suits them, or prevent us from taking a line of action which does not suit them, could resort to this weapon.</P>
    <P>One thing that has appeared from this situation is the amount of our dependence upon Great Britain and the danger of that dependence and the necessity, in the national interest, as quickly as ever we can, to get out of that position of dependency.  The question is: can we do it?  I dare say it is true that Deputies on the opposite side will be as anxious to do it as we are.  It was preached for many years that we should try to find alternative markets.  I dare say if there were favourable markets they would have been found in the ordinary course of business.  They probably would.  I am willing to admit that.  I should like to say now, and it is well that people should know it, that I see little prospect of establishing alternative markets (Deputies: &ldquo;Hear Hear&rdquo;). That is the truth.  I see little prospect, but one thing I do see is that it is worth a tremendous effort to try. I want to satisfy myself that everything that can be done to look for them, to find them, to establish them, will be done.  I do not think we ought to be blamed for doing that.  There is nothing that I can see&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard of many things that were tried before and yet it is by trying again you get there. We are not satisfied that it has been tried as thoroughly as it should be tried.  If we fail, you will have your day of trial.  You can say you were better able to anticipate the situation than we were.  Well and good, we are willing to face that.  We will have to account when there comes to be a question of expenditure of money in trying to get these markets, and if there is failure to get them, you will have your day of trial and will be able to say, &ldquo;We told you so.&rdquo;  With the full knowledge that we have of the difficulties, that is not going to prevent us having our try and we will stand the criticism of any failure that may result from it.  I said we are trying in this case to take defensive action <Col N="1851" /> and we want this money in order to do it.  From day to day it may be necessary. I hope myself that it will not be necessary to spend much of this money. I assure Deputies on the opposite benches that if there is any mistake made as far as we are concerned probably the biggest criticism that will be made is that we have been too conservative or will be too conservative.  I believe that we are much more likely to be open to just criticism on the ground of being too conservative in a situation like this than being the reverse. I do hope that, though we are getting powers to use that money, it will not be necessary to expend much of it.  But, if we should decide that it is necessary to expend it, then it will be there, and we will not be held up for want of money.  If I were a member of the Opposition, I would say, &ldquo;Give them their chance; do not hamper them for want of means to carry out their policy; give them the opportunity they have asked for; if they succeed, well, at least, the nation will benefit; if they fail, we will be able to bring them anyhow before the bar of public opinion.&rdquo;  I think that is fair.  I do not think that members on the opposite benches by giving this power to the Executive are, from the narrow point of view, or even from the wide point of view, doing anything that they need regret, anything that they need have any qualms about.  I believe it is good policy on their part and good policy for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have, however, digressed somewhat. It occurred to me to deal with this question when I mentioned the Oath.  There is this political background. Were it not for that, you could walk up quite easily to Mr. Ramsay MacDonald and say, &ldquo;We are hard up; do not be too hard on us over this £5,000,000; do let us off; it is very difficult for us to pay.&rdquo;  In the first place, I do not think that either Mr. Ramsay MacDonald or any other British Minister is as soft as that, or that petitions put in that form are likely to be listened to very much.  I do not believe it.  I may be wrong. They may be more generous and soft-hearted <Col N="1852" /> than I have found them, or than I give them credit for.  But, at any rate, it is suggested that they would be that generous and soft-hearted that we had only to show we were going to be good friends with them and everything was going to be all right.  I have said that is not my experience.  As far as the political background is concerned, they know what the political background is just as well as Deputy Hogan.  He knows that we went to the electorate and gave a definite pledge to the electorate that there would not be any further constitutional move, if you like to put it that way, than those we mentioned to the people without again consulting the people.  In other words, that the Treaty as such was not an issue in that election.  Neither was the question of secession.  It was plain by our actions that we did not consider that the issue and our attitude towards the question of the Oath and of the refusal of an Empire tribunal would be the same if I was as loyal a supporter of the Treaty as Deputy Cosgrave for the simple reason that I believe that within the Treaty we had the right to remove the Oath.  As regards the whole situation, I believe that we have a perfect right to say that whilst we are the Government that is our line, but we are not going to say to anybody, and if we did we would be foolish in saying it, that a future Government&mdash;ourselves as a future Government or anybody else&mdash;is not to go any farther.  That question has been mentioned many a time in many generations of Irish politics &mdash; the question of &ldquo;thus far thou shalt go and no farther.&rdquo;  Only one answer can be given by conscientious Irish nationalists, and that is &ldquo;No man is going to set bounds to the onward march of the nation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Until there is another election we have promised to act within certain bounds and certain lines.  We are keeping within them.  That is all we are to be asked.  We can, in fact, enter into no further commitments and we can give no further promises.  If this Government were to give a promise what would it be worth?  Does not the whole thing depend ultimately on the <Col N="1853" /> sentiments of the mass of the Irish people?  Does not the whole thing depend ultimately on whether the advantages to be got in this association of equal partnership, as they call it, are such that the Irish people would prefer them to the advantages of complete independence?  That is what it depends on and neither I nor anybody else can make a promise as to what the Irish nation will consider its advantage in five years or ten years' time.  If this connection which exists at the moment with the British Empire is going to persist it will persist because of its inherent advantages to the Irish people and for no other reason and it will not persist because I or somebody else may presume to give a promise as to what the Irish people will do.  Having said that, I do not hesitate to state what my attitude is.  Deputies on the opposite benches used to sneer at me because I at one time said I was not a doctrinnaire republican.  I think Deputy Hogan says that I am not a republican at all.  When he wanted on one occasion to express how little something was he said &ldquo;as much as I was a republican.&rdquo;  Of course, we could go into a long argument as to the meaning of &ldquo;republican.&rdquo;  All I have ever striven for as far as Ireland was concerned at any time, and I have made no secret of it at any time, was the right of the Irish people to determine freely for themselves what should be their governmental institutions and what should be their political relations with outside States.  That is all I ever worked for.  The day the Irish people can freely make that choice&mdash; when I say freely I am not looking for that sort of freedom that can only be got in another world; I am looking for the sort of freedom that can exist in this world &mdash; I say that when the Irish people are given an opportunity of freely determining for themselves what their governmental institutions shall be and what shall be their political relationships with other States I, for one, will be satisfied.  I never bothered a bit about forms of government.  I have referred to democracy in a broad sense.  I am in that sense a democrat, but I have <Col N="1854" /> never made any particular fetish of one form of government over another. Why did I stand for the Republic? For the reason that the Irish people in the face of desperate odds did by democratic choice choose the Republican form of government and there was none other that I could see that they could have if they wanted it.  To all those who say that there was no Republic I would say there was a Republic as far as a Republic could be established by the will of the people themselves.  Those of their representatives who could meet met and declared a Republic.  At another election it was definitely put before the people to support the Republic.  Those who say there was no Republic are right in the sense that it did not get international recognition but it is wrong to say that it did not exist because it was not internationally recognised.</P>
    <P>If the foundation of government is the will of the people themselves in their own country, then there was a Republic here and there is no getting out of it.  At the very start when the Sinn Féin organisation was formed, when there was a controversy with one of the national elements at the time as to whether there was to be a republic or not, my own attitude was that the form of government was for the people themselves when they had got a free choice and, in the circumstances, I could see no choice made by the people if they had a free choice except that of the Republic.</P>

      <P>That is all tommy rot.  Parrot phrases are of no value to anybody.  These were simple phrases that were used during a certain period as useful for propaganda for the gentlemen on the opposite benches. Somebody had a sneer to-day&mdash;I think it was Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald&mdash; about looking at his own heart.  About three minutes afterwards one of the Deputies on his own benches said that he was able to judge of the situation <Col N="1855" /> as to what the Irish people wanted by examining what he himself as a typical Irishman wanted.  Except people are willing to play with phrases there is nobody going to be deceived by nonsense of that sort.</P>
      <P>I think I have explained both my own personal attitude and the position of this Government and what it is committed to before the people and if it is going to secure a political background then let it be so.  What does anybody else want I would like to know.  I have indicated that we can give no promise and that if we did it would be of no value&mdash;that until the coming election the constitutional position we put ourselves in we are prepared to abide by.  Otherwise, I would have gone with quite a different programme to the election.  We would have put quite a different issue to the people and what the issue will be at the next election remains to be seen. The one thing I am certain of is that if my sole aim was to get finished with any connection with Britain, good, bad or indifferent then I would welcome such action as the British Government has taken, because of this position of dependence.  They are using this position of dependence in order to show how much we owe them and how impossible it is for us to get away from them.  I tell you that there is another side to that which tells us something else.  It tells us that we must get away from them if we are going to have our independence.  If every time there is an issue between us they are going to use coercive measures of this kind, then, clearly, no matter what hankerings anybody may have after the connection, the thing for us to do is to get rid of it as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The statement of the present Attorney-General in England, Sir Thomas Inskip, has been referred to. I have got a newspaper report of that statement and one of the first things I see in it is &ldquo;What God has joined no man can separate.&rdquo;</P>

I was just going to remark that it is extraordinary that the very people who say that no man can separate Britain and Ireland, although the Irish Sea is between them, these self-same people did not see when they were even separating six counties from the other twenty-six in Ireland that there was a joining by God, if ever there was one.</P>

      <P>Nonsense.  They not merely partitioned six counties from the other twenty-six, but Ulster, that sacred Ulster of theirs, they partitioned as well.  When they talk about no man separating what God has joined, let them think of what they did in this country.  The next thing I find in the statement is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>If there could be a clear and sincere declaration of the desire and intention of the Irish Free State to stay within the Empire on the basis of their constitutional position and in a spirit of loyal partnership, no annuities or debts could cloud the prospect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is all very fine, but when we claim co-equality in that partnership we are supposed to have, then they say: &ldquo;No; you are bound and fettered by the agreement which was made <Col N="1857" /> with us in 1921.  You are held to be static in that position.  It does not matter how the rest of the Common-wealth may develop.  No matter how much we indicate to you about that co-equal partnership, in fact you are subject to us in the manner we have prescribed and compelled you to accept by our superior force.&rdquo;  They cannot have it both ways.  I do not know what may be the attitude of the Irish people.  I cannot foretell what the attitude of the Irish people would be towards a real co-equality in partnership. If there was a united Ireland here dealing with Britain, I do not know what the attitude of the people would be.  I cannot tell.  He would be a very wise man indeed who could tell, but from our history there is one thing I can say: there will be no satisfaction in that partnership and cannot be as long as this country is divided against the will of the majority of the people.  I feel I can say this also: that as long as there is a tittle of diminution from the full co-equality, then the Irish people's judgment will not be in doubt.  What it may be in the other circumstances, I do not presume to tell.  If there was an election to-morrow, I would take my chance in complete independence, and I would sacrifice&mdash;the people may not agree&mdash; the advantages of the partnership for the advantages of independence.  I would be willing to put up with the disadvantages just as a man might be who was asked whether he wished to be a serf in the lord's demesne or to be a cottier.  He may say to himself: &ldquo;If I am a serf in the lord's house I may have plush seats and I may have occasional wines and so on.  But if I become a cottier in my own home I will have to give these up.  I may have to depend on plainer food.&rdquo;  He might have to use plain furniture instead of the carved mahogany of the lord's mansion.  He might have to depend on plain, deal furniture in his own home.  If I were asked to take my choice in that way&mdash;I am not asking anybody to follow me, that must be decided by the people&mdash;if I were asked to take my choice, I would choose to be as Denmark and Switzerland <Col N="1858" /> are and to be in the position in which these countries are rather than be in a position where, if I have the advantages of the partnership, I have very many of the disadvantages as well.  At least there would then be a hope of being neutral in big Imperial wars, a position in which we cannot hope to be under the present circumstances as far as I can see.  It is a rather important choice for the people but no person with any sense of responsibility or any sense of truth can go farther than I have gone to give a clear unequivocal statement of our position.  This Government maintains that position as long as this Government is in office.  When we surrender our office, our responsibilities are surrendered also, and let those who come after us deal with their period of office. I hope that will help to get rid of any misunderstandings there may be</P>
    <P>Now we come to the immediate question of the solution of this difficulty or the settlement, if you like, of this dispute.  I explained to the House on a previous occasion that there appeared to be only two ways, one arbitration and the other negotiation. Arbitration has broken down and on what?  Sir Thomas Inskip says that I am resolved not to agree to a tribunal wholly drawn from the Empire.  He later says: &ldquo;He will not agree to the wide choice offered within our world-wide and varied Empire of an arbitrator.&rdquo;  He evidently wants to make out that I am given a wide choice.  I am giving him a wider choice.  It is not I who am narrowing down the choice.  He can pick his people from anywhere he chooses, but as far as we are concerned, we insist on the right to pick ours anywhere we choose.</P>
    <P>Is there anything inexplicable about that?  Does it mean that this Government is aiming directly and immediately to bring off secession?  It does not.  Just as I said a short while ago, that if I were in a Republican State I would oppose an oath being forced upon Deputies in a Parliament of that State, so here I say that if I were as loyal a member of the British Commonwealth as, say, Deputy Cosgrave or Deputy Sir James Craig is, <Col N="1859" /> or anybody else, I would still insist that, in a matter of this kind, one party to the arbitration is not going to take his nominees from the area selected by the other.  It cuts at the very basis of arbitration.</P>

      <P>Therefore, I will not change from that position, and I do not think that any Irish person wishes me to change from that position.  I do not believe that our opponents on the opposite benches wish me to change from that position, because they know as well as I do that there are questions which may yet have to be submitted to arbitration, and they do not want the arbitrators to be in a position in which there might be bias, conscious or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next question is about negotiation. I think that nobody could give greater evidence than I have given of our willingness to negotiate&mdash;to meet and discuss the points of the issue and to see each other's point of view.  I have done that.  I have been explaining the points of view in public and in private until I am tired of it.  I agree with British Ministers in that regard, that mere talk about things will not get you anywhere.  You have to get down to details in order to solve the question. I offered when I was in Britain on the last occasion to arrange immediately for representatives of this Government to go over and meet representatives of the other Government, go into this matter in detail and examine its merits, provided that there was a state of affairs which would give any hope of success.  What was necessary for success?  Here we were coming in, for instance, to-day, taking measures to defend ourselves, as the British were taking measures to defend themselves.  If steps like those had to be taken and were being taken while negotiations were going on, what would be the result?  Is it not quite obvious that negotiations could not be continued profitably under such a state of affairs?  You might as well have negotiations while the war was going on.  If there were a truce and one party during the truce was taking steps of one kind or another to defend itself, <Col N="1860" /> it would be regarded as want of good faith by the other side.  Therefore, I said &ldquo;All right; we are quite prepared to enter into negotiations; we are quite prepared to examine this matter and give our point of view.  Let it be examined thoroughly, step by step, but we must have conditions in which it will be possible to get to some end in the matter.&rdquo;  I suggested that if they took steps such as the imposition of these tariffs, it would threaten our existence; it would mean a state of war and we would have to take counter measures to defend ourselves.  We could not sit down here and wait until October would come along, when Deputy Gorey's half million cattle would be ready for sale.</P>

      <P>Our first payment was due and we had either to pay over the money or hold our ground and say: &ldquo;We challenge the issue here and now.&rdquo;  The time was fixed independently of us.  There was no possibility of manæuvring on the question But there would be grave danger of manoeuvring if we entered into negotiations and our hands were tied while the hands of the British were free to inflict what damage they could upon our industry by the continuance of these tariffs.  Therefore, I said: &ldquo;Yes, we are quite prepared to enter into negotiations but we want conditions which will make it possible to succeed and one of the first things is to remove suspicion.&rdquo;  I shall say for myself&mdash;I am not an over-suspicious person&mdash;that I would be desperately suspicious <Col N="1861" /> if I saw any delay in the negotiations or any waiting for the time when we would be in the middle of our difficulties, while we were bound in the meantime not to take steps which would mean defensive action.  I had no purpose in my mind except to get conditions that would make for success.  The tariffs were only just coming on that night and I proposed that they should hold their weapon in the air and let the thing stop.  The answer was, of course, &ldquo;you pay over the annuities.&rdquo;  I know the difficulty.  I can see the British point of view as well as the gentlemen on the opposite benches can.  I saw the case they could make.  They made that case.  Their answer was, &ldquo;Very well, there is just one and a half million pounds of annuities which you are to pay over.&rdquo;  I said &ldquo;Our credit is sufficient for that, at any rate.&rdquo;  I said also, &ldquo;Lest there be any question as regards our credit if we are adjudged liable, you have got further security in the fact that the money is being preserved in a separate fund, ready to be handed over at any time.&rdquo;  That brings me to another matter.  That position cannot continue indefinitely. The complaint is being made that our farmers are paying twice&mdash;that they are paying into this contingency fund, on the one hand, and paying by way of the British tariffs, on the other.  It is quite clear that we cannot, as a Government, continue to retain this money in a suspense account for an indefinite period.  We have kept it there as evidence of our good faith. We are keeping it there for a reasonable time.  When a reasonable time has elapsed, we will have to use these land annuities.</P>

      <P>Let us go into this question.  It is just as well to get it cleared up.  It has been suggested by Deputies on the opposite benches&mdash;and suggested in a most irresponsible manner when they know what is involved &mdash; that the present Government, when they were in opposition and during the election, suggested to the farmers that these <Col N="1862" /> annuities should not be paid.  No such suggestion was made by anybody I know of.  I believe it was made in the Dáil.  I have been told it was made in the Dáil, but I do not think anybody took it seriously.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember that on the first day I went down to Clare to initiate the campaign for the retention of the land annuities by the State, I made quite clear, beyond any possibility of misrepresentation, that the farmers owed them to the community or to the State, that they were a debt from the individual farmer to the State.  Thinking that the farmers would not be attracted by our programme when the individual had to pay to the State, Deputy Hogan&mdash; Minister, as he then was&mdash;talked about this sort of thing &mdash;&ldquo;It does not matter to the farmer whether he pays across to England or to de Valera.  It does not matter a pin as long as he pays.&rdquo;  I had myself to get up and to expose that fallacy on the platform by indicating to the farmer that if they were retained in the community Treasury, indirectly, it would be a benefit &mdash; a benefit which the community, as a unit, would give to the particular class, to the particular individuals, in their own good choice, and as a result of their own will in the matter.  On every platform on which I spoke I went out of my way to hammer home that and to indicate that the retention of the land annuities by the State did not mean the retention of the land annuities by the farmer.  If there is any campaign in that regard for the retention of the annuities by the farmer, it is a campaign carried out mainly by Deputies on the benches opposite since this Government came into office, and it is carried out deliberately, in order to embarrass the Government.  I have said that it is the duty of the farmers to pay to the State. The State, acting for the community as a whole, and the Executive Council, acting as an Executive, has to do everything in its power to come to the relief of one section, if that section is particularly hard hit now, and to the relief of another section again. <Col N="1863" /> But the money must come from the individual into the State first, and there can be no remission of these payments at the present time.  Whatever relief can be given otherwise, there is going to be no remission of these payments. It is not hard to give several reasons for that.</P>
      <P>It may be difficult for some people to pay.  Individual cases may have to be examined in the future as in the past.  But it is most important that the individual should get it clearly into his head that his annuities have got to be paid to the State.  What would happen if they were not?  Suppose that we were likely to give way to this campaign for the individual farmer to keep his annuities.  There are something like 87,000 holdings bought out under the Act of 1923.  I cannot tell straight off the total amount of the annuities that they pay&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>Nearly one million pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>£800,000, I am told is the figure.  That £800,000 is not included, at all, in the million-and-a-half. If these farmers are not to be put in a different position with regard to the others we would also have to remit their annuities, and that would amount to provision by the State of another £800,000 and much more than that, because my belief is that once the State surrenders its right to receive these annuities for any considerable period of time then it is never going to get them.  And if it is never going to get them what is going to happen?  What is to be the position?  The position is going to be that every step which the State might take in the future&mdash;that is the community&mdash;to advance money in this way would be nullified, because the example that would be set, by the refusal to pay land annuities, or by the retention of the land annuities by the farmers, would clearly be followed in regard to every other public decision and the State or the community as a whole would be rendered impotent to do what is particularly its duty, its main duty, and that is to give to the individual and to make available for the <Col N="1864" /> individual the credit that is possible on account of the collective responsibility of the community.  Further land division in these circumstances would be impossible.  Therefore, those who have any real regard for the interests of the community as a whole are not playing a fair part, if there are any doing so, who suggest that those land annuities should be retained by the individuals.</P>
      <P>The question of doles was suggested. If we were to proceed by way of doles, and to dole out this £2,000,000 to individuals who are hard hit, it could not be done.  There is no use in anybody thinking that the money could be used in that particular way.  I do not see how it could.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Gorey will envisage, instead of saying &ldquo;why not,&rdquo; the machinery by which we could distinguish cases that are genuine from cases that are false, and if he will give us the machinery by which that could be done, and if he will show us the way that we could help the lame dog, there is no one who would be better pleased than I would if I knew the way it could be done justly and fairly.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree to the principle if I do not see any way by which it could be done.  I should be only causing misunderstanding and raising hopes that cannot be satisfied. I do not want to raise hopes about a moratorium at the present time or about the dole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now as to the time this may last and Deputy Gorey's point about our suggestion of holding stock, I believe that anything I said did not convey what Deputy Gorey attempted to convey. I hope it did not.  When I spoke last on this, my attitude was, and I hope my words expressed it, that we should keep as near as possible to our ordinary, national life; that the farmer who has stock to sell, if he gets a fair price, should sell.  If there is an attempt on the part of traders to utilise the present situation to defraud the farmer, to give ridiculous prices, <Col N="1865" /> so that if he sold he would have to sell at such sacrifices as would entail such loss he should not sell, particularly if there is a chance of his holding out as there is a chance.  But it is not going to relieve the situation if as much stock as possible is held hoping for better markets, while there is no attempt on the part of traders to misuse the situation or to fleece the farmer.  The question is very difficult.  Individual choice in this matter will work better than any concerted action on our part.  The farmer is a fair judge of his own affairs.  In one case it may be better to hold out in particular circumstances; in another to sell.  My advice, at any rate, would be instead of holding out, owing to the critical situation that may arise later, if there are reasonable prices there would be great danger in holding out rather than in selling.  I should not like to be understood as giving advice to the farmer to hold out and wait until October.</P>
    <P>There was another piece of advice mentioned by Deputy Gorey or somebody else, that I would not like to take.  It was suggested this might be a short fight and could be easily settled in a week or a month, and that some persons are holding their stock because there might be an early settlement.  I would like them to dismiss that opinion because, willing as we are to negotiate and to try to get a settlement, there are always two sides.  No amount of willingness, on our part, will guarantee that the other side is willing to settle.  The only safe thing for us to do is to do what I told Deputy Mulcahy at one time, when he was Chief of Staff, during the old negotiations, his duty was.  I told him his duty was to get the Army up to the highest pitch of efficiency to defend themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words, as the President is dealing with the question of the negotiations again.  Sir Thomas Inskip states that the negotiations broke down because, so far as I remember Sir Thomas's words, the President took the view that the negotiations could not be profitably conducted while the tariffs were imposed.  The British reply was that they could not withdraw the tariffs so long as the annuities were being withheld. What I should like to know is, was there any alternative held out such as that the annuities would be given over to be held in trust by a third and independent party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>My attitude was that the credit of our country is good; that the money is there in a Suspense Account for everybody to see, and that, as far as we were concerned, I would do as I had promised the electorate, when speaking for the Party at the time we were seeking election, that the money would not be sent out of the country until Britain had proved her case.  I am keeping exactly to the promise that was given.  As long as the money is there in a Suspense Account for the whole world to see, it is a sufficient guarantee, at any rate, of our good faith, and any further <Col N="1867" /> point would be only making unnecessary difficulties, as far as I can see.</P>

I have no doubt that the people on the other side say the same thing.  We have got to put up with that, but I cannot understand why, when there is a difference of this sort, it is we who should always surrender.  That is the same sort of mentality that we had expressed a short while ago in the quotation &ldquo;whom God hath joined to gether let no man put asunder.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>To get back to what I was speaking about.  I was pointing out that the advice I would give the farmers was the advice I gave to Deputy Mulcahy on the occasion when there were negotiations taking place. The one safe thing for us to do is, as far as ever we can, to take measures to defend ourselves.  There is no other course.  If negotiations take place and are successful, well and good.  We will have lost nothing by this step.  I do not think the Executive Council ought to take steps which it will have to retrace. I would not have us pledged to something that would have to be sacrificed if there were to be negotiations. I believe that the steps we should take are steps which the nation would take in any case.  By working along that line, and as quickly as we can, we will be taking the sensible line to protect ourselves.  We will have taken the only step we could take to defend ourselves.  You can take your choice.  You can take the money out.  You can have peace on these terms&mdash;there is no doubt whatever about it&mdash;but if you are serious in your belief that these moneys belong to this country and that we must assert our right to them by every possible means, as we believe, then <Col N="1868" /> there is no line of action you can take except the line which we are taking. We are criticised for taking what any person who goes into the matter would see are the only steps that any people would take who are really in earnest.  We are in earnest.  We believe that we have a right to these moneys and that even if they were legally due it would be nearly impossible for us to pay them.  That is not the issue at the moment, however. The issue is that we are entitled to keep them because they are not due, legally or morally.  Because that is a fact, we are taking the action which we are taking at present, and I will put it to the Deputies on the opposite benches, if they have a sense of fair play, if they do believe that the Irish people are entitled to this, to point out in what particular we have done anything except what would have been done by people who are serious about the retention of these annuities.</P>

Is not that the usual <Col N="1869" /> plea when men are fighting for their rights&mdash;that those who lead them are simply living by this form of activity?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The next question is the question of negotiation.  We are quite prepared to negotiate, provided that the initial conditions which may give any hope for success are there. We cannot be negotiating at the same time as we are taking measures in this country to defend ourselves.  These defensive measures, in one way or another, are going to react on, and do a certain amount of damage to Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>And to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter whether we make that our purpose or not, the very defensive measures that we take, of necessity, will be doing damage, and it would be a rather peculiar position to have negotiations continued at a time when we were taking active steps which the British would say are going to damage them, and, if we do not take the steps, we are going to put ourselves into a position in which we will be getting weaker from day to day because of the lack of time to take measures to defend ourselves.  I will <Col N="1872" /> not take the responsibility for committing the country to negotiations under those terms.  If the British want negotiations, they can have them.  The money is there, clearly, in a Reserve Fund, where it will be retained for a reasonable time, and that reasonable time may flow away fairly quickly.  I was asked where this two million pounds was going to come from.  We will have to see, first of all, what the bill is and how much of it will be spent before we can take measures to get it, but if it is necessary, at a later stage, and if the British have not taken advantage of our offer of negotiations, then we will be compelled to use it, because we cannot put that further burden on our people, when their money is there and when the British are, on their own admission, paying themselves otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, that is the position.  I do not want to be aggressive in this thing at all.  As a matter of fact, I do not want to be repeating it, because, if I repeated it sufficiently often, instead of being believed, I would be disbelieved, and it is the truth.  From the very first day on which I had anything to do with Irish politics, the greatest hope I had was to see a time come when the peoples of these two islands would live, side by side, as friendly neighbours, and I believed in the policy of independence, because I held the view that they would be brought closer in their relations, and in a more permanent manner, by mutual advantage than they would ever be by force from one on the other.  I do honestly wish to see friendly relations between the two peoples.  I do not wish for this fight at all, but I do not want to see money, which the Irish people can ill afford, given wrongfully away.  We are defending, so far as we here are concerned, their interests in that.  That is the sum total.  So far as the British Empire is concerned, I have indicated what the policy of this Government is, and I have tried to speak as frankly as I could, both to the people here and to anybody else who may be listening. Apparently, now, we are going to talk to each other across the water. Very good, let it be taken that way. That is our attitude here&mdash;a perfectly <Col N="1873" /> friendly one.  We may speak about the spirit of Ottawa.  I do not know what the spirit of Ottawa is, but I know it is the same spirit exactly as the spirit in which we met the British representatives here and the same spirit in which we met them in England.  It is quite the same&mdash;no difference whatever. There has not been any of the acerbity that some people try to pretend there was.  There was nothing of the kind.</P>
    <P>With regard to contact, I am supposed not to have kept in contact.  I kept in contact so far as it was possible or of any value.  It is suggested here that I asked Mr. MacDonald to discuss the matter.  I did not, as a matter of fact.  I am not making any point on it but, as a matter of historical truth, I did not.  Deputy Norton knows that he rang me up in the middle of the night, one night, and said, in the presence of four or five witnesses, that it was suggested that Mr. MacDonald would like to see me about this.  I pointed out the hour of the night and that it was impossible to see my colleagues.  I gave a number of reasons why I could not go but, as the Prime Minister of England was ill, and was going on a rest holiday, I said, &ldquo;All right, I will go.&rdquo;  I did not go to the meeting for half an hour after the scheduled time, because there was some doubt as to the conditions under which the meeting should be held.  I do not want to make any point on it, but there are no punctilios like that keeping me away.  I am quite prepared to deal with these matters in a friendly way.</P>
    <P>There is another thing about this talk to which I should like to refer.  Conversations that were supposed to be confidential have been published piece-meal. I only want to say that that is not my wish and I want to say, in as mild a way as I can, in respect of this, my first experience of this sort of thing, that I was astonished, to say the least of it, at the fact that there was an ex-parte statement given by Mr. Thomas of conversations which were supposed to be private.  I do not want to make anything about it, but, if private conversations are to be <Col N="1874" /> held, I am quite willing to keep them absolutely secret and to give nothing to anybody.  I do not want to make anything about it.  If private conversations are to be held I am quite willing to keep them secret, and to give nothing to anyone, except that which has been agreed upon as a public document by both sides.  I have no complaint if there is rigidity in the matter. I admit that giving to the public piece meal information by one side or the other is harmful.  I have not given to the Dáil the information which it is my duty to give.  I have given it about conversations only when the example was set by another party to the negotiations. I have nothing to fear about that.  I do not care whether they are published or not, because the conversations I would have in private are precisely the same conversations I am prepared to have in public.  I have nothing to fear from them.  I want to say that I am not in favour of giving unauthorised publicity to conversations. It does not help negotiation when misrepresentation takes place. Piecemeal publicity is not helpful. Everyone recognises that it is not helpful. I have got used to it for a pretty long time.</P>
    <P>A variety of things was referred to. I have attempted to indicate the position of the Executive Council in asking for this grant, and to defend them in a way which Deputies ought to be able to understand against these attacks.  I ask Deputies on the opposite benches, as long as we are the Government, to give us just the assistance which we are entitled to get.  As they know full well it is a difficult task.</P>
    <P>That reminds me of certain questions about threats.  As far as this Executive Council is concerned it wants no threats given to anyone.  It can conceive of no greater damage to the country than threats of that kind&mdash; no greater damage.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>For instance, we all know that the British would have agents through the country trying to find out public opinion.  That is only natural.  Deputies yonder should know full well that they could interpret public opinion as no British agents could.  The only thing at present about their statements that I am anxious about is that the British might regard them as interpreters of public opinion greater than they are.  That is the danger, that in fact they might be taken to interpret public opinion when, in fact, by their attitude, they do not represent the temper of our people at the moment, because of a particular defeat&mdash;I hate the word, but I cannot find a better one to express what I mean.  The defeatist note in these speeches is not in our people but the British might be trying to take advantage of it.  The danger of the situation is that the expressions of public opinion by Deputies opposite might be taken by the British as expressing public opinion accurately when in fact they do not.  Mr. Thomas, who has been accustomed to win fights of a particular kind, or to lose them, as the case may be, owing to the breakdown of the morale of our people, might hope that he is going to break down that morale here.  In my opinion, he is not going to have any breakdown <Col N="1876" /> of morale here.  What I am afraid of is that unnecessary damage would be done through the British counting upon a public spirit such as would be in the country if the Deputies on the opposite benches really reflected public opinion, when they do not.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the I.R.A. and that there is some secret pact between ourselves and the I.R.A., there is not. Our attitude is that we set out deliberately on a policy which we gave the country in order to have unified direction.  That policy we engaged in at the time the civil war ended.  We made it quite clear that, in our opinion, there was only one way to unity of direction for the country, and that was by the acceptance of majority rule, and by acceptance by the elected representatives of the people, as determined by the majority, what national policy should be.  We stated that it was clear to every section of the people that they could freely elect their representatives and that their representative, could come to the national assembly.  There was no excuse for rejecting majority rule, and there should be no possible excuse for anybody refusing to accept the assembly of the representatives of the people as being the governing body. That principle we have worked for from the time the civil war ended. Day in and day out we built the Fianna Fáil organisation upon it.  That principle is the principle we are going to work upon, and we believe it will have the effect of unifying the country.  It is on the unified principle we depend for the future welfare, unity and peace of this country.  We are anxious naturally during the period that the oath is still here, that nothing should happen which would make it more difficult for that principle to be fully accepted.  And our actions are justified on that basis.  There is nothing we have done which would for one moment subordinate the elected representatives of the people to any body other than the representatives of the people.  We are here independent, responsible only to this Dáil and responsible to the people of the country, responsible for the policy that we openly proclaimed and responsible for none other; responsible in the position which we occupy to see that peace is maintained and that every citizen in the country is entitled to express his views.  We intend to act in that way as long as we are in that position.  As far as public meetings are concerned, <Col N="1878" /> there has been a suggestion that there has been interference.  As far as we can give protection at public meetings protection will be given; interruption will be prevented in the same way as it would be at our own meetings.  We cannot, of course, get people to come to listen to Deputies on the opposite side.  That is something we cannot do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>This arms question is a big question.  I know something about it and about the origin of it and about the tradition that insisted on the retention of arms.  I have tried to point out on more than one occasion that under present conditions arms could not be of value for prosecuting national purposes.  I have tried to point out time after time that under present circumstances arms cannot be used for national purposes except they are to be used first of all in internal warfare in this country.  I put this question to anybody who stood for holding arms: &ldquo;Do you want to use these arms in internal or civil conflict?&rdquo; The answer I have invariably received was &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  I said then: &ldquo;What do you want them for?&rdquo;  Now, suppose they are there to be used solely against an outside enemy, is it not as clear as daylight that under present conditions if arms are used to defend the people they can only be used successfully under the leadership of the elected representatives of the people?  They can only be successfully used when the elected representatives are leading; and if the Government for the time being is leading, will you not have sufficient arms for everybody who is willing to carry arms and everybody who is willing to bear them for the freedom of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore I have said that, to my thinking, under present conditions if those who are following the old national tradition consider that they are going to try the policy of getting freedom for this country by arms in that way they are living in bygone conditions.  A change has taken place.  When I tried in Thurles to show that, I told the young men that when they tried to get arms into the country, how stupidly they were leading them along that course, and I said: &ldquo;Do you realise that if this Treaty is passed if you attempt to use arms the first thing you will have to do is to use them against the Government of the country?  The Government will <Col N="1881" /> either have to abdicate to you or the Government will have to attack you,&rdquo; and therefore the first step I pointed out at that time was to consider what they were doing.</P>
    <P>But the gentlemen on the opposite side instead of trying to get that lesson, instead of wanting to end all the misery, tried to misrepresent me and misrepresent the arguments that I had used.  They come along now and try to ascertain my attitude towards arms. The moment the Treaty as such was put through and the State founded upon the Treaty was established, the moment that happened you had a new situation in Ireland, a situation that was quite different from any previous situation, a situation which immediately broke the traditions, so to speak, and broke the foundation for any arguments in favour of arms.  What was the proper thing for us to do to realise that situation?  Was it to try to work against the traditions of the people? Was it not to put forward a sensible programme by which those who wanted to go further towards national progress could do so?  The only way that was left us was to try to get a national assembly which was free; free so that every person who entered into it had not in any sense forsworn his views; and that he could come in here as a representative without forswearing the views he held as a Republican and then work to get a majority here in favour of a republic.  That is the whole foundation of the Fianna Fáil political policy as far as it is concerned with internal politics.  Therefore it is not necessary to ask me to-day what is our attitude towards arms.</P>
    <P>Our attitude is that we hope the good sense of the young people of Ireland will triumph and, when they are allowed to come with their representatives freely into an Assembly like this, without any commitment other than the commitment of accepting majority rule, it seems to me that there is no excuse whatever for refraining.  That is our policy.  We mean to go ahead with it.  We do not believe that any good purpose would be served at the present time by attempting to go after arms or to get arms.  We would not succeed if we <Col N="1882" /> tried.  We would create the same sort of position as was created here when our predecessors were in these seats and we would be handing down to a succeeding Government, whatever it might be, the same problem.  We hope that problem will be solved.  We hope the moment the Oath is removed everybody will see that the last justification for retaining arms will have gone and that this country will then have to advance and defend itself with the resources put at its disposal and under the direction of those elected as a Government by the majority of the people's representatives.</P>
    <P>We are working steadily for that policy and we are not going to be driven from it by any suggestions that we are favouring this or that body, that we are acting illegally in not pursuing those who have guns.  We are asked what are the guns wanted for. I have given the explanation that the guns are in their possession as a result of previous efforts here in Irish history to win the freedom of this country by force of arms.  There was no Government directly until the Dáil was established&mdash;the Republican Parliament. Previous to that, there was a secret organisation which armed itself in order to be able to use the only weapon that was deemed to be effective against an outside enemy.  That is the position.  Let us face it and realise the facts.  Let us forget the antagonisms that were created by the unfortunate divisions that followed the Civil War.  Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald talked about the authority of a Government, how it is derived, and the rest of it.  He said quite clearly in this House that he was a potential rebel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, sir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot get away from it.  He indicated that in certain circumstances he was prepared to be a rebel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Never against lawful authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Deputy himself is going to be the judge whether it is lawful authority or not.  I merely want to make this point, that there are people in the country who justified <Col N="1883" /> their action on exactly the same basis. All I ask Deputies over there to do is not to forget completely their past and the motives they had in the past. I ask them to remember that when they were younger men they had certain ideals.  There is in this country a large body of young men who are not able to cut things as finely and argue as neatly as Deputies over there.  I will ask those Deputies to remember that and to use their commonsense upon it and to be as just to others as they would like justice to be shown to themselves.  If they, under certain circumstances, feel they would be justified in rebelling, there might be others who would feel similarly.  I could make a case if I wanted to, but I do not want to do it; I do not think it would be good that I should make a case.  I could make a case on the premises that have been indicated by Deputy Fitzgerald.  I could show why people who have not accepted the authority of this Parliament were entitled to act as they did.  The first foot I would stand on would be the fact that they were excluded from representation.  That might be a false premise, but from a democratic point of view it is not unsound.  It may be, from another point of view, fundamentally wrong, but there are people who think like that and if Deputy Fitzgerald betrayed himself in showing that at the back of his mind he was getting to think like that, why should he not give some consideration to others?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I had better not enter into arguments of this nature at this stage.  It ought to be clear what the attitude of the Government is both so far as internal and external matters are concerned.  I confidently ask Deputies here, regarding the national situation, seeing it as it is, to give us their support.  If they give us that support&mdash;I wish to Heaven it could be unanimous&mdash;they will be doing <Col N="1884" /> the right work for the nation at the present time.</P>

      <P>The President, in attempting to answer a question which I put to him&mdash;and I put it in quite an orderly fashion&mdash;made a reference which I looked upon more or less as a personal reflection.

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble in this House is that there has been too much innuendo and, when a person speaks plainly, it sometimes happens that there is inferred from what he says a meaning that he never intended to convey.  I had no intention of conveying anything more than what I said, and what I said I mean.  I said that if Deputy Morrissey had been closer to national events he would have better understood certain things.  I <Col N="1885" /> mean by that that if he were actively or directly associated with the Volunteers in the past he would better understand the situation.  Perhaps he was&mdash;I do not know.  I believe if he were as closely associated with them as other people I know&mdash;people who are following us in this situation&mdash;he would understand it quite well.  That is all I mean.</P>
