      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state whether passports to visit Russia were issued recently by his Department to Messrs. Patrick Kelly (Transport and General Workers' Union), John Sunderland (Workers' Union of Ireland) and James Woods (Electrical Trade Union, Belfast), and, if so, if he is aware that the purpose of the visit was to participate in the celebrations of the fifteenth anniversary of the Russian Revolution.</P>

      <P>Passports to visit Russia were issued to Patrick Kelly and John Sunderland on the 28th October.  No application for a passport was received from James Woods. I am aware that the purpose of the visit was to attend the celebrations of the 15th anniversary of the Russian Revolution.  Refusal to grant a passport does not prevent people going to Russia, and it probably increases any feeling of sympathy for Communism which may exist.</P>

      <P>There is a sum of £25,131 5s. due to Cork County Council in respect of the second quarterly instalment of Agricultural Grant for the present year.  There will also be payable a further sum of about £23,000 in respect of the county share in the additional grant of £250,000 authorised by the Government in the current year.  The advance of sums on account of the second quarterly instalment referred to is under consideration. The distribution of the £250,000 additional grant must await the enactment of legislation which is at present in course of preparation.  I am aware of the overdraft position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister to state why he is not in a position to give this information?  Is the Minister aware that this or a similar question was asked during the last three weeks?  Am I to understand that when the Minister was exercising his prerogative &mdash; I do not know if it was the Minister or the Governor-General exercised the prerogative of mercy&mdash; he had not all the information that is asked for in the question before him?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>A similar question was not asked before.  I doubt if Deputy Morrissey can have read the question and, if he has, he cannot possibly have grasped what the question imports, the numerous files that have to be gone through and checked in my Department.  The staff relating to this matter consists of two men who ordinarily are fully occupied, and this throws a great burden upon them, as well as the previous question which I answered, showing the enormous number of cases in which the late Governor-General exercised the prerogative of mercy since 1925.  It threw a great strain on my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that he has not answered my question, whether the information asked for in this question is not similar to that asked for by another Deputy about a fortnight ago, and if it was not before the Minister before he exercised the prerogative of mercy?  If all the information asked for in this question, and in the question asked by a Deputy a <Col N="1902" /> fortnight or three weeks ago, was not before him, how did he exercise the prerogative of mercy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>My intention is to answer Deputy McGilligan's question. The prerogative of mercy in the cases referred to was exercised on my advice. In each case I went into the matter in the greatest detail, and went into it far more than is indicated in the question.  Of course, the papers have been put away and filed, some since last March, some since April and some since May.  It is now largely a matter of routine, picking out all the information again and classifying it in the way in which Deputy McGilligan desires to have it classified and made available to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

      <P>All the checking was done in each particular case.  The different features of the case were inquired into in the order of the Deputy's question.  I do not know what Deputies are suggesting.  Immediately notice of this question was <Col N="1903" /> received the staff of my Department was put on to the work.  As I said before, I intend to answer question No. 7 as I answered No. 6.  I am afraid Deputy Morrissey is not able to appreciate the amount of office work that was necessary for question No. 6.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the second time the Minister has shelved the whole question.  Surely when a Deputy puts down a question he would be expected to appreciate the details required. Does the Minister state that getting the details of question No. 7 is an easier task than getting details of a question which last week the Minister refused to answer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been some reference to the practice of the Dáil and as this is a very important matter it might be well to know what has been followed here.  When a motion is put down by the Leader of the Opposition, or by a person sitting on the Front Opposition Bench, and when the Government allows time, as has taken place very frequently in the last ten years, I want to suggest that the invariable practice has been, when a day has been given for a motion, that the mover gets from 10 o'clock or a few minutes after 10 p.m. to reply.  I want to state that there has been no exception to that rule.  It was suggested that there was an exception.  It was suggested that, in some cases, where a Deputy moved a motion because Cumann na nGaedheal was in office he did not get an opportunity of replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In every case where a motion of this kind was moved and a day allotted by the Government, the Deputy moving the motion was allowed to conclude as from 10 o'clock.  That was your own idea yesterday, sir, I think.  What happened was that that Deputy got up without opposition at 10 o'clock, and if there was a certain difficulty it was solved in not less than five minutes. <Col N="1905" /> But in no case was a Deputy given less than that time to conclude.  The important point is that that practice should not be broken now.  The Minister for Finance broke it yesterday by bringing the debate forward to to-day.  I submit that the Deputy should get a half an hour to reply.  If he does not need it, that is another question, but the practice is there.</P>

      <P>The understanding which I had was that those who did not get time to speak last night would get the opportunity to do so to-day. The Minister for Finance declared that he was going to speak out this motion until 10.30.  If he continues to-day and speaks it out until 4.30, neither myself nor the other Deputies here who represent the farmers of the country will get an opportunity of speaking on this very important motion, nor will the proposer of the motion get an opportunity. In the course of the last hour or two of the debate last night, with all due respect to you, sir, and to the Deputy-Chairman, a great amount of irrelevancies were allowed to be introduced into this debate.  I would like to point out also that if the Minister for Finance is determined to do to-day what he intended to do yesterday, and that is to talk out this debate by introducing outside questions, it is unfair to the members of the House who do not belong to either of the big Parties not to allow them an opportunity of speaking on this motion.</P>

    <Title>Proposed Suspension of Collection of Land Annuities.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on Motion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That as the British Tariffs on Saorstát agricultural produce impose on farmers a burden at least equivalent to their Land Commission Annuities the Dáil is of opinion that the Executive Council should take appropriate steps to suspend the collection of annuities during the period of the operation of these tariffs.&rdquo;&mdash;Deputy Cosgrave.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was speaking last night and Deputy Cosgrave introduced a certain element of unnecessary heat and obstruction into the debate, I had dealt with the question as to when an agreement is not to be referred to as a secret agreement.  I had further dealt with the proposition as to when a British agent is not to be described as a British agent.  I now come to the question as to when a moratorium is not to pass as a moratorium. In his speech yesterday&mdash;and it rather indicates the muddle-headed attitude of the Party opposite in regard to this proposal, or, possibly, a very equivocal attitude towards a notice of motion which is down in the name of two private Deputies &mdash; Deputy O'Sullivan said that this proposal was not a moratorium.  Deputy O'Sullivan, <Col N="1910" /> I believe, enjoys a certain reputation as a philosopher, knows the meaning of words, is capable of correctly evaluating them, is endowed with certain gifts of expression.  Yet having read and, possibly, having in fact assisted in drafting, a motion in these terms: &ldquo;That as the British tariffs on Saorstát agricultural produce&rdquo; do certain things, &ldquo;the Executive Council should take appropriate steps to suspend the collection of annuities during the period of the operation of these tariffs&rdquo;&mdash; having put down a motion of that sort and urged the House to accept it, Deputy O'Sullivan, in the course of his speech, disclaimed this as a moratorium.  I do not profess to be a lexicographer, but I did look up some authorities, and I find that the word &ldquo;moratorium&rdquo; is referred to as &ldquo;A modern coinage; specifically an act, decree, or ordinance of the legislature giving authority to delay or defer or suspend the payment of a debt or obligation.&rdquo; This motion proposes that the Executive Council should take appropriate steps to suspend the collection of the annuities during the period of the operation of these tariffs.  But Deputy O'Sullivan has emphasised that the motion in question is not a moratorium. I have been wondering why it was that he came to that conclusion. A moratorium is an act, ordinance or decree of the legislature giving authority to defer, or delay, or suspend payment of a debt or an obligation.  This motion proposes that the Executive Council should take appropriate steps, probably by way of an ordinance, or a decree, or an Act of the legislature, to suspend the collection of annuities during the period of the operation of these tariffs.  It is proposed to suspend the payment of a certain thing. If this motion is not a moratorium in the mind of Deputy O'Sullivan, it can only be excluded from a definition of a moratorium by the fact that he does not hold that these annuities are an obligation at all; that the Free State farmer has any obligation to pay these annuities over to the State.  I think that I am right in taking that point of view of Deputy O'Sullivan's mental attitude, because in the course of his <Col N="1911" /> speech he said: &ldquo;We do not see what title in justice the Government has to collect these annuities.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That drives me back to the point at which I was interrupted last night, when I said that it was quite obvious that in regard to the land annuities and the collection thereof the late Cumann na nGaedheal Executive regarded themselves merely as the British agents in this country.  I do not see how we can come to any other conclusion.</P>
      <P>If it is true that in 1923, when the then Minister for Finance was moving a certain Estimate in this House, said that, &ldquo;as provided by law the annuities were payable to Great Britain&rdquo;; the point in that connection, which I think is of vital interest to the people, and upon which some information should be given by those who were members of the late Government is: did they, before coming to the conclusion that these annuities were properly payable by law to Great Britain, obtain any legal opinion on the matter?  In a statement on the Land Bill of 1923 Deputy Cosgrave made that point, that the annuities were payable by law to Great Britain.  I again challenge him: was the matter examined at all, or did they act on a mistaken and erroneous view of the law without having consulted adequate authorities?  Why was it necessary, first of all, to have an agreement in 1923, this secret agreement, and why was it necessary to put a section into the Land Act of 1923 providing that the moneys should be paid over if, as Deputy Cosgrave said, under the law in this State, as it stood at that time, we were bound to pay the annuities over to Great Britain?  If this agreement did not involve a change in the law, why was it necessary for Deputy Cosgrave to refer to it all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dealing again with this agency question which has arisen in the course of the debate, which arises particularly out of the statements made by Deputy O'Sullivan, Deputy Morrissey, Deputy Hogan, and all those who have spoken in support of the Opposition view, that we have no title in law to collect these annuities if we do not collect them to <Col N="1912" /> pay them over to Great Britain, how is it that the British Government, in the present controversy, rely only on the agreements of 1923 and 1926?  It shows the inconsistency between both sides &mdash; those who are claiming the annuities on the other side of the water and those who are urging on this side of the Channel that they should be paid.  While the British rely on the agreements of 1923 and 1926 to make good their claim, the White Paper issued by the late Government in relation to this question disclaims that the agreements of 1923 and 1926 have anything at all to do with the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The main argument put forward in support of this motion is that we have no legal or moral title to collect the annuities.  That is the basis of the whole case.  If we have no legal or moral title to collect and retain the annuities here, if they are not payable to us, why did the legal advisers of Cumann na nGaedheal allow Deputy Cosgrave to bring forward this motion?  Why did they not do as they used to advise us to do&mdash; test the matter in the Courts?  During the last two months the papers were filled with bold declarations by people throughout the country, people with very little to lose.  They declared that they were going to stand on their legal rights in this matter and if we attempted to collect the annuities they would have the matter tested in the Courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1913" /> A gentleman who has made a very recent and not very distinguished appearance in Irish politics stated at a meeting that he was taking counsel's opinion on this matter and that as soon as certain people were fortified with that they would challenge the action of the Executive Council in the Courts of this State and they would see that the annuities were retained by the people to whom they belonged, the tenant farmers.  If the whole matter could be so easily settled by one action why was that action not taken?  If the people on the Opposition Benches believe that the State is not entitled to collect and retain these annuities, why do they not challenge our action in the Courts?  They were very vocal about their intentions in that regard six weeks or two months ago.  They have become very silent since, because an examination of the law has shown that there is no justification for the argument, which has been put forward in this House in support of the motion, that we have no title to collect the annuities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan said that if the moneys were not collected and paid over to the stockholders, we had no title to collect them.  The annuities in Northern Ireland are collected and retained there; they are not paid over to the stockholders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it, if the Government cannot collect the annuities unless they collect them for the purpose of paying them to the stockholders, that the annuities are collected in Northern Ireland, are not paid over to the stockholders but are retained for the use of the Northern Ireland Exchequer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of stockholders, <Col N="1914" /> Deputy Hogan knows as well as I do that a very large proportion of Irish land stock, possibly the greater part of that land stock, is held not by private individuals in Great Britain, but by British Government Departments.  When the National Debt Commissioners pay interest on that stock, they pay it not to British citizens, but to other Departments of the British Government.  So far as that argument goes there is no essential difference between collecting annuities and paying them to the individual stockholders and collecting them and paying them to the British Government, because in any event the great bulk of the payment goes to the British Exchequer in the end.</P>
    <P>In regard to the case which the Government has made for retaining these annuities for the use and benefit of the Irish people, which, according to the Opposition, is a vital element in their right to collect them, since the Irish Free State case was published in full there has been no attempt to criticise seriously the grounds of our claim to retain those annuities.  There has been no such attempt here or on the other side of the water.  Instead, since the correspondence was published, we have had two leading lawyers in Great Britain, Professor Berridale Keith and Lord Parmoor, stating there was substance in our claim that we are entitled to retain the moneys.  There has been further confirmation of that from Lord Hailsham to the effect that agreements are not binding until they have been ratified by the Legislature. The very fact that these admissions have been made strikes away at once any foundation there might be for the statement made on the Opposition Benches that if we do not collect these annuities in order to pay them to Great Britain we are not entitled to collect them from the Irish farmers at all.</P>

The point I wish to deal with is this: What are the intentions of the Government with regard to proceedings for the immediate recovery of all outstanding annuities?  Regarding this matter, I received the following telegram last night:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At a large and representative meeting of the Farmers' and Ratepayers' League at Rathdrum to-day it was unanimously resolved to request the withdrawal of all proceedings for the immediate recovery of annuities as it is quite impossible to pay them.  We expect you to take immediate action.</P>
      <P>Anyone who understands the situation prevailing in County Wicklow must realise that the farmers there have been hit especially severely by the collapse of the sheep trade.  The two Government Deputies who represent County Wicklow must be aware how very serious is the situation there, and I hope they will urge the Government to give full consideration to this very grave matter, especially as it has been brought about by the action and inactions of the Party now in power.</P>

      <P>In spite of the very long debate that has taken place on this motion, and in spite of the widely divergent views expressed in that debate, one thing appears to be clear. That is, that amongst the two main Parties in this House there is agreement that relief of some sort or kind is necessary and urgent.

The alternative suggested by the President in the course of his statement yesterday was to give relief to those who needed it and who are in a position to prove their need.  That seems to me to be the better course.  I have come to that conclusion because I am aware &mdash; I do not think that anybody in this House will deny it &mdash; that there are quite a number of well-to-do people in a position to discharge their obligations to the fullest extent.  I consider that it would be a hardship on deserving people if relief were given on an indiscriminate basis.  Nobody will deny that at present there is a campaign against the payment of land annuities for political reasons.  Nobody will deny that there is a campaign to destroy the public services of the country on the basis of a no-rates agitation.  No colleague of mine from the County Cork will deny that that course is being advocated publicly there at present and that it is succeeding to a considerable extent.  One finds it very hard to reconcile the treachery of a campaign of that kind with the slush that is talked in this House about the hardships of the poor caused by the present position.  The poor have strange friends these times.  The people who would close the hospitals by refusing to find the necessary funds to keep them open, who would strangle work on the roads by refusing to find the wherewithal to pay for it, and who would tell those in receipt of outdoor relief that they could go and starve, are the new-found advocates of the poor.  These are the people who hold up their hands in horror at the hardships imposed upon the poor.  This Party fully agrees that a sound case has been made for relief for a very large section of deserving people who are unable to meet their liabilities. We are keenly conscious of that need and, in my opinion, and the opinion of my colleagues, the method by which the President hopes to give that relief is the better one.  On the question of the permanent relief outlined in the President's statement yesterday, I should not like to offer an opinion now. I hope that we shall get an opportunity <Col N="1917" /> of considering that matter very fully. I think that it is a question which calls for very full consideration before it is decided.</P>
    <P>I regret I was not here yesterday when a particularly filthy attack was made on this Party by a colleague of mine in the representation of West Cork.  It is not possible to be always in this House.  One was tempted to leave to discharge the other duties that fall to a Deputy outside this Chamber, because of the fact that everything that could be said on the question of the land annuities had been said in some shape or form in the presence of those of us who have been here for a considerable time.  I should like to say in explanation of my absence&mdash;it will be some comfort to my colleague, Deputy Wolfe, to know it &mdash; I was not in the portion of the House to which some of my colleagues go to seek inspiration for their speeches.  I was not in the portion of the House where the motive power for the eloquence and filth which is poured out subsequently here is provided. Deputy Wolfe could not finish a statement of that kind without reference to Judas and the thirty pieces of silver.  It is peculiarly appropriate that he, above all members of this House, should make a reference of that kind.  I was wondering if there were not in his heart the murmurings of an uneasy conscience, if he was not looking into the mirror of memory and if he was not weighing up again the price he himself obtained for a week's arduous work in Cork in defending the murderers of the Lord Mayor of Cork&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was wondering whether it was the memory of that occasion and the number of pieces of silver that changed hands for a case that was very eloquently argued that was awakening memories in the mind of Deputy Wolfe and inviting him to make the filthy comparisons he made here yesterday.  There were other cases, too.  The Deputy spoke about the honest labourer beginning to realise where he was being led.  He is beginning to realise where he is being led by some people.  I tell Deputy Wolfe now, as I shall tell him in West Cork when the occasion arises, that neither the dope he serves out in certain depots in West Cork at election times nor the dope which he supplies in this House will prevent the honest labourer from realising where he is being led.  Every labourer and small farmer is anxious for relief from the burdens that press upon him at present and for relief from the stigma and slander of the presence of a man of that kind in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard here yesterday complaints about the destitution of the people in the country.  One could not help feeling that there were people in this House who were gloating over that destitution, when one knows that it has been publicly advocated in the country that employers should dismiss every man they can dismiss in order to create the right political atmosphere. I want to know if it is suggested by the mover of this motion &mdash; a Deputy who always argues his case as it should be argued and for whom I have the highest respect&mdash;that certain people in the country dismissing their employees for purely political reasons <Col N="1919" /> deserve the same consideration from the State in regard to a motion of this kind as the people who are right up against it and who are endeavouring and struggling bravely to carry on.</P>

I suggest, however, that that relief should not be given indiscriminately, but that it should be given in relation to the degree of hardship obtaining and to the degree of necessity existing for that relief.  A Deputy in this House is chairman of a certain organisation in my constituency.  At a meeting of that organisation in the backroom of a hotel some time ago, the non-payment of the annuities and rates was agreed upon.  I invite the Deputy to get up here and defend that policy and I invite him to go down to his constituency and at a public meeting there to defend that policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Before coming to the main motion before the House, I <Col N="1921" /> should like to make a passing reference to the speech delivered by Deputy Kennedy yesterday.  I would, in the ordinary way, disregard that Deputy's remarks were it not for the speech I have just heard from Deputy Murphy. Deputy Kennedy stated here last evening that a meeting was held in Mullingar on 11th September at which public addresses were delivered and that a private session was held afterwards. He stated that the result of that meeting was that the people in the County Westmeath refused to pay their rates and annuities.  As one of the speakers at that meeting in Mullingar, I deny absolutely that I enunciated such a doctrine.  My attitude towards this resolution will prove exactly not only what my attitude is to-day but what it was when I spoke in Mullingar.  The canard started here had been previously referred to in Navan by the Minister for Agriculture. I denied that canard in the place where it appeared.  What annoyed Deputy Kennedy was this: that in Mullingar on 11th September there was a meeting called by circular to be held in the county hall there, and so many people turned up at that meeting that the hall was not found large enough to hold them, and it had to be turned into an open-air meeting. That was an open-air meeting of the agriculturists of Westmeath which the county hall would not hold.  That meeting was the beginning of the awakening of the agriculturists of Westmeath to the situation in which they find themselves to-day, Sufficient for that.</P>
      <P>I never advocated the non-payment of annuities.  Neither did I request or advise the people of the country not to pay their just and lawful debts whether to the State or to the private individual.  I may now put my position in a few words.  I cannot support the motion before the House for two reasons: First of all, because it makes no reference whatever to the question of tariffs that have been imposed by this Government, and, secondly, because it enunciates the doctrine for which I have never stood &mdash;the repudiation of debts, whether land annuities or anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1922" /> This motion goes too far in one direction and not far enough in the other direction.  It states that because the duties imposed by Great Britain on agricultural produce are as much as, or possibly in excess of the amount of the land annuities, that the land annuities should not be collected.  There is not a word in it about the tariffs that are a much heavier burden on the agriculturists, the business community and the workers of this country.  I refer to the tariffs that have been imposed by the present Government. Unfortunately for the late Government, they were started by them.</P>
    <P>The Irish-made carpets in the Lobbies of this House have been worn out by a small number of avaricious self-seekers lobbying the Ministers here to impose tariffs for their own self-interest &mdash; a set of profiteers, battening on the decay of our principal industry.  These economic vampires are slowly draining the life-blood out of agriculture in this country, and not alone out of agriculture but out of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I said not alone has agriculture been affected by the tariffs imposed but the business community and the workers have also been affected.  I would advise the present Government to beware of those gentlemen who were lobbying here to get tariffs for their own benefit.  They will do with the Fianna Fáil Government what they did with the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  They will desert them as well as they deserted the others, and wait for some other people to bleed when they come into office in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the alternative that has <Col N="1923" /> been put up by the Government to the proposals in this resolution, so far as has been announced in this House it appears to me to be a step in the right direction.  It has been stated &mdash; I do not know with what degree of truth, but I hope it is true &mdash; that the Labour Party exercised an influence in bringing about this step.  All I can say is that if they did they have been very wise advisers.  As to the proposals that the President suggested would be made in the future, I await these proposals in the form of a Bill.  I await them with interest, but until such time as I see these proposals before the House I will reserve my judgment as to whether they fit the situation or not.</P>
    <P>The farmers whom I represent &mdash; and some people scoff at the idea of my representing farmers &mdash; are organised farmers.  They were not organised to-day or yesterday.  They have been organised for years.  The small farmers of County Cavan are organised, honest citizens of the State, whether you go to Government records or traitors' records. They never announced or enunciated the doctrine that they should get out of payment of their lawful debts.  I am here as their spokesman, not to repudiate their liability to the State.  They want time to pay, and are willing to pay if they get time, always provided that there is a Government in power that will increase their capacity to pay.  I do not say that the farmer is overburdened by paying rates or annuities or taxes.  The farmer does not want to get out of his liabilities, but he wants the Government in office to foster his industry and to increase his capacity to pay.  If it is necessary for the running of this State to double the rates and taxes so long as he is in a position to pay he does not care what the consequences are.  There is another very strong reason why I should repudiate the second part of this resolution.  As I said, it enunciates a doctrine to which I do not subscribe.  I hope, and I have been living in that hope for some years, that the time will come when the agriculturists of this country will take their proper place in controlling the Government, and setting a headline as to <Col N="1924" /> the economic conditions of this country in the future.  Am I going to support a resolution that would sap the moral fibre of those men whom I hope to see in authority in this country in the future?  Am I to corrupt them by suggesting that they should not pay their lawful debts?  It would be a very unwise thing for the future of this country if the farmers and workers of the country &mdash; who, so far as one can see by the debates in this House, are merely pawns in the game; subjects on the dissecting table, victims of the vampires who are sucking their blood from one end of the year to the other&mdash; were so corrupted.  I want to see them take their proper place in the State, but I want to see them take their place as honourable men, fit to control the destinies of this country.  I do not want to encroach further on the time of the House.  It is a very extraordinary thing that the people should be amused by that remark.  I have not been speaking ten minutes, on a matter of most vital importance to three-fourths of the citizens of this State, leaving the profiteers and the others out, and yet I am laughed at because I suggest that I should not encroach further on the time of the House.  I am going to conclude very soon.</P>

Before I signed that recommendation I asked this man &ldquo;Is it possible that you could not get <Col N="1925" /> a better position for your daughter than this which you seek?&rdquo; I may tell you his daughter was a fine young woman of nineteen years of age. What did he say?  He said: &ldquo;I had hopes there was a better future in store for her, but the present position of the farmers of this country is such that I have got to make some sort of provision for my family in the future, because I see no hope of anything coming their way.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am now going to deal with the motion.  I am supporting the motion, but before I come to it I want to refer to a remark made by Deputy Murphy of West Cork.  Deputy Murphy said I advocated the non-payment of rates and annuities.  I deny that, sir.  If Deputy Murphy could only be as fair to me as he tries to be to himself he would go and quote from a speech of mine which I made in Clonakilty at a Clonakilty Farmers' Union, where I advised people to pay their rates.  I say I am more in sympathy with the poor than Deputy Murphy ever was, because Deputy Murphy never contributes much to the rates, to the labour bill, or to anything else that is of any benefit to this State. Deputy Murphy has taken advantage here this evening of attacking me, and attacking our other colleague for West Cork, Deputy Wolfe.  It is only typical of him, not only here but on the County Council and on every Board he represents.</P>

      <P>I withdraw it. The reason I am supporting the motion is this: the inability of the farmers to pay at the moment.  The farmers are faced with a situation that they have the land annuities, they have bank bills, they have shop debts, they have rates, and they have the labour bill to meet owing to the policy of the Government.  They are unable to meet any of these payments.</P>

      <P>We had it circulated a fortnight ago the amount of rates that had been collected in each county, and there is not 20 per cent of the rates in.  As one who knows, and speaking with authority, I say every ratepayer, who could pay the first moiety of his rates, has paid it and the other 80 per cent. are unable to pay at the moment.  Hence it is I support this motion, &ldquo;that the collection of annuities be suspended until such time as the tariffs that are imposed will be obliterated.&rdquo;  I would like to speak at length on this, but in fairness to Deputy Cosgrave, who moved the motion, I finish up with these remarks.</P>

      <P>The farmers never undertook to pay two Governments, and two Governments are now collecting. The farmers subscribed under the Land Purchase Code to pay only to one.  They are paying more now by reason of the British tariffs than they undertook to pay to the Land Commission when purchasing their holdings. The sum assessed on the farmers is £5,000,000.  What is the amount of the Land Commission annuities?  £3,000,000 under the pre-1923 Acts and £1,000,000 <Col N="1927" /> under the 1923 Act.  For the £4,000,000 land annuities for which they are liable they are being taxed to the extent of £5,000,000.  Would Deputy O'Hanlon, who takes a great interest in the farmers, justify that imposition on the farmers?  They are unable to pay £1,000,000 per annum over and above the agreements they signed.  Last evening here we heard Deputy Ruttledge. I made a charge against him last evening and of which I have proof here.  I do not see him here now but he is probably within short distance. Here is the proof:</P>
      <P>Seventh year of the Republic. War News No. 114. 3rd Sept., 1922.</P>
      <P>Now, therefore, all citizens of the Republic are hereby enjoined to refuse payment of income tax, Land Commission Annuities, annuities or other rents or payments to the Congested Districts Board and generally to refuse payment of all moneys demanded by any Department acting with, or under the authority of, the British Government either directly or through its servants and agents, the so-called Provisional Government of Southern Ireland, or any other body purporting to exercise authority derived from the British Parliament.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is signed Padraig O Ruithleis. There is no such Irish name as O Ruithleis.  It is just what you expect from people who sign names to documents &mdash; names they are not entitled to use.  What are the facts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 31st January, 1922, the total arrears outstanding in respect of pre-1923 Acts was £190,000.  On the 31st January, 1923, that is, after the Proclamation signed by Deputy Ruttledge &mdash; now Minister for Lands and Fisheries &mdash; the total arrears due in respect of pre-1923 Acts was £642,939. We had not taken over the Land Commission at that time.  It was not taken over until the 1st April, 1923, and we took it over with these arrears, less what was paid off during the two months.  What were the arrears on the 31st January, 1932?  £665,415. What is the difference &mdash; the whole increase on the arrears was some £20,000 in ten years.  What is the sum <Col N="1928" /> collected &mdash; probably £35,000,000 or £36,000,000?</P>
    <P>It is a slander, a vilification and a shame, to say that the farmers of this country have evaded their debts.  They have not evaded them.  No country can show such a record as that and the Minister yesterday evening in reading out those figures misled the House, or at any rate, allowed the House to be under a misapprehension regarding the arrears that were due.  What are the facts?  Over one hundred thousand pounds of the arrears due ten years ago, due after the publication of the proclamation which I have read have been collected &mdash; as £139,320 out of the £665,415 arrears is in respect of the Land Act, 1923, the annuities collectable entailing an extra million pounds.</P>
    <P>It is said that we want the farmers to default.  We are endeavouring by this motion to save them from default. It is unfair and unjust to collect from them a sum in excess of what they signed to pay.  I am against repudiation. I admit at once, in connection with the final adjustments that must take place in connection with this matter if this remission is to take place, that those adjustments must be made by the State which occasioned all this trouble, by the Government opposite, which with the assistance of the Labour Party, is responsible.  And whatever suffering, and injustice, and trouble there is in this country at the present moment, it is on their backs, and in their hearts the responsibility lies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>No one in England or outside can charge the farmers of this country with default.  Not alone in this country, but outside, the figures which I have quoted&mdash;the facts as they are&mdash; are a vindication of their honour. Parnell, Redmond, Dillon, Davitt and Healy&mdash;all assured the critics of Irish land purchase that the farmers would not default.  Their assurances have been justified.  The British tariffs were imposed when farmers were paying Land Commission annuities.  The farmers who paid last June were paying Land Commission annuities due in November, which were again collected <Col N="1929" /> by means of tariffs, on 15th July and from the 15th July up to date.  What are the facts?  They are being charged from 15th July last £1 5s. for every £1 they owed in Land Commission annuities. The man who owed £4 is paying £5.  Are the Government not satisfied with that 5/-?  No.  What is the new proposal?  Nobody ever listened to such a lop-sided, ridiculous proposition. I hear the Labour Party have something to do with it.  I am not surprised.  I believe myself the back benchers of the Fianna Fáil Party are really responsible for it.  What does it mean?  Annuities due in November and December, 1932, and in May and June, 1933, are in the case of persons declared unable to pay and who get a certificate from the Land Commission to that effect &mdash; are to have these annuities funded at 4½ per cent &mdash; that is more than they have undertaken to pay.</P>
      <P>What else is going to happen?  They are going to get a perpetual remission on their annuities.  Who introduced the word perpetual?  Who has the right to say that this State has a right to the land of the people &mdash; the land which the people bought and fought for?  They are not going to give it up to anyone.  What will be the effect? A substantial perpetual reduction is going to be given.  How much will it mean?  Much less than 75 per cent.&mdash; because the cost of the interest and sinking fund on the 1923 Act, which has to be paid by the State, costs over £1,000,000 and a 25 per cent. collection would only pay that amount.  Therefore you must collect at least 25 per cent. of the annuities, and the most you could possibly give is 75 per cent. remission.  You are not going to do that.  Fifty per cent.  I presume.  The sum and substance of that proposal is that the Government wants £1,000,000 of the farmers' money.  What is the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the British are going to collect £5,000,000 and the State say £2,000,000, the farmers are to pay £7,000,000 when they only owe four.  I say that is little short of robbery and you cannot legalise robbery.  You can if you like. You have power to annul the Decalogue, but you have no right to do it. You are encroaching on the people's <Col N="1930" /> rights and privileges, and you are shaking the confidence of this country, and you have brought disaster and difficulties to this country.  The Vice-President knows this well, and he can smile because he knows nothing whatever about farmers' difficulties or troubles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I do, and the advice which is being given by the President, who, also, is not a farmer, and knows nothing about business, is bad advice.  &ldquo;Do not sell, do not glut the British market, leave just a small quantity as the competition will be enormous for it.&rdquo;  What is the result? We have stocks of cattle piled up in this country.</P>
      <P>It so happens that we are faced now in this motion with the prospect and the possibility of doing something honest for those people whom you have deprived of their natural market, and the means of selling their goods.  I put it to the House that, no more honest motion than this has ever, in the set of circumstances which prevail here, been put before the House.  I cannot understand how any person reading that motion could take any other meaning out of it than that it meant remission, and remission for the time during which the tariffs are on. Further, no man will dare go before an agricultural community, or an agricultural constituency, and tell the people there that, he believes they are able to pay what the British are collecting and what you are endeavouring to get from them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, I should like to ask a question. Am I to understand from certain remarks made by Deputy Murphy that in any proposed legislation which the Government may introduce either now or in the near future, dealing with the partial remission of annuities, that there is going to be a distinction shown as between certain members of the community?  In other words, are farmers who are supposed to give advice not to pay annuities, going to be excluded from the ambit of the Bill, or is there going to be class legislation?  As one representing working men, honest, hard-working men, and farmers as <Col N="1931" /> well, am I to understand that there is going to be class legislation introduced into this House in connection with the question of the annuities?</P>

      <P>(2)  Regulations made under this section shall not have any force or effect unless and until they have been approved by the Minister.</P>
      <P>During the discussion in Committee on this Bill it was suggested by Deputy Hayes that the regulations to be made by the Commission regulating the proceedings of the Commission should be subject to approval by the Minister.  I have introduced this amendment to provide for that.</P>

I think he wanted that they should have such approval by the Minister as would make them prescribed regulations and consequently would have to come before the House. The point was, although there is a precedent for having these regulations made in this way, that regulations involving such an important matter as this, indicating &ldquo;the form and manner in which submissions shall be made and evidence given to the Commission, and in particular, whether such submissions and evidence shall be given <i>viva voce</i> or in writing,&rdquo; and also &ldquo;the admission or exclusion of any person to or from the sittings of the Commission,&rdquo; should come before the House. After these regulations have been made, a breach of the regulations under sub-section (2) Section 17 will become an offence for which a man may be certified to the High Court, and the High Court may in fact punish him in like manner as if he had been guilty of contempt of the High Court.  Consequently imprisonment may be imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a Bill of this magnitude which gives the Minister power to interfere over the whole range of trade in a specified article or articles which may afterwards be scheduled, it seems to me that the regulations which can be made assume an importance which <Col N="1948" /> would not attach to regulations under other Bills.  What I understand Deputy Hayes was aiming at was not so much that the regulations shall not have any force or effect unless and until approved by the Minister, but should not have any force or effect until laid before the House, and then dealt with, in accordance with the regulations made under the Bill, whereby they come before the House, and, if a resolution is moved nullifying them, they are nullified without prejudice to the validity of anything done in the meantime.  That was what was aimed at rather than having them approved by the Minister.  This is a step, but it does not go the whole way.</P>

      <P>I realise that we are not in Committee, but I would like to explain that the section in the Bill is precisely similar to sections in other Bills, notably the Merchandise Marks Act, in which case the regulations are made by the Commission entirely of their own volition and are not approved by the Minister.  I cannot feel convinced that approval by the Minister is essential, but as a safeguard against the possibility of regulations that would give rise to trouble I will put it in.  I do not think it is necessary that these regulations should be laid before the Dáil and approved, and it was not considered necessary in similar Acts in the past.</P>

      <P>I make the point that other Bills had different scope. They were not going to interfere with ordinary trading concerns to the extent to which this is likely to interfere, and, while I do not say that the regulations are of such importance that they should be brought in, say, under Section 6, the House ought to get notice of them.  If the Minister would give an undertaking that the regulations, when made, would be, in some way or another, brought before the members of the House, not by being brought in in the form which Section 6 ordains, but in a way that would give an opportunity to members of the House to question the Minister as to why he approved of regulations in a particular form, my point will be met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendments 2, 3 and 4:</P>
      <P>2.  In page 6, before Section 19, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Commission may, in their absolute discretion, hold any sitting or part of a sitting in private and the reference in the next following section to a private sitting of the Commission shall be construed as a reference to a sitting or part of a sitting held in private.</P>
      <P>3.  In page 6, line 38, Section 19 (2), to insert before the word &ldquo;sitting&rdquo; the word &ldquo;private.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>4.  In page 7, line 12, Section 21, to insert before the word &ldquo;prohibition&rdquo; the words &ldquo;private sittings of the Commission.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These three amendments, which go together, are designed to meet certain objections which were raised in respect of Section 19 on Committee Stage.  Sub-section (2) prescribes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>It shall not be lawful for any person (other than a member or officer of the Commission) who attends a sitting of the Commission to disclose to any person any information acquired through being present at such sitting and which is available only by virtue of the powers of obtaining information conferred upon the Commission or an inspector by this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Particular reference was made to the difficulty which that section would impose on representatives of the Press being present at meetings of the Commission. The three amendments, which it is now proposed to insert in the Bill, provide that the Commission may hold either private or public sittings or may hold a sitting partly in private and partly in public.  If a sitting is private, the representatives of the Press, will not, of course, be present, and sub-section <Col N="1950" /> (2) will operate to prevent any other person in the capacity of, say, a witness, from publishing the information which he secures by being present at that sitting.  When the Commission is sitting in public, representatives of the Press will be present and will be entitled to report the proceedings in the ordinary course.  It is not easy to make arrangements which will provide for the privacy of the evidence given by a witness before the Commission, the privacy which would be desirable in many cases, and, at the same time, to provide for the proceedings of the Commission being published in the Press.  I think that the amendments which I suggest make the best possible attempt to achieve that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  Let us read it in relation to private sittings:</P>
      <P>It shall not be lawful for any person (other than a member or officer of the Commission) who attends a private sitting of the Commission to disclose to any person any information acquired through being present at such sitting and which is available only by virtue of the powers of obtaining information conferred upon the Commission or an inspector by this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only thing which a person is precluded from publishing is such information as is obtained by being present at a private sitting and which he has got by virtue of the powers of obtaining information conferred on the Commission under the Act.  Supposing a person is present at a private sitting, who is not an inspector or an officer, but who is somebody in or <Col N="1951" /> about a firm, and some information comes out incidentally.  He is at liberty to publish that information because it is not information he has obtained through being &ldquo;present at such sitting, and&rdquo;&mdash;the &ldquo;and&rdquo; is the necessary word&mdash;&ldquo;is available only by virtue of the powers conferred upon the Commission or an inspector by this Act.&rdquo;  Supposing there was some firm being examined with regard to something or another, and there was an employee of that firm present and something comes out in the course of the private sitting.  So long as that person can say that he did not get that information by virtue of the powers conferred on the Commission under this section, he is at liberty to disclose it.  I think that is a serious gap.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary, I think, to have some such provision there. The fact that a particular person gave evidence, for example, without indicating the details of the evidence is something that could be disclosed. The general burden of that evidence could probably be disclosed, but where the Commission use their power to enforce the production of documents or to compel a witness to give evidence at a private sitting, in relation to his own business, in order to substantiate his statements, every person present at the sitting would be debarred from publishing that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is certainly what is intended and what the section will operate to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather that that is the intention but I do not think the section carries it out.  The section says &ldquo;a person other than a member or officer of the Commission&rdquo;&mdash;that is all right, because members and officers of the Commission are attended to in the previous sub-section&mdash;but any other person who has attended a private sitting of the Commission is precluded from disclosing to any person any information he has acquired, but only if he has acquired it for two reasons, firstly, that he has been present at the sitting, and, secondly, that <Col N="1952" /> the information has become available to him through the exercise of certain powers conferred on the Commission or on an inspector under the Act.  Supposing that there are some witnesses present&mdash;some members of a particular firm or its employees.  They afterwards leave the employment of that firm, and if they have picked up certain information, it cannot be said that they have acquired that by reason of powers conferred on the Commission or on an inspector under the Act, and they are at liberty to disclose the information brought before the private sitting.  Surely, the reason for the private sitting was to prevent anything being disclosed except what is published officially.  I think that you are giving leave, here, to a person who has come to be present, power to disclose information afterwards, if he can say &ldquo;I did not get it there by reason of powers conferred on the Commission to extract evidence under the Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I do not quite follow.  If the Commission anticipate that they will have to use these powers and extract from some witness private information which the witness would be unwilling to give in public, they declare part of the sitting to be private, in which case the only persons present are those who have business there.  Another witness, or someone else might be interested in the matters under examination.  That witness under examination might give a lot of information which he would be quite willing to have published.  The Commission might require and compel him to produce evidence.  If unwilling to do so then this section operates but if the information was published he would be liable.  It would be necessary to establish in the proceedings that such person had acquired the information as a result of the exercise by the Commission of its powers under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The position is this, that if someone is brought before the court and is charged with disclosing information contrary to the sub-section it is necessary for the prosecutor to establish that such information was available to that person, not merely by the fact that he was present at the Commission, but at the Commission in the exercise of its powers.  It would be drastic, I think, if a person present at the Commission was liable to prosecution for disclosing something which might not be kept secret at all, but which he heard by being present at the meeting, even though the witness gave it voluntarily, and had no objection to publication&mdash; that it merely arose out of the fact that it was given at a private session. It think it is desirable to establish in the proceedings that a particular thing disclosed was extracted or revealed by the witness at the sitting, and by the exercise by the Commission of its power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The phrase the Minister used gave me the example I was looking for.  I want more secrecy about private sittings of the Commission.  It is going to be an inquisitorial body, interfering with private trade being carried on, and therefore the exercise of these powers ought to be narrowed down in the extremest possible way, and any disclosure of information from the secret sittings should be prohibited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it practicable to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be only practicable to do so if it is possible to get evidence that there has been disclosure. I hold that there should be a penalty.  As the Minister stated, if a person is present and hears information given by a firm voluntarily, and if the firm does not care whether the information is disclosed or not, I <Col N="1954" /> agree that there should be no penalty. As the information was given voluntarily and was not extracted it is therefore not brought within the provisions of the sub-section.  But if it is given voluntarily, and if a firm does care about publication, and if there is no prohibition of disclosure being made, is that desirable?  I want the Minister to hark back to his remarks about sub-section (1), that the only prohibition is to certain members or voluntary officers of the Commission. The answer made to me was that the change applies only to private sittings.  If it applies only to a public sitting why prohibit disclosure by a member or by an officer of the Commission and not prohibit it by a member of the public who may be present? What is the difference?  It cannot be something not disclosed at the public sitting which an officer or member of the Commission got by virtue of these powers.  That could be held up in another way.  You prohibit a member or an officer of the Commission from disclosing information disclosed at a public sitting but you do not prohibit a member of the public from disclosing.</P>

      <P>In the Bill as originally framed, when the Controller, consequent on the receipt of the inspector's report, reported that an unreasonably high price had been charged for any commodity, and proposed to issue a price certificate, he should serve on the seller a notice in the prescribed form indicating the things which are set out in the various paragraphs of Section 32 (1) (a).  Paragraph 5 of that notice says:</P>
      <P>requiring such seller within twenty-one days after the service of such notice to give to the Controller an undertaking in writing to charge in future a reasonable price for the commodity mentioned in such notice and ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed to change the period of 21 days to ten days and this is consequential on amendment No. 11 which is being introduced in order to meet a proposal which was moved here on the Committee Stage.  Amendment 11 provides that where such notice is served upon any seller of an article, such seller may within fourteen days from the date of the service of such <Col N="1957" /> notice request that the Commission hold an investigation into the general level of prices of that commodity, in which case the Commission would carry out an investigation and be satisfied that the application was bona fide and that it was desirable in the public interest that such investigation should be made.

Paragraph (v) requires the seller of the article to give an undertaking in writing that in future a reasonable price will be charged for the commodity mentioned in the notice. It has been stated elsewhere that under any circumstances the period of twenty-one days there was much too long and that the seller in question&mdash; he being a person prepared to admit that he did charge an unreasonable price&mdash;should be able to make up his mind within ten days whether or not he was going to charge reasonable prices for that commodity.</P>

If they decide that the application is not bonafide and that no such investigation is necessary, then, within that fourteen days, the Controller may issue a price certificate.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the Minister has this right at all.  Let us look at Section 32.  It starts off by saying: &ldquo;Where a report is made to the Controller by an inspector on a complaint referred to him for investigation, and the Controller, after consideration of such report, is of opinion that such complaint is well founded&rdquo;&mdash; that means that previously there was a complaint by an individual which is referred by an inspector to the Controller. The Controller may throw it out. The inspector makes a report to the Controller and if the Controller, after consideration of such report, finds it well-founded, then the following provisions shall have effect, etc.  In (v) and (vi), the small numbered paragraphs, what happens then?  The notice may require the seller within twenty-one days after the service of such notice to give an undertaking in writing to charge reasonable prices in future, and, if such notice relates to a sale, to repay within twenty-one days.  That is the section we are amending&mdash;the repayment section, and only that. What does the new amendment, No. 11, refer to in this at all?</P>

The notice is that the seller, within some period of days&mdash; ten, fourteen or twenty-one&mdash;shall give an undertaking to charge a reasonable price and to repay.  Then, in paragraph (c) &ldquo;If such seller does not <Col N="1959" /> comply with the requirements of such notice, and such complaint relates to a sale or offering for sale retail the Controller shall do the following things&rdquo;&mdash;and then amendment 11 comes in.  Is not that the framework of this business?</P>

      <P>Well, it is really, I think.  In fact, and in time, it refers back to something that happens after the service of the notice on the person about whom the complaint is being made.  Therefore, the Controller, before making a price certificate&mdash;an entirely different thing&mdash; shall serve on the seller a notice of his intention to make a price certificate on the following things&mdash;then the new amendment No. 11 comes in. But what is the purpose of cutting down the period of twenty-one days in which the seller can say whether or not he will undertake to charge reasonable prices for the commodity mentioned? The seller has got to make up his mind, having got the evidence of the complaint before him, having got the Controller's and inspector's point of view&mdash;he has got to make up his mind that he still thinks it a reasonable price.  In order to make his case, he will have to bring in a multitude of things, such as his overheads, whether his trade is a cash trade or a credit trade, and many other things, and he has got to make his case as to whether he thinks he can stand up against this order.  I do not think that in the circumstances three weeks is too long a time to give him for that, and it is only after he refuses at the end of the three weeks that you should proceed as to whether you will give him a price certificate or not.  I think that the seller should have the time given to him originally, three weeks. His business is going to be attacked. If he accepts the notice, he has got to accept it for an unmentioned time, although the notice may contain a statement as to the area or the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to (v) he has to give an undertaking to charge in future&mdash;not for a limited time&mdash;a reasonable price for <Col N="1960" /> the commodity.  His whole business is really going to turn on this notice served upon him.  It may tie him even against a change in the wholesale price. It is surely not too much to ask that three weeks should be given him to make up his mind whether to accept this reasonable price and whether he will repay the sum he is alleged to have overcharged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that in the case mentioned we are giving not three weeks, but a maximum of twenty-four days.  Let us consider this.  An allegation is made that on a particular occasion a particular seller sold a commodity at an unreasonably high price. The Controller examines the allegation and decides that it deserves to be investigated. An inspector investigates it, subject to the provisions of this Bill, and reports to the Controller, and the Controller, on getting that report, decides that the complaint is well founded.  In other words, there is prima facie evidence, in his opinion, that an unreasonably high price is being charged.  At that stage this section begins to operate.  The Controller sends to the seller a notice in the prescribed form stating the nature of the complaint, the grounds for his opinion that the complaint is well-founded, and so on, and requiring that seller to give, within ten days, an undertaking that in future he is going to charge a reasonable price for the commodity and refund the amount of any overcharge made.  If the person is in the situation described by the Deputy and is of opinion that the price indicated as a reasonable price by the Controller is not a reasonable price, then what happens?  The new sub-section, amendment 11, comes into operation.  At the end of ten days, if no reply has been received from the seller alleged to have charged that unreasonably high price, before the Controller issues a certificate he sends another notice to the seller informing him of his intention to issue the certificate and &ldquo;the Controller shall not in any case make, serve or publish any such certificate in relation to such person until the expiration of fourteen days from the date of the service of such notice.&rdquo;  Within those <Col N="1961" /> fourteen days, the seller may make representations to the Commission, appeal from the Controller to the Commission, on the ground that the price charged by him was the general price and request the Commission to carry out an investigation as to the general level of prices in the area, or in the county as a whole, for the commodity. The Commission consider that appeal and if they decide that there is a case for investigation, then the certificate drops; there are no fresh proceedings against that seller until the general price investigation has been concluded. If, on the other hand, the Commission decide that the appeal must be rejected, that there is no case for an investigation into the general level of prices for the commodity, then, at the end of the fourteen days, a certificate is issued.  A person who considers that a price charged by him was a reasonable one, even though that was not the opinion of the Controller, reasonable in relation to the general level of prices of that commodity, has a maximum period of twenty-four days within which to take proceedings under the Bill to prevent the certificate being issued.</P>

      <P>I am not making any argument on the period that will elapse from the time the complaint is made and noticed as reasonable to the person, until the price certificate is made.  I am making the point as to the time you allow a person to make <Col N="1962" /> up his mind whether he is going to have his business investigated.  He has to survey the whole course of his business in ten days.  He previously was given twenty-one days.</P>

      <P>As this Bill stood he was.  Nothing happened until the end of the twenty-first day after he got notice.  On the twentieth day he could say &ldquo;I will accept&rdquo; or he could say &ldquo;I will not accept.&rdquo;  He had three weeks in which to survey the whole course of his business affected by the order.  What does he get now?  Ten days to survey the whole course of his business.  Something that is going to happen to him thereafter may be postponed, but the machinery is set in motion after ten days.  He previously had twenty-one days in which to consider the whole thing without any machinery being set in motion.  After ten days under amendment 11 the Controller serves the notice in the prescribed form but he shall not make, serve or publish any such certificate until fourteen days from the date of service of the notice.  The person may send in a statement to him that he wants the whole thing investigated. But he may not.  Thereupon, the order will be made, presumably.  He has to make up his mind within ten days after he gets the notice as to letting this machinery operate against him.  That is the point I am at.  He should get the three weeks.  Cut down this other period if you like, but give him the original twenty-one days that was in the Bill as drafted.  As I say, it is a very serious matter.  Incidentally, may I ask, is the Controller a member of the Commission?  I do not think he is, as the Bill is drafted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Consequently the Controller cannot administer an oath. He cannot, therefore, take evidence on oath.  So far as this part of the Bill is concerned, somebody comes along and makes a complaint to the Controller, not on oath.  The Controller makes up his mind as to whether, <i>prima facie</i>, it is absurd or whether there is some sort of a case.  In the <Col N="1963" /> second event, he sends out an inspector, who makes an investigation.  I do not think this can be made on oath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they are defined. The Controller, who is not a member of the Commission, has no power to administer oaths.  I doubt if any delegate from him can administer an oath.  At any rate, the inspector makes inquiries and the Controller, after some time, finds that the complaint is well-founded.  He serves notice on the man, requiring him to charge a reasonable price.  Again, I call attention to the fact that under paragraph (v) he is to charge in future, not for a specified time, a certain price. He has got to sit down and think: &ldquo;I am charging that price; complaint is being made about it; somebody investigating in a particular way has found that it is an unreasonable price, as far as his judgment has been brought to bear upon it.&rdquo;  He has to think of his whole business.  Can he stand up against that?  He will have to consider his overheads, the type of his customers, the credit he has to give, everything about his business; the things he may charge a low price for in order to get people into his premises as a set-off against the things he charges a high price for when he gets the people in.  He has to consider all that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy notice that it is &ldquo;a reasonable price,&rdquo; not &ldquo;the reasonable price?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is worse, if a reasonable price is the one that is certified by the Controller to him.  If it is &ldquo;a reasonable price&rdquo; I should like to have a view expressed on that. If he is to be allowed to operate his judgment as to what is a reasonable orice, then the section is useless.  But if it is a price which is to be judged from the point of view of whether it is reasonable or not in relation to the notice served upon him by the Controller, after complaint has been made, then he is going to be in a bad way. <Col N="1964" /> He has to certify that he will charge a reasonable price in future.  Supposing the price of the article that he is selling goes up the next week, will he be made charge the old price on the notice, or can he even go above the price complained of?  These are considerations that a man will have to ponder over in his mind before deciding whether or not he will allow this machinery relating to these price certificates to go against him.</P>
      <P>The period now specified is ten days; previously it was twenty-one days. This legislation, to my mind, is going very seriously to upset trade.  I do not think the difference in time between ten days and twenty-one days should be considered by the Government. Is it not recognised that if it gets about that a complaint is made in regard to the prices charged by a certain individual and an inspector is sent down to investigate, that man's business is going to be very considerably damaged, irrespective of whether the inspector finds for or against an unfair price?  Is it not obvious that considerable damage is going to be done in such cases?  If a man makes up his mind to submit his case for examination by the Commission he should get the twenty-one days that the Bill originally allowed instead of the ten days that the Government now propose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is over-stating the case.  What happens? A complaint is made, a complaint which the Controller, with a knowledge of the general level of prices all over the country, may consider to be worth investigating.  He sends down an inspector. The Deputy rightly admits that the seller knows as soon as the inspector calls that a complaint has been made.  He has a certain amount of time in which to consider whether the price he has charged was or was not reasonable.  The investigation is pursued and a report is submitted to the Controller.  The Controller then takes a certain period in which to come to a decision.  During all that time the seller can be examining his conscience with respect to the price he has charged.  It is only when the Controller decides that an unreasonable price <Col N="1965" /> has been charged that the notice is issued.  We should not be filled with consideration over the troubles of a man who has, under these circumstances, been deemed by the Controller to have charged an unreasonably high price.  The notice is sent to the individual concerned that he has charged an unreasonably high price and he is given an indication of what the Controller considers to be a reasonable price.  He is asked if he is prepared to agree to give an undertaking that he will in future charge a reasonable price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  What is specified is a reasonable price for the commodity.  He is given ten days within which he can decide whether he will plead guilty or not.  Then he has twenty-four days in which to put forward a defence, if he has a defence. If he recognises that he cannot defend his position he has ten days in which to give an undertaking and to make any refund that may be necessary, because of the amount he has overcharged. If a trader considers that he has not charged an unreasonable price, that he should not be required to give an undertaking or make a refund, then at the end of ten days he gets the second notice envisaged by amendment 11.  He then appeals to the Commission and he is allowed a period of fourteen days.  He asks the Commission to investigate the general level of prices for the commodity in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Commission decides that his appeal is well founded and that the price charged by him was the general price, the issue of the certificate drops and the price investigation by the Commission proceeds.  If the Commission decides that there is no ground for the appeal, that the general level of prices is quite satisfactory, that there is no need for a prolonged investigation and that the price charged by the individual was higher than the general level of prices, the appeal drops and the certificate is issued.  There is a period of ten days within which a man with a guilty conscience <Col N="1966" /> can plead guilty and a man who has a defence to make has twenty-four days in which to make it.  Every facility is provided under the Bill for the making of that defence.</P>

      <P>Which is going to wipe him out of business.  It is all very well to talk about a man with a guilty conscience.  It is an interesting way of fouling the whole atmosphere. The Minister has already declared that he has no evidence of profiteering.  He has got complaints, but he did not say how numerous they were and he did not know how well-founded they were. He entered the qualification that he did not know whether they were well-founded. He has had complaints of individual traders charging one price one day to certain customers and a different price the next day.  Because of that we are going to have all this interference with trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This can be a most impressive measure; it can also be a complete piece of futility.  Let us consider this from the angle of the person who has not a guilty conscience and who is afraid that the Commission will not properly be able to investigate the conditions of his business.  If this Bill goes through in its present form I think a man would be a fool ever to give in to the provisions set out in Section 32.  He should <Col N="1967" /> always hold out and insist on an investigation. Again, when a price certificate is issued it applies to all the businesses in that area for the specified period, whereas if he gives in it will only apply to himself for an unspecified time and for a price in respect of which he has no indication.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>A man should always hold out&mdash;I do not care whether he has a guilty conscience or the best of consciences.  The Controller will certify a price which in his opinion is a reasonable retail price.  Later on a notice is issued requiring the seller to give an undertaking to the Controller that he will in future charge a reasonable price.  We are told that the reasonable price referred to in paragraph (v) is not the same as that referred to in paragraph (iii).</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, he has to make up his mind to charge some price other than the old price complained of. &ldquo;In future&rdquo; seems to indicate an indefinite period.  He has to undertake that he will charge what he thinks will be a reasonable price in future. There is no limitation in time.  It is not laid down that the time can be specified, although it may be specified in the certificate.  Take the man with a good conscience.  As the Minister says, that man has time to consider everything from the moment the inspector calls.  Will he?  Of course, he will not.  He is not up against this thing until he gets the notice.  No man who has any business worries arising out of his ordinary avocations is going <Col N="1968" /> to bother his head about this to the point of making up his mind until he gets a notice.  Then he will have to consider: &ldquo;Am I going to have myself held up to odium and scorn by the publication of a notice in the paper, or do I think I can make it so clear to my customers that they will be inclined to cast odium and scorn on the notice that appears in the paper and that they will continue to pay the price I charge&rdquo;?  That is a pretty big decision for a man to take, even though he may have the very best of consciences in the matter.</P>
      <P>I do not still see any reason for cutting down that period of twenty-one days.  I think that it is small enough in a very serious matter like this.  I do not care about what happens afterwards.  The point is that certain machinery is set in motion after ten days.  It used to be after 21 days.  Because you enlarge the period in which the machinery will revolve and send out a price certificate is no excuse for cutting down the period inside which the man has to make up his mind whether or not he will subject his business to all this upset and investigation and the possibility of a price being fixed against him individually by notice in the paper.  No reason has been given yet why that period of 21 days should be cut down.  There are two distinct divisions of time and the first one is by far the more important&mdash;the period in which the man has to decide whether or not he will run the gauntlet of all this procedure.  He really does not begin to think on the matter until he has got the notice served on him. He will always believe that he will have persuaded the inspector with regard to any complaint.  If it is a case of a guilty conscience, he will give in at once.  I am not thinking of that man.  We have no examples of the man of guilty conscience put before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all the ráméis which used to be talked about profiteering, with the report of the Commission on Prices and all the Departmental files before him, the Minister is not able to say that there is profiteering.  Although he is not able to say that, we have this very inquisitorial process imposed upon an individual, and instead of 21 <Col N="1969" /> days, he is given ten days to make up his mind as to the ruin of his business or the running of the gauntlet of all this investigation.  The ten-day period should be enlarged to 21 days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very easy for the person who was inquired into under this Bill to fulfil the requirements of Clause 5.  Any man can give a guarantee in writing that he will charge in future a reasonable price, because that &ldquo;reasonable price&rdquo; will not necessarily have any relation to the &ldquo;reasonable price&rdquo; mentioned in the notice referred to here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What that is intended to provide for is that certain representations may be made on one side or the other, and an agreement reached as to what is a reasonable price.  In nine cases out of ten, that will have been done by the inspector when investigating the case.  The Controller indicates what, in his opinion, is a reasonable price to be charged for the commodity.  As a result of representations, he might agree that an increase of a penny or some small increase like that would be permissible. The Bill provides for these representations being made and considered. That is why different wording is adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Deputy McGilligan's point, I should like to have convinced the Deputy, but I do not see much prospect of it.  The dropping of the period from 21 days to 10 days is a necessary consequential step on the introduction of amendment No. 11, which provides for another period of 14 days in which the person alleged to have charged the unreasonably high price may have the general circumstances affecting that price investigated by the Commission, with all the powers of that Commission.  That seems to me to be a reasonable safeguard in the case of the person who, in his own opinion, is not, in fact, profiteering but merely charging what is generally considered in the trade, or in the trade in that particular district, to be a reasonable price.  Reference was made to the fact that a slight mistake was made in inserting the amendment.  It was intended that the <Col N="1970" /> period of 21 days in both paragraphs 5 and 6 should be changed to 10 days, whereas the amendment only refers to No. 6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <P>Different traders in a town may make contracts at different times.  A particular trader may enter into a contract which will subsequently <Col N="1971" /> prove unprofitable.  There may be a fluctuation in the market value of an article, in the ordinary course of business. The trader may have entered into a contract for the supply of an article the market value of which drops.  That trader may try to safeguard himself by charging what, in the ordinary course of events, would be a reasonable price. There may be other traders in the same locality who bought later on more advantageous terms.  They may be underselling the other trader, who is merely getting what would, in the ordinary course, be regarded as a normal profit.  That price might be regarded as profiteering having regard to the market value at the time, whereas the trader might actually be selling at a loss.  On the other hand, the value of a commodity may go up considerably after a trader has entered into a contract.  Would he be entitled, notwithstanding that he bought considerably under the market value, to charge the market value on the particular date on which he is selling?  Would that be regarded as profiteering?</P>
      <P>What I want to convey is this&mdash; suppose he had bought the goods at a price on a particular date, and the value of a particular article that he had bought had in the meantime gone up considerably, would it be reasonable for him to charge the market price, or would it be profiteering if he were to do so?  The market price in a particular case might mean a very considerable profit.  Of course there are fluctuations in the market price from time to time.  Any man who is really a businessman has to speculate in buying goods from day to day.  He has to take risks in buying and selling, and these everyday transactions bring him face to face with the risk of the article going down in value.  The market may go against him.  On the other hand, because of the possibility of balancing his account, he will be prepared to take risks.  A man will be prepared to contract for the supply of an article at a date very much ahead.  The profit on that transaction may compensate him for losses previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1972" /> The difficulty I can foresee in regard to the inspector is this&mdash;how is he to arrive at what is profiteering in different circumstances?  If the trader has to take a risk that the article may go down on the one hand, how can the inspector give a decision against him if the article goes up?  The matter is most complicated.  A businessman takes a contract on which he may lose money.  Businessmen have to do that from time to time.  They may incur serious losses in the event of the market fluctuating against them.  If the market goes in their favour they sell, and make a profit when they are only charging the market value of the article at that particular date.  From a particular commodity which he has bought a trader may have a considerable profit compared with the price of the article on the date at which he contracted.  Will the inspector regard that as profiteering?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>By the Controller. Surely the trader cannot have it both ways.  The Controller would decide a question of policy like this, whether the price paid by the seller wholesale shall determine the price charged retail; or whether the market price was to rule.  But the trader cannot get it both ways.  There are two methods obviously which the Controller could adopt&mdash;either the trader is entitled to charge a higher price than the market price when he bought, but if so, he must charge a lower price if the market falls.  The individual trader may charge higher prices than the wholesale price justifies him in charging. But these are questions to be determined by the Controller, and when coming to a conclusion he will apply to that all the facts supplied him by the inspector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are providing in our amendment that if a trader finds that the general level of price is such that the prices charged could not be regarded as unreasonable, then he can appeal from <Col N="1973" /> the Controller to the Commission, and have an investigation into the whole matter.  If that investigation shows that there has been no excessive profit taken, then no price certificate is issued against the trader.  It seems to me that this Bill has, if anything, been carefully framed in order to make it rest as lightly as possible on the traders of the country.  My feeling is that this part of this Bill will not be operated to any undue extent at all, and that the existence of these powers in the Controller and the existence of the machinery of investigation will prove a deterrent to that particular thing.  The machinery is there in the Bill to check any profiteering that may exist.</P>

      <P>The Minister refers to unreasonable prices on the part of the trader.  Leave out of account <Col N="1974" /> altogether the case that the trader deliberately sets out to cheat any of his customers.  Leave out the trader who operates with what the Minister calls a guilty conscience. Let us take two traders in the same town.  The whole method of the running of these two businesses may be completely distinct. One may have a large staff.  The other may run his business by his own family.  Take also into account the fact that one trader gives credit and the other does not.  In such cases there may be considerable difference between the prices charged by two traders in the same town.</P>
      <P>When the Minister speaks of a reasonable price and when he expects the inspector to investigate the question of charging an unreasonable price I submit to the House that it has never been made quite clear in this discussion as to what was meant by &ldquo;unreasonable charges.&rdquo;  Is it &ldquo;unreasonable&rdquo; in reference to the actual business of that particular trader?  If it has not that particular meaning I suggest that it is most unfair and that it can operate most unfairly to the trader.  It may really amount to asking him to run his business at a distinct loss leaving altogether out of account any profit. There must be a complete investigation into the running of the business of that particular man.  I suggest that that is a most complicated investigation requiring the most detailed knowledge of that particular business.  I wonder is the same inspector expected to be an expert in the running of different types of business?  It is difficult for an outsider to determine how business in one particular line can be run, but if he is to investigate the grocery business and the drapery business I doubt if the inspector will be found to have the capacity for doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid that the Minister has not a sufficiently clear idea as to how business is run by the ordinary traders in the country.  The inspector will have to investigate into overhead costs.  Now, very few country traders get their accounts audited.  I am aware that some of them have done it quite recently.  They have brought in <Col N="1975" /> an auditor for income-tax purposes. In this case the trader has to make up his mind in ten days whether he is going to enter into that investigation when a charge is being made against him, or an allegation has been made that may be perfectly unfair.  That period may be altogether inadequate for the trader to make up his mind. The Controller will fix whether there is a fair price or not, but in reality the only evidence that the Controller has before him as to the running of that man's business is what the inspector sends to him.  He is completely dependent on that one presentation of the case.  It may be that that inspector is not capable and cannot be capable of understanding the complications of running a business.  I think if the Minister had experience of how the ordinary shopkeeper in the country town runs his business he would see the extreme difficulty the shopkeeper would have in making up his mind in a case where he has no desire to cheat anybody, whether he is capable of presenting a case to the Commission for investigation.  The ordinary country trader does not keep books, though I know that recently as a result of the activities of the Inland Revenue Commissioners a number of people have got in auditors to tell them where they stand in these matters. They have only the very vaguest idea as to what their running costs are, and yet the Minister expects a man to make up his mind on all that particular matter &mdash; because he is visited by an inspector in ten days.  I suggest that this is a most unreasonable demand to make of a shopkeeper. I am dealing only with the shopkeeper who is acting in perfectly good faith, and who is charging what seems to him a reasonable price.  We have no indication as to what the Minister means by a reasonable price.  We do not know whether it is a reasonable price for that article in the district&mdash; and from some of his remarks I understood him to mean this&mdash;or a reasonable price in reference to that particular business.  You may have an average price for a district that would mean selling at a loss and bankruptey <Col N="1976" /> for one particular man in the way he runs his business.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister a question.  I asked the wrong question before.  I asked a question about a price certificate; I want to ask it now with regard to a price order.  A price order cannot relate to an individual only.  Is not that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see why anyone should ever accept anything under the first sub-section of Section 32.  If he gives in on Section 32 he is going to give an undertaking to charge in future a reasonable price&mdash;not the reasonable price&mdash;and certainly not the price of which complaint has been made.  What &ldquo;in future&rdquo; means we do not know.  What will happen if he gives that undertaking and breaks it we do not know, because what follows under sub-sections (b) and (c) only comes into force if he fails to comply with the requirements.  If he gives an undertaking in writing to charge in future a reasonable price he has complied with the requirements of the notice, has he not?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  Supposing he thereupon overcharges after giving the undertaking, what is the penalty for the breach?  Is it laid down here?  I do not see it.  He could give an undertaking in writing and the next day charge the old price.  Is that so? What is the purpose of the section? That is one point.  Supposing, however, he does not give that undertaking&mdash;supposing he is an honest individual and says &ldquo;I will not give the undertaking&rdquo;&mdash;then we may issue a price certificate.  There is one thing at any rate he avoids by refusing to comply with the requirements of the notice, and that is a refund, because under the price certificate he cannot be compelled to make a refund.  Is that not so?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should he give an undertaking which is accompanied by the necessity for a refund, when he could, instead, have a price certificate? The answer is, of course, that the refund may be done secretly as the notice may be kept quiet.  The certificate is published.  That is an important point he has to determine within ten days, because when ten days pass he cannot avoid either of two things happening&mdash;a price order being made for the area or a price certificate, applicable to him only, being issued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>He is faced with either of two things.  As I say, he can balance against a price certificate and its publicity the fact that he will not have to make a refund.  He can go a step further and say &ldquo;I will give no undertaking, but when notice is served on me that a price certificate is going to be made I can produce evidence that the level of wholesale prices does not show me to be any greater profiteer than anybody else.&rdquo; Thereupon he can throw the whole area into the dispute, and if anything happens after that it is going to be a price order for the whole area and no refund to be made by the individual trader.  It is a rather complicated provision.  I do not know if it has been thought out, or if that is supposed to be a scheme of the punishment appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the man with a guilty conscience who has overcharged but who knows that three or four other people in the neighbourhood are overcharging with him.  Somebody makes a complaint about him.  We know how complaints will be instituted against one particular individual and not against others&mdash;and he has a notice served on him requiring him to repay.  He says &ldquo;no.&rdquo;  Notice then comes upon him for a price certificate and again he says: &ldquo;I can give evidence <Col N="1978" /> against two or three traders in the area.&rdquo;  He thus saves himself a refund, and saves himself the publicity of the price certificate, because it will not be applicable to him alone &mdash;it will be applicable to the whole area.  Is that the punishment for the individual guilty man against whom a complaint is made?  I suggest that the whole section should be taken back, with the other section about which some doubt has been raised here, and brought up again with those things fully considered.</P>
    <P>I now get back to my original point. The ten day period is to let the man make up his mind as to whether or not he will start certain machinery in operation.  He may then, within fourteen days, succeed in diverting the whole inquiry from himself on to the traders in the area, but he has got to make up his mind in ten days as to whether he will face the possibility of a public notice against himself, or whether he will take things quietly and pay the money over.  As I say, under the section, according to what the Minister said, he could pay the money over, give an undertaking in writing to charge a reasonable price, and on the next day proceed to charge the old price.  Then I suppose the whole thing has to be gone over once more&mdash;all this business about complaints and notices, the inspector making an investigation, the inspector reporting the result of that investigation to the Controller, the Controller serving a notice on the individual trader, who can give an undertaking in writing to repay to the individual by whom the complaint has been made, and go on as before.  If that is the purpose of the Act I say no more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear from what the Deputy has said that the trader who proposes to act in the way the Deputy has suggested has twenty-four days to do it in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>He has ten days to determine his tactics, and twenty-four days to carry them out.  That is one <Col N="1979" /> point established.  The second point is this.  What happens in the second period of fourteen days is that the trader appeals from the decision of the Controller to the Commission, but the Commission may decide on that appeal that a price investigation into the general level of prices of that commodity in the area is not necessary&mdash; in other words, that the appeal is not a bona fide appeal on that ground&mdash;and consequently a price certificate is issued.  The only other point made by the Deputy was that the trader may rattle off a guarantee straight away, and proceed to ignore it immediately afterwards.  The trader could conceivably do that, but conceivably if he does it he is going to bring much more trouble on himself than if he risked the price certificate in the first instance, because it is going to mean continuous investigation by inspectors, and the continuous giving of those undertakings.  At some stage he will be caught out, and those undertakings of his will appear in public.</P>

      <P>As one interested in the provision line, is the Minister aware that, from time to time, prices possibly change five to six times in one day?  When the inspector is arriving at a decision in regard to what is a reasonable price, what is a reasonable profit, what would be profiteering, or <Col N="1981" /> what would not be profiteering, what is the basis on which he would consider the prices charged as being profiteering or otherwise?  What I want to bring home to the Minister is this, if a man has entered into a contract and with the fluctuation of prices that contract becomes what we consider a bad deal, in other words, that the market has gone against him, and the prices go down considerably, what happens? It is unnecessary for me to point out to the Minister that competition in every line of business is sufficient to bring down prices and, beyond yea or nay, the market has gone against him, and he is going to lose on that transaction. On the other hand, if the price of a particular commodity for which he has paid a certain sum appreciates, in other words if the market has gone in his favour, where do you draw the line with regard to what would be reasonable, or what would be an unreasonable price, making due allowance for the losses he might sustain for entering into a bad contract; and also taking into account the fact that after he has made a good contract by which he is making a profit and as a result of the fluctuation of the market that particular commodity has depreciated in value, in the meantime, since he entered into the contract?  Now it might be said that it would be unreasonable, that it might be profiteering, when he is only getting the market value of what was the wholesale price of that particular commodity at that particular date.  But if he entered into a contract at a time when the value of that particular commodity was much lower than the market value was at a subsequent date, would you consider that profiteering?</P>

      <P>If you want my personal opinion I would say that, if the trader has given his customer the benefit of any reduction in the wholesale price and suffered a loss on that reduction, then he would be entitled to get the advantage of any increase in the retail price, or any decline in the wholesale price.  I mentioned the two principles upon which the Controller could operate.</P>

      <P>You would not consider <Col N="1982" /> it profiteering for a man who entered into a contract, it often occurs in the provision line, perhaps three, and, in some instances, six months ahead, thus taking a risk in speculating (and any good business man will speculate) if he wants to make his business progressive he must take his profits and his losses together.  When the value of a particular commodity goes down in the market he must always have to meet it, and, needless to say, if others bought on better terms than he has, he will have to bring his terms to suit his customers.  Otherwise they will take his customers&mdash;to retain his customers he must come down and meet their prices.  Consequently, he must sustain a considerable loss if the contract he entered into was more than the market value at that date.  On the other hand, if the market goes up and he has entered into that contract, and the market value of that particular commodity at a date subsequent, say, three months from the date he entered into the contract, is considerably over the price he contracted at, do you say that is profiteering?.  It is the market value of the commodity at that particular date and he has to meet with competition which we hit up against every day in business.  He had to take his losses when the market went against him.  Now he is only looking for the market value, and the market value might appear, to any one not well acquainted with markets, an unreasonable one.  Would that be regarded as profiteering when he has previously suffered a loss on a previous contract? I take it for granted the inspector will refer to the invoices, and in referring to these invoices I hope will have a good knowledge of the business and of the fluctuation in prices, and that he will make reasonable allowance for one and the other.  If you have a fixed standard and you do not take into account losses as well as profits it will be very difficult to arrive at what is a reasonable price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That this Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>When this Government came into office one of the matters to which we gave early consideration was the possibility of establishing a cement industry in Saorstát Eireann.  We found that various proposals for the establishment of such an industry had been submitted from time to time by different parties to our predecessors, and by other parties.  Such proposals were almost immediately submitted to us when we came into office.  As we examined the matter two considerations arose, to which we had to give very careful attention. In the first place, it became clear that none of those at present engaged in the manufacture of cement here, contemplated their being able to purchase and market that cement at a price comparable to that at which cement is now imported.  Consequently to adopt their proposals would have meant an increased price for cement in the Saorstát.  In the second place it became clear that to establish a cement industry here would not, in itself, directly affect the unemployment position to a substantial degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As most Deputies are aware, the amount of employment given in the modern cement mill is remarkably small, and, particularly so, when consideration is given to the large capital investment involved.  We were faced, therefore, with these two considerations: that the amount of direct employment to be given in a cement mill would be small, and that on the basis of the proposal before us, an increase of the price of cement would arise if any of these proposals were adopted.  These were two considerations obviously of great importance, because it was conceivable that an increase in the price would result in a drop in sales to all building operations and public works so that more unemployment <Col N="1991" /> would be caused by the increased selling price than the increase of employment given in the new cement factories.  We were, nevertheless, particularly anxious to secure the establishment of cement factories here.  Consequently we turned our attention to the possibility of modifying some of the proposals before us, or getting new proposals that would overcome those difficulties, and which would provide comparable employment in the contemplated industry and which, at the same time, would secure that the price of cement would not be increased.  We came to the conclusion that we could have achieved this objective by proceeding with the establishment of the cement industry in two stages.</P>
    <P>We decided that the first stage should be to establish, in Saorstát Eireann, what are called grinding mills; that is, places where cement clinkers, imported into this country, would be ground and turned out as cement.  The total consumption of cement in this country would permit of the establishment of three such grinding mills upon an economic basis. The employment given in connection with three such mills would be equal to, or at any rate very little less than, the employment which would be given in one cement factory for the whole process of supplying the requirements of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Roughly about that. We went carefully into the cost of erection of such mills, the price at which the clinkers could be imported, and the cost of grinding in such mills, and also when the clinkers are treated, packed and distributed.  It became <Col N="1992" /> quite clear that cement clinkers imported and ground in such a mill would permit the cement being sold here at a lower price than now prevailing for imported cement.  We decided, therefore, it was advisable, in all the circumstances, to proceed upon these lines until it became clear that circumstances would permit of our doing the entire process without damage to other industries.  We were in contact with various interested parties, and proposals were submitted to us, all of which we examined.</P>
      <P>As a result of the examination of these proposals, we come to the Dáil with this measure.  It is clear that if any company is going to embark upon the heavy capital investments involved in the erection of these mills, it would require to be secured in the supply of its raw materials for such a period as would permit of its amortising that capital.  Such period, we ascertained, would be about ten years.  It was, of course, within my competence to assure anybody interested in the proposal that it was the policy of the Government of which I am a member not to impose a customs duty or to impede the importation of cement clinkers, and it is possible that interested parties would be satisfied with such an undertaking.  But I, naturally, felt it incumbent on me, in view of the fact that the period contemplated was longer than the normal life of a Government, to take such steps as the introduction of this Bill, and to inform the parties that I had the authority of the Dáil for an undertaking of that kind.  It is said that there is nothing to prevent any future Dáil, in the exercise of its sovereign powers, repealing these proposals, or, by legislation, cancelling any previous Act in consequence of its powers.  But it is obvious such action could not be taken unless circumstances had so changed the authority here that the Government in office at the time would feel it was justified in doing so.  If this Bill is passed it will be passed with the full knowledge in the minds of everybody likely to be interested that that is the position.</P>

      <P>So far as this Bill is concerned, it is quite clear that, where an undertaking is given to any one company in consequence of the passage of this Bill, the circumstances resulting from that undertaking will apply to all companies.  That is clearly understood.  The passage of this Bill will permit the Minister to give an undertaking to a company that proposes to manufacture cement from clinker here that no duty will be placed on clinker for ten years.  No special advantage is conferred on any one company.  The advantage is open to all companies.  As far as the law will permit, any company is free to engage in this particular industry.  It is equally clear that there is nothing in the Bill that will prevent at any time any company engaging in the manufacture of cement, by which I mean the whole process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to inform the Dáil that, to my knowledge, there is one company prepared, as soon as this Bill is passed to put up the necessary capital and to proceed at once with the erection of grinding mills on receipt of an undertaking from me: that following the passage of this Bill these mills will be erected and that cement from them will be available in six or nine months' time.  That cement, I am informed, will be of the current British standard specification, and will be sold here at a price ex-mill substantially lower than that now prevailing.  The Bill, as Deputies are aware, is a simple one and is introduced under the circumstances I have indicated.  It is necessary I think that I should give an explanation to the Dáil why the Government is proceeding to get the cement industry established along this particular line as against getting the whole process of cement manufacture undertaken <Col N="1994" /> here now.  There were various proposals by different companies and different groups of people in that connection. The adoption of any one of these proposals, and an embarkation upon that policy, would involve a customs duty on imported cement and a rise in prices.  We decided deliberately and calmly&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There was, in fact, no proposal submitted to me which did not involve, in addition to a customs duty, a monopoly of the market, subject to control of prices, such control of price being a price higher than that now prevailing.  We decided, therefore, and decided deliberately, after very mature consideration, that we were going to proceed along this alternative line.  By this alternative line we get a substantial part of the process of manufacture done here.  We get employment for an equivalent number of people, and we get cement at a lower price than it is now available. That is, I think something that we can be satisfied about, particularly when we know that it does not place any barrier to the establishment of the complete industry here at any time that circumstances will permit of that being done.  I accordingly move the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy apparently knows nothing about the cement industry.  I was going to explain that, if we import the cement clinker free, the amount of employment that will be given to turn the clinker into cement is practically negligible; that it is not worth talking about.  So far as the manufacture of cement is concerned, the real employment is given in making the clinker.  I think the Minister will admit that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am astounded.  My information is this: it is got from experts in the trade and from firms that are going to benefit by this Bill, that so far as the question of employment is concerned the greatest possible amount of employment is given in the manufacture of the clinker.  Does the Minister deny that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not pose to be an expert.  The employment in any case <Col N="1997" /> is quite small.  We are gaining in employment by the fact that we can have at least three grinding mills as economic units of production.  We could only have one cement factory as an economic unit of production.  The employment given in three grinding mills is about the equivalent of the amount of employment that would be given in one cement factory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like the Minister, do not pretend to know very much about this matter, but as one member of the House who is interested in it I have done all I possibly could to get information.  My information is that seven-eights of the employment is given in the manufacture or production of the clinker.  That is my information. There are members of this House who have some practical knowledge and experience in this matter, but I am giving my opinion for what it is worth.  I do not know anything at all about it myself, but I am told that practically all the employment in the cement production business is in the production of the clinker.  Once the clinker is there, it is a matter purely of machinery grinding it into cement, and I am informed that the amount of employment given would not be more than thirty hands, and I am further informed that the present tariff on cement, that is, the tariff against British cement and in favour of the foreign cement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is the same thing so far as purchase is concerned, but I am informed that whether cement is imported from England or from Belgium, there is a cement ring, and that even if the cement is imported from Belgium, the English cement exporter gets his share of the spoils out of the profits.  I have been informed of that by a fairly extensive importer of cement.  I know nothing at all about the business myself, but I have gone to the trouble of trying to acquire information. I should like to remind the Minister of some of his own speeches in this House during the last four or five years.  I should like to remind some members of the present Government Party, and, if he were here, but unfortunately he is not, Deputy Corish <Col N="1998" /> of Wexford, of the Drinagh Cement Company in Wexford.  I should also like, if it were possible for me, to refer Senator Comyn and many others who have laid down here for the last five years that there was no reason why this country should not support at least one cement factory.  I should also have mentioned Deputy Tom Finlay, who, I understand, is ill, but who also wanted a cement factory in Skerries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister contradicted me in my first point and said that it was quite economic, while in his own speech he said that in order to set up a cement factory to produce cement from the ground up, from the first substance to the finished article, was not possible, that it could not be done, and that the protection that would be required would be out of all proportion, and, secondly, that we would have to give a complete monopoly here which the Minister, and I agree with him, does not desire.  This Bill is the most effective answer that could be given to the speeches made by the Minister himself and by his colleagues over a number of years on the cement question.  What does it mean? Three-fourths of the labour involved in the making of cement goes into the making of the clinker.  The clinker is imported here and it is then a question of machinery grinding the clinker into cement, and I put it to the Minister that the employment to be given as a result of the passage of this Bill would be very small.  I want to say this, however, that, if the Minister can <Col N="2000" /> assure me that the passage of this Bill will not mean any undue&mdash;and I will let the Minister make any play he likes with the word&mdash;increase in price&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If it means a decrease in price, without any decrease in quality, and if it were to mean the employment of only two extra hands, I am going to Vote for the Bill.  I do say this, however, that the Minister ought to be&mdash;if I use the phrase &ldquo;honest with the House,&rdquo; I may be misunderstood, but I am not impugning the Minister personally&mdash;but, at any rate, if he is putting this Bill before the House, he ought to give us the real reasons and all the reasons why it is not practical at the moment to set up a cement factory in this country.  I want to make my position clear.  I am not very much in love with this Bill, but if I am assured by the Minister that it is going to mean that we can produce as good an article at the same price, at a lower price or, even, at a slightly increased price, and give more employment&mdash;even if it were only five extra men&mdash;I am prepared to vote for it, but I want to know why we cannot carry out the suggestion made by the Minister himself when he was in Opposition two years ago for a cement factory in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say that I have much the same feelings as Deputy Morrissey has expressed himself as having on one angle of this whole measure.  I had got a fairly clear idea from the Minister when he was speaking, and I attended to all he said, but he has left me very much confused by his interjections to Deputy Morrissey.  He did say, without the slightest doubt or hesitancy, that to adopt proposals for the establishment of a cement manufactory in this country, raising the materials here which we have, would have meant an increase in the price of cement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>He said that it would not affect seriously the question <Col N="2001" /> of employment here, although later we were told it would give very much the same employment&mdash;that is two hundred people.  These two things have to be considered in relation to the big capital which would have to be employed in cement manufacture. He said later that by importing this clinker and giving some guarantee in this Bill we will be able to produce it at the same price as that imported. To one interjection by Deputy Morrissey he said at the same price as English cement.  I do not know whether he means the English cement against the Emergency Duties or in any event, supposing it is, it is notorious that Belgian cement has been coming to this country for years at something not less than about 6/-under the price of English cement, and, if you take the quoted price of English cement, the price is nearly 12/- less.  I do not know whether the guarantee giving these proposals is a guarantee for a period not more than eleven years and if we are going to have cement at not less than the price at which we can import Belgian cement. Is that what is proposed?  If we can get cement here from imported clinkers, which we will be able to sell at not less than the Belgian cement is being sold already, is that the proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not intended to put a restriction on the importation of cement.  I would like to qualify that to this extent, that there has been some indications recently of what is clearly &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; from one or two countries, where there is a depreciated currency and certain other factors operating to induce the exportation of cement at a lower price than that at which it is sold here, and much lower than in the countries of origin. If that went on to an undue extent we might have to contemplate certain duties designed to restrict that type of importation.  The intention is definitely, subject to that qualification, that there will be no restriction on imported cement and consequently, any company operating here following the passage of this Bill, if it wants to sell cement here, it must sell in competition <Col N="2002" /> with other cement.  The intention of the group I mentioned is to sell at a substantially lower price, which they are quite capable of doing.</P>

      <P>So that there will be no duty put on Belgian cement coming into this country.  Therefore we have to take it that the test is that they are satisfied with the tariff against Belgian cement; they are satisfied that they can sell, as the Minister stated, at a substantially less price than the Belgian cement now fetches.  That is going to take some doing.  I want to get back to the point that Deputy Morrissey started upon, the adoption of the proposals for cement manufacture, that the raising of materials here until the cement is turned out has been turned down because it would increase the price of cement, and because it would only give about two hundred people employment. We have not heard by how much it would raise the price of cement.  We have not heard what would be the extra cost to the community spread over housing and road making.  I would like to get the amount, because remember we are going to impose a tariff upon flour in this country, and the estimate made by those applying for that tariff was that no higher number of people will be put into employment than 130, while it is calculated that the cost will be £330,000.  Yet that is accepted, notwithstanding that danger, and for cement we are turning down the idea or raising the materials.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are turning it down for the time, on the basis stated by the Minister, that when you offset the amount of employment given to two hundred people, and the extra cost to the community of cement made here, in the words of Deputy Morrissey, you have to consider that it is an uneconomic proposition.  I remember the Minister saying here on one of these dumping duties about spades and shovels that if you took as a test the price at which you could buy the articles imported we should stop manufacturing everything.  That was the test the Minister applied with regard to the turning down of cement manufacture. The Minister says that these things have all to be related to the capital involved.  Whose capital would be involved in any proposals put to the Minister for establishing the cement industry?  Was there any capital from this country?  There were firms quite prepared to put up all the capital. Why need we bother about that capital except and only in relation to this, the selling price of the commodity, which would have to be sufficient to enable whoever put up the capital to get back their money?  If there were people prepared to risk as much as £750,000 to establish the cement industry I would like to find out, before we go further, what would that entail in the way of extra cost on the community, and what would it entail in the way of extra employment over the two hundred persons spoken of as likely to be occupied through the grinding mills?  I do not know how the labour is divided.  I think Deputy Morrissey exaggerated the point a bit.  It seems to require explanation that if you simply import clinkers to grind in a mill that you are going to get the same employment as by raising the material.  Surely there is more in raising the material and transferring it to the site of a factory.  We have to add that to the employment given at the factory.  At any rate the point arises that with clinker brought in here, and with Irish material, the employment is the same in both cases.  If the clinker is imported there is a certain <Col N="2004" /> amount of dock labour that is to set against the employment given in raising the material.  Again I suggest that the materials are not merely here in abundance but are here in abundance in many areas.  I welcome that as far as it shows a glimmer of sense at last with regard to certain economics&mdash;even elementary economics&mdash; that you have to consider the price, so far as it affects us in two directions, the building of houses and the making of roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to get another item considered. Supposing cement was to go up by from 3/- to 5/- a ton, has any calculation been made as to what will be the extra cost per house in the different categories of houses under some Housing Acts, in comparison with what would be the cost if they were houses now building with imported cement?  That is the only test I think that should be applied in these cases. How much per house, in the different types of houses we have to consider, and for which subsidies have been given, would be the increase by using Irish manufactured cement in comparison with houses built with imported cement?  That is one side of the thing, and, in so far we see at last some appreciation of the fact that the final cost to the consumer has to be taken into consideration, it is pointing to an improvement in the mental process of the Minister, that education has some effect, and that experience is telling some little bit.  All that is very welcome.  But I think there is a serious objection to this Bill from another angle.  I do not suppose there was ever a proposition of this type put before any Parliament.  Look at the terms of this: &ldquo;When the Minister for Industry and Commerce is satisfied that a company has, whether before or after or partly before and partly after the passing of this Act, erected&rdquo; certain machinery, that Minister may &ldquo;at his discretion, by writing sealed with his official seal, undertake with such company that no duty of customs&rdquo; shall be imposed for an eleven year period or downwards.  There has been a heap of talk about secret documents recently. What is the Minister asking us to do now?  He asks that, at his sole <Col N="2005" /> discretion and whenever he thinks fit, he should be allowed to tie the hands of this House as far as he can do it for eleven years.  Has ever such a proposition of that type been put before any House?  In what are known as trade treaties there is a denouncing clause, but the trade treaty is ratified and the House has it in its control to say that the period over which the treaty is to last is too long and that the period in which it may be denounced ought to be shortened.  We are giving control here over one important item of customs to a Minister who may be replaced in six months.</P>
    <P>We give him power to tie this House on a financial item for eleven years.  There was a considerable amount of constitutional learning poured out in the Parliament of England to make the Ottawa duties operate over a period of five years&mdash;a limited period&mdash;a period somewhere near the lifetime of the House over here.  This, however, is for a period to extend, as the Minister said, over the ordinary normal lifetime of the Government here; and it is to be done without the House getting any idea as to what the proposal is in respect of which he is likely to certify.  This clearly demands much more than what is contained in this skeleton Bill.  On a proposal like that contained in this Bill I would certainly give notice that, as far as I am concerned, I would not consider myself tied by any guarantee that the Minister gave under these conditions. If any firm takes up business under a Bill of that type, it is asking for trouble.  If the Minister wants stable conditions for firms coming in here he has got to give more than is contained in this Bill.  He has got to come here with proposals.  He has got to give the relative prices per ton of the various cements and inform us what amount of capital is going to be put into it and who is going to give the capital and, in contradistinction to that what is the best kind of cement and what is the extra employment which will accrue out of these enterprises. He has got to tell us where the material is to be raised and if it is to be raised in different areas, where these areas are.  He has got to let us know in these schemes where the capital was <Col N="2006" /> to come from, what capital was proposed, and in the end what was going to be the price at the factory itself and the price at which the material was going to be sold through the country. If all parties decide, after getting these details, to agree to this, then the firm has some reasonable guarantee; but if any firm takes up position under the Bill as it stands now, then they are asking for a very definite rebuff from any Government that comes into power which is able to change that guarantee. It must be emphasised that nothing that this Parliament does can tie the hands of the next Parliament.</P>
    <P>I thought, as I said, when I saw this amazing proposal to give the Minister power to tie the hands of the House in a matter of finance over a period of eleven years, that the Minister's speech in seconding this was going to set forth all the things that I have alluded to.  I thought that we would know the details; but I doubt if anybody, after listening to him, has any knowledge as to what price cement is going to be sold at for twelve months after the three grinding mills have been established.  What profit do the people, who will establish these mills, look to get for this?  They are going to amortise their capital in ten years, we are told.  I do not know why a period of ten years was chosen.  Does the machinery that grinds clinkers ordinarily require to be replaced in ten years?  If it does not, why is that period chosen?  Is it to avoid the instability that accrues from two Parliaments having to recognise this guarantee?</P>
    <P>Of course, if the thing is to go through, and all the details are given to the House and proper consideration given to it, then it would be far better to extend the period to whatever would be the ordinary life of the replaceable machinery.  The Minister tells us&mdash;and this again I want to have further explained&mdash; that if we give this guarantee for eleven years or some period not longer than eleven years, that we can later on go on to the full scheme of development of cement works without harm to any other industry.  That leaves me a little bit puzzled.  At the moment, we are turning down a <Col N="2007" /> scheme for raising the raw materials for cement manufacture from where they are in this country and we are doing that because the Minister said it would raise the price of cement. But later on, he said, we will be able to do that.  Why?  Why later on instead of now?  What circumstances later on will enable us to raise the material?  We adopt a scheme now whereby we import raw material and grind it here, but later on we will be able to go on to a scheme in which we will raise our own cement material and manufacture it here.  If that is so, there is some explanation required as to why it is not being done now and as to why it cannot be done now. We are going to erect, I understand, three mills.  Are there three firms in question before the Minister's mind at the moment, or only one?  If there is only one, why the diversion into three mills?  Is it part of the decentralisation of industry that has been so affecting the Minister for so long?  If there is only one firm, has that one firm, on its own, suggested three grinding mills, or has there been any consideration given to the possibility of getting a decrease in the cost of the manufacture of cement if all this grinding was to be done at one mill instead of in three mills.  If there is only one mill, what is the employment to be given at that one mill?  Are we, in other words, looking to get three grinding mills in order to sweeten three constituencies for the Minister and to get some little amount of employment, which is wasteful employment, rather than have the whole thing done at one mill, which might mean possibly less employment but getting in the end a reduced price to the consumer?</P>
    <P>In connection with that, we also require some information from the Minister as to whether or not, when proposals were put up for cement factories in the country there were also proposals for a single factory; whether, of their own, these people decided that they had better have one, two or three factories; or whether it was the Minister's pressure with regard to decentralisation <Col N="2008" /> that insisted on this being done.  I should like to get definitely put before the House, before we go a step further with the Bill, a statement as to the best proposals under monopoly conditions, with regulations as to prices, for a single cement works to manufacture cement for the whole of the country; the best price which that monopolistic group could guarantee for the distribution of cement through the country; to the areas where generally cement is used; and, as a contrast to that, a statement from the Minister as to the price that will be paid finally under this.  Then we can take our decision on it, knowing that this scheme, at any rate, wipes out what the Minister has so often lectured us about, the use of certain raw materials which are here in abundance for a certain manufacturing process. We will have to find out why.  I am not saying there is not a good reason, but it has not been explained.</P>
    <P>The thing has to be subject to certain variations.  I should like to have some statement as to the more or less exact price at which, over, say, a six months' period, cement will be sold here after these grinding mills have been established; because if there is a definite guarantee that we can have a substantial reduction, quality being the same, on the price at which Belgian cement is being imported, then something has been promised to the Minister which was never promised before. If there is a promise I want to know if is subject to any variation; variation, say, in the rate of wages to be paid; variation in the price to be paid for coal; variation with regard to, say, the use of electric power, if electric power is to be used in the factory.  If all these things enter into consideration, let us have, at any rate, a statement as to the items which enter into the scheme; at what wage rate, at what price of coal, and what price of electric current, is a guaranteed price going to be made to us for a six or twelve months' period?</P>
    <P>I suggest seriously that it is something that amounts to an insult to the House that they should be asked to pass this.  It is a complete scorning of Parliamentary procedure.  For eleven years, the Minister is going to <Col N="2009" /> be given the power to tie up this House, and another House so far as he can, with regard to the imposition of customs duties on a particular item, when he is satisfied, not when the House is satisfied, but when he is satisfied that certain machinery has been erected, or is going to be erected, and that from the clinker imported cement is going to be turned out at some price which the House does not know.  That is an amazing proposal, a proposal which I think the House should reject. If there is to be a scheme of development, and if the Minister wants to be in a position to ensure that firm or firms some stability with regard to conditions, he has got to do all I have said: to give this House the material upon which they can come to a proper conclusion; such a conclusion as would enable them to say that it is right and proper to tie this House and the succeeding House in so far as they can.</P>

You have to get all these elements.  What decision is possible under this and under what the Minister said?  Nothing, except to trust the Minister.  Can anybody, after reading the Bill and listening to the Minister, say that he is in a position to give an answer to any of his constituents who may ask: what is the price at which cement is going to be sold in this country, and for how long, and subject to what variation?  At any rate, for what it is worth, if that is all that is to be put before us&mdash;I hope it is not all; I hope there will be some attempt to give details on which a decision can be taken&mdash;let us have it stated from this side of the House that any bargain founded upon that is going to be baseless, is going to be a most tentative sort of arrangement, one open to scrutiny; and the moment it can be scrutinised by other people it is going to be open to change, at the earliest moment at which change can occur. The only way to get out of that situation <Col N="2010" /> is to put more details before the House than have been given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask a couple of question.  I notice that this says: if and whenever the Minister for Industry and Commerce is satisfied that a company has erected a mill. Surely, it is scarcely fair to a company to ask them to erect a mill and then come to the Minister for his permission? It ought to be possible to arrive at some stage at which, if they comply with certain conditions, they will get the permission.  The Minister mentioned that this is a half-way house towards the establishment of the cement industry here.  It occurs to me that it may be quite the opposite, because, obviously, if grinding mills are put up, they will be put up at the most economic points for grinding clinkers coming in from overseas.  If, at some future time, a cement factory is established in this country, it might happen that the site chosen may not be near the grinding mills.  The Minister, I understood, stated there will be no duty imposed upon imported cement. That is really the acid test: keeping the supplies open to the people of the country and ensuring that the price would not be increased by reason of protection given to someone who is already doing the process of manufacture here.  I am absolutely unable to follow the Minister's reasoning that the price will be substantially reduced by grinding in this country.  The Minister, no doubt, can elaborate it, but I cannot see how, by the leaving of some of the grinding mills idle at the parent mill, while clinker is brought in and ground here, the price is going to be reduced, if the factory is more or less being cut in two.  That baffles me, and it is absolutely against all the ideas of efficient modern manufacture, which entails the grouping together of all the processes, if not under one roof, at least in one line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on the very frank statement that he gave us this afternoon. He told us that the manufacture of cement in this State is in substance an uneconomic proposition. That will be a great disappointment for many people in our country.  We <Col N="2011" /> have been hearing frequently of the desirability of erecting cement factories in many areas in this country.  From my own knowledge I am satisfied that we have as good a basis for the manufacture of cement in this country as is to be found in any country in Europe; but nevertheless, the fact is that, while we have the material from which excellent cement can be manufactured, we cannot manufacture it.  I think the Minister deserves to be congratulated for bringing that matter to our notice.</P>
      <P>Some of us on these benches have been drawing the attention both of this Government and of its predecessor to the serious effect an increase in the cost of living would have on the industrial development of the country. None of us who has been observing the imposition of tariffs here almost by the wagon-load during the last few months, until almost everything around us except the very air we breathe is tariffed&mdash;none of us who has been trying to live in that atmosphere will doubt that the obvious effect of it has been to increase the cost of living.  If we look up the figures we will find that the increase in the cost of living here is very seriously in excess of the cost of living in either England or Scotland.  I hope that Deputies who may follow me on this point will read the cost of living figures before they enter on the subject.  I have read them and I find that the cost of living is a very serious factor.</P>
      <P>It has been difficult to get Deputies here to realise its effect on industrial development.  From that point of view this discussion has been to my mind of the most useful character.  I congratulate the Minister on being so frank about it.  The cost of living has its reaction in increasing wages.  If Deputies have any doubt on that point, as some Deputies sitting behind the Minister may have, I will ask them to read to-day's Order Paper.  There is there a motion that has been discussed to some extent by the Dáil, and it reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That in the opinion of the Dáil every proposal for a protective tariff should include provisions to secure that fair wages shall be paid and <Col N="2012" /> fair conditions of employment observed in the protected industry.</P>
    <P>I need not tell Deputies that that motion stands over the name of Deputy Norton.  It specifies what Labour wants and what already we have had some strikes over in this State.  In any industries that have been tariffed they want additional wages.</P>
    <P>Now, let us get back to cement, but bear in mind the connection.  The reason we cannot manufacture cement economically in this country is because of the high cost of production.  The Minister told us quite frankly that if cement is to be manufactured in its entirety in this State it will be necessary to put on a protective duty and the result of that protective duty will be to increase the cost of building.  We see the effect, in the first place, in the high cost of living.  We have high wages and an inability to carry out a policy of industrial development because of high costs.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Deputies who have listened to this discussion have been few in number.  The Minister said that while the manufacture of cement in its entirety would not be a practical proposition, if I may put it that way&mdash;the Minister does not approve the word economic&mdash;the nearest approach he can make to it is to set up grinding mills which will do a considerable volume of the work and which in themselves would be economic.  I will not express any opinion at all on that point.  I am glad to know that the operation will be economical and that it will not add to the price of the material.</P>
    <P>The Minister was rather optimistic. He said he was quite satisfied that it will reduce the price of cement here. I was glad to hear that, although it may react on an industry in which I am interested.  Nevertheless, if it is going to be of advantage to the country as a whole, that will not affect my support.  Before one can express an opinion that would be worth anything, one would have to have some additional information from the Minister.  I would like to have information on the following points:&mdash;How many have applied to the Minister for undertakings of this <Col N="2013" /> kind?  What is the nationality of each applicant?  Are there many Irish nationals amongst the number? Will this State of ours be called upon to supply any of the capital that is necessary?  I hope not.  I would also like to know where the Minister intends these factories should be erected.  I do not know whether that is a matter on which he would like to express an opinion.  Perhaps he would like to leave that to those who risk their money in the undertakings. I think that would be desirable.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear from the Minister that he was against increasing the cost of building further.  I have tried on other occasions to point out to the House that the cost of building in this State is not alone at the moment the highest in these islands, but I have heard it said that it is amongst the highest in Europe. Be that as it may, it is an uneconomic proposition in this State at the moment.  As a result of building being uneconomic, we cannot get people to embark on it independently. Another reaction is that in order to get building work, which is carried out in other countries without any subsidy because it is economic, embarked on here, the State is called upon to provide large subsidies.  Not alone is the State called upon to provide subsidies out of public funds, but our local authorities have to subsidise, and subsidise heavily, at the expense of the ratepayers, all those building schemes which are undertaken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister make the statement that he was against adding further to the costs of the building industry.  I am sorry that he had not arrived at that conclusion a few months ago, before he treated us to an avalanche of tariffs, many of which affect the building industry.  These tariffs have <Col N="2014" /> increased the cost of building to a considerable extent.  Not alone have they done that but they have made building a much more difficult operation than it was in the past by the holding up of necessary building materials for long periods by the customs authorities.  I do not want to go into that point at the moment, but all these matters arise out of the tariff policy and they all add to the cost of building.  I do not want to stress this matter further until we get information, which I hope the Minister will be able to give us in detail, on the points I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>One would think, from the statements we have heard here to-night, that something terrible had interposed in the affairs of the country. The proposal is to erect three factories here which will give employment to between 200 and 300 men.  One would think from all the simulated heat we have had here during the past few months about unemployment that members of the Opposition would be glad that proposals were being made to give employment to between 200 and 300 men, as well as supplying the material from those factories more cheaply than the imported material is being supplied. That is what the proposal means in a nutshell.  Deputy Good told us all about the high cost of living.  I can easily visualise Deputy Good's idea of heaven.  When Deputy Good goes to another place, his ideal of heaven will be a lot of men, three-quarters naked, living on one meal a day, without any wages, with Deputy Good over them as a ganger with a big whip.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not expect to go where you will go.  Deputy Good tells us about the high cost of living.  It was only yesterday we were told that the farmer, who is producing practically everything necessary for life, was broken owing to the prices he was getting.  How can the Deputy reconcile the two positions and at the same time vote in the same lobby with the gentlemen opposite?  Deputy McGilligan roamed along from the price of <Col N="2015" /> flour to the result of the tariff on flour and from that on to the Ottawa duties. He brought them all into this little proposal for the grinding of these clinkers in this country at no additional cost to the consumer.  Yesterday and the day before we were debating the position of certain producers owing to the action of Deputy McGilligan's late Executive Council in bringing in certain Bills to cover purchases in which certain gentlemen would be first paid for the landlord's interest, then paid for the evicted tenant's interest and, thirdly, given compensation for disturbance.  When all those things were rolled up together and put on top of an unfortunate man, he was compelled to go out of production.</P>
      <P>I have been deeply interested in this question of the manufacture of cement, for down in my constituency there is a district in which all the materials are available.  We have also a deep water quay, with plenty of transport facilities. When I went into the matter, I found that the cost of the plant, if a factory were established there, would be so great that it was very hard to get people to invest in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>And that the amount of labour that would be given would not justify my going to too much trouble in trying to force the pace.  Under this proposal, three factories will go up and give employment to 300 men. That is a lot.  Better still, these factories will turn out the material at reduced cost and will bring about a reduction of Deputy Good's second heaven&mdash;building charges.  I cannot understand what all the noise or what all the trouble is about or why Deputies opposite insist on wasting the time of the House on proposals of this description.  Deputy Good has a special bee in his bonnet in connection with the high wages he must pay and the percentage he can knock out of those high wage earners by way of dividends.  I can understand Deputy Good's point of view, but I cannot understand Deputy McGilligan's point of view.  I cannot understand Deputy McGilligan's coming in here and twisting <Col N="2016" /> and turning over this matter.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce could give a guarantee not alone for eleven years in this matter but, judging by appearances, he could give a guarantee for fifty years.  He will be there as long as he lives as Minister for Industry and Commerce and he can go higher if he wishes.  I can guarantee that.  So far as you are concerned, you are a wash-out and you know it.  It is not to-day you found it out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, but I have been so repeatedly interrupted by this Deputy that I might be pardoned for thinking there should be a limit to his peculiar performances.  I want to point out that the Minister in introducing his Bill for this cement grinding industry in the Free State said that it would leave the question of employment or unemployment practically untouched. I want to point out one other thing and that is that when we were on the other side of the House as the Government Party the one thing about which we heard year after year, was our failure to establish a cement industry in this country.  I had frequent letters from Skerries in the County Dublin, where all the raw material for the manufacture of cement exists, asking me to use my influence with the then Government Party for the setting up of a cement manufacturing industry.  Time and again the present Minister for Industry and Commerce thundered against the inefficiency and the inability of the late Government for not having established cement factories in this country.  He said that all that was wanting on the part of the Government was initiative to get on with the job.  Now the Minister has got the job in his own hands and what has he done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill is a confession of failure on the part of the Minister of his ability to tackle the job.  We have in this country all the raw materials necessary for the manufacture of cement.  We were told at one time by the Minister that certain <Col N="2018" /> English companies had bought up deposits of this raw material in different parts of the country, had prevented them from being worked and that this was done in the interest of share-holders across the Channel.  What solution has the Minister now given for the unemployment difficulties confronting the country?  A Bill to import clinkers, a Bill giving employment at the maximum to a couple of hundred hands.  But if what Deputy Morrissey said be true it is really a Bill that will probably give employment to something more like 20 or 30 hands instead of the number which the Minister mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his speech, stated that the setting up of these three grinding mills in this country would not influence the complete manufacture of cement.  He was asked was the manufacture of cement in this country an economic proposition.  He stated distinctly that it was.  He went further and he stated that the setting up of these grinding mills would not prevent at a later stage the setting up of a complete process of the manufacture of cement in the Free State.  What we here on this side of the House want to know is this&mdash;if it is feasible at a later stage or period in the industrial development of this country to set up cement factories completely equipped to manufacture cement, why cannot that problem be tackled and these cement factories set up now?</P>
    <P>In dealing with a question of this kind I want to say that from the first day I entered this House I used any influence that I as a Deputy possessed for the industrial development of this country.  In speaking to a Bill of this kind I have no wish and no intention of dealing with it in any Party way.  I am on the lines that Deputy Morrissey is on.  If there is going to be an increase of employment in the country through the setting up of any particular industry let us have that particular industry going straight away.</P>
    <P>I think it is a terrible thing to think that an agricultural country like Denmark is able to meet all the <Col N="2019" /> needs of the home market for cement and in addition that it can do a huge export trade in that article. If that is capable of being done in an agricultural country like Denmark will the Minister for Industry and Commerce tell us why it is not capable of being done here?  I do want to say one thing in regard to the powers that the Minister seeks under this Bill without committing my Party to giving certain concessions to the people to set up factories in this country.  I for one have no hesitation in saying that as far as the granting of these powers by this House is concerned, it makes not one iota of difference.</P>
    <P>The Minister has power during the life of his Government and not a single day longer.  There is a Minister sitting beside the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the Front Bench, that is the Minister for Justice, and he knows as well as I do that no Parliament can bind a future Parliament.  I think it would have been well for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to have consulted Deputy Geoghegan, the Minister for Justice, before he introduced in this Bill a provision that is devoid of common sense and that has no basis in law.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce could have been told by the Minister for Justice that time and again attempts have been made by Parliaments to bind their successors and that not a single one of these has succeeded.</P>
    <P>The only speeches that I confess I listened to in this Debate were the speeches of Deputy Good and Deputy Dockrell.  These are two practical men engaged in the particular trade affected by the passage of this Bill.  I could not gather whether they were in favour of this Bill or against it.  Looking at it from the point of view of the plain ordinary business man it seems to me that the passage of this Bill through this House will certainly not worsen the industrial position of the people of this country.  The question that a man has got to ask when technical details are lacking in the introduction of a measure of this kind is: Is it in the <Col N="2020" /> interests of the people or is it not? We are guaranteed certain things under this Bill that are very valuable if they are carried out.  No. 1, we are guaranteed that there will be no restrictions on imports, so that competition will go on between the cement ground in the Irish factories and cement coming from outside sources. That is certainly a business proposition. No. 2, we are promised that there will be no increase in the price of cement.  The only point about that is this, how is that guarantee to be enforced? By what means can this House be assured that there will be no increase in price, or that if there is an increase in price the prices charged in the home market will not exceed the prices charged elsewhere?  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce would give us some information as to the guaranteed price it would be very acceptable to this side of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have down here in black and white a note I took when the Minister made his opening statement: &ldquo;One company is prepared to put up the necessary capital and cement will be sold at a lower price than that now prevailing.&rdquo;  He was asked by Deputy McGilligan, the ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce, did that mean that the prices of cement in this country would be on a competitive level with the prices of Belgian cement.  From <Col N="2021" /> what I could gather, the Minister nodded assent to that enquiry, and Deputy McGilligan said: &ldquo;If that is so, the Minister has succeeded in getting hold of a proposition that has never before been got hold of in this country.&rdquo;  Now let us be clear on this.  When the margarine industry was being set up, and a tariff was being placed on it by the late Government, when they were on the opposite benches, a guarantee was given that the price charged for margarine in the home market would not exceed the price charged across the Channel or elsewhere.  That guarantee has been faithfully observed, and if the Minister can act in the same way with regard to this new cement industry and give a guarantee on the same lines, he will find that the House will be very sympathetic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBroderick" hpid="Mr. Seán Brodrick Mr. Seán Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Seán Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry has gone to great length to inform us as to the amount of material for the manufacture of cement in his own constituency.  He has told us about the means of transport, and that everything is so cheap.  I do not know whether he has mentioned labour or not, but he found everything very cheap and the only thing lacking was the <Col N="2022" /> cash.  He said that the people refused point-blank to invest any money in this industry&mdash;the industry in this country of which the consumption is 250,000 tons annually.  He could not get an Irish investor to invest his money in that industry.  I ask the House what is the reason that you cannot get the money invested in it.  I ask the House that question, and I ask the Minister that question.  My opinion is that the country has no confidence in the Government.</P>
      <P>We have been hearing for the last four and a half years what the then Government could do when they were on those benches.  We had that matter of the cement industry debated here time and time again, and the amount of employment that such industry, if established, would give.  Seeing that we consume 250,000 tons annually, a plea was put up about the thousands that could be employed in that industry here.  Now that Fianna Fáil are the Government the only answer they can give as regards the consumption of 250,000 tons of cement annually is that it will give employment to two hundred men.  Certainly I give credit to the Minister for one thing, and that is that after eight months of consideration he has begun to think of the consumer. He stated that by the setting up of those three mills cement would be substantially cheaper, and able to compete, I believe, with the Belgian or British Portland cement.  I would like to know from the Minister whether the men who are going to invest their money in those factories are members of the British Combine of Cement Producers. If they are, it is very easy for them to compete because the price has got to be arranged by the combine.  I would like to know that from the Minister when he is replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now Deputy Morrissey stated that three-fourths of the employment went in the making of the clinker.  There is only one-fourth of it which goes to the crushing of the clinker and making it into cement.  We are told that there is plenty of material in this country for the making of it, but I am glad to see that the Minister now admits that it is not economic to manufacture <Col N="2023" /> cement in this country.  He had been for four and a half years stating in this House that it was an economic proposition to manufacture cement here, but after eight months he has found now that it is not economic, and the best answer he can give to the workers in this country in order to try and establish the industry for the manufacture of cement, of which we use 150,000 tons per year, is that he can give employment to two hundred hands annually.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan (Clare) Mr. Hogan (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): In this matter, as in most other matters, Deputy Byrne is a clinker in criticising the present Government.  Deputy Brodrick told us that it was probably through want of confidence in the Government that the people were unwilling to invest their money in this industry.  I remember having asked for the establishment of a cement factory in this House during the past ten years and yet nothing was done by the Government which Deputy Brodrick and Deputy Byrne supported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that. Nothing was done.  Whether it was want of confidence, or excessive confidence, I do not know, but anyhow, nothing was done.  I am not in love with this measure.  I want to ask the Minister very definitely when it is proposed to manufacture cement in its entirety in this country.  There is no doubt whatever there is an abundance of material and the very best material in various parts of this country.  I would like to know what was wrong with the conditions put before the late Government and before the present Government. What is wrong with the conditions which will enable clinkers to be manufactured outside this country, imported here with additional overhead charges, and still you get this cement cheaper than it can be manufactured in its entirety in this country?  Would the Minister tell us what is wrong there?  The material is there, the labour is there, and I have <Col N="2024" /> heard the capital is there, and yet the clinkers cannot be manufactured in this country, converted into cement, and sold as cheap as the imported clinkers will be sold when they are manufactured into cement in this country.</P>
      <P>I do not know that the positions were put up to the late Government and there was no monopoly asked for. I was asked by the people to put forward that project.  They were not even asking for a tariff.  They were asking if the Government could use their influence, not to make it a binding regulation, to get the Irish cement used upon public works of all kinds.  I am told that position was put up&mdash;I have it on the word of one of the people who was responsible for the project. Yet the position is that we have to import clinkers and manufacture cement here and we can sell it cheaper than the manufacture of the entire material here.  There is this in it, probably that the industry would be scattered around the ports where the clinkers are landed, and in the rural districts where the deposit is plentiful, there would be no opportunity of engaging in the industry. Will the industry be allowed, when the clinkers are imported, to concentrate around ports such as Cork, Dublin and other ports?  I want the Minister to say that this Bill is in no way going to cut across the manufacture of cement in its entirety in this country and I also want to know how it is that the product imported from outside, the semi-manufactured article, can be sold cheaper in this State than the same article could be sold in this country when the deposit is there for the manufacture of the clinker, and the manufacture of the complete article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BartOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, the few words I have to say on this matter will not be of a hostile nature, because I welcome anything that will give employment in the country, especially in regard to the manufacture of cement.  For some years, I have been interested in the project myself.  I have given it a good deal of time and it has cost me something to arrive at the knowledge I have as regards the manufacture of cement in this country. <Col N="2025" /> I am certainly surprised at the statement of the Minister, when he says this cement will be sold cheaper than the imported cement.  I hope you are sure of your grounds.  If you can do it I would certainly take off my hat to you.  As Deputy McGilligan said it is a tall order.  However, we wish you luck with your project, but I would say this to you, that any remarks that Deputy McGilligan has made to you have not been made in a hostile spirit. He is looking for information, for he has been through the mill exactly as you are going through it now.  There have been several projects from time to time put up for the manufacture of cement here and as you know when Deputy McGilligan was Minister for Industry and Commerce, all information had to come through him.  I would say to you now in an advisory spirit that I hope you will be careful and that the money of the State should not be invested unless you are quite sure that cement can be manufactured here as cheaply as the imported cement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From experience we came to the conclusion that cement could not be manufactured here without either a subsidy or protection.  For the amount of employment it would give it would be much cheaper for the State to pay the weekly wages of the number of workers free than the cost it would be to the people who would use the cement. Calculating the amount of cement which would be used in this country for roadmaking, house building, etc., and the employment it would give to manufacture that cement, and calculating the subsidy which would be needed to compete with the imported article, it would be cheaper to pay the wages of the number of men employed in making the cement&mdash;the subsidy would be more.  Of course, I will be pleased if the thing can be accomplished.  But I would ask the Minister to supply the information which Deputy McGilligan asked for.  We should approach this with a good spirit.  Employment, certainly, is badly needed, but it would be a pity if a cement factory were started here and afterwards turned out to be a failure.  One thing surprised me in the Minister's statement when he stated that because the clinker could be milled here we can sell the <Col N="2026" /> cement much cheaper than the imported article.  That is news to me and I would like to get further information on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Having heard a good deal of the debate I am unable to follow the reason for the attack on the Bill.  So far as I can judge, the Bill does not commit the State for a moment, and according to the explanation the Minister has given, to any liability whatever.  But, it is evident that a premeditated attack was made upon it.  One Deputy came along and stated that this was only going to employ thirty hands.  When asked to show how he produced that figure he almost lost his temper.  It would seem to me that no man could give an estimate as to the number of hands which would be employed in any factory unless he had some idea of the extent of its production.  Further, we heard the Minister questioned as to whether or not he could guarantee that the price of imported cement would not rise, notwithstanding the fact that he stated in his opening address that there were to be no restrictions put on the imported cement.  It looks as if there was something that has not been quite explained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested to know whether this will prejudice any application for help that may be forthcoming with regard to a brick factory.  The Minister knows that there has been a great deal of agitation in certain places in recent years for the establishment of a brick factory.  I think his geological surveyors have advised him, or are in a position to advise him, that clay as good as any brick clay in the world is available as the raw material for such work.  It may not be the case that a really practical proposition has been put before him up to the present, but I hope that if the State is going to assume any liability in connection with the cement factory, it will not prejudice any application that may be forthcoming with regard to a brick factory.  The only objection that we see to the Bill is the objection made by Deputy Hogan, that the establishment of works such as may follow the passing of this Bill will <Col N="2027" /> lead to vested interests, vested interests in merely finishing work and that that might prevent the development at some future date of complete works.  That would be a thing to be regretted and I should like to hear the Minister deal with the point that has been raised as to the relative volume of employment in the manufactory, which it is proposed now to set up, compared with the employment that would be given in a complete factory. I should like to hear him, also, as to the economics of a complete factory. I remember hearing one who was interested in a cement factory state that the amount of coal required for a complete cement factory would be a strong objection.  It would be a costly matter if the coal were to be imported. That factor would also affect the location of the works.  I can see no reason now for opposing the Bill, while at the same time regretting that a complete factory is not a practical proposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>Frankly I must admit at the outset that I do not know anything about the manufacture of cement, but the one thing that has drawn me into the discussion is that every Deputy who has spoken has admitted that the raw materials for the manufacture of cement are present in the country.  I believe that all the raw materials can be obtained in the country and it is a puzzle to me to know why it is necessary to import this clinker.  If we are going to manufacture cement in the country why not manufacture it from the very foundation? Recently I had a discussion with a gentleman who knew all about cement.  The normal consumption of cement, I learned, was between 250,000 and 300,000 tons.  He assured me that one cement factory to produce that amount would be a more economic proposition than three factories. He visualised an increase in the consumption inasmuch as you are carrying out a housing programme.  Eventually you will also be building cement highways and probably our consumption of cement will be increased by 100,000 tons.  He estimated that the factory would necessitate the employment of about 300 men.  That is very much more than 30 men and it is somewhat <Col N="2028" /> of an increase on the 200 men mentioned by one Deputy.</P>
      <P>As I stated at the outset I am not competent to give any opinion on the matter.  I am just giving the opinion of this man who knew what he was talking about.  I should like to emphasise the fact that he stressed, that three cement factories in the country would not be an economic proposition.  He stated that one cement factory situated at some port where materials would be at hand, where you would have good railways and where good waterway transport would be available, would be an economic proposition.  He was very emphatic on the point that three factories in this country with a comparatively small output would not be economic.  I should like further to emphasise the fact that we have all the raw materials for the manufacture of cement.  Why do we not proceed from the outset to manufacture cement from the ground up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that most of the things that have been said by Deputies in relation to the Bill are due to a misunderstanding of it.  There is nothing whatever in this Bill that either prevents or impedes in any way the establishment in this country of a cement factory producing cement, as Deputy Goulding put it, from the ground up.  The one thing which the passage of the Bill would require and which the Government would also require in any case if such a factory is established here, is that it could be able to produce cement at a competitive price.  That is the sole condition on anyone who is prepared and has the necessary capital to operate a cement factory here to-morrow.  Subject to that condition which is not imposed even by the Government, but which is imposed by the facts of the situation, any person can do it.  Nothing in the Bill prevents him from doing it.  In fact, nothing in the Bill prevents the Government from giving such people any reasonable assistance that a Government might give in ordinary circumstances to promote industrial enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want it to be clearly understood that at no time did we contemplate <Col N="2029" /> the possibility of the Government manufacturing cement as a State enterprise.  It seemed to us that such a step was not necessary and none of the proposals submitted to us by interested parties contemplated the production of cement here at a price which was as low as the lowest price, at which we can now buy cement from outside.  I should like to tell this to Deputy Brodrick, in relation to one remark made by him, that we have had no scarcity of people willing to invest very substantial sums required in the cement industry, on the understanding that they were going to get protection in this market and be allowed to charge prices here as high as those prevailing in certain other countries.  That is some indication that those people had a somewhat more optimistic view of the country than that possessed by Deputies opposite and perhaps a belief in the stability of this Government, which Deputies opposite do not profess to have.</P>
    <P>We have got to face the fact that we in this country for some years were in a very favourable position in regard to cement.  The cement industry is largely a trustified industry.  All the various markets in the world have been parcelled out through the various producing units, but when the various firms were arranging their marketing schemes they apparently, for some reason, forgot the Irish Free State with the result that this was the only market where competition really ruled and, with the result also that prices were substantially lower than those prevailing in other countries.  It is in relation to that situation that we have got to consider the cement industry. I do not know, I am not in a position to offer an authoritative opinion, as to whether it is possible to establish one cement factory here to manufacture cement at a price similar to that at which it is now imported. Nobody has offered to do it.  I cannot see for myself why, if it is not now possible, it should not be possible at some time in the future, and that is my answer to Deputy McGilligan.  He asked what circumstances were likely to intervene which would enable a complete <Col N="2030" /> scheme to be proceeded with in the future.  The answer to that is the growth of the market.  The importation of cement, into this country, in 1924 was 95,000 tons: in 1927, 164,000 tons; and last year 226,000 tons.  The utilisation of cement has increased: the market is growing.  If it is possible to establish a factory as an economic unit, selling at a competitive price, with an annual consumption of 200,000 tons, it might be possible next year or the year after when we reached 250,000 tons, to establish such a factory. There is no reason why we should not get as much industry as we can so long as the steps we take do not make the possibility of such an industry more remote.  The steps we are taking here do not do that.  If there is any group willing to invest the necessary capital and to make cement, by a complete process, a success here I shall be glad to meet them.  Nothing in this Bill would prevent them going ahead with their scheme and I would be very glad to meet them and to wish them success.  But there are other factors.</P>
    <P>Deputies know how one industry links up with another, how the raw material of one industry is the finished product of another, how the waste of one industry may be the essential raw material for others.  There are prospects that even we do not contemplate in this country of industries for which cement clinkers are the raw material. If such a development takes place here, then, the lines on which we are proceeding at the moment, to get a cement industry again established here should facilitate rather than impede any fuller developments that might arise.  The main objection of Deputy McGilligan was that it might give power to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to tie the hands of the Dáil in a definite matter of ten years.  He expressed his resentment to that.  But I pointed out, when introducing the Bill, that it was quite possible for another Dáil to repeal this measure.  What is the position?  Any Bill introduced is a declaration of Government policy and can be repealed.  The Dáil is a sovereign authority and no one Dáil can be bound by the proceedings of the preceding Dáil.  We introduce a Bill as <Col N="2031" /> an indication of the policy, and as an indication of what we are prepared to do.  When Deputies talk of what can be done in a Dáil they must realise that a customs duty could not be imposed except by a member of the Executive Council with the sanction of the Executive Council.  No private member could introduce such a customs duty.  So long as this Government is in office there is no question of the Dáil's powers being restricted If this Government goes out of office and another Government comes in and so decides, it could introduce legislation to repeal this Bill, or, if it considered it desirable, introduce legislation taking power to annul any power enacted by a former Minister.  But it would have to do that in the light of the circumstances existing, and it would have to justify its action before the Dáil.  But nobody can question their legal right to do it, and if it happened that another Government came into office, in the next ten years, and desired to take such a course in relation to an undertaking given in this Bill, it could, of course, do so.  But it will have to be prepared to justify its action to the Dáil and that is what the position of this Bill involves.  In that connection I would point out that Deputy McGilligan obviously missed the point in the position he took up with regard to the agreement.  He said any agreement made under this Bill would arise for examination and modification if a Government of which he was a member came into office.  There is no question of an agreement.  There is only a question of an undertaking given by the Minister in control that for a period of ten years the duty will not be imposed.  Either a duty can or cannot be imposed.  Any Government in office is entitled to act in the light of its own policy or prospective consequences.</P>
    <P>There were a number of other points raised.  I am asked why take three mills.  I take three mills because I satisfied myself it is possible to establish, as an economic unit, a grinding mill of a capacity of one-third of our consumption.  Consequently three mills are feasible.  I know people interested <Col N="2032" /> in this industry are prepared to engage in it, and contemplate mills of about that size situated at three different centres.  And it would be the policy of the Government to engage them and, so far as it has the legal power, it should insist upon that because it is our aim to decentralise industry except where decentralisation is obviously uneconomic.  I am not purporting to deal with the points raised in any defined order.  Considerable confusion appears to have been aroused by my reference to price. There is a question of a guaranteed price.  The question of possible variation in price, due to an increase or decrease in wages or cost of coal or cost of electricity does not arise.  I have told Deputies that there is a free market in cement.  If anybody comes in to manufacture here, either the whole process or to manufacture from clinkers he is free to do so.  Anybody who likes to send in cement from abroad is free to do so but he cannot possibly secure the market here except he sells a better and a cheaper cement.  Persons coming in are perfectly alive to the position.  But there is one qualification of the statement that there is to be no import duty on cement.  It may be that some particular industrial group in some other country would think it would be better for twelve months to give us cement for nothing or at 1d. per ton or at some entirely uneconomic price in order to serve their own purpose. In that condition we would be prepared to advise some such duty as the late Government imposed upon bacon here designed to check the dumping and to leave free competition at a fair price.  As I said, therefore, I anticipate a lower price than cement is now available at because any company coming in here cannot secure the market unless it sells at a lower price. There is another reason.  From the costings shown to me it is clear that it is possible to import clinkers, grind them, and distribute the cement here from three centres&mdash;and remember the transport operates seriously in this economic argument in favour of the three centres&mdash;cheaper than the price at which it is.</P>
    <P>For the first nine months of this year the average price of imported cement <Col N="2033" /> as shown by our trade statistics was 37/8 per ton at the port.  I have again and again warned Deputies against average prices, and do not want undue reliance placed on that figure.  The average prices shown in the trade statistics range from 40/5 downwards. That is the highest price paid for cement.  There were various lower prices paid for cement in different countries.  These would include cement of different qualities.  The 37/8 per ton was the average price at the port for cement imported here.  It is clear to me that first-class cement, up to the British standard specification, could be produced at the grinding mills here and sold ex-mill at 4/-, and possibly more, below that figure.  I was asked where I intended to place the factories to be erected.  I am not going to decide where the factories should be erected.  The size of any factory to be established in consequence of this Bill, or a complete cement factory that people may engage on, will be determined with regard to economic considerations only by those who propose to finance and operate them.  There is no reason, as I have said, why we cannot have or anticipate the establishment of a complete cement industry in this country. Standing here I want to say that I hope before I vacate office we will have in this country a complete cement industry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>To assent now to that proposal.  There is no secrecy about this at all.  I have explained that the concessions in any undertaking given under this Bill are available for anybody and everybody who proposes to engage in the industry.  The fact is that we were trying to avoid any suggestion of secrecy and that is why this Bill is before the Dáil.  There will be no secrecy about the factories when they are erected.  As to why the period of ten years was selected, it was selected because it was the period which was indicated and clearly demonstrated as that in which it was possible for a company selling cement at the level I have indicated to amortise its capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were a number of other points raised which I do not think it is necessary to deal with.  No application is pending for any State capital in a cement undertaking nor is any application pending under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.  I do not contemplate any.  On the question as to the relative employment that would be given in a cement factory, that is a factory in which the entire process is carried out as against the employment likely to be given in three grinding mills of the kind I have indicated &mdash;I mention three mills because three mills would supply our requirements and would have an output equivalent to one cement factory of <Col N="2035" /> the minimum type&mdash;my information is that roughly about 180 or 200 people are, or would be, employed in a cement factory producing from 200,000 tons to 225,000 tons of cement per annum.  The employment contemplated in a grinding mill, including the employment given in the unloading of the clinker into the mill and the clerical staff, would be in or about 60.  So that you would have roughly three times that employment in three mills.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that the difference as regards the actual number of people engaged between the two projects is not substantial. When Deputies sneer at the small amount of employment given in the cement industry I want them to bear several factors in mind.  First of all it is clear that the cement industry does give small employment. In a mining proposition you can put one man to work for every £100 invested.  In this industry the corresponding figures would be one to every £3,000, and there are several other industries of the same kind. Flour is one, as Deputy McGilligan pointed out.  While the actual amount of employment given in the industry itself may be small, the amount of consequential employment given is not inconsiderable.  Huge quantities of paper bags are used in packing cement.  There are huge quantities of other materials also used.  There is transportation and other work, so that the amount of indirect employment given is by no means inconsiderable.  It may, in fact, well exceed the actual direct employment afforded.</P>
    <P>I was asked what were the economics of a complete factory.  That is a matter upon which I am not in a position to give very reliable information, because conflicting statements have been made to me.  People have come to me and said that it is not conceivably possible to establish in the Irish Free State, with its present consumption, a factory for the manufacture of cement.  On the other hand, people have come and talked to me of cement factories with 30,000 tons and 50,000 tons per annum production. <Col N="2036" /> That would be less than one-quarter of our consumption, but in no case did they talk of producing cement at a price which would be competitive with imported cement. If they are prepared to do so they can go ahead.  Certainly we can contemplate circumstances arising in what I would call the near future, when it would be possible to establish a complete industry here upon an entirely sound basis arising out of either an increase in our consumption of cement or an improved technique in the actual manufacture of cement, following upon the invention of new machinery or something of that kind.  Certainly our aim is to get a complete industry established here.  We propose working to that end.  In so far as there is a difficulty about that now we are proceeding on the lines I have indicated of getting as much as we can in the way of employment.  We are getting more than that because we are getting a diminution in the value of our imports. We are getting the consequential employment that is given, and it is not impossible that we will be able to secure, as a result of the establishment of this industry here, that certain arrangements may be entered into by which in return for whatever imports have to be undertaken that certain exports will also be provided for.</P>
    <P>These are the main points, however, and I think the Dáil has reason to be pleased that we are facing a position in which we will have, within twelve months, Irish-made cement of British standard specification at prices cheaper than those now available and manufactured in considerable part within the country.  That is something we have not been able to contemplate before.  It is coming now and will follow immediately on the passage of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Before the Bill passes I should like to say a few words on it in general, and upon the principles involved in it.  Those of us who have listened to the case put forward by the Minister were struck by the fact that he really attempted to do only one thing not to prove that the Bill was necessary, not to prove that the extended powers claimed in it were necessary or would be useful.  At the very most all that he attempted in the course of various replies to different questions and to arguments, both on the Second Reading and on the Committee Stage, was to put forward reasons why he should be given certain <Col N="2041" /> powers of investigation.  On the different Stages the Ministers confessed again and again that he had no evidence to show that there was any profiteering in this State.  Certainly he had no evidence that there was a large amount of profiteering.  All that he wanted, or attempted to justify, was an assumption of power by the Government to investigate certain complaints of profiteering that he said he had received.  But if anybody looks at the Bill he will see that the powers actually taken by the Minister under it go a great deal further than any mere process of investigation.  In one of his speeches I think the Minister made the rather surprising statement that even if there was in certain cases profiteering up to the present, the State would require this Bill as a perpetual measure, so as to be able to investigate complaints&mdash;whether they were ill-founded or not no one could say&mdash;that might be made about profiteering in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, I think, on other occasions during the passage of this Bill said that he does not expect Part 4 to be widely used.  That is the part that deals with investigation into prices charged by individual traders for certain goods that they are selling. I wonder why he does not expect that portion of the Bill to be much used.  Whether it is because he really believes that&mdash;and there is evidence in the various statements of the Minister to show that that is his real belief&mdash;that there is not much profiteering actually in the State, so far as traders are concerned, or whether he believes that the mere fact, when this Bill becomes law, that a committee is set up and that powers are given to it and to the inspectors, would have the immediate effect of preventing whatever profiteering there may be, about which the Minister does not care to pledge himself one way or another, I cannot say.  But surely when we consider the situation of the ordinary shopkeeper and of the ordinary trader at the present time with, especially at the present moment, a diminishing market, with the difficulty of getting customers of any kind to deal with <Col N="2042" /> him, owing to circumstances which we need not now discuss, owing to the fact, into the causes of which we need not inquire, that the purchasing power of the ordinary person has declined rather considerably in recent times&mdash;the mere existence of competition in these circumstances would be sufficient in itself to prevent any undue profiteering or any attempt at unfair charging on the part of the traders.</P>
    <P>So far as this Bill is concerned, there are two possibilities.  These two possibilities have been considered by the Minister and have been put up in the course of the discussion of this Bill.  One is the possibility that the Bill may prove unworkable.  Many examples have been quoted to show that such attempts in other countries in the last few years have proved unworkable and suggesting that that may be the fate of this Bill.</P>
    <P>But there is another possibility, and that is a possibility that I should like the House to consider before giving its final consent to this Bill.  That is, that the Bill may prove an instrument of great oppression in its operation, that it may so interfere with the ordinary business of the ordinary trader&mdash;and I am speaking now not of a person making any unfair profits, but of the ordinary most conscientious trader in the country who finds it extremely difficult in the present circumstances with credit short and with the necessity of giving credit to many of his country customers &mdash; that it may prove exceedingly oppressive so far as that particular man is concerned. I am dealing, as I said, not with the person who makes undue charges or who is in any sense guilty of profiteering; but what I think the House has not sufficiently considered is the effect of this Bill, if it is operated in any real sense, on the most honest trader in this country through this continuous interference with his business. The mere fact, as is contemplated in Section 4 of this Bill, that a charge has been made and investigated will be a detriment to him in his business.  Anybody who knows the ordinary life in a country town <Col N="2043" /> will know perfectly well that the mere fact of a charge having been made and an inspector being sent down&mdash;the Minister himself acknowledged it&mdash;is bound to be detrimental to the business of that particular man.  It is not a question here at all of catching a profiteer.  It is a question of this Bill, if it is to be operated, being used in a manner that can easily prove to be tyrannical. I quite admit that Bills of this kind have proved themselves incapable of being worked, but there have been examples also of Bills of this kind being used as potent weapons of tyranny by individuals with such power given into their hands by the authorities.  Let anybody ask themselves, looking over this Bill, what the Government expects the Committee to be able to do; what extraordinary ability they expect from the Controller or even from the Inspector?</P>
    <P>I put a question during the Report Stage to the Minister, when there was a question of a reasonable price, and I asked the Minister what did that mean?  Did it mean an average price for the district, a reasonable price, when every business in that particular district was taken into account; or did it mean, as apparently it ought to mean in justice, a reasonable price to the particular man in the particular business that was being investigated? Did it mean a reasonable price, considering all the factors that went to the fixing of that price without any desire on the part of that trader to charge a halfpenny more than he was charging? How could an inspector who has to investigate several types of business, a drapery business on the one hand, a grocery on the other and various other types of business form any opinion of what is a fair price in every individual case of any particular business?  He has to go into the outlays of that man, the efficiency or inefficiency with which the business is being run.  He has to go into the question as to the wisdom or not of the bargains the man has made in buying his goods.  He has to go into countless matters about which even <Col N="2044" /> the business man himself, as every man knows, is incapable of giving a full and satisfactory account, who does not know it from information.  And yet, an inspector, paying that man a casual visit, is expected to make a report about the business to the Controller, and on that report the Controller will fix what he considers to be a fair price, or at least will put it up to that trader that he is not selling the article at a reasonable price.  Either that portion of the Bill will be completely inoperative or else some rule-of-thumb, some general average rule, may be adopted which may prove to be exceedingly unfair to the individual trader.  It may be because he is less efficient in running his business or that the business is on a larger scale and he employs a larger number of people. What is a fair price, for instance, to a person running his business with his own family may be less remunerative for a man running his business with a large staff.  Does anyone visualise that an inspector is really in the position of being able to give a valuable report to the Controller on the strength of which the Controller can really give any valuable decision on the case in point? It was easy for the Minister, when these difficulties were put up, instead of defending what was in the Bill to adopt a rather propagandist attitude and speak of the profiteers.  There is no question here about the profiteers at all.  The question is about the possible damage that this may do to the ordinary business community in this country in the effort&mdash;probably the vain effort&mdash;to get after a few profiteers, so far as they exist.  The Minister himself has said that the vast bulk of the traders are honest and yet, in order to get after the few profiteers that may exist&mdash;he does not even say they do exist&mdash;these extreme powers, which may be tyrannically used, and even if they are not used that way, even if they are used effectively&mdash;these extreme powers are given for a vague cause and in fact, without any real cause given at all.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Dáil not to be led away by mere propaganda in this particular matter.  It is not a question of saving the person who dishonestly <Col N="2045" /> charges too much or who is guilty of what is generally called profiteering.  Merely in order to catch a couple of hypothetical profiteers, or whose existence is hypothetical, the ordinary business community may be interfered with to such an extent that they may have, in some cases, to retire from business.  These powers can be so used.</P>
    <P>It may be that Deputy Dillon's view of the Bill is sound; that it is mere eye-wash; that it is not intended to work; that it is merely intended to make it an Act of Parliament; that in reality, beyond appointing the various officials necessary, nothing more will be actually done.  The Minister himself has on more than one occasion given it as his opinion that very little use will be made of Part IV of the Bill, which is, in some respects, the most extraordinary part of the Bill.  Anybody who knows the way in which people, especially in country towns, make complaints, will know that complaints are bound to come in continually, complaints not on their face absurd, but reasonable cases for investigation.  Are they to be thrown aside merely on account of their number, or are they to be seriously investigated?  If they are to be seriously investigated, this Bill can have a deplorable effect, as far as I can see, on the business of the country. Not merely that, but even if the Bill is operated in that way, though it may damage business seriously, I do not believe that it will succeed in bringing down prices.  It has been suggested that it may have the opposite effect; that the mere fact of fixing maximum prices may have the effect of sending prices up to that particular maximum. I myself warned people, when passing a Bill through this House, that one of the effects of fixing a minimum school age of fourteen would be that a large number of people would regard it as a maximum.  That particular view was scoffed at at the time, but a couple of years afterwards I had to listen to complaints that, unfortunately, in many parts of the country, what we put down as the minimum school age was regarded as the maximum, and the very fact that a child was fourteen years of age was given as sufficient <Col N="2046" /> reason why it should no longer go to school.  The same thing may happen here.</P>
    <P>No matter how strongly and how stringently this Bill is operated I do not believe it will bring about any reduction in prices.  It may have the opposite effect by interfering seriously with business.  It may have that effect directly and indirectly.  What I am sure of is that if the Bill is operated it will be a severe drag on the ordinary honest business man.  It is not the profiteer who will be hurt.  As was pointed out to-night, the man who is determined to be dishonest under this Bill can escape.  He can promise to do certain things and, as the Minister acknowledged, there is no penalty if he does not keep the promise.  It is the honest man who will be hit by the Bill.  When a particular man promises to charge a reasonable price, the Minister was asked what would happen if the man did not honour his promise, and all he could say was that there will be another investigation and then another investigation.  There can be no publicity; there is no penalty attached to breach of the promise.  In various other ways it is quite clear that under this Bill it is the honest trader who will be hit and the dishonest trader who will get off scot free.  That is one of my main objections to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister generally takes up the line that, because it is said the Bill will not be effective, therefore the other fears that it will be oppressive are groundless.  In reality, it can be both ineffective and oppressive; ineffective in so far as it will do a great deal to interfere with the ordinary trader in the transaction of his business and very often make it practically impossible for him, if the inspector is not a person of very great tact and ability indeed.  How the Minister is to get inspectors of that particular type I do not know.  If, as the Minister said, he has no evidence of profiteering, if he believes that the vast bulk of the traders are honest, then I say he is doing a great disservice to the vast bulk of the traders and he is doing a service to nobody.  I admit that, from the point of view of mere window-dressing, something is served <Col N="2047" /> by the Bill.  A number of people will be persuaded that with the passage of the Bill prices will fall and that the thing for which a shilling is now charged will be got for sixpence.  Experience, I fear, will soon prove there is no foundation for that belief.  As I say, if the Bill is worked, I am afraid experience will prove that it will severely interfere with and hamper the ordinary trader and business of this community.</P>

      <P>As a trader, I should like to make a few remarks on this Bill.  I consider that the Bill is a farce, and that those who brought it forward do not know anything about business in the country.  They may know something about education and other matters, but they know nothing about business.  It is admitted that there is no profiteering.  Why then is the Bill being brought forward?  It is being brought forward in order that they may be able to appoint a staff of inspectors to go around the country at our expense.</P>

      <P>Everybody knows the position in which shopkeepers are at present in the country.  Some Deputies know very well that they are under an obligation to some shopkeepers and they may say now, &ldquo;I defy the shopkeeper to issue a writ against me now, he cannot claim anything.&rdquo;  I have experience of business, which some Deputies have not, except that they may owe debts to shopkeepers.  There are several Deputies on the Opposition Benches who owe debts, and they may be seeking to get out of them.  They may be expecting later on to get a nephew or somebody else appointed as an inspector under the Bill.  That is what the Bill is intended for.  Deputies may have seen the number of failures that have taken place all over the country.  I am sure they are not altogether on the Cumann na nGaedheal side.  I am sure they are on the other side also.  They are getting off with 2/- and even with 1/6 in the £. I say that this Bill is brought in to create jobs for the followers of the present Government.</P>

      <P>I say that fixed prices will do away with competition.  When a pound of jam is sold at 10d. all over the country it will do away with competition. I would be glad if there were fixed prices.  The shopkeeper would be able to get a greater profit than he does at present if there were a price fixed on his goods.  My experience during the Great War, when prices were fixed, was that we were allowed a better price for our goods than when we were in competition with other traders.  The whole thing is a waste of time.  The only result will be that you will have a staff of 300 or 400 inspectors going round the country, just, like they are under the Egg Production Act.  A batch of inspectors will be appointed at big salaries at the taxpayers' expense. It is admitted by the Minister that there is very little profiteering. Why, therefore, is the Bill introduced? I understand that there is a Commission to be set up under the Bill and that will cost something.  Instead of going on with more valuable business, the Government have introduced this Bill, which, in my opinion, is a farce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the wish expressed by Deputy Professor O'Sullivan that as little use as possible may be made of this Bill.  I hope there may be very little need to apply it when it becomes an Act.  It is not the type of State interference that one gladly welcomes.  While I am glad it is being passed, I think at the same time its principal use will be to satisfy an idea that so generally prevails, that many shopkeepers are mulcting their customers, that they are taking unnecessary profits and are using every opportunity to profiteer. My real purpose in rising is not to attempt a defence of the Bill. That should be easy, seeing that the Opposition found it is so technically perfect that they are not able to put forward any amendment.  I want to refer to a statement the Minister made when he was questioned as to the probable cost of administering this measure.  He estimated the cost at about £4,000.  At the same time, <Col N="2049" /> he said it was rather difficult to arrive at an estimate.  I think that it is very likely to be much more than that amount, and that it may easily reach four times that amount.</P>
      <P>I want to appeal to the Minister not to let the fact that he put the estimate so low as £4,000 influence him in the appointment of the Commission. In the appointment of the Commission he could easily be tempted, with a view to keeping the expense of administration down, to appoint mediocrities rather than have to pay people who would be more competent.  Very grave danger could arise out of that.  I think the application of the measure will want to be done very carefully.  If done loosely, if loose judgments are arrived at, if there were any loose decision by the Commission or by the Controller, it would have a very bad effect, not so much on business as on the individual businessman.  It is for that reason I would like to see the Minister appointing absolutely the most competent people, even if he has to pay rather high salaries to them.  I am sure the benefit to the community would be much more than repaid.  It is no good saying that this is a plea for extravagance or anything of that kind.  The benefit to the community will be much greater if the people in charge of the administration of the measure are so competent that nobody will have any reason to doubt their judgments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must realise the enormous task it will be to examine into the accounts of any shopkeeper.  To take stock of his actual circumstances, one would have to go almost into his domestic circumstances as well as his business circumstances.  When one imagines what a very delicate task that would be, it is quite evident that only people who are amongst the best trained in the community will be capable of administering the Act.  It is because of that, and because, too, I remember noting the very low figure the Minister estimated as the probable cost of administering the Act, that I rise to appeal to him not to be influenced by the fear of a taunt such as &ldquo;Here is <Col N="2050" /> an Act costing £20,000 and you said it would cost only £4,000.&rdquo;  I appeal to the Minister not to let any fear of such an accusation or taunt as that influence him in the appointment of the people who are to have charge of this very important measure.</P>
    <P>I hope there will not be much occasion to use the Bill.  I think when it is passed it will probably have a very good effect on the business community. It will deter those&mdash;if there be such; I am not competent to speak on the subject, because I have not definite knowledge&mdash;who are often represented to be profiteers.  Every one of us hears the charge made every day in the week of excessive profits, and if there be such people in the community, I think they are very likely to consider their position under this Act, and they will not run the risk of prosecution and exposure.  If that takes place the Bill will have served a good purpose. I hope that will be the effect of it, rather than that it will become a definitely established and regular part of our Government routine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I used to hear the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he was in Opposition, say that it was an easy matter to determine whether a Bill came from the Department of Industry and Commerce, when I presided over it, because one had merely to go through the measure to see whether the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; had, generally in the operative sections, replaced the word &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;  Then he could tell that it had proceeded from me.  This Bill goes a step further.  We have hardly a &ldquo;shall&rdquo; right through, but we have &ldquo;may,&rdquo; with the words added, &ldquo;if he thinks fit.&rdquo;  The whole thing is left to the Minister's discretion, except one remarkable point.  Even if a person is able to found a good complaint about overcharging for such a necessity of the people as butter, no action can be taken under this Bill by the Commission, the Controller or the Minister, until the Minister for Agriculture has been appealed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are four parts in the Bill. One deals with the general level of retail and wholesale prices.  The machinery of investigation under this <Col N="2051" /> Bill is there started either by the Minister or by a complaint made to the Commission.  If it is the latter of these two things the Commission cannot act until it considers whether it is in the public interest to act.  When we come to the simple matter of overcharging by traders, the machinery of the Bill is put into operation by a complaint only, without any investigation or any submission as to whether it is in the public interest or not.  It is to be done by the Controller, who is not a member of the Commission, who cannot administer an oath and cannot, consequently, take evidence on oath. When it is a question of the displaying of lists of retail prices, then the Commission only may act.  When we come finally to the investigation of the prices of protected commodities, in which there is most reason to fear an increase in price in this country, we find that a complaint has to go through the Minister.  Having the attitude the present Minister has about protected commodities, we can realise how many complaints are going to get from him as far as the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Commission is also authorised as part of its duty from time to time, and as the other business of the Commission permits, to select certain protected commodities and investigate prices.  The Minister says that this is not going to be a full-time Commission. He hopes to get people to act without pay, and he does not estimate the expenditure under the whole thing, inspectors, prosecutions and everything, to be more than £4,000. This part-time Commission, acting without fee, is asked to investigate from time to time, as the other business of the Commission permits, the prices of protected commodities.  The Bill is intended, in respect of protected commodities, as a bait to the community generally; but that is the part of the Bill which is least of all going to be put into operation.</P>
    <P>There are many sections which, although I think in the main the measure is going to be futile, can lead to considerable oppression amongst the trading community.  It is possible <Col N="2052" /> to have complaints made by individuals, and these complaints are to be investigated by a Controller who is not a member of the Commission, who cannot take evidence on oath, but who, nevertheless, after passing a complaint to an inspector, and getting a report, may damage a man irretrievably in his trade.  Right through the Bill the question crops up: Is there or is there not profiteering in this country?  There are no terms of reference given to the inspectors, to the Controller, to the Minister or to the Commission, as to what is to be considered profiteering.</P>
    <P>Running through the Bill, there is the provision that these people are to determine, in all the circumstances, whether what is described as &ldquo;an unreasonably high price&rdquo; is charged. What are going to be the data on which that judgment as to the price being unreasonable is to be built up? It is not determined.  There are no terms of reference given.  The task is flung vaguely at a body of five or seven persons, of whose qualifications we have been told nothing.  They are to act, as the Minister hopes, in an honorary capacity and they are to go into details of all the multitudinous business of this country, carried on under multitudinous conditions as regards overhead expenses, differing as they do, even from street to street as well as from town to town.  They are to report whether the prices for all the variety of commodities in the schedule which &ldquo;are used as food, clothing, material for clothing or fuel,&rdquo; and such other things as may, by order, be added to that list, are reasonable or unreasonable. An inexperienced, honorary body is to decide that and to determine, in fact, whether a man is to be put out of his business or not.</P>
    <P>For what reason is this instrument of oppression being introduced? Deputy Corry remarked in an interjection &ldquo;To catch thieves.&rdquo;  During the debate on all stages of this measure, only two Deputies spoke as if they had any belief whatsoever that there was overcharging in this country.  Deputy Murphy gave one <Col N="2053" /> example from a local authority.  That was the only concrete example given. One other speech was directed against the so-called &ldquo;profiteers&rdquo; and the Deputy responsible for that speech was perfectly certain of his facts.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>There is no doubt about it that scandalous profiteering has been going on.  The unfortunate people are not getting fair play in any sense in this respect.</P>
    <P>Then there is an allusion to the Tribunal on Prices, which said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>We have satisfied ourselves that, in certain areas, consumers have to pay high prices for particular articles of food, bread, meat and milk, and that an excessive margin of profit is secured.</P>
    <P>We get a rhetorical question then:</P>
    <P>Is there any Deputy who will say that the price of bread in the last six or seven years has any relation whatever to the price of flour?</P>
    <P>We get a calculation by that gentleman, who was so sure of his facts.  On his examination, &ldquo;made out in pints,&rdquo; by himself:</P>
    <P>The brewer could afford to reduce the price of stout by 2½d. per pint and have the same profit as in 1920.</P>
    <P>He goes further:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A case can be made out not alone for this Bill but a case can also be made out for placing a lot of oily faced gentlemen in jail.</P>
    <P>He speaks of shopkeepers who come in to start business in towns and he says that they are considered most unsuccessful if, after two years, they are not able to get a house by the seaside and a motor car to take them to town every day.  Later, he speaks of unfortunate consumers who &ldquo;are being fleeced, as undoubtedly they have been fleeced.&rdquo;  He is disposed, in the end, to think that</P>
    <P>A definite system of fines and a definite system of jail without fines for individuals who are found guilty of gross profiteering after they have received one warning</P>
    <P>should be put into force.  We have a reiteration of the statement that profiteering <Col N="2054" /> has been carried on &ldquo;to a scandalous extent&rdquo; by some shopkeepers. The Deputy winds up with this advice to the Minister for Industry and Commerce:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I see some of these gentlemen who come into town very lean, who start operations very lean, and who grow big corporations in four months as a result of the prices they charge the poor.  You would find that these corporations would go down very quickly if they got a spell inside a jail.</P>
    <P>Then, there is this nasty jibe at the Minister for Industry and Commerce:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I confidently recommend it to the Minister as a cure for profiteering.</P>
    <P>That is Deputy Corry.  That much might be understood from the language. He was the only Deputy who had any certainty as regards the practice of profiteering.</P>
    <P>Let us hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce on this matter.  Remember that, having heard what I have read from Deputy Corry, the Minister for Industry and Commerce can say: &ldquo;There but for the grace of God and access to a few files, with a less limited capacity for understanding files than Deputy Corry, would be the Minister for Industry and Commerce.&rdquo;  This is shown by his speeches in 1930 when there was as much thunder in the air about profiteering as the unfortunate Deputy Corry was able to get out on 19th October of this year.  What did the Minister say about profiteering in introducing this Bill:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the fact that the general level of prices may be too high&mdash;</P>
    <P>That is the greatest example of a fact I know&mdash;the fact that prices &ldquo;may be&rdquo; too high&mdash;</P>
    <P>there is also reason to believe and numerous complaints have been received that particular retailers and particular wholesalers sell to particular individuals articles of common necessity occasionally at excessive prices.</P>
    <P>Complaints have been received that certain people sell occasionally at excessive prices!  Later, he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2055" /> There is no doubt that in this country because of the smaller number of industrial units which we have it is always possible for those industrialists who enjoy the benefit of a protective tariff to combine amongst themselves to exploit the market.</P>
    <P>Then, hurriedly:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that any evidence that such has happened to any extent is available.  In one or two cases, there are circumstances which would indicate to me that the necessity for getting this Bill through quickly exists.</P>
    <P>That is the Minister's case.  From that, he concludes:</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that there is necessity for this legislation.</P>
    <P>Certain prices may be too high; complaints have been received that certain people occasionally charge too much; this is a small country with small industrial units and there is always the fear that those who enjoy protection will combine to exploit the market&mdash;that, the Minister says, &ldquo;is the main justification for the Bill.&rdquo; Lest he had said too much about profiteering, although it was not very much&mdash;it certainly does not accord with Deputy Corry's views about profiteering&mdash;the Minister goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I am not really in a position to offer any solid opinion as to whether there is real foundation for some of the complaints which have been made.  In so far as we have been able to carry out investigations, we have found that, undoubtedly, in a number of cases, particular shopkeepers did charge excessive prices.</P>
    <P>We did not hear how many cases&mdash;</P>
    <P>I do not say that we have found that the general level of prices has been unduly high.  I mention the fact that there are one or two of the protected industries in respect of which I would like very much to see the position examined.</P>
    <P>There is, then, the hurried reservation&mdash;</P>
    <P>even though we are unable to say that excessive prices have been <Col N="2056" /> charged, because I am, nevertheless not satisfied with the information in my possession which goes to show that excessive prices are not being charged.</P>
    <P>He goes on&mdash;</P>
    <P>It is possible that they</P>
    <P>That is the body which will go into the matter&mdash;</P>
    <P>will find that my suspicions</P>
    <P>Lest anybody should be offended, he says:</P>
    <P>if I might use even so strong a term as that, are completely without justification.</P>
    <P>But in the event of their finding the reverse, then we have this question of going further.</P>
    <P>Later on, the Minister says:</P>
    <P>I would like to say this, that our experience has been that, in the majority of cases, profiteering is not taking place.</P>
    <P>And later on, he says:</P>
    <P>It may be that in the course of a year or two, or in five years, circumstances will change and we may find ourselves in a position to repeal this legislation without incurring any danger.  I hardly think that will arise so long as we are operating a protective policy, or so long as present circumstances continue. I think a necessary corollary to a protection policy is the introduction of legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>Then later on he went into a certain amount of talk as to the fact that we have too many distributors. That is not Deputy Corry.  That is the Minister, though Deputy Corry need not be ashamed of what he said, for the Minister would have said as much if he were over here without having access to the files of information collected.  We have the fact that the Minister has got to announce in bringing in this measure that he cannot see that there is any profiteering taking place&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the Second Reading, as the Deputy knows, the principle of the Bill is discussed. On the Fifth Stage only what is in the Bill is discussed.  I do not think we can go back now and discuss as to whether there is a necessity for the Bill or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am keeping very close to what is in the Bill.  I started off by pointing out what I considered to be very peculiar in the Bill.  I pointed to sections that are likely to be oppressive, and with what the Minister envisaged in his own Second Reading speech.  The Bill as it stands is founded upon a measure introduced in England.  It is founded upon a Bill called the Consumers Council Bill, a Bill which never reached the Statute Book.  That Bill is identical in four-fifths of its sections with this Bill.  There are greater details in this measure, more elaborate machinery, but as far as the objectives are concerned four-fifths of it is an absolute copy of the Consumer's Council Bill introduced in the British House of Commons.  What was the purpose of the Consumer's Council Bill?  What is the necessity for the sections put in there?  It was stated frankly by the Socialist Minister who introduced it that it was to give them an opportunity when they got a Socialist majority in that Parliament of taking over business. He said it was the thin end of the wedge or it was said for him.  But he admitted that a measure of this kind controlling prices, when we could not control supplies, was unreasonable. He intimated that as soon as possible when a Socialist majority had been <Col N="2058" /> reached that supplies would be controlled and thereupon the Consumer's Council Bill would have the effect which he desired from it.</P>
      <P>Is that the intention here?  Is that the reason for this phrase about price fixing?  I do not think anybody in this House would object to that portion of this measure which deals only with investigation, or with that portion which deals with investigation, with publicity and with price fixing.  What is the purpose of price fixing and what is the possibility of price fixing working out to anything good if there is not control of supplies?</P>
      <P>Those who have talked about the necessity for a measure of this kind, and particularly for the price fixing part of it, and based themselves upon the Report of the Tribunal on Prices, have completely missed the import of the Tribunal on Prices report.  The Minister with the Report of the Tribunal on Prices before him, and Deputy Corry having quoted from it, brings himself in the end back to the statement that he had no ground for any belief that profiteering was taking place in the country.  Did the Tribunal on Prices find a necessity for a measure of this sort?  They ask for evidence, investigation.</P>
      <P>The Minister said at an earlier stage that without this measure there was no machinery for investigating any complaint with regard to profiteering. I contradicted him on that. There is still, apart from this Bill, legislation in this country, which enables an investigation to be made. There is the Tribunal of Evidence Act, which was taken over with many statutes taken over here, and when a <i>prima facie</i> case has been established a Tribunal can be set up with every power, other than price fixing&mdash;the power which the Tribunal gives.</P>
      <P>In addition, there is the Act of 1926, the National Emergency Act, which gives not merely what is in this Bill, but powers to control supplies.  And yet the Minister tells us if this measure is not passed he has not the power to investigate complaints made and that he has not the power under which he could take action.  Again, I tell him, we have both, and I tell him what they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2059" /> The Tribunal on Prices did not find a necessity for any legislation of this sort.  In fact, it recommended against legislation.  It recommended that until the investigating machinery had been tried and found wanting that it was, in their opinion, undesirable to fix prices, and they gave reasons for that recommendation.  Though one member of the Tribunal on Prices advocated the licensing of shops, the Commission as a whole reported that they found themselves unable to make recommendations in favour of that Appendix to the Report, which was put forward by one of its members.</P>
    <P>The measure turns upon the determination of what is an unreasonable price.  Is this lay body of five or seven people going to investigate the whole run of prices and the whole scheme of prices in the country?  I suppose the Minister does know from his touch with business that there are varying rates of profit looked for in the normal way from business.  I suppose he knows that certain people stock perishable goods and that they have on that account a fair amount of the stuff wasted.  Such a trader will look for a profit of as much as 50 per cent. on what he sells.  There are certain other lines of business where the stock is not perishable, in which the trader would be content with a profit of 10 per cent. or 15 per cent.  Is that matter of the profit which a business is taking in the ordinary course to be looked into when this body of five or seven people is going to be looked into whether the price is reasonable or not?  Bread was mentioned by Deputy T. Murphy but only one instance was given of profiteering by him.  Is not the Minister aware that in the bread business the position is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T.J. Murphy Mr. T.J. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>And meat as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the Minister aware with regard to bread that it is a common habit with bakers to distribute broken bread at a very low rate to the poor and that even good firms distribute good wholesome bread &mdash;not even stale&mdash;at a very low rate to the poorer classes of the community? Does he not realise that the <Col N="2060" /> price the baker looks to get is the price he gets for all he bakes, not the price of what he sells to one section of the community?  And is it not clear that, if we in any way interfere with this practice of the bakers of distributing bread to the poorer classes of the community, it will have a very serious effect on these people?  If he goes to investigate and to interfere with the prices for which bread is retailed, he may, in the end, find that instead of bread prices being put up for the better class purchasers there will be a stoppage in the practice bakers have of distributing this type of bread to their poorer clients.  I reminded the Minister before, at the time when he wanted to impose a sentence of jail on the person who overcharged for grape fruit, that I would like to hear whether that grapefruit was bought from a shop which sold fruit only or from a shop which sold fruit and vegetables.  If that particular fruiterer or greengrocer had suffered an increase in his cost of living, would the Minister prefer that increased cost to be put on grapefruit rather than on vegetables?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been great clamour in this House as to the necessity for price fixing.  An example has been given that in different streets in the same town articles are being sold with a great differentiation in price.  The reply that might easily be made to that contention is that the articles are bought at that great differentiation in price, in spite of its not being conceivable that in a small town the fact that one shop in a different street was selling them at a much less rate was not known.  Why do the people go to the shop which sells at the dearer rate?  Because they are getting something else than the article that they buy.  They are getting service of a type that they would probably not get in the other shops. They are probably getting credit for a longer time than they would get in the other shops.  They are getting something different in the way of service, or if they are not getting that, there has to be some explanation as to why the dearer price is paid in a small town where the same article is sold&mdash;that is a contention put up&mdash;at <Col N="2061" /> a smaller price.  The Minister will know that if this Committee were set up to base price fixing upon evidence which stops short at a particular price, they would certainly have to count people in the north side of the city as profiteers in certain articles, and they would have to count nearly every trader in the south side of the city as a profiteer in another sort of article.  There was a very definite investigation made of that particular anomalous condition at one time, and what was discovered?  There are certain traders who have a habit of selling one or two commodities, tea or sugar, at an extremely low rate, in order to get customers into their shops, and then they will more than make up for what they did not charge on tea or sugar by what they did charge on other articles.  Similarly, in all areas of the city, the articles on which some traders are making little or no profit are the articles to which other traders look for their main profits.  Are these unreasonable prices?  Which is unreasonable in comparison with the other?  Which is unreasonable from the point of view of the public getting robbed?  Those are Deputy Corry's words&mdash;the thieves that have to be caught.</P>
    <P>The only thing the Prices Tribunal Report established, and it is on that this Bill is said to be based, was that in the opinion of the Tribunal there were too many distributors in this country, and then they committed themselves to the peculiar statement that the fact that there were too many distributors meant that the price of goods retailed ordinarily in this country was too high.  They made no relation of cause and effect between these two things.  They stated two facts which they had found&mdash;that there were too many distributors in the country, and that as far as they could find out the prices retail generally were too high.  Having stated these two facts, they proceeded to say that the one depended upon the other.  Page 9 of the Report which contained that particular statement gives the result of a census of the number of shops in Saorstát Eireann, divided according to the Gárda Síochána divisions, and it shows two things&mdash;the shops kept by <Col N="2062" /> people who are shopkeepers only, and the shops kept by people with other means of livelihood.  What emerges from the table?  If you leave out Dublin and the two ridings of Cork&mdash; where presumably the professional shopkeeper would be more to be found than elsewhere&mdash;and take the rest of the country, you find that those who keep shops and have other means of livelihood are 40 per cent. of the whole.  Surely then it is a case of mixed employment, which one finds so constantly in this country?  Surely it means that the so-called marginal trader upon whom, according to the Report, everything else is based, is not a marginal trader in the sense that he is an inefficient trader who ought to be put out of distribution, but that he is a representative trader, and that because of his other means of livelihood he takes less profits than the representative marginal trader might take.  Alternatively, you can put it this way, that because he gets only so little in the way of profits he has got to look for other employment.  The fact of the number of distributors in this country, as shown by that Report, does not at all mean that there is an increase in retail prices, but it does show a very marked diminution in the profits that are looked for by the distributor throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, when speaking on the Second Stage, said that he believed this Bill was eye-wash.  He said it had got to be remembered that the Government Party, in 1926, I think it was, also indulged in a little eye-wash in setting up a Tribunal to examine into prices.  If Deputy Dillon were here I would refer him to the resolution that was moved in the year in which the Tribunal was established.  After I had moved that, and explained what was intended, the late Deputy Bryan Cooper got up and said that he had wondered, while listening to me, whether I had come to praise the resolution or to bury it, and Deputy Corish asked what was the good in proceeding with the resolution when it had been torn to bits by the proposer.  When the resolution went to the Seanad members of the Seanad said they did not see that much good was going to <Col N="2063" /> come of it, and wondered why it was moved, until they had read the speeches made in the Dáil when the resolution was moved.  It was clear to everyone at that time that no great good was looked for from this Commission. There had been pressure with regard to so-called profiteering. When moving the resolution I said I wanted and thought I would get one thing from that Tribunal, and that was fairly clear evidence that there was no such thing as profiteering in this country.  That was what the Report established.  The Minister, in bringing in this Bill, had to admit that he had no evidence of profiteering whatever.  The only person who was clear about profiteering was Deputy Corry.  There was no eye-wash about the Tribunal.  The Tribunal was given an extremely difficult task to perform, and the public did not help them in their attempt to perform it.  There were many complaints from the members of the Tribunal at that time about it, and in the end it was clear that the reason why people did not attend and give evidence before the Tribunal, although they knew the Tribunal had power to enforce their attendance, was that there was no pressure in any of the provincial towns with regard to this matter of profiteering.  Despite the Tribunal's Report, despite what the Minister has to say about it, of all the Deputies who spoke in the House Deputy Murphy in one single instance, and Deputy Corry with all the nonsense he talked about profiteering, are the only two members who could be found to stand up and say that there is profiteering.</P>
    <P>There are only two people who can stand up and say there is profiteering&mdash;Deputy Goulding and Deputy Murphy.  I have indicated their fears of this Bill, and certainly they have not indicated substantially the reasons why it should ever be introduced.  Deputy Davin, for years past, has talked about profiteering which went on in the country but he could not be got to make his appearance while the Bill was being discussed.  He would not say a word about it, and from no part <Col N="2064" /> of the House, with the exception, again, of the single item quoted by Deputy Murphy, and the rather vague stuff which Deputy Corry put up was there any suggestion of profiteering or any reason whatever for the introduction of this measure.  Why is it brought in?  Because the Minister for Industry and Commerce really committed himself to it before he knew the facts, and then, when he did get to know the facts, he came in with his lame explanation that, occasionally, word was sent in that certain traders in certain parts of the country were overcharging. What overcharging meant was not stated, but when the Minister was concluding he said that it meant when a man was known to have a price fixed for an article one day, and a day later, or later in the same day, he sold it at a dearer price, and at a later period sold once more at the original price. That might happen with the most honest tradesman.  He might have reduced the price because the article was going to be lying on his hands, and then, later on, there was a demand in the town for the article and he raised his price.  The Minister adverted to one contention which was made against this Bill, i.e., that it is well known there never yet has been a successful attempt to fix prices which did not result in what was called the maximum price becoming the minimum price, and which did not result in all idea of quality disappearing.  His answer to that was that this only occurs in war time when prices are rising.</P>
    <P>There is a very excellent series of publications brought out by those who were in charge of the British Government Departments after the war. They were alleged to be very experienced writings by the Carnegie Foundation for International Peace, and that their experiences might be a help to people who came after them in regard to the matter they had to consider, and a book on the matter of the control of prices was written by a man, who was then a civil servant, now a university professor.  He had been secretary to the Food Control Establishment from the beginning to the end.  He sums up his experiences, and it cannot be argued that he is <Col N="2065" /> biased, because he went through the whole thing, and he claims they made a success of control from one angle and one angle only.  He says you can show, with the sort of machinery that is established here, price-fixing machinery, after investigation of a particular type if it can be counted successful, in the sense that you can substitute the ordinary element of competition and the ordinary force of competition by a man made system, but only in time of war can you do that with all the ruthlessness the civil population would stand for.  Amongst other things he pointed out that the maximum price becomes the minimum price all over again, and that all differentiation in quality goes.  The phrase he used was &ldquo;in the good old days of control, meat was meat, no matter where it came from, and butter was butter except where it was margarine and was sold as butter.&rdquo; He states further that this was not their experience only with regard to the maximum price becoming the minimum price&mdash;that was not their experience only when prices were raised. Food control lasted after the war, and on two occasions when food prices were falling they had prices established by costing accounts as the minimum at which people could sell. They reduced those prices on one occasion in the case of milk, and within twelve hours the milk was sold at a thirty per cent. reduction below the price that the milk retailer should sell by the costing account.  The same thing happened with some other commodity, but I forget what it was.  The last limitation these people put upon any price-fixing machinery is this, that if you are going to operate price-fixing machinery you must operate it at every stage between the purchaser and the consumer.  You must follow it down from the moment the raw material makes its appearance to the people who prepare it in a semi-manufactured way, to the people who sell it wholesale down to the retailer, and if you miss any one link your scheme of control goes, and your scheme of price fixing goes wrong.  And yet from all <Col N="2066" /> the lessons that could be learned here, this absurd measure is introduced.</P>
    <P>As I said before, five or seven lay people are appointed, who certainly cannot know about all the businesses they are going to investigate, and they are going to have put before them the job of deciding whether certain prices of certain retailers in certain areas are or are not reasonable.  If you can get the definition in the Terms of Reference what &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; meant you could get a decent measure.  Nobody can determine what a reasonable price is and the only use that is going to be made of that Bill is really an abuse of it.  The traders are going to be harried; people are going to be egged on to make complaints; supporters of one trader can make complaints against a rival trader, and a man must go to the expense and loss of time which he should be otherwise devoting to his business, in order to answer complaints put up about his prices.  I would like to see the list of prices that is going to cover, say, vegetables.  Are you going to put a different price for every different cauliflower in a shop; are you going to have different prices for every individual fish in the fish-mongers, according to its freshness, according to when it was caught and first put upon the slab; are you going to have a range of prices for packed eggs which the ordinary grocer will have; are you going to have a range of prices with regard to different cuts of meat which the butchers will have, and in this case are you going to make allowance for the resulting waste such as offal and other things that will be thrown out or converted into some sort of material.  There was another section in the Bill and the only section that was worth anything.  It was the section that might allow these people to devote their whole time to the protected commodities in the country. Instead of giving them a decent opportunity to do that we find they are, according to the Minister, to be a honorary body, therefore not a whole time body.</P>
