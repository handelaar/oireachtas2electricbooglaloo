      <P>I hope the Minister will make some provision so that the price of these articles will be controlled in some way, and that there will be some relation to the price of spades and shovels before the introduction of this motion.  Many people besides agriculturists use spades and shovels, such as road workers, and they have to pay for these articles. When contractors engage men they usually supply them with implements to be used in the business, but in thousands of cases labourers have to buy these articles.  If the articles that are now to be protected are not up to the standard, are not as durable and of the same utility and value as shovels that could be bought before this tariff was imposed, those affected will find themselves much worse off. I ask the Minister to see that the poorer classes in this State will not suffer as a result of the imposition of the tariff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The surest way for securing that competitive prices will be charged is to have an adequate number of firms engaged in the production of these articles.  At the present time there are three principal firms in the Free State engaged in the industry, the Galway Foundry Company, Messrs.  Scott and Company, of Cork, and a firm in Clones.  As regards the firm in Clones, there is some slight doubt whether the factory is in the Free State or not.  Apparently half of it is in the Free State and half in the Six Counties, but the contention is that the bulk of the factory is in the Free State, and that it is a Free State firm.  In addition, there are a <Col N="1737" /> large number of smaller places throughout the country engaged in the manufacture of spades.  The factory at Clonskeagh, which was engaged in the production of these articles, closed down some time ago, but I am informed that it is shortly to be reopened. In addition, another firm is contemplating embarking on the manufacture of these articles.  Information has also been received that another factory is about to be established at Nenagh.  Consequently, it is contemplated that in a short time there will be adequate competition to ensure that competitive prices will operate. In any case, the bulk of the spades required in this country have been always produced here.  There are local habits and peculiarities with respect to spades, each county preferring a type of its own.  Consequently the industry has been mainly a local one at all times.  The position is not quite the same with regard to shovels.  Apparently, a number of local authorities prefer a type of shovel which is manufactured only in England, and they maintain that that is the type of shovel most suitable for their needs. Against that, I am informed that Galway County Council has for some time utilised a shovel produced by the Galway foundry which they found satisfactory.  I am satisfied that shovels of satisfactory quality and at satisfactory prices will be available in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beckett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to correct an impression that might be conveyed by Deputy Anthony's remarks.  The shovel is the one tool that belongs to the labourer.  It has been the custom for many years for the shovel to belong to the labourer.  Labourers are very particular about the shovels they use, particularly the handles.  It is very important, therefore, that the price of the shovel to the builders' labourer should not be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite aware of that fact.  It relates mainly to builders. Certain public bodies do provide their workers with shovels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in <Col N="1738" /> a position to give any information as to what he called &ldquo;the short space of time&rdquo; within which he hopes to have the requirements of the country in this respect met by home producers?  He has adverted to one difficulty with regard to these items, the local predilection for certain types of article, a choice which has shown itself in other respects than in spades.  It is one of the things which has helped to hamper the development of the boot industry, because in certain counties they will not have boots with rows of nails put in in certain ways.  They must have them in another way.  How is it hoped to get over that difficulty?  If there is local preference for a certain class of article, and if there is a natural insistence on the locally-produced article, how does it come that there is necessity now to impose this protective duty?</P>
      <P>With regard to the other articles not subject to local variations of taste, I would like to have the question as to &ldquo;short time&rdquo; more carefully analysed than we have had it up to date.  The impression with regard to all these tariffs is that all you have to do is to make an Order, make a few passes of the hands, get the usual formula, and the factory, the skilled workers, and the production required come along. Facts do not bear that out.  There must be an estimate, as there have always been estimates, as to the period in which, even on the most optimistic view, the hopes as to the industry are likely to be fulfilled.  Even when discussing these things in a hasty way at this early stage, I think we are entitled to get the best considered view of the people briefing the Minister in this matter as to the period which must elapse before home requirements are not only scantily met, but so adequately met that the competition of home firms will keep prices close to what they were before.  Even at this early stage, I think some analysis of the position should be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have always been making the bulk of our requirements in spades.  The spade is an article in respect of which there are local habits. Therefore, very little additional production <Col N="1739" /> of spades will meet our requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was it not there already if there was local demand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is there already.  The majority of these articles are produced in small local works throughout the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The great majority.  In addition, there were four factories which made, and there are now three factories which make, spades and shovels on a larger scale.  As regards shovels, the position is not the same. There is a predilection in favour of shovels produced by a particular Birmingham firm.  That predilection will be changed.  It will have to be changed now.  In other words, the persons who formerly had that predilection in favour of that particular shovel will endeavour to meet their requirements with the home-produced shovel.  I mentioned that Galway County Council had already done so quite successfully and were using a locally-produced shovel. As regards the length of time within which these additional factories may come upon the scene, I am not in a position to give a precise estimate.  In the communication I received in relation to the Clonskeagh factory the term used was &ldquo;a few weeks.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, to some extent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Deputy a history of the various steps taken by my Department to secure the reopening of that factory both before and after the tariff was imposed.  I never had any doubt that we would get the Clonskeagh factory reopened.  It was <Col N="1740" /> merely a matter of getting it reopened in the most efficient manner and under management that would enable it to be continued efficiently. As regards the Nenagh factory, I have seen a statement in the Press that the proprietors have already purchased machinery and propose to instal it.  I do not know what truth is in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Nenagh factory, I think it is only fair to say that the proprietors had taken steps to open it before the tariff was ever mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that in four, five or six weeks we will be in a position to more than supply our requirements, and in the meantime existing stocks are adequate to meet the demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this goes to the root of the matter at all. It is quite possible to get a factory opened for anything&mdash;no matter how absurd&mdash;in this country if the outside supplier is closed down upon and if there is to be no advertence to the price at which the product is to be sold.  There is nothing marvellous about that.  If you have a demand for something which has to be satisfied and if you close down on the outside supplier, clearly if there is to be no advertence to the price to be charged, the article can be made here and it will be a good thing for somebody to make it here.  But that is not the beginning and end of a tariff policy. Articles should be produced in sufficient numbers and produced speedily to meet the requirements of the country at a suitable cost.  All we have got in defence of this order is the statement that the Minister in charge of the particular order &ldquo;hopes&rdquo;&mdash;he advanced later to the position that he was &ldquo;sure&rdquo;&mdash;that within a few weeks factories would be opened and would be producing sufficient to meet our needs.  But the item of cost is a special item and it enters into this question. I take this case because it is a smallish matter, in a sense, though very important to certain classes of the community. By getting these considerations analysed in respect of a small <Col N="1741" /> thing, you get the wider and more frightful reactions of a tariff which is of greater importance in the sense that it imposes on the community a tremendous cost if the article in question is not made speedily and if it is not made at a cost comparable with the cost at which the public were getting the article previously.  Nothing has been said up to the present with regard to cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must go further.  I understand that the Government have a certain policy with regard to decentralisation of industry and that that policy works even to this point, that in the respective categories of industrial blocs, so to speak, there is to be decentralisation. It is not enough to have spades made in Dublin or Clonskeagh, something else in Galway and something else in Donegal, it is better to have two or three factories making spades in two or three parts of the country.  How is that going to be managed?  Apparently, it comes out in this tariff.  You get two or three factories established for the manufacture of some particular goods and they are kept going in different parts of the country because the Government aided the establishment of a particular factory in one place where the natural advantage for the location of the factory seemed to be another place.  Suppose three factories are got going and one of the factories finds that, by reason of lying up against the water edge, it can get in raw material more cheaply and produce more cheaply than its competitors.  Suppose that factory wants to extend and to cut out another unit, are we to have protection as between the different areas?  You can decentralise by diverting manufactures to different spots, by the counties giving certain relief with regard to rates.  That might be done or the Government might say: &ldquo;You will get a bounty or a trade loan guarantee if you go to a particular county and keep the industry going.&rdquo; How is the decentralisation of industry to be maintained unless by some process of zoning out the country&mdash;allowing only Clonskeagh spades to be sold within a certain radius of Clonskeagh and articles made in Galway to be sold <Col N="1742" /> within a certain radius of Galway?  We will have to discuss this matter in a more general and more vigorous way when we come to the more important tariffs, but this consideration enters into this tariff.  What future does the Minister see for a small factory established in a particular place for the production not of an article in which local choice will exercise a certain protective effect, but for the production of an article in respect of which there is no such local choice and where artificial bounds will have to be set to prevent that factory, operating in a particular place, from going into the ground or territory of another factory?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a much bigger question than anything relating to this particular tariff.  So far as this industry is concerned, it has always been decentralised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is with regard to spades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That particular fact has relation to the question of cost.  We have always been producing here the bulk of our requirements in spades. In the near future, our productive capacity in relation to spades will be substantially increased.  Consequently, one may look for a decrease in price, resulting from the duty in respect of spades.  Certainly there will be no increase.  In relation to shovels, the same thing does not apply.  We will be able to produce shovels here in or about the cost at which they are now procurable, but the cost at which they are now procurable is the cost of a highly centralised mass production firm which is supplying huge quantities of these shovels, not merely to this country, but to a number of other countries as well.  The smaller unit, having proportionately larger overheads per unit of production, will not be able, except by rigid economy and efficiency in every department, to compete with that huge English firm in the matter of price.  It would not be able to do that except with this measure of protection. There may be some slight increase, but the whole position will be carefully watched by my Department to secure that there is no undue increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1743" /> If we are going to let the factor of prices determine our position as to whether or not an industry is to be established here, then we can abandon the whole idea of industrial development at once.  There is no single industrial commodity which we are capable of producing here which we could not buy more cheaply somewhere. If the standard set is the lowest price at which a commodity can be produced in some factory on mass production lines or by sweated labour, then we can reconcile ourselves to the fact that we will not have any factories producing these commodities here.  I am not going to set up that standard.  If the conditions of the country and the resources in material and skilled workers make it reasonable to assume that we should be able to produce a particular commodity here, it will be the function of the Government to secure that that commodity is produced and that the industry is protected during the initial stages, when it is developing.</P>
    <P>On the main issue raised by the Deputy &mdash; decentralisation &mdash; at the moment the Government has no power to enforce decentralisation.  Whether or not we will require power to enforce decentralisation has not been considered.  It is, undoubtedly, the policy of the Government to encourage it, and up to the present that policy has been implemented in this way and in this way only&mdash;that we have been bringing to the notice of people proposing to engage in particular industries the special advantages which exist in particular districts.  There are special advantages in Dublin, Cork and certain other centres&mdash;the advantage of being at the centre of the country's distribution system, of being close to the ports, and of having a large supply of skilled labour available.  As against these advantages, there are, in a number of provincial districts, a number of local advantages which might offset those available here, and which, if brought to the notice of persons proposing to engage in industry, might induce them to locate their factories elsewhere. For a long time, however, I think the <Col N="1744" /> industrial centres will be the towns situated at the ports where railway and other facilities are available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This leads us somewhat more deeply into the mire. Deputy MacDermot referred last night to a policy which has operated for a number of years past throughout the world, with very bad effects for the world&mdash;the policy of economic nationalism. We are not merely to have economic nationalism, but we are to have economic provincialism.  Possibly we will get down to a smaller unit than the province and have a system of economic counties.  The Minister has shown clearly that he has not yet thought out the difficulties and he has no policy other than the policy he took over&mdash;that of directing industrialists to what seemed to be suitable sites, suitability depending upon natural conditions and not upon any artificial diversions away from where the natural advantage would ordinarily locate an industry.</P>
      <P>On the smaller matter of the shovels, the Minister started off with a phrase that I thought was going to lead us to some firm ground.  He said he believed that within a short time the factories of this country would be supplying the needs of the country at a cheap price.  I thought the ending of that sentence was going to be that when that happy state was achieved the tariff could be taken off.  The Minister at a later stage indicated that protection during the initial stages was supposed to be the function of the scientifically adjusted tariff. In between he completely threw overboard any hope a person might have had that that was going to be the sound conclusion from his earlier sentences. Now he roundly asserts with regard to industry that one has to keep on protective tariffs practically for all eternity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Minister, nothing can be produced in this country which we could not buy more cheaply elsewhere. That means, therefore, that there is going to be a protective tariff on this item, not merely in the early stages, even though the Minister has <Col N="1745" /> the belief that, within a short period, home manufacturers will be supplying home requirements at a cost equal to what people would pay abroad.  That was the Minister's first phrase.  He pointed out that he does not take the element of cost as the only test.  I do not take it as the only test either, but I think it is a test that should be applied. We are not interested here merely in showing up the defects of any scheme and pointing to what is going to be the cost to the community. We had a positive statement from the Minister which counters most other equally positive statements that the same Minister made when in opposition. We have the very positive statement that tariffs are going to increase the cost to the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been told that most of our industries suffer from unfair competition&mdash;from dumping.  Industries seek protection against that. That means that they cannot compete at present prices.  When they are going to be protected the Minister states that we are going to have things sold here at a price higher than what we could buy them at abroad.  The cost to the community is going to be increased, and that increased rate will be maintained.  That is the clear-cut statement the Minister made to-day. If that is not so, then can we have any hope that once a tariff of this type is put on it will be removed?  It used to be said that the essence of a good tariff was that once put on you saw clearly ahead the date of its removal. I have not discovered any tariff which has operated along these lines.  It is almost impossible to take off a tariff once it is imposed.  You definitely entrench certain people.  The capital and the livelihood of certain people are involved, and in the end the removal of the tariff means the confiscation of so much capital and the deprivation of work for some people.  The Minister indicates than an extra tax has been put upon the community for all these things.  If every country is to behave the way we are starting out, what is going to be the result?  All the natural advantages which benefited the world <Col N="1746" /> so greatly in the pre-war period are going to be cast aside, and we are definitely walking into the mire which is so stirred up, and which has so involved all the other countries of the world that followed out this policy of economic nationalism.  The Minister has declared that there is not a sufficient purchasing unit in this country to make the production of articles sufficiently economic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has widened the scope of the discussion still further.  He questions the advantage to mankind of the policy of economic nationalism.  Our particular concern is the advantage of economic nationalism to the 3,000,000 people in this country.  We have small units of production here; we must have.  If the Deputy says that tariffs are going to lead to an increase in price he is right to this extent: that in so far as our people are getting the advantage of dumped prices for a short period, then some increase may follow.  But where that is not operating, where the inability of the home firms to compete arises from the fact that they are working only 33? or 50 per cent. of their capacity, then the imposition of a tariff permitting them to work at full capacity, and consequently reducing the cost per unit, will not, and should not, mean any increase in the price of the commodity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That should mean that the tariff could be removed once you get the unit working full capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Except in so far as the removal of the tariff would invite the large, more highly-capitalised competitors of our firms to engage again in a price-cutting war in order to put the Irish firms out of operation&mdash;and they would do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's argument is that the firms at home will have reached the point when they will be able to produce to the fullest extent of their capacity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesWalterBeckett" hpid="Mr. Beckett Mr. Beckett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beckett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister if this involves the partial manufacture of the raw material. If it is merely coming in the initial stages and necessitates very <Col N="1747" /> extensive plant, will it be economic for the small firms to erect expensive plant for this operation?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to remind the Minister that although the price aspect of this thing has been treated very fully, price is not the only consideration. In the case of tools that have to be worked by hand, the quality and design, in my opinion, are almost more important than the price. I have no hesitation in saying that shovels of an inferior design and quality offered at 2/6 would be left aside and a farmer would much prefer an article of better design and quality even at a cost of 4/- or 5/-. I suggest that this is one of the industries in which outside firms should be permitted to participate.  If any English firms want to set up a factory here for the production of spades and shovels, or parts thereof, the Minister should be very careful before he imposes the restriction relating to 60 per cent. of Irish capital.  From what we hear, we know that the Minister has repeatedly turned down all applications for the setting up of factories here unless the outside firms interested conform with the proposal to have 60 per cent. of the capital Irish.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that from the Minister.  I thought that proposal was actually in practice.  I hope the vested interests that we now hear so much about&mdash;the suggestions of the people behind this tariff&mdash;have been set aside and have not been regarded seriously by the Minister.  I accept his word.  Sixty or seventy years ago people were physically stronger than they are to-day.  Some of the tools then in use are a worthy relic of the Stone Age.  Some of the agricultural tools manufactured to-day&mdash;and I am not going to say where they are manufactured&mdash;and sold in some parts of the country, are also relics of the Stone Age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had occasion two years ago to be in a certain county in the Saorstát.  I <Col N="1748" /> saw a certain make of a spade in favour there.  If that were the only article available in my part of the country there would be no such thing as a spade used there at all.  The people there would not use such a spade.  They are accustomed to a better and a lighter article.  I say that quality and design are of more importance even than the price.  If I were to go into a shop in the morning and were offered one of those spades at 2/- I would prefer to pay 5/- for a better article of better design and quality, and I would consider that a good investment. I think it will be accepted by most people that the workers cannot give the right output with an inferior tool, a blunt-edge spade or a bending shovel. With an inferior article they will not give the output, and our output in most cases is bad enough at present.  It would be infinitely worse if we had to toil with inferior tools.  In fact, there should be show cases here and prices offered for the most suitable article that would give most satisfaction in the country.  There are different designs in the different counties.  Particular designs find favour in a particular county, and the tool that would be used in one would not be used in another.  I have seen a half-dozen designs, different patterns, of spades and shovels made by one firm in order to suit local needs and prejudices, which seem to be very strong.</P>
    <P>I understand that the most any of these foreign firms ask is the right to put up a first-class equipment to turn out a first-class article&mdash;merely the privilege of setting up that class of factory.  The only thing such a firm would ask would be the right to employ a few key-men to direct the local workers.  I see no reason in the world why these people should not come over here regardless of where the capital comes from provided Irish labour is employed, that the goods are made here, and that the implements turned out by the factory would suit the requirements of the people.  I say there should be no other restriction whatever.</P>
    <P>It is a pleasure to work some tools and a torture to work others.  I can say that from experience, and I am not <Col N="1749" /> speaking as one who knows nothing about it.  I have had personal experience of using those tools.  Now in these days when, as I said before, the physique of the people is not as good as it was thirty, forty or fifty years ago, it is of the utmost importance that the labourer should have the right sort of tool.  Unless the man is given a spade or shovel of the right design and quality the article will be of no use at all, the work will be badly done, or not done at all.  In the matter of the minor drainage on the individual farms, this is of great importance.  The shovels and spades used on the farm will be a most important factor in this work of drainage in the future.</P>

      <P>Within three miles of the City of Cork there was for a long period a spade and shovel factory.  That has been closed down for some years, but the implements that were made there are still in use.  I have seen some of them myself, and I know of one of the spades made there which has actually worn out five foreign spades. When you send three or four men working you will have them fighting as to which of the three or four is to use the &ldquo;Irishman,&rdquo; as this spade is called.  All of them prefer to use that spade.  It is the only decent spade of the bunch.  The implements that are turned out now by these foreign factories are absolutely useless for our work.  I challenge Deputy Gorey on that point.  I suggest that the Deputy should be given the job of tester of these implements.  He would then be in a perpetual state of torture, and that is the only cure for him.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Customs Duties (Boots and Shoes) (Provisional Variation) Order, 1932, made on the 22nd day of April, 1932, by the Executive Council under Section 1 of the Customs Duties (Provisional Imposition) Act, 1931 (No. 38 of 1931), and a copy of which was laid on the Table of Dáil Eireann on the 27th day of April, 1932, be approved with and subject to the modification that the following paragraph be substituted for paragraph 3 of the Schedule to the said Order, that is to say&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Twenty-two and one-half per cent. on the value of the article on the following articles, viz., boots, shoes, slippers, goloshes, sandals, and clogs intended for wear by young children and of any size from 7 to 1 (inclusive).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Resolution No. 5 and the new Financial Resolution referred to in the paper go together.  I will explain the situation in a moment.  A provisional order was made imposing duty upon boots and shoes in excess of the duty heretofore in operation.  The effective difference made was to increase from 15 to 25 per cent. the duty operating upon boots and shoes and we left unaltered the duty on children's shoes and shoes manufactured not of leather but of rubber and other materials. It is intended now to remove entirely the duty on children's shoes up to size 6.  That requires the introduction of a new resolution because that duty was imposed by the Finance Act of 1924-1925 and has been in operation since.  It is also intended to remove for a period of six months the duty upon the manufactured parts of children's shoes from size 7 to size 1. I will explain the reason for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1755" /> When we were discussing this alteration in the Budget duty, I had certain discussions with the boot manufacturers and it was my intention at the time to ask them to concentrate their activities upon the production of adults' boots and shoes and to leave the market for children's shoes to be supplied by imports so that for a period we could remove the duty on these boots and shoes altogether.  Since these discussions have taken place, however, certain people have come along who propose to erect new factories in the Saorstát for the manufacture of children's shoes only.  They advert to the difficulty, however, that they would have to train their labour and ask for a period during which that training process will take place.  It is proposed to admit free of duty all the cut parts of shoes for six months.  At the end of that time the duty will be reimposed on those parts and possibly a duty put on the entire range of boots and shoes and brought up to the present level of 25 per cent.  There will then be in existence, we hope, factories engaged in the manufacture of these shoes capable of supplying the greater part of, if not the entire, requirements of the country.</P>
    <P>We are also making for the moment no change in the duty on rubber shoes, but again it is only a temporary arrangement, because we hope to have the manufacture of these rubber shoes also undertaken in the Saorstát in the near future&mdash;certain discussions in that connection are in progress at the moment&mdash;in which case that duty will also be liable to an increase.  There is probably no duty among all the duties imposed by the late administration which was more unfairly criticised than the duty in relation to boots and shoes and on some occasions, criticised by those responsible for its imposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to remove any misunderstandings as to the effect of that duty on the development of the industry I should like to make a brief statement to the House.  The duty imposed was a small one, 15 per cent. <Col N="1756" /> and the margin of protection afforded to the industry here was not very substantial. It was imposed in April, 1924.  At the time there were five boot factories in the Saorstát.  One of these was, however, closed and the others were all working short-time.  There are now nine factories all working at full-time.  When the duty was imposed there were 250 people engaged in the manufacture of boots and shoes here. There are now 1,205.  The production of the home factories has increased from 19,666 pairs in 1923, the year before the duty was imposed, to 58,166 pairs in 1930.  The confusion which has arisen in the minds of some people in relation to this duty arises out of the fact that the total imports of boots and shoes also increased in that period. They do not advert to the fact that the consumption of boots and shoes has also increased in that period.</P>

      <P>That increase in consumption has been occasioned by the rise in popularity of rubber boots and rubber shoes.  The importation of boots and shoes of rubber, which was only valued at £35,000 in the year 1926, has increased to £100,000 in the year 1931.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  The Saorstát factories have, up to the present, more or less concentrated upon the production of the heavier type of boot.  It appears that the duty of fifteen per cent. was sufficient to swing the balance in their favour in relation to this class of boots, but not sufficient to swing the balance in their favour in relation to the lighter class of boots. It is true that the production of ladies' and children's footwear and of the lighter footwear for men and women has been undertaken, and very considerable progress has been made in that end of the industry, but to a very great extent the English manufacturers <Col N="1757" /> met the duty by cutting prices and consequently they were in a position to check effectually any substantial growth in the industry here.  The existing nine factories with the existing plant are capable of doubling their output, and we anticipate that that doubling of output will take place almost at once, in addition to whatever new factories may be established. The Department is in touch with various groups who are proposing to engage in this industry.  The training of necessary workers will, of course, take some time, and consequently boots will have to be imported for a period despite the duty.  It will, however, be some consolation to those for whom price is a main consideration to know that the English boot manufacturers are again proposing to meet the increased duty by cutting their prices still further.  The price lists of the English manufacturers which I have seen circulated since the imposition of the new duty all show a substantial reduction in prices, and in some cases the prices were cut to the extent that the same class of boot is being sold here now at a lower price than it was sold at last year.  I do not suppose that the English manufacturer will continue that process indefinitely. We do not propose to allow them.  It is our intention to develop this industry and to ensure that our requirements in the matter of boots will be met by factories working within the country. Because of the highly-skilled nature of the work and the time that must elapse before an adequate number of workers are trained, that result cannot take place immediately.  But it will take place ultimately and employment will consequently be made available for some five or six thousand additional people in this country.</P>

    <P>I do not want to give the impression that the boot manufacturers will be able to develop the necessary output immediately, because there has been to a very great extent a forestalling of the duty.  Probably this duty has been forestalled to a far greater extent than the duty on any other commodity, and there are very large supplies of boots and shoes of all descriptions in the country at the <Col N="1758" /> present time.  It is not until these stocks are cleared away that fresh orders of any magnitude will become available for the Irish factories unless the shopkeepers and the customers cooperate and insist upon getting articles of Irish manufacture, in which case the development of the industry will start much earlier.</P>
    <P>When I advert to the fact that there has been as yet no increase in prices and that an increase in prices is not anticipated at any time in the near future, I want to utter a word of warning. I am aware that certain shopkeepers in different parts of the country have put up prices unnecessarily, but we are proposing to take power to deal with such people.  Jail, in my opinion, is the proper place for them.  One glaring example was brought to my notice only this morning.  A lady of my acquaintance was charged 2d. more for a grape fruit than yesterday on the ground that the new Government had put a tax on them.  Similarly other merchants have put up the prices of different commodities and even have advanced the price of Irish manufactures without justification.  Where evidence of such a thing has been brought to my notice I am approaching the manufacturers with a view to the cutting off of the supplies to those merchants immediately, because I certainly think they should not be allowed to exploit the needs of the consumer in that way.</P>
    <P>In the course of a few weeks the situation will have adjusted itself, and people will have come to realise that where the prices of particular commodities are increased to them by the retailers it has been done without justification. It would help to that end if Deputies and others got out of the habit of talking about taxes.  When people talk about taxes upon clothing, boots or shoes or any other article subject to a tariff, they are creating a wrong impression&mdash;they are creating the impression that Irish produced articles are also subject to a tax.  This is, of course, not correct and consequently they are facilitating certain dishonest shopkeepers in misrepresenting the facts to their customers and getting exorbitant prices.  The changes which <Col N="1759" /> we are making in the fiscal list only impose taxation or tariffs upon imported commodities.  The products produced in this country are not subject to a tax of any kind, and the prices of them will gradually decline as production increases, and people will be able not merely to help themselves and help their country, but they will also bring about a more rapid fall in prices if, when making their purchases, they insist upon getting Irish products in preference to imported products.</P>
    <P>These are just general matters that do not arise altogether out of the Resolution before us.  The Resolution proposes to ask the Dáil to approve of the Order made on 27th April for the modification in respect of the parts of shoes&mdash;sizes 7 to 1 inclusive&mdash;to which I have referred, and the Financial Resolution which will be moved subsequent to it removes the duty upon infants' and children's shoes, sizes 0 to 6, and upon the parts of such shoes, and also removes the old duty upon the parts of shoes, sizes 7 to 1.  I ask the Dáil to pass this Resolution.</P>

      <P>We had better get this Resolution through in good time, because this is not the proper time to have a debate upon the general matters to which the Minister has referred.  I can see the result of adopting this tax, and I deliberately call it a tax, and I am not going to forestall anything I have got to say on other matters later on.  We have heard the astonishing statement that certain people have got a remission because of the fact, now recognised by the Minister, that some time has got to elapse before you can get skilled workers in a particular trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am remitting the tax imposed by the late Minister, not by me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have got to get skilled workers and the remission is for six months.  If the Minister will produce to this House after six months his trained workers, I suggest that there should be a mannequin parade for them at the back of the House. They would be as remarkable as the <Col N="1760" /> marvellous heirloom spade that Deputy Corry has told us outlasted six or seven English ones.  Six months for the training of skilled workers in a particular branch of industry!  I should like to see them.</P>
      <P>The Minister was to have given us an answer to the question that Deputy Dillon asked him, but we did not get it in the end.  Deputy Gorey, I think, supplied the answer.  We can deal with that later.  I asserted many and many a time, and was as often contradicted, that one thing you could say had resulted from the imposition of the boot tariff and the criticisms that were passed upon it; that was the general conclusion that there were more boots and shoes being bought by the Irish community than there had been at any time previously. That was an indication I said of a rise in the standard of living, and not in the cost of living, and betokened an increase in general prosperity and that has got to be admitted.</P>
      <P>The Minister is very anxious to deal with people who are profiteering, with the people who are making scandalous impositions, and would like to put in gaol the person who charged a lady friend of his 2d. extra for a grape fruit.  Why would not a person charge 2d. extra in the last couple of days? Not for the reason given.  There is no direct tariff on these things, but does the Minister think that the increases in income tax to 5/- in the £ and in the rental of business premises as well as the increases in all the other taxes put on in the last couple of days are not going to be passed on to such articles as grape fruit?  The Minister is learning a very definite and easy lesson in economics if he gets that into his head, and there is going to be no question hereafter of putting people in gaol because certain commodities which are not directly tariffed or taxed have to increase in price.  They will increase in price as a result of what has happened in the last couple of days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we had this animadversion to the taxes&mdash;the Minister's rather innocent statement to the House that if people would only ask for Irish manufactured articles they would not be <Col N="1761" /> charged anything, but his own statement on the spades and shovels Order that we had this morning gives people who want to increase and who have got to increase the price of Irish manufactured articles all the answer that they require for any objector. The whole contention about these tariffs is this: that the Irish manufacturer at the moment has had his home prices depressed on account of the undue competition, or the unfair competition, commonly called &ldquo;dumping,&rdquo; but never proved to be such.  But once dumping is lifted, what is going to be the natural result?  The price of the Irish manufactured article is going to go up&mdash;there is no reason why it should not&mdash;and the Irish manufacturer ought not to be in business if he does not raise the price on any really well-adjusted tariff to the full height of the tariff, just remitting so much of it as will enable him to outsell the person operating against the tariff. But to say that in a tariffed industry, where the tariff has been put on because the stress of competition from outside has depressed the price of the home manufactured article, that the price of that article should not go up when the article which depressed its price has stopped coming in, betrays a complete misunderstanding of the economic position.</P>
    <P>The Irish manufactured article is the one that will go up.  It will go up definitely and has got to go up.  It will go up because these people have got first of all, even if they cut their supposed losses in the past, to sell at what they consider to be an economic price which they considered they were not getting in the past.  In addition they are going to pile on a little extra, either by reason of the fact of the putting on of the tariff or as a recognition of their case that their prices had been unduly depressed.  Therefore, they have got something recognised as a severe loss and to make up for that they will raise prices not merely by starting anew from the date on which the tariff came into operation, but to get something back of what have been proved and admitted to be losses of an unjustifiable type.</P>

      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce defend the increases in connection with the boot industry.  If I understand his figures aright there are now employed in the industry 1,205 persons. That includes men, women and children.  Formerly, we are told, 250 were employed in the industry.  Consequently, we have an increase of approximately 1,000 persons: of men, women and children.  According to the figures for last year, we find that in order to provide employment for these additional 1,000 hands the State was taxed to the extent of £254,682.  In other words, for every man, woman and child in that industry the cost to the State was over £5 a week.</P>

Of course, it went into the Exchequer, and went to meet the ordinary cost of Government.  If the money had not been raised in that way it would have been raised by means of income tax.</P>

      <P>That is quite another question, the proper means of raising revenue which we can discuss on another occasion.

The Minister says that the tax is not passed on. I am afraid that he must be living in the air.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What astonishes me is that the Minister will not let this infernal cat out of the bag and let it leap around at its leisure.  Obviously, these tariffs are going to raise the cost of living, and there is no use in dancing <Col N="1763" /> on a tight rope trying to persuade everybody that they will not increase the cost of living because money has got to be spent to provide the revenue that would have to be raised otherwise. The plain fact is that tariffs are going to raise the cost of living and everybody knows it.  The only question is: can this be defended on the ground of emergency?  If it can, then let the Government come out and say so.  But what I want to say is, that nobody can put up that defence so far as the Financial Resolution imposing a tariff on clogs is concerned.  According to the Minister, that tariff is designed to protect the Irish market for a thriving clog industry.  Anybody who knows anything about the clog industry knows that it is dying and dying very rapidly. There is a small section, the poorer section of the agricultural community, who use clogs.  They use them because they get the benefit of the surplus production of the old Lancashire factories that were designed for the production of enormous quantities of clogs for the Lancashire market.  But anyone acquainted with the industry must know that in ten years' time there will be no clogs bought here.</P>
      <P>I submit to the Minister that while this tail-end of clog consumption continues, our people should not be deprived of whatever benefit they can get from the purchase of cheap clogs, and these should be specifically excluded from these financial resolutions, now or hereafter, because their inclusion is simply raising revenue in a most undesirable way.  I am not going to follow Deputy McGilligan, after his loud protestations that he would not deal with policy at this juncture, into the question of policy, or anything else, but I do think it would help these discussions a great deal if the Minister would come out, plump and plain, and say that these tariffs are going to raise the cost of living, and that he believes it is the right thing to raise the cost of living.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to include in this category shoes from size 13 to 1, at least for a temporary period of six months.  If <Col N="1764" /> I understood him correctly, I think that when the manufacturers appeared before him it was also running in his mind that they should concentrate on the production of rubber goods.  We will not open that up now, as this resolution has to go through, but I think that, seeing this tariff will, at least in the immediate future, be a tax on the people generally, with regard to the actual use of shoes, this temporary exception of shoes from size 13 to 1 should be included.  That would cover children under 10 years of age, and it should be done, because it is an abnormal burden on the fathers and mothers of families to impose this on them as a tax.  If these sizes were included in this exception order for six months, it would give the Irish factories an opportunity of getting largely into the manufacture of this class of shoes, which have, in the past, been made principally abroad.  It would be a great boon to the people, and I think the Minister should agree to their inclusion. This arrangement in regard to the size of 7 to 1 is really infinitesimal. It is worth nothing, because these things are made out of cloth, rubber and all sorts of shoddy.  Anything will suit a baby who is, most of the time in a pram, and for practical purposes, it is useless.  The really effective thing would be to include boots and shoes used by children, from ten years down, at least for a period of six months, until the Irish factories got into a large way of producing these things at an economic price for the public.</P>

      <P>I took a note of the Minister's statement in opening this matter, and it has disappointed me, I must say, very much.  If I got his figures correctly, he said that the output of the boot factories was increased approximately three times, and he also said, if I took him up rightly, that the staff was increased six times. I am sure the Minister will be able to explain that in some way, but if that statement is given without any explanation, I see very little future for the boot industry in this country.</P>

      <P>This particular decision to select size 7 as the size where the tariff should begin strikes, especially in the city of Dublin, and I suppose in the country also, the people least able to bear the tax&mdash;the poor people.  As Deputy McMenamin said, the remission of the tax on these boots and shoes between size 7 and 0 is really very little relief.  To increase by sixpence in the lb. the tax on tea will also hit the same people and will come unduly severely, coupled with this increased tax.  Perhaps the Minister is not aware that these children's shoes are imported in very large quantities into this country and sold for very small sums of one shilling and two shillings.  They are rubber shoes and rubber material mixed with cloth, and so on, and that very cheap shoe or boot was a boon to the poor, especially, as I say, those who cannot afford to meet the increased tax, and I think the Minister should seriously consider the proposal put to him by Deputy McMenamin to extend the size from 7 to some size like 13 to 10, or whatever it would be, but at least to the size at which a poor man sending his child to school up to the age of twelve or thirteen would not be asked to bear this extra tax.</P>

The Minister should inform these people that there are other than in Dublin sites available, as they, I am sure, will go to the least trouble to find that out. There are a lot of towns at present which have no industry whatever, and it will require the Minister's constant attention to see that they are not neglected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know if the Minister is quite satisfied that these restrictions on rubber goods are a good thing for the national health.  I have been told by medical men that these goods are detrimental to the public health.  National health is a very important matter in this country, and I am not so sure that you are doing a good thing, from the point of view of national health, in encouraging the wearing of rubber boots or shoes. I have no personal knowledge on the matter, but medical men have assured me that the wearing of rubber, in any form, has a very detrimental effect on health, and if that is so, it is an aspect of which the Government should not lose sight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said, to use his own phrase, that more boots had been consumed in Ireland than previously. There are only two reasons for that&mdash; that the country has increased in prosperity or that the quality of the <Col N="1767" /> boots has depreciated, and considerably depreciated.  Some exception was taken here to the term vested interest. I say that any manufacturer who has got a promise of limited competition, and who has a guarantee that certain competition in a particular line would not be allowed, has got a vested interest, signed, sealed and delivered, and there is no question about it.  It is all very well to say that there is a promise to erect a factory, or that a factory is about to be erected, but I think that, until a factory is in full swing, the duty should not take effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that is right, but I accept the Minister's word.  If that is the position, my argument is not necessary, but the Minister should insist that no duty would be put on, in any direction, unless a factory was in full working order, and was fairly efficient. People did not mind so much the tariff on adults' boots, but the new tariff on children's shoes has left housewives in an extraordinary position.</P>
      <P>I met a lady a fortnight ago who went into a shop to buy boots for children, but she had to come out without buying them as she could not afford to pay the price of the boots for three or four children.  This tariff is going to hit very hardly the people as a whole.  I do not see any reason why a tariff should be imposed on children's boots of which there is no production in this country.  The Minister ought to have some regard for the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as sizes 7 up are concerned, we are not making a change, but there may be, and probably will be, some decrease in the price of these shoes because we are taking the tariff off the parts of such shoes for six months.  On the point raised by Deputy O'Sullivan, I am prepared to look into the advisability of taking the tariff off children's shoes from size 7 up, not of leather, that is, of rubber, and other materials.  We will have to consider, however, the reaction of such action upon the leather shoe industry.  Deputy Gorey is very keen that we should keep out rubber boots.  In that matter, he is in close accord with the boot manufacturers, who are pressing very strongly for an almost prohibitive duty on the rubber boots of various kinds which are coming in from Japan and China at amazingly low prices.  I agree that they are bad for health, but I decided to leave that question over for the present, because certain discussions are going on, and we hope to have a factory for the manufacture, if not of rubber boots, certainly of rubber and canvas shoes, established at some time in the comparatively near future.  The question of the duty upon rubber boots however, will have to be considered, if the importation of these Japanese cheap rubber boots increases, to any considerable extent, or to the extent that it is going definitely to hit the one end of the leather boot trade which our factories are able to supply.  The cheap price of these rubber boots coming in in the same shape as leather boots, although quite cumbersome, may make them a serious competitor to the leather boots for people who are not prepared to advert to the health aspect referred to by Deputy Gorey.  There is just one other point. Deputy Beckett referred to figures.  I am afraid I left him under a misapprehension. The figures I gave relating to output of Irish factories were <Col N="1769" /> for dozens of pairs.  The increase was from 19,666 dozen pairs to 58,166 dozen pairs in 1930.  That does not affect the Deputy's argument, but I think I left the House under the impression that it was that number of pairs, not dozens of pairs.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to enter at very great length into the fiscal side of this motion, but I think that if anybody ever paid a visit to Messrs. Dwyers' boot factory in Cork and saw the employment that has resulted from the 15 per cent. tariff, they would say that the tariff had been justified. I have been informed by the heads of that firm that from the time the tariff was imposed some years ago the factory commenced to go ahead and prosper.  When we take into consideration what would be the result of the shutting up of that factory, and the hands that would be let loose on the City of Cork unemployed, I, for one, look upon the 15 per cent. tariff as being justified.  It is a moot question, however, whether the increase of the tariff is necessary when the factory is going at full-time, and when, before the imposition of a tariff, it was working with a very much less number of hands at half-time.  I think that the 15 per cent. tariff has justified itself.  How far the increase in the tariff is justified is a question which I, for one, think is open to question. When factories prosper on a certain tariff there is no question about it <Col N="1771" /> that an increase in the tariff will result in an increase in the price charged by any further factories set up.  A point has been raised in connection with rubber boots.  Having regard to the climate we have to contend with, I think it is very essential that we should have a large supply of these boots at our disposal.  Nothing will conduce more to health than saving our people from wet and cold feet. There is no doubt that there is a very big justification for the manufacture of that particular cheap boot here, or, failing manufacture here, allowing it to be imported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the question of the training of young people.  I understand there is a certain restriction on the training or taking of apprentices in these boot factories at present.  I would direct the Minister's attention to that particular side of the question.  Any new factory set up will either have to import operatives to carry on their work or else any restrictions, no matter how imposed, will have to be removed at once. Reference has been made to the heavy imports of boots after the increase of the tax.  These were probably imports of the lighter type of boots used by the younger generation in this country, who are really very much on the increase owing to the stoppage of emigration.  They are in favour of a light shoe of that class, and they are not favourable at all to the use of heavy shoes.  That would possibly account, in some small degree, for the use of that particular boot and the increased imports of that article not manufactured in this country.  I think those who imposed the fifteen per cent. tariff are justified in view of the increased employment that resulted, and in view of the increased output.  We have five times the number employed as the result of the tariff, and we have three times the output of boots irrespective of the fact that we have no factory turning out the particular article most in favour in this country. We will probably have another opportunity of discussing this at greater <Col N="1772" /> length so that I shall not keep the committee any longer at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this particular tariff is a very valuable one to discuss in detail.  We have got to know a lot of facts about it, and as it has an educational influence as enabling us to consider the effect of other tariffs, I think that we get a lot of light from this particular tariff.  Now, as the last Deputy has said, those living in the immediate neighbourhood of the place where employment is given must think the tariff is good.  I want to consider the general aspect of the matter for a moment and to go back to the point Deputy Good made.  This tariff cost the country last year a quarter of a million pounds roughly.  Now whether it were better to raise that quarter of a million by direct taxation, on a certain section of the community, in a way in which every person in the country would have to bear his share, is one separate question, and a very arguable question, and I think a lot could be said upon either side.  But it has nothing to do with this particular point as to what this giving of work to a thousand men has cost the country.  I see no way of getting over the fact, that in order to give employment to a thousand men, the country had to spend a quarter of a million or £5 a week per man, as Deputy Good has stated.  The conclusion to be drawn is that, so far as we can learn from the boot and shoe tariff, the giving of employment by a tariff is an expensive plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one point made in the debate which was rather interesting.  We heard a lot of talk about the increased importation of boots.  Deputy Good and Deputy Thrift referred to the increased importation and Deputy Gorey referred to the increased consumption of boots. I suggest the particular reason for the increase has been because of the more inferior article imported compared with what was imported previously.  I have seen these imported boots brought home by some of my own men; the moment they went into the wet fields <Col N="1773" /> with them the heels fell off and the soles soaked up and they were perfectly useless.  What I suggest is that when it is said that we are importing more boots that sell at a lower price, that means that actually more brown paper is being used and less leather.</P>
      <P>Deputy Minch wanted to have factories scattered here and there through the country.  I wonder had he the permission of Deputy McGilligan for suggesting this decentralisation.</P>

      <P>I am glad of that.  Deputies from the back benches of Cumann na nGaedheal are not prepared to follow Deputy McGilligan's lead as regards one big factory at each port.  One other matter I would like to allude to is that of rubber boots.  I am very glad to hear that there is going to be a factory started in this country for the production of these rubber boots.  I would like to impress upon the Minister that rubber boots are largely used by fishermen who are rather poor men and who are particularly badly hit at present, and I hope he will take their case and the boots they wear into consideration when he is considering the whole problem.  These fishermen are poor men who make their livelihood in a very hard way.  I suggest to the Minister that if he considers putting a tariff on rubber boots and shoes coming in here he should give special consideration to the type of rubber boots used by fishermen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>A remark by Deputy Gorey, and referred to by Deputy Corry, recalls to me the fact that not only from rubber boots, which I believe also to be unhealthy, is there danger to the health of the people of the country but there is danger in the use of other cheap material in boots. I know something about boots and I believe a very considerable number of people have their health impaired owing to wearing cheap boots imported into this country for years <Col N="1774" /> past.  I have seen not merely men's boots but, what is far more dangerous, children's boots that are unhealthy. I have seen children going to school in these boots with water soaking through them, yet the children wear them on their feet all day.  I have seen these boots stripped.  There is an outer sole, heavily nailed, made from what is known in the trade as the shoulder.  Inside that is an inner lining of brown paper.  The heels of the modern ladies' cheap shoes are made of compressed paper and some of them are timber.  The cheaper class of children's boots and ladies' boots used in the country are a danger to health.  After a short time in use the boots are not only no protection but they are far more dangerous than if the wearers were standing in their bare feet.  I think that whatever we do in this country we should endeavour to see that the boots made for our people are not boots that are going to occasion damage to the health of the people.  I believe some effort should be made to see that the use of brown paper or any sort of paper filling in boots made for our people is not permitted.</P>
      <P>In any country in the world in which tariffs are imposed as has been pointed out the people for a time at least should be prepared to make some sacrifice in order to help the industries of the country.  We are not denying that.</P>

If we admit that there is no argument for protection and if protection of any industry should not be imposed then that would settle the question and admit that our industries ought to be swept away.</P>

      <P>Before the motion is put I would like to mention one matter. I have received various protests that no protection has been given to the leather working industry.  I want to explain that it is the intention of the Government to assist that industry, not by way of protection but by way of a subsidy on output, to ensure that there will be adequate supplies of Irish leather available at a cheap price for boot repairers and manufacturers.  The decision to assist the industry by way of a subsidy on output rather than by protection is to ensure that no damage will be done to those engaged in the manufacture of boots by hand.  We are anxious that handicraft work of that kind should not be impeded and it is intended consequently to introduce in the Dáil in the near future proposals for legislation which will give us the necessary power to assist the industry in the manner I have indicated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1927" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, in introducing this Budget, at the outset of his speech, saw fit to describe the capital position of this country, and suggested that something like £115,000,000 was the amount of the National Debt.  One would be at a loss to understand the reason for introducing this figure at the outset of the speech were it not that when one considered the remainder of his speech he was forced to the conclusion that the figure was simply introduced as a blind to persuade the people of the necessity for the grossly exorbitant imposition which he has placed on them in the Budget.  To arrive at this figure, £115,000,000, the Minister has seen fit to describe as the contingent liability of this country £74,000,000 in respect of land annuities or land guarantee payable under Land Acts prior to the Act of 1923, and some £24,000,000 which is attributable to land bonds payable under the Land Act of 1923.  Later he blandly told us that the only assets which this country has to answer this contingent liability of £100,000,000 is a national revenue of some £25,000,000.  I must congratulate the Minister for Finance on his methods of accountancy and book-keeping. Probably few of us on these benches aspire to the position of Minister for Finance, but if it is a necessary qualification to make ourselves proficient in this new method of accountancy and book-keeping, then I fear we would all grossly fail, because it would appear to be somewhat elementary that an asset which this country has and which counterbalances any contingent liability in respect of this land guarantee under the Acts prior to 1923, or the land bonds which were payable under the Act of 1923, is the land itself, which the annuities are charged upon and which would appear to be security for it.  It may be that the Minister thinks the land of this country of no value and accordingly dismissed it by saying that the only assets we have are £25,000,000 of taxable revenue. If that is his view, then it is certainly rather peculiar on his part when regarding the land of this country as of no value to impose an abnormal <Col N="1778" /> liability by this Budget, which, to a large extent at any rate must be ultimately borne by the land and those interested in working the land.</P>
      <P>I must congratulate the Minister in the first instance for the jovial manner he adopted here when introducing this Budget.  I represent the same constituents as the Minister, and I am sure they will feel greatly relieved when, considering all the blisters imposed upon them in the way of increased income tax and other impositions, they know that the Minister was in light heart when he announced them to the Dáil.  I thought at first that probably his light heart was simply to make easy for the taxpayers the increased impositions which he placed upon them, but perhaps it is due to another motive, or another thought on his part because, if rumour be correct, he is not to participate with the ordinary taxpayer in paying increased income tax which in ordinary events would be payable by him for the remuneration he has received, and will receive, in thinking out the imposition which is placed on the taxpayer. Consider this Budget in any light you wish.  I understand that the policy of the Government as announced prior to the elections was that the chief requirement of this country was the cutting down of expenditure&mdash;in other words, setting a headline as to what was the taxable capacity of this country.  In the Budget which they have introduced, apparently they have entirely departed from any consideration as to what is the taxable capacity of the country.  It is undoubtedly sound economics to consider and fix for oneself a particular point beyond which in imposing taxation on the people that taxation will be nonproductive, will lead to unemployment and in general will be to the detriment of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce held out to us great hopes of industrial revival.  What steps have been taken in this Budget to promote industrial revival?  In the first instance, we have a cutting down of the amount of profits in respect of which Corporation Tax will be imposed, and increased <Col N="1779" /> the Income Tax from 3/6 to 5/- in the £.  I suggest to the Minister that these impositions in themselves, so far from encouraging industry and the promotion of companies in this country, will have the very opposite effect, and that the net result will be to stifle industry and to make it more necessary to have increased capital, while holding out no encouragement whatsoever to the people who invest that capital.  In itself, that will hit the big body of people in this country.  It will hit the poor to whom special reference has been made in this House.  There are a number of other impositions which will, perhaps, hit the poor a great deal more.</P>
    <P>We have been told that the articles in the Schedule of Financial Resolution No. 7 will produce about £910,000 this year.  A big proportion of that will be borne by the working people and by the poor.  The tax of 4d. on tea will be borne, to a large extent, by the working people, by farmers, and by the poor.  It is all very well for the Minister for Finance to say, &ldquo;Oh, that is well counterbalanced by the remission of the ½d. a lb. on sugar.&rdquo; I think most Deputies are aware that throughout the country tea is in no sense a luxury.  It is a necessity for most people.  What probably is not realised is that the connoisseurs and judges of tea are not people residing in good circumstances in the city of Dublin, but the people to whom it is, in a large measure, a food.  They are the people in the country districts.  It is these people who pay by far the bigger prices for their tea.  The most expensive teas are purchased by them, and it is on these people especially that the increased imposition of 4d. per lb. will be a heavy burden.</P>
    <P>[<i>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle took the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>In this Budget the Minister has started out absolutely regardless of the taxable capacity of the country. He told the people, and members of the Government told the people before the election and used it as one of <Col N="1780" /> their strongest arguments for getting office, that they would straight away reduce expenditure here by two million pounds, without whittling down in any way the general services for the benefit of the people.  What has been the result?  The fact is that instead of any reduction by two million pounds there is to be an increase of something like five million pounds, nearly four millions of which is to be raised this year by the direct or indirect taxation of the people.  We were told that at the end of eight months we would find much better conditions, much less unemployment.  That is mere talk. The facts will prove that, at the end of that period, so far from there being any general improvement in the way of employment&mdash;I do not refer to the temporary measure of relief&mdash;things will be a great deal worse, because industry is being stifled and the general body of the people are going to pay much more in cost of living. They are being indirectly taxed to an extent which they cannot bear in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is a matter in the Budget with which I would like to deal.  The Minister told us that he proposed to effect a saving of a quarter of a million pounds by a reduction of the salaries of civil servants and of local officials.  He has been careful not to tell the House the method by which he proposes to obtain the reduction. I gathered from his speech that, though there might be mere talk with civil servants or with local officials, the Government have determined to effect that reduction.</P>
    <P>Apparently, if the civil servants and local officials do not agree, there is going to be some class of compulsory power taken.  Before this House is asked to vote upon the Budget, the proposed method of securing the cut, and the amount of the cut, should be made clear, because we are all interested in seeing that the Civil Service which, I think, it will be admitted on all sides of the House, is a loyal and efficient body, is not treated in any way to its detriment.  I quite appreciate the reluctance of the Minister for Finance to state clearly to the House the method by which he proposes to <Col N="1781" /> deal with the Civil Service.  It is proposed to secure the seven Labour votes in support of this Budget.  If that Labour Party which, on the eve of the election, distributed handbills outside the various Government offices stating that they were the one Party in the State which had the interests of the civil servants at heart, and which was prepared to stand by them, is not going to act up to the statements in that handbill and the promises on which they solicited the votes of the civil servants, they should ask for a very clear and explicit explanation from the Minister for Finance as to the method in which he proposes to deal with the Civil Service.  I find on the handbill which was distributed: &ldquo;The Civil Service needs the protection of the Labour Party.  The Labour Party needs the votes of the Civil Service.&rdquo; If the Civil Service is depending to-day on the support and protection of the Labour Party, that support is sadly lacking.  Not alone that, but the Government Party sought the votes, not only of civil servants but of their friends, on the undertaking that they would not interfere in any way with the Civil Service without arbitration.  It was stated, on their behalf, that no step would be taken with regard to the Civil Service without consultation and without arbitration.  Is there going to be arbitration on this cut in the Civil Service?  We are entitled to information on that and we ask for it. I took it from the speech of the Minister for Finance that, after a talk with the civil servants, he hopes to secure their concurrence and consent and that, if he does not, the cut is going to come nevertheless.</P>
    <P>What is the justification for interference with the basic salaries of the Civil Service?  It may not be generally known that as between the year 1921 and to-day the civil servant has suffered a reduction of about 28 per cent. of his salary.  The civil servant who in the year 1921 was paid £748 a year is to-day paid £537 a year&mdash;a reduction of 28 per cent.  The civil servant, just the same as any other member of the community, has to bear the increased taxation imposed by this Budget. <Col N="1782" /> What case can be made out, or what case exists, for imposing a double burden on the civil servants?  They are only one of the professional classes of the country.  What is the case for compelling them to make a double contribution to the Exchequer?  Take a specific case to illustrate the position of the civil servant after this Budget shall have passed.  Compare the position of a married civil servant with four children drawing a salary of £425, with that of a married man outside with the same number of children and drawing £425 from National Loan as unearned increment.  Both the £425 paid the civil servant and the £425 dividend from the National Loan come from the State.  With income tax at 5/- in the £, if the children's allowance were left as last year, the civil servant would pay £5 income tax and the private individual, doing no work, would pay an income tax of £10 7s. 6d. With the new allowances for children, the civil servant will pay no income tax and the private individual will pay no income tax.  So far as income tax is concerned, they are on an equal basis.  But if there is to be a cut in the salary of the civil servant, what will be their comparative positions?</P>
    <P>We have no information as to the basis of the cut in the salaries but we will take it at £15 on a salary of £425 a year.  What is going to be the position?  The civil servant will suffer a cut of £15 on his £425 salary. He will gain £5 in income tax as compared with last year and his net loss will be £10.  There will be no deduction from the private individual and his net gain will be £10 7s. 6d. In other words, as between the two individuals the civil servant, because he is doing work for the State, is going to suffer a loss of £10 while the man drawing unearned income from National Loan will gain £10 7s. 6d.  What case can be made for that? I ask the Minister to make a case for it.  I suggest no case can be made and the net effect of attempting to interfere with civil servants by cutting down their salaries&mdash;and you have undoubtedly, a loyal and efficient Civil Service&mdash;will be to impair the general efficiency of the service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1783" /> It will affect the yield of revenue within the country; it will affect the country generally by depriving the civil servant of his power of purchasing. The civil servant has a basic salary plus the cost of living bonus. Apparently you are going to interfere with his basic salary.  That civil servant may have entered into an agreement to purchase a house.  He probably has to pay a sum of money by way of insurance and he has to pay for the education and the maintenance of his children.  All these commitments are made upon the basis of the basic salary plus the cost of living bonus.  You are going to deprive him to a large extent in relation to those commitments.  You will certainly interfere seriously with them.</P>
    <P>This question of eating-in on the salaries of civil servants goes a great deal further.  There are large numbers of civil servants who are transferred officers from the Government of Great Britain.  Under Article 10 of the Treaty and Article 8 of the Supplemental Agreement which was made the basis of the Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Act of 1929, these civil servants have complete security of tenure and have been given this right, that if there be any interference whatsoever with their position, including any interference with or cutting down of the salaries payable to them in respect of their offices, they can voluntarily retire and claim their terms under Article 10 of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the body of civil servants serving here at the moment is that they came over voluntarily to the Government of the Irish Free State; they came over to give their services here in the ordinary way until, under Civil Service regulations, they would be compelled to retire at 65 or 60 years as the case may be.  If there be any interference with their basic salary, that is a breach of the contract with them, a contract which they have with the Government here by virtue of their Treaty rights.  What would be the <Col N="1784" /> effect of that on the general efficiency of the Civil Service?  You would have practically every senior man in the different branches of the service taking his Article 10 rights and going out. If the Minister says &ldquo;Well, I am not going to give them Article 10 rights,&rdquo; we know where we are.  That may be the reason for attempting to repeal certain provisions of the Treaty so far as they have legislative effect in this country.  The fact remains that if the Minister attempts to impose any compulsory cut on the civil service the effect will be that he will lose to a large extent the general body of the service, most of the senior men, and he will seriously decrease the efficiency of the service.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask a question with regard to local officials.  It is proposed apparently to cut in a similar way the salaries payable to the officials of local bodies.  How is that going to be done? Is it to be done by leaving it to the local authorities to agree with the officials as to what would be a proper salary in the future, or is the Minister for Local Government going to act on the powers he has under Section 15 of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act of 1923, and fix arbitrarily by sealed order the salary payable in future to any county secretary, county surveyor or other officers of local authorities?  If he is, the same arguments which apply to the Civil Service apply to this other reduction. The Minister is going to impair the efficiency of local bodies.</P>
    <P>Local bodies to a large extent depend upon the good work done by the officials.  The members come together once a week or once a fortnight, but the main work is carried on by the executive officers of that local authority. If it is proposed to make local officers disgruntled, the effect will be serious.  Most of the county secretaries appointed by local bodies during the last four of five years were appointed at inclusive salaries&mdash;at very much reduced salaries compared with what was formerly paid to county council secretaries and grand jury officials. The salaries paid to freshly appointed <Col N="1785" /> local officers have been on the basis of the capacity of the local authority and the country to pay.  These inclusive salaries have been accepted as a definite and final figure by these various officers.  Much more will be the air of resentment at any attempt to cut down these salaries and the general efficiency of local government in this country will be seriously affected if this intended cut is carried out.</P>
    <P>In March last in England the position with regard to the Civil Service was investigated by the Sir George May Committee on national expenditure. What was the report of that Committee with regard to the Civil Service? &ldquo;Civil servants' remuneration should reflect what may be described as the long term trend both in wage levels and in the economic condition of the country.  We regard it as undesirable that the conditions of civil servants when under review should be related too closely to factors of a temporary or passing character.  The State which does not raise its general scales of pay in prosperous times should, having regard to immediate conditions, take a long view when times are not so good.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does the Minister for Finance say that the paying capacity of this country is down once and for all?  He does not.  He tells us we have a dreary year in front of us, but at the end of that year, and with his foresight and the foresight of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, we are to have happy hamlets and villages and smiling children.  The state of depression is a temporary thing, apparently.  If it is temporary&mdash;and the Minister indicates it is&mdash;then there is no justification for any cut in the basic salary of a civil servant or a local officer.  If the Minister attempts in any way to cut the basic salary of civil servants or local officers he will rue the day because, in my opinion, it will bring about disastrous results in the general efficiency of the existing system of local government in the country, and it will seriously affect the revenue yield which the Minister expects during the coming year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only compare this Budget to the curate's egg, good in parts.  A fairly good case has been made out for the imposition of the various tariffs enunciated in the Financial Resolutions.  No doubt an impetus will be given in the case of certain industries resulting in some increase of employment, but it will also result in the disemployment of very many other persons in this State.  I feel that the Minister should have given some little further consideration, at any rate, to the interests to which I now refer&mdash;has he, for instance, considered the amount of injury that will be done to persons in the distributive trades, commercial travellers and others, and last but not least to a very deserving and hard working class of the community, on whose behalf I have not heard even one word uttered. I have not heard a word on their behalf from the members of the Party who are supposed to represent the working people in this country.  I refer to the dockers, the men who go down to the docks day after day seeking that elusive kind of employment known as dock labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do hope the Minister when he is replying will be able to give the House some information on that point.  I hope he will be able to give some information that will satisfy me, at any rate, as representative of a city which has a very large number of unemployed persons of both sexes, and as representing a city which expects to reap some benefit as a result of the new tariffs.  I am very doubtful indeed that the city I represent will receive any benefit from these tariffs.  A few moments ago Deputy Brasier referred to the large amount of employment given in Cork City as a result of the imposition of the previous tariffs.  He mentioned especially the case of the boot industry.  Let me assure this House that I know more about, and am more intimately concerned with, the people who run the industry as employers and those who work in the industry as operatives than Deputy Brasier.  Let me say that the boot industry is one of the most precarious employments we have in the State.  It <Col N="1787" /> is indeed one of the most precarious of all employments in the State.  It cannot be said that the wages given to the employees there are very much in excess, if in excess at all, of the wages paid to the boot and shoe operatives in similar industries across the water.  The operatives mostly work on piece work and, therefore, they are only paid for the amount of work they produce.  Possibly that may appeal to some of the amateur economists in this House who profess to be more deeply concerned with production than with the conditions which surround that production.</P>
    <P>I have waited patiently during the past week to hear one word uttered with regard to the conditions that should operate in a Christian country, the conditions governing employment in the industries which we are now about to tariff and to protect.  We have on the Order Paper a motion in the name of Deputy Norton which asks that every proposal for a protective tariff should include provision to secure that fair wages and conditions should obtain in these industries.  I raised that point myself a week ago on the introduction, I think it was, of the Dairy Produce Bill, which seeks to impose a further burden on the poor and the working class people of this country.</P>
    <P>Even the supporters of this measure proclaim, in any case they do not deny, that the Budget will result in increasing the cost of living.  They suggest that the increase in the cost of living will be met by further and greater employment.  Most of the things tariffed enter every other day into consumption in this country.  There is no doubt we are dependent to a large extent on our neighbours across the water.  Whilst I have every confidence in our own people to produce all they require, I must have regard to the fact that these tariffs are going to press unduly on the very poor.</P>
    <P>I repeat that we are not altogether independent of our neighbours across the water.  The political economy <Col N="1788" /> preached by List and his disciples, and subsequently preached in this country by the late Arthur Griffith, might have been good political economy at that period, but in the present age that political economy is not sound.  I have always felt in relation to protective tariffs that we might assist particularly in a key industry.  There are cases where we must protect such a key industry as flour milling.  I always felt that we should extend a measure of protection to a young or infant industry in the same way as we would extend a helping hand to a little child attempting to walk, but that the moment that child's limbs were sufficiently developed to move about, then that protection should no longer be afforded.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Agriculture, or any of the other Ministers whom I have heard speaking on these tariffs did not suggest that at the end of a term protection by way of a tariff will be withdrawn, the end of the term being when the industry is placed on its feet. Some Deputy here to-day said, and I think rightly said, that once you apply a tariff you will find it very difficult to remove it; vested interests will have been created.  I can see a more sinister thing developing in this country, far more sinister indeed than any economic disturbance.  I can foresee that these tariffs may perhaps be the forerunners of other tariffs, and certain things will be dominated by outside forces.  I can foresee the time when there will be financial support for political parties from the interests behind those tariffs.  I said here before that we might some time or another Americanise our institutions.  In using that expression I do not mean to insult the great United States of America, but I do feel that some of these days it will come down to the matter of graft, pure and simple.</P>

      <P>These people will be the donors of political bribes or graft, as I have termed it.  Some Deputies appear to think that without some kind of price-fixing Board &mdash;by the way, I am not too much enamoured of that&mdash;or without some means of correction, some means of control, the prices which will be exacted by toll from the poor people of this country will be exorbitant.  I am afraid, and I would like to remind the Minister of the fact, that we are not all saints and scholars in this island. Many years have passed since that appellation could be applied deservedly to this country, and because of the fact that we are not all saints and scholars, particularly saints&mdash; there are so many professors and schoolmasters in this House that I have to withdraw the statement about scholars&mdash;I cannot share the optimism that is apparently shared&mdash;and I use the word &ldquo;apparently&rdquo; advisedly&mdash; by many members of the present Government Party.  I do not share their optimism that shopkeepers and the shopkeeping class in this country are such saints that they will not exact the last farthing they possibly can out of the consuming public of the country, including the very poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard to-day from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that, if it were brought to his notice that there were cases of the character which I have just endeavoured to outline, he would consider jail too good for them. I say &ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; to that, but I say we must have regard to the fact of business being business all the <Col N="1790" /> time, and that we are living under a capitalist system which has not been changed, and which this Government does not propose to change.  I will refer to that aspect of the case in a few moments.  We heard of the shopkeeper who sold grape-fruit.  He had to exact something from the consuming public which the tariff imposed upon him compelled him to do.  He said, in other words, &ldquo;If I am going to lose on the hobby-horses I am going to make it up on the swings.&rdquo; According to the present economic morality in this country he is entitled to do so.  Some time ago, speaking in this House, President de Valera suggested&mdash;I am not going to quote his words&mdash;towards the end of his speech in enunciating his economic policy that it might be considered a hair-shirt policy, but that he did hope that, if we had to wear the hair-shirt for a time, the time would come when we would all wear silk shirts.  I am not exactly quoting his words, but that is the burden of his message on that occasion.  To that I say, &ldquo;Very good.&rdquo;  If we are all prepared to share in the losses we should also share in the gains.  Subsequent to the President's speech the Minister for Finance, commenting on some speeches delivered on the occasion of the debate on unemployment, said, &ldquo;Feed the hungry.&rdquo;  Taking that as his text, he said&mdash;I am quoting the Report of the Dáil Debates of the 3rd and 4th May, Volume 41, No. 5, column 1440:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Feed the hungry&rdquo;&mdash;that was the admonition addressed to the individual, but very much more addressed to the community, and, in particular, addressed to Governments; and because we accept that principle of feeding the hungry, not feeding them in idleness, but providing them with a chance to earn their bread, in accordance with the Divine decree, by the sweat of their brow&mdash;that, according to Deputy O'Sullivan, is preaching a class war. I am glad, at any rate, to be one of those who will preach that war, and, so far as I and those associated with this Party are concerned, we will preach it until unemployment, hunger, <Col N="1791" /> and want are banished from the territory over which we have control.</P>
    <P>There I interjected:</P>
    <P>The President said that too, and I accepted it.</P>
    <P>Again I repeat I accept that if it is the policy of the present Government. I am rather intrigued and most anxious to know from the present Government do they stand for the sentiment expressed there in all its implications, because if they do I stand with them in all its implications. But knowing what I do about human nature I feel that we have to travel a very long road indeed before we can reach the fulfilment of that very pious hope.  I subscribe to the doctrine of &ldquo;Feed the Hungry.&rdquo;  I subscribe to the doctrine of the Sermon on the Mount but being only human and because this is merely a human institution, I cannot see how we can achieve that great objective. We may preach it.  We may come very near it but we cannot evolve it out of the present system.  We cannot evolve it out of the present economic system.  That cannot be gainsaid.</P>
    <P>I should like to put another question to which I hope the attention of President de Valera will be directed. He went further than the Minister for Finance when he said that if within the present system&mdash;remember, I hope I am not quoting him wrongly&mdash;he found it impossible to solve the present unemployment problem he was prepared to scrap that system and try the alternative, the only alternative being, as any of us who has the merest acquaintance with political economy knows, that you must scrap the present system of capitalism in this country.  Remember there is such a whole lot in the policy of the present Government that it needs not alone one day's discussion or two days' discussion but needs discussion in the country and I feel with the time which we have at our disposal <Col N="1792" /> to discuss the very serious proposals which are included in the Budget, we should also have time to consult our constituents on the various matters arising out of the imposition of these tariffs.</P>
    <P>I said that the Budget was good in parts like the curate's egg.  I am in the position that I will be able to support the Government on one or two items, perhaps more, but I have not gone into the matter fully yet. I would find myself in agreement on certain matters.  I would find myself in agreement with what they propose to do for the civil servants for whom they expressed great solicitude when in Opposition.  At the same time, when in Opposition they always proclaimed that they were out to reduce the salaries of persons having over a certain sum per annum.  I forget the amount at the moment.  I feel that the matters raised in this Budget are of such a serious character that it would demand more attention than has been given to any Budget statement in this House since its inception.</P>
    <P>Something has been said here about decentralisation in reference to tariffs. I feel here also agreement with Deputy McGilligan because I do feel that it is time that centralisation of industries in this country was stopped. There are several parts of this country where natural facilities, capital, and offices can be provided and yet we find that the tendency is to centralise.  I do suggest that no Minister for Finance or no Minister for Industry and Commerce can be prevented from enforcing this policy or applying this policy of decentralisation.  I agree with Deputy McGilligan when he suggested that if this went to its logical end it would mean that we might come down to provincial tariffs.  We might come down, as somebody suggested to me, to parochial tariffs.  Well, I think that is rather an absurd kind of argument, because I do feel that we could easily do with certain factories in certain areas.  I have on more than one occasion said to this House that I felt that there were a number of <Col N="1793" /> social activities growing up around the small mill in the little town, around the small industry in the little town which kept people from migrating into the larger cities. There is a problem facing us in this State at the moment which transcends in importance any others, and that is the constant influx of people to the Metropolis and also to the city of Cork and to the cities of Waterford and Limerick.  There is a regular trek from the land.  And here, in this Budget, there is no proposal to put the people back on the land.  I felt that the Fianna Fáil Party, and that the present Government which is a Fianna Fáil Government, would have done something that would induce people to go back to the land. But no, except for one or two things that are done here by way of butter production and so on that may possibly induce a very small fraction of our population to remain in these agricultural areas.  But I do know that there are thousands upon thousands of acres of good arable land in this country remaining untilled.  This is however a question, I think, for another discussion; and for that reason I will confine my remarks to other matters contained in the Budget.</P>
    <P>The members of the present Government seem to take a pride in the fact that we have a growing population, growing at the rate of 30,000 persons per annum, the fact being that that growth in population has been brought about by the fact that emigration has been stopped.  The Fianna Fáil Party say to us and say to the people outside: &ldquo;It is because of our activities that young people can be kept at home.&rdquo;  Not at all.  Let us be quite frank about it.  All these thousands of people would have gone to America if they got the chance, and if the ports were open to-morrow and if the United States of America opened its portals to Irish emigrants it is not 30,000 that you would have going but 60,000.  There is no use in throwing this veil of patriotism over persons or Governments.  We all know that we are a prolific race and that we shall continue to multiply; and so long as <Col N="1794" /> that multiplication of the human species goes on in this country you will have a surplus population.  There is no question about that.  I want to know from those people who envisage a population of eight millions of people in the Twenty-six Counties&mdash; I want to know from them in the name of common sense, how are we to keep eight millions of people?  Is it by bringing them back to '47 and '42 when they were content to live on potatoes and sour milk?  I should like to get rid of some of these nonsensical statements made here from time to time about increased population.  We can support a very much larger population than we are keeping now, but we cannot support eight millions of people in this State.  We have figures a hundred years old and sixty years old quoted, but we always neglect very important factors.  We seem to lose sight of the fact that the age of machinery and tools has reached this country as well as other countries.  I do hope that we shall have all that kind of thrash dropped out of debate in this House.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party are imposing in this Budget a tax of 6d. per lb. on tea.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce endeavoured to prove or demonstrate that this impost is not affecting the very poor, and that an impost on sugar was a far greater evil than this impost on tea.  I, too, like some other Deputies have met people in the trade and they have informed me that the cheaper teas, the Java teas, I understand, can now be bought or should be bought at 8d. or 10d. per lb.  Now the 8d. tea will go up to 1s. 2d. and the 10d. tea will go up to 1s. 4d.  If that is not an imposition on the poor people of this country I do not know what is.  Tea is not the luxury that some people think.  Tea is an absolute necessity for thousands of people in this country, not alone workless people, people who are unemployed, but thousands of poor people who are in precarious and seasonal employment.  It cannot be said that this is a poor man's Budget.  My own feeling on the matter is, as I said a moment ago, that it is going to give an impetus to some industries while <Col N="1795" /> on the other hand it is going to create an amount of disaffection, and to disemploy a number of other persons in the industries I have enumerated. Deputy Dillon made my blood run cold, I got cold shivers down my spine when the Deputy spoke of the effect that this tax might have on clogs and when he envisaged the time ten years hence when they could not afford anything else.  Yet he praised this Budget. The other member of his Party &mdash;they have a party of their own like the Siamese twins&mdash;Deputy MacDermot damned the Government with faint praise.  I do not anticipate that in the area represented by Deputy Dillon you will have the people running about barefooted after ten years.  I think we have left all that behind us. But I am rather concerned to know how these tariffs are going to be imposed. I quite understand that the Minister may say that they will be imposed in the usual way.</P>
    <P>I want to know will that usual way mean an increase in the number of officials, because I feel that if the expenses of administration are to be increased further it will not be a very happy augury for the Fianna Fáil Party, who for years have been proclaiming at the cross-roads and on every opportunity that presented itself that the late Government was squandering the money of the people: that it was indulging in an orgy of regular squandermania in every Budget that it introduced.</P>
    <P>I can see in this Budget a very big effort to impoverish a number of people in the country.  Of course, I will be told, with all the blandishments that the Minister for Industry and Commerce can command, that a number of people will be put into employment, that we will all be very happy and smiling after eight months, as I think he suggested.  I am afraid that if the Minister is prepared to gamble on the impositions in the Budget producing the effects he hopes for in a period of eight months, he is unfair and unjust to himself, because, in my opinion, it will not be possible for him to ascertain in that <Col N="1796" /> period of time what the reactions and repercussions of these tariffs will be. I feel that this Budget has been very ingeniously conceived.  A tariff here will satisfy one person, a tariff there will satisfy another; but I would much prefer to see a Budget which would go the whole hog and tariff everything in the country. Nearly everything has been tariffed already.  Of course, this Budget reflects the economic policy of the Government. I believe it is the policy on which they pride themselves most. It is the one upon which they sailed into office, but in my opinion it is a policy which will bring nothing but ruin in its train.  I know it can be pointed out that the putting into work of a hundred people is no indication of ruin, but the disemployment of another hundred or 120 people would be an indication of ruin, and I feel that is what is going to happen.</P>
    <P>I am not of a suspicious nature, but I am concerned in more ways than one as to what will follow as the result of the imposition of these tariffs.  We have confectionery and chocolate industries in this country. I am anxious to know from the Minister if he has received any representations at all from people who are selling here for outside firms chocolate, cocoa and their by-products.  I had an interview with the representative of one of the firms engaged in that trade.  He assured me that he and the representative of another firm were prepared to establish a chocolate factory in Cork that would give employment to between 800 and 1,000 persons.  If such a thing came about it would certainly be very useful.  I am anxious to know from the Government if any considerations, other than economic, induced them to apply the tariffs outlined in the Budget. Now I would like the House to understand that I am not saying that in any mean or captious spirit.  I am putting the question honestly and frankly, because it is one that is giving me serious thought.  In dealing with this I do not want to make the nasty innuendos or suggestions that were made here the other night by a <Col N="1797" /> member of the House, because I do not like that kind of thing.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Agriculture is the only member of the Government on the front bench at the moment, I would ask him to take a note of my question: whether any considerations other than economic entered into the granting of these tariffs, and of certain rights and privileges, if you like, to certain manufacturers to operate in this country? I ask that question because I feel that if considerations other than economic did enter into the granting of these tariffs it would be very serious.  I say that as one who likes a square deal with his fellow man, no matter what business that man may be in, whether on this side of the Channel or on the other, and also because I feel it is better to act straight in these matters. I say that, too, because we do not know but that the cry of retaliation and that sort of thing&mdash;intimidatory expressions of that sort&mdash;may be used on the other side.  At all events, we must have regard to what is going on around us, and to the fact also that if we impose tariffs then somebody else is going to use the tariff weapon against us.</P>
    <P>The history of protective tariffs is very briefly told.  Subsequent to the Great War many countries, because of certain reactions following the war and of the economic chaos that resulted from it, thought it prudent and wise to put up a tariff barrier not because they believed that it was going to provide an ultimate solution of their economic difficulties, but rather because they believed, as a medical man believes, that a stimulant of some kind was necessary if they were to keep the body politic alive.  Now, one State having done that, another State retaliated and so on and so on.</P>
    <P>Most countries now have tariff barriers and what is the result?  Has the adoption of that policy brought any prosperity, even relative prosperity, to those countries?  It has, of course, gingered up their industries for a time just as a stimulant may ginger up a <Col N="1798" /> human, but the tariff barrier has not had the effect of providing a lasting cure for the economic ills from which those countries suffer.  I suggest to the Executive Council that that aspect of the matter should again be carefully considered by them.</P>
    <P>The woollen industry has been referred to and reference has been made to the wonderful results that have accrued to that industry following the imposition of tariffs.  I have a letter here from an operative engaged in the industry.  I am not going to read it to the House, but I will hand it to the Minister if he desires to see it.  I do not want by any act of mine to injure any industry in this country that is giving employment.  But to revert for a moment to what I said earlier in my speech, I want to put this to the Executive Council: will they see to it that in those industries which they now propose to protect, and out of which they derive revenue, the Factory Acts are observed and rigidly observed? Will they see to it that the Truck Acts are observed, because I have definite knowledge that they are broken, and that fines are being inflicted on operatives in tariffed industries.  That may be a revelation to the Minister, but so long as I am not satisfied that these industries will not alone give employment, but that they will give employment with decent humane conditions, I will be no party to passing, or supporting in any way whatever, the imposition of these tariffs.  I am prepared to give the Minister private information rather than to give any kind of adverse publicity to the matter.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he thinks that a further impost on tobacco is necessary. It may be, of course, to produce more revenue for the State, but is it fair to the ordinary agricultural labourer to charge him more for his tobacco.  At the present moment many of these men are working for eight or nine shillings a week and their keep.  They have very little to spare out of that wage, and it is within the knowledge of farmer Deputies here that that small <Col N="1799" /> wage is pretty general all over the country.  Farmer Deputies will bear me out when I say that.  Is it right to impose that tax on the farm labourer, who smokes, on an average, between three and four ounces of tobacco every week, and to whom it is a necessity. I know some of these agricultural labourers who would do without their breakfast before they would do without a smoke.  That seems to people like us a rather extravagant statement to make, but it is true, and those of us who represent the cities know that it is true in many cases, and here we are inflicting further imposts on the humblest class of the community, the class least able to bear them.</P>
    <P>I have suggested that sufficient consideration has not been given to the imposition of some of these tariffs.  I know of commercial travellers and others with thirty years' experience good sound Irishmen, and many of them strong supporters of the present Government&mdash;who have been thrown out of employment as a result of the imposition of certain tariffs.  What I am mainly concerned about is why the Executive Council, when proposing to inflict these tariffs, did not see to it that those persons who would be put out of employment would be absorbed in the newer factories, which will cater for Irish manufactured goods.  I am sure it will be very easy for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to suggest to some of these people who are looking for a tariff&mdash;the clothing industry, the woollen industry, the hosiery industry and the confectionery industry&mdash;that there are men in this country who are being put out of their jobs because of the operation of these tariffs, and that they should be absorbed by the people who are getting the tariffs.  It would be a sound business proposition because these men have established business connections all over the country, and from that aspect alone it would be a sound business proposition.</P>
    <P>The question of alien capital might be raised at another time, but I do feel that where a certain want exists, and <Col N="1800" /> where the want has to be satisfied, that want will continue unsatisfied, until such time as the consumer gets the particular brand of tobacco or sweet or chocolate he or she requires.  Pending the setting up of factories here to meet that want, some accommodation should be reached.  Where, as I have said, you have two firms prepared to establish a factory to cope with their Irish business, it is a matter that should be seriously considered by the present administration.</P>
    <P>I want to close on one note, and that is, that I am more concerned with the conditions that will operate in these factories than I am with any other aspect of the case.  If this Government decides to impose these tariffs, there must be sufficient inspection of the factories.  The Factory Act system will have to be tightened up, and inspection will have to become, I will not say more rigid, but, at least, as rigid as it is in other countries, and there will then be no fear that operative will be sweated as they are being sweated in some of the tariffed industries, and on that I have private information which I can give the Minister.  The conditions should be humane conditions, hygienic conditions, and so on.  I want to close on that note, in the hope that when these tariffs are imposed, the workers in the industries will get decent, humane and fair conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>An examination of this Budget would fall normally under four heads.  There is, first of all, the balance, that is as to whether or not the necessity would arise for making provision for any deficit arising out of last year's Budget.  There is next, the requirement of the current year, which would, of course, include any adverse balance remaining over from the previous year, and that would involve a decision being taken as to the amount of money that would require to be raised, which is, of course, the essence of the problem of practically every Minister for Finance in any country.  There is then the question of impositions and reliefs, if any, and the last question which <Col N="1801" /> arises, and which is of, perhaps, major importance in connection with this Budget, the reactions, favourable and unfavourable, in respect of the whole Budgetary proposals taken together.</P>
      <P>On the first point, of balance, the Minister devoted a good deal of his time in the earlier part of his speech to dealing with it, and he proceeded, so far as I could judge, to satisfy himself that according to his own estimate of last year's Budget it was not well balanced.  His leader here a short time ago&mdash;I think within the last fortnight or three weeks&mdash;mentioned that the legacy which Deputy Blythe had left amounted to £1,400,000.  Of course there is not a word of truth in that.  Some Deputy on the far side said, when the President of the Executive Council made that statement, &ldquo;That was their contribution to employment.&rdquo;  We have had a retraction or an elaboration of that statement from the Minister for Finance, but we have had no retraction so far from the President, and he ought to be afforded the opportunity of putting himself right with the people, because a statement is either true or false, and this statement, coming as it did from the head of the Government, requires to have behind it at least something which would prove it, and there is, apparently, nothing to prove it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now if we leave that for a moment and go on to another point that the Minister made&mdash;that there was a very big task facing the Minister for Finance this year, whoever he would be, and that the late administration went to the country rather than face it, I want to stamp that statement as absolutely untrue in substance and in fact.  Last October&mdash;and if I might, just while I am on the point of October, correct a mis-statement of the Minister in his speech, when he said that we put a tax on sugar last October.  That is not true.  It was imposed in the Minister's Budget last year and not in October&mdash;but, in <Col N="1802" /> October last, seeing what the situation was and realising the importance of balancing our Budget and of meeting all the expenses which should be met, the Minister for Finance at that time, Deputy Blythe, introduced a supplementary Budget here in which he imposed 6d. in the £ on Income Tax and 4d. on petrol.  What was the attitude of the Opposition on that occasion?  What was their contribution towards balancing last year's Budget? They stated that the supplementary Budget was not necessary&mdash;that the necessary money could be got by economy.</P>
    <P>Let us just mark the difference between statements and actions, because no person of sense pays any attention to any statements of any individual, from the President of the Executive Council down to the Deputy who is least known.  Let us look at the acts of the Government.  What did they do when the second Budget was introduced in October?  They walked into the Division Lobby and voted against it.  It was not a rich man's Budget. The Minister for Finance last October took the House and the country into his confidence by putting before them what the situation was and what it required. Those who were in opposition last year, and who objected to 6d. in the £ being put on income tax and 4d. per gallon on petrol, come along now and ask us not alone to increase the income tax, but to put income tax in respect of certain businesses and professions in this country on exactly the same level as in England.  They come forward and ask from the country at this moment a sum of approximately £5,000,000 in excess of what the yield would be if the taxes were the same as were imposed last year.</P>
    <P>It is a strange commentary upon the statement made by the Minister for Finance, who cannot afford to waste any time by attending the House, that in the earlier portion of his statement he deals with the contraction of the business of the country, contrasts the present volume of business with what it was last year, and goes further and <Col N="1803" /> compares it with what it was in 1927-28. He said on page 6 of his statement:</P>
    <P>So that in 1931-32 the total value of our import and export trade was only 68 per cent. of what it was in 1930-31, and only 63 per cent. of what it was in 1927-28.</P>
    <P>Does he suppose that there is going to be an improvement this year in the trade of this country?  In the year 1927-28 the late Administration was denounced from one end of the country to the other for taxing people beyond their capacity, for crippling industry and placing obstacles in the development of trade by reason of the enormous taxation that they were imposing at that time.  This year we are being asked, when our trade is only 63 per cent. of what it was then, when industry, commerce, agriculture, and the professions are in a far worse position than they were when we were listening to these denunciations Sunday after Sunday, to shoulder a burden far beyond the capacity of this country to bear at present.</P>
    <P>As I said, the first point to consider in connection with the Budget is balances.  The Government describe themselves as honest men, who are approaching the consideration of this Budget purely and simply with the spectacles of honest men who are going to deal with everything in the Budget as honest men should deal with it.  But when we put the question, &ldquo;Are you providing for the deficit of last year?&rdquo; we find that these honest men are not.  We must draw only one conclusion from that, that there was no deficit last year.  The ex-Minister for Finance has at least this to show, that after his eight or nine years of office, introducing Budget after Budget, in difficult times and good times, the whole thing remains for examination, and what are the weaknesses in it?  None.  So that the Minister for Finance, in introducing his Budget, found himself with ordered conditions in the State, with the credit <Col N="1804" /> of the State good, with its industry in a much better condition than we found it, with a successful tariff policy which has improved employment, subject to the proviso that we have not entirely escaped the terrible economic conditions which are affecting every State in the world, but that we did escape much better than any other country in the world.</P>
    <P>As I said, we are now asked, with the example of other countries in Europe before our minds, in which bad financial policy brought about baneful results, in which unsound national economics injured the industry of various States, ten years after the event to take up the wrong policy that was followed by these other countries and to jeopardise the sound financial position of this country, and for what? Included in this Budget this year there is, beyond what was provided in last year's Budget, a sum of £650,000 for employment.  The Minister for Finance, who criticises his predecessor by saying that he has left him nothing but mortgages, enters into possession of a Road Fund which produces something like £900,000 annually, with a liability of £640,000 against it, with a further liability of a quarter of a million, and as assets fairly good roads, as good roads as there are in any other country in Europe, and as good roads, I believe, as this country can afford.  He proceeds to mortgage that Road Fund to the extent of one million pounds.</P>
    <P>That operation simply means that whatever employment is going to be given this year is at the expense of the employment which should be given within the next five or ten years, or whatever the length of the loan is to be.  It is not mortgaging your capital at all.  It is mortgaging the unfortunate roadworkers of the country for the future.  In a time of depression, if it could be conceived that there was a likelihood of improvement in conditions, if, as the Americans say, we were sure we had touched bottom and it was a question of rising up, there would be an excuse for that. <Col N="1805" /> There would be a further excuse if the condition of the roads necessitated such an expenditure of money as would enable them to be put in a condition to be used.  But that is not the case. As I conceive it, what will happen is something like this: the Minister will assemble various officials belonging to various Departments, and will say: &ldquo;I have one, two or three millions of money to spend in one, two or three years, or I have one, two or three millions to spend yearly for the next three years.  How can we spend it quickly?&rdquo;  What are we going to be in possession of when we have spent this one million pounds?  Is there an asset? Is there something that will lessen the cost of production and that will ease the burden upon anybody?  It does not appear to me to be an attractive position even from the point of view of those most interested in giving the maximum of employment.  There I shall leave that for the moment.  As far as that one million is concerned, it is mortgaging the future.  What is left? A sum of £600,000, of which £350,000 is to be devoted to public health work; a sum of £150,000 is to be devoted to immediate relief&mdash;there has been no development of the policy that is to be pursued in that connection&mdash; and £100,000 is to be devoted to housing.  £600,000 is being given to provide labour in this Budget.  At what cost?  So far as the industry of this country is concerned, it is the difference between £23,310,000 which is the estimate of the receipts of last year's taxation, and £27,200,000 which the Minister proposes to spend this year.  In essence what it amounts to is this.  £600,000 is to be spent to give employment, and the people of the country are to be taxed to the extent of £4,000,000 in order to do that.  There is sound finance!  There is something for the various Deputies belonging to the Fianna Fáil Party to go around the country and to explain to the people as a sound economic proposition; to show what great financial mind is behind a proposition of that sort, how the country is to progress by spending £4,000,000 in order to give employment to the number who would be employed by an expenditure of £600,000. <Col N="1806" /> The first mistake made by the Minister, the first indication that he was not on a sound platform, was when he stood for getting from this country in these days, when he himself estimated that our imports and exports were only 68 per cent. of what they were twelve months ago, £27,000,000.  It is impossible.</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister upon his first Budget and to say to him that it most closely resembles, and most faithfully follows the Budgets of our neighbours across the water.  I will not have time to-day to explain that in full detail, but I hope next week to be able to deal with it.  Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.  I would like to say this: that it is unwise ever, I think, for one Parliament to criticise another.  But if I were asked, either as a Minister of State or an ex-Minister of State, or as a business man, what my view about the situation across the water is, I would say it is simply this: that they are levying much more upon the people of the country than the country can afford at the present moment.  Much the same may be said of every country in Europe and outside Europe.  It is to a large extent, and to a very large extent, one of the causes producing the terrible economic conditions prevalent at the moment all over the world.  We are invited to follow in the wake of that policy, and we are doing it as closely as it would be possible to do it without forming an exact parallel.</P>
    <P>There is a difference, it is true, of 2/- in the pound taking income tax and super-tax together as compared with the British, but it is more apparent than real.  As a matter of fact, if one were in the happy position of being liable for the full income tax and full super-tax, he would pay more in income tax and super-tax in this country, with the other charges that are placed upon him, than if he were an Englishman.  Nobody knows better than the Minister for Finance, and nobody knows better than the Ministry here, that one of the real weaknesses in this country is the low percentage of rich persons in the country. The reason taxation falls so <Col N="1807" /> heavily upon the people of this country is that a proportion of taxation is borne by a much higher percentage of rich people across the water than is available in this country, and that, in consequence, the incidence of taxation here falls much more <Col N="1808" /> heavily upon the remainder of the people.</P>
