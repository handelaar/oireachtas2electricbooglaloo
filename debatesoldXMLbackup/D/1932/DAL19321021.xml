    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, the Minister for Finance was alone on the Front Bench, and had not an opportunity of consulting with his colleagues. He was asked a question, which seems to me of great interest to the House and the country, with regard to sub-head M. for a sum of £1,126,500.  It was recalled to him that a statement had been made by the Party now in power that the Government policy with regard to this matter would be based on advice that would be got from Counsel, and that its action would follow that advice.  The Minister informed the House that the Government had been advised that this payment was not legally due to be made.  Now the ordinary custom of the Dáil is that monies that are put down in Estimates are provided for by law.  Occasionally, when the law is changed during the year in such a way as to involve the expenditure of monies owing to a position which was not anticipated or foreseen when the Estimate was drawn up, the situation is met by a Supplementary Estimate.  The Minister told us that legally this money was not due to be paid.  It is a fairly large sum&mdash; more than £1,000,000&mdash;and it seems to be an extraordinary thing that we should legislate for paying large sums of money by merely putting down a figure in the Estimate and doing nothing further.  We are told that, at this moment, it would not be legal for the Government to pay this money in the manner indicated in the Estimates. Presumably, a change in the law would be required to make that payment. The ordinary custom of the Dáil is that, when legislation is introduced, a <Col N="309" /> Supplementary Estimate to meet the cost arising as a result of that legislation is introduced.  I can quite understand that yesterday the Minister for Finance may not have been aware that such legal opinion had been sought and accepted by the Government. He might have been unaware of the exact personnel of the advisers, or he might have hesitated to give the names on his own responsibility without consultation with his colleagues when he might miss one or be dubious about one.  Since then, he has had ample opportunity to consult with his colleagues, and I should like to ask now for this information, as the country was promised that certain advice would be got and acted upon. The country has the right to know the names which imply the authority of that advice.  I hope the Minister will now give us those names.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to stress, again, that it would be an extraordinary thing if this country were committed to payments, not payable by law, by the mere insertion of a figure in an Estimate, that being done merely in anticipation that during the twelve months, and at no specified date, the law may be changed.  In the ordinary way, when a supplementary Estimate is introduced, it is a declaration of Government policy.  For instance, yesterday, we had the Second Reading of a Bill to provide certain pensions. A supplementary Estimate will, presumably, be introduced for those pensions, having been already sanctioned by law.  If a supplementary Estimate were brought in before the law was passed, it would be a clear indication that the Government intended to change the law in such a way that they would require these payments.  Here, we are told that the law does not require these payments, that the Government does not intend to change the law to make these payments and, yet, we are asked to vote this very large sum of money, which changes the whole figure of the Budget, as introduced.  When the Budget was introduced, it set out to raise a sum equivalent to the cost estimated for the year.  This makes a difference of more than £1,000,000 in the taxation of this country, and it may <Col N="310" /> be necessary to raise taxation by £1,000,000, when Government policy so requires, in order to carry out this programme.  Here we have an extraordinary situation.  The law does not provide for the payment of these moneys.  The Government does not propose to change the law for the payment of these moneys.  Yet the people are to be taxed for no reasonable reason at all.  I should like to hear the names of the men on whose legal judgment the Government are placing what I might call the whole economic situation of this country.  In legal opinion the authority very largely rests upon the name of the person giving the legal opinion.  Laws are often practically made by decisions from the Bench.  Here the law is being made so far by an anonymous lawyer. That seems to be a ridiculous and scandalous situation.  Certainly we have a right to ask, and the country has a right to expect, that at least the weight of the authority on which our basic policy is now based will be made known to them, so that they may judge as to the wisdom or unwisdom of the course we are pursuing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so much concerned as to who is the legal adviser or who were the legal advisers of the Government in this matter, but I am seriously concerned with the effects of Government policy on the workers and farmers.  I should like some assurance from the Minister that the gloomy forebodings of Deputy McGilligan yesterday evening have not any foundation in fact.  It has been stated, and stated with truth, that more money will be extracted by the British from our people by way of retaliatory tariffs and the withdrawal of certain preferences than is represented by the retention of the land annuities and the non-payment of these superannuation and retired allowances.  I should like to enter my protest against the workers and farmers being made the shuttle-cocks of any number of theorists, whether lawyers or laymen.  I understand that certain legal gentlemen have given certain advice.  The names of these people have not up to the present been mentioned.  I think the people <Col N="311" /> are entitled to know the names of these legal advisers.  We cannot form any idea of their eminence, or perhaps of their obscurity, because we have not got the names.  I should like to remind the Minister that many Deputies have during the last few months received very many complaints from their constituents in various parts of the country.  I represent a very important Borough, the Borough of Cork, in which area there are many thousands of farmers, as well as industrialists. Industrialists, shopkeepers and others in the city are complaining bitterly of the ill-effects that have followed the Government policy in this particular regard.  I shall reserve for a more appropriate occasion further comments with regard to the bad economic effect that this policy is having.  The Minister proposes to retain these moneys for some purpose not yet defined, because no later than last evening in answer to a question by Deputy MacDermot the Minister refused to say that these moneys if retained will be used for the purpose of derating.  Many farmers in my area were led to believe that if the land annuities and these other moneys indicated by members of the present Government during the last election campaign were retained the farmers would be entitled to some relief by way of derating.  That has not come about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all conversant with the conditions that operate from one fair to another in the country.  Farmers are finding extraordinary difficulty in disposing of their stock and when they do sell they have to accept a price which cannot, by the greatest stretch of imagination, be considered economic.  I feel, therefore, that I cannot support this Estimate in the absence of the information asked for yesterday evening.  Lest the Minister might think that I have in any way exaggerated, I should like to quote one or two sentences from a letter I received yesterday morning from a very extensive farmer in my area&mdash; one of the best farmers I suppose in this country; a man who employs more men to the acre than perhaps <Col N="312" /> any farmer in the country, north or south.  He writes:</P>
    <P>The position is very serious with us, farmers.  I do not think my loss will be under about £1,200 this year. Unfortunately, the more intensively a man farms the more he loses.  I have lost 20/- each on some 500 heavy pigs, and have more still to market at a further loss.</P>
    <P>I could go on quoting from the letter, but I do not want to occupy the time of the House.  I think the Minister should give us some assurance.  He should reassure not alone Deputies, but the persons who sent us here to represent them.  As to the nature of the advice tendered by the legal advisers, we want to know whether it was something more than a yes or no to certain stated and framed questions put up to these legal advisers.  I suggest to the Minister, as one who does not want to embarrass the Government in any way in their delicate negotiations, that many people, even supporters of the present Government, are anxious for this information. Even the layman can form a decent estimate of the standing of these legal gentlemen, as to whether they be obscure or eminent.  The retention of these moneys is having a very disturbing effect on the trade and commerce of the country.  I know from my own experience that it has had very ill-effects in the Borough of Cork, which I represent.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour this question. I think everything that could be said has been said already by Deputy McGilligan and others.  In the interests of the country, I think the Minister should give the names to the House so that the public outside can estimate for themselves the value of the legal advice tendered in connection with this sum of money which is supposed to be retained by this Government and put into something like a Suspense Account.</P>

      <P>I presume the Minister <Col N="313" /> is, first of all, going to answer the question put to him from these benches.  It does not follow that he must now conclude the debate.  It is an absolutely vital point and the country wants to know.</P>

      <P>I am afraid if we are to adopt that procedure it will be very difficult to have this debate concluded to-day.  I am sorry Deputy McGilligan is not in the House, because Deputy McGilligan is regarded as one of the bright young things on the Opposition Benches.  It is a pity that latterly his speeches on this matter and particularly in this debate should have degenerated into echoes of each other. For twenty minutes last night, before I rose, as I thought, to conclude the debate, after everything useful had been said and after a good deal which was neither useful nor helpful to the present Government in the existing crisis had been said from the Opposition Benches, Deputy McGilligan spoke and then, after I concluded, he wasted a further twenty-five minutes repeating what he had already said on the earlier occasion.  We have had a virtual repetition here this morning of what Deputy McGilligan said last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies in Opposition have suddenly developed a great regard for legal opinion.  They are asking us what legal opinion we have had to justify the retention of the land annuities and the retention of the moneys which were formerly paid by Great Britain in regard to R.I.C. pensions. It would seem to me that a much more practical point in the country's view would have been: What legal opinion was obtained by the last Government before they decided to pay these pensions?  After all, it is not an inconsiderable sum that is involved.  During the ten <Col N="314" /> years when the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was in office they paid away in respect of R.I.C. pensions no less a sum than over £12,000,000.  If a Cumann na nGaedheal Government were in power to-morrow there would, possibly, be an additional £12,000,000 paid by them in pursuance of their former policy in this regard.  When an issue of that magnitude is involved, surely the Government responsible for taxing the people in order to make these payments ought first of all to have assured themselves that under the Treaty they were bound beyond yea or nay to make the payments?</P>
    <P>We have searched all the files available to us in this matter, and we cannot find any trace in those files that before the Agreements of 1923 and 1926 were entered into there was any serious consideration given to the point as to whether we were under any legal obligation in this matter. There was no obligation imposed on us by the Treaty to make these payments.  If the question of legal authority or legal advice arises in the matter at all I repeat that it arises with much greater force in the contrary direction and that is: What legal advice was obtained before the payments were made and before the people were taxed to make them?  We have secured advice through the usual channels.  That advice has been fortified by men whose competence and standing at the Bar is unchallengeable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;but I doubt it.  At any rate, whatever their names may be, they are such that the Government are fortified in the course which ordinarily they would have taken on their own initiative, having studied the whole matter.  They were thus fortified in their decision to withhold the payments.  These payments were never properly due under the Treaty. <Col N="315" /> When we were in Opposition and when knowledge upon real vital facts was not at our disposal we were told by those who were apologists for these payments on the Government Benches that one of the reasons why we were making the payments.  despite the fact that it seemed on the face of Article X. of the Treaty that we were not bound to make them, was that they had been a private arrangement between the two Governments &mdash; that the disbandment of the R.I.C. by the British had been a matter of private arrangement between the two Governments&mdash;and that though there was no legal obligation, there was a moral obligation upon us to make the payments. What are the facts?  I have here a letter written by the Minister for Justice at the time&mdash;a minute written by the Minister for Justice at the time&mdash;to the then President and Minister for Finance, dealing with this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give me the reference to the Dáil statements of which he has just spoken?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The statements have been made here on many occasions. I will give the Deputy the reference later if he cares.  At any rate, here is one letter that shows there was no arrangement of the sort.  It has often been held out as an excuse for making these payments.  It shows, in fact, that the disbandment of the R.I.C. was a purely British decision. This is a letter from the late Kevin O'Higgins, who was then Minister for Justice and was one of the Committee which drew up the document entitled &ldquo;Heads of Working Arrangements for Implementing the Treaty.&rdquo;  It is addressed to the Minister for Finance and it states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disbandment of the R.I.C. was, so far as I am aware, a purely British decision dictated, of course, by the necessities of the position.  I have no doubt whatever that it was insisted upon by the R.I.C. themselves. The mention of it in the Heads of the Agreement was merely <Col N="316" /> the statement of a fact which I believe was actually in operation at the time.  There was never any suggestion by the British of handing over the R.I.C. to the Provisional Government.  Their disbandment was a foregone conclusion.  Possibly the reference in the Heads of the Agreement is for the purpose of stressing the fact that the early disappearance of the individuals and the uniform was a desideratum and would render the Truce more secure.</P>
    <P>That is initialled &ldquo;C. O'H.&rdquo;, and the date is 21/12/22.</P>
    <P>So that we are bound neither by a legal obligation nor by an honourable understanding to pay these moneys. In view of the power of this House and the duty which Ministers owe to this House and to the people I say that there can be no honourable understanding if the terms of that understanding are withheld from the people and from this House.  The Deputy has said, or at any rate I think has tried to suggest, that there is somewhere a legal obligation on us to pay.  The only documents which would require us to make these payments are the documents of 1923 and 1926. We challenge the validity of those documents and we say that they are not binding upon us in law or in equity.</P>
    <P>The text and terms of the 1923 agreement were concealed from the Oireachtas and from the people for nine years.  There can be no doubt whatsoever about that.  We have had a Minister of State in communications addressed to the British Government stating that it would be politically inadvisable to publish these documents.  In regard to them we have a further statement made in this House by Mr. Hogan the then Minister for Lands and Fisheries on the 26th March, 1925.  The reference is Vol. 10, cols. 1538-9, in which he says:&mdash;&ldquo;We can at once clear our minds on this question of agreements.  The Dáil of course, as everyone here knows, is supreme.  The Dáil can agree or disagree.  There is no question of an agreement in the past.&rdquo; And then he makes the statement more <Col N="317" /> comprehensive.  He goes as far back as the establishment of the first Dáil. &ldquo;There is no question,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of an agreement in the past, or in 1920, 1921 or 1922.  The Minister for Finance is perfectly entitled to state the facts, but I doubt if there is anyone in the Dáil who does not know that the Dáil is supreme, is sovereign and can at this stage act as it thinks fit on this matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think there can be a more categorical denial of the existence of the 1923 agreement as a binding agreement than is contained in that statement. And yet that 1923 agreement is the only instrument in existence that would compel us to make these payments.  I think that in view of the Resolution adopted in this House on the 26th February, 1926, no member of the Opposition will any longer contend that the 1926 agreement is a binding one either.  On the 25th February, 1926, Deputy Professor Magennis proposed this Resolution consequent upon a letter which the then President of the Executive Council had written I believe to, of all journals in the world, the <i>Morning Post.</i></P>
    <P>That the Dáil learns with alarm and disapproval, from the communication of the President to an English newspaper, that secret negotiations with external Governments have been carried on of late, if not at his instance with his knowledge and consent, directed to cap the London agreement with an economic treaty; and the Dáil condemns and forbids the commitment of this State to changes of its fiscal policy and surrender of its fiscal freedom by covenants entered into on its behalf by Ministers of the Executive Council without previous authorisation and specific mandate from the representatives of the people.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly any Deputy speaking from the Opposition benches dealing with a matter of this sort must be in great difficulty.  He has not the exact information at his disposal which would enable him to present his case in all its force, but no one will deny that the President of the Executive <Col N="318" /> Council at least knows what is taking place.  And knowing that these negotiations were at that time actually in contemplation, knowing that, and knowing also the feeling in the Dáil on this matter, not merely on the Opposition benches, not merely amongst the members of the Labour Party, not merely amongst the Independents, but knowing the feeling in his own benches on the matter, the then President of the Executive Council did not dare to allow that Resolution to go in that form before the House, and he introduced an amendment which would seem designed to allay the fears of his own followers, and to give the House assurance which it did require that these negotiations were not contemplated nor being carried on.  The terms of the amendment moved by the then President are as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To delete all the words after the word &lsquo;Dáil&rsquo; in the first line and to substitute therefor the words &lsquo;recognising that Saorstát Eireann cannot be committed to or bound by any agreement with an external Government without the prior sanction and consent of the Dáil, has no desire to limit the Executive Council in the exercise of its functions or in the discharge of its duty to defend and promote the interests of the State and its people&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The agreement of 1926 was signed in March of 1926.  This Resolution was passed on the 26th February, 1926, and again I ask the attention of the House to its terms: &ldquo;That the Dáil recognising that Saorstát Eireann cannot be committed to or bound by any Agreement with an external Government without the prior sanction and consent of the Dáil, has no desire to limit the Executive Council in the exercise of its functions or in the discharge of its duties to defend and promote the interests of the State and its people.&rdquo;&ldquo;Cannot be committed to or bound by any Agreement with an external Government without the prior sanction and consent of the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Was the prior sanction of the Dáil given to the agreement of March, 1926?  We have been told from the <Col N="319" /> benches opposite that these Agreements are valid and binding.  Now that the terms of that Resolution proposed by the head of the Government in 1926 have been recalled to their minds can the Opposition sustain that contention a moment longer?  Is it not quite clear that we are no longer bound in honour or in law, so far as this House is concerned, to fulfill this Agreement, and in view of the burdens which they impose upon our people it is our duty as a Government to resist the imposition of that burden, and, if we can, to secure an unqualified release on the part of the British Government from any obligation which it might impose upon us.  When we are doing that, are we not entitled to the support of every element in this House and in the country?  Deputy McGilligan last night for his own purpose referred to the factor of 66/1, and that factor can be rightfully applied in this connection, that a payment of one million pounds by our people is equivalent to a payment of £66,000 per annum by the British.  The payment of £5,000,000 under the 1923 and 1926 Agreements is equivalent to an annual payment of £330,000,000 by the British Government, and we saw the stand which a Chancellor of the Exchequer in Great Britain made in respect of a payment of £2,000,000, when he threatened to break up an international conference &mdash; a critical international conference&mdash;and by standing fast won his point, and came home to be lauded as a hero and statesman by the British people.  They asked us if any loss we may sustain during this period and during the continuance of this dispute is commensurate with the benefits and advantages which we will secure if we win.  The men who talk like that cannot see beyond their noses.  As regards the total amount involved in the payment of the Land Annuities for the period that they have yet to run, it is not less than £140,000,000.  After that there is the amount involved in respect of R.I.C. pensions and the other items which we are now challenging, and the total is brought up to the sum of £160,000,000 or £170,000,000.  That is what we are fighting for&mdash;for the retention of that. <Col N="320" /> It is more than nine times, so far as I can see, the total value of our whole cattle trade with Great Britain.</P>
    <P>As matters stand it is almost four times the total value of our whole trade of every sort with Great Britain. It is much more than was involved in the land war.  Our people were able to fight the land war not for one year but for over a generation, and we are asking them now to help us to fight to bring that land war to a victorious conclusion, so that never more will English Governments, and the representatives of the English Crown in this country as the landlords were, wrung from the toiling Irish people rent for Irish soil.  That is what is involved in this dispute, and I believe that we can carry it through.  I believe that we can carry it through, because, whatever may be the temporary inconvenience inflicted by this dispute upon our people, there is one fact that cannot be denied. That is that so long as Britain, the seat of an island Empire, is over populated by many millions of people, and dependent on overseas sources for her foodstuffs, she can never kill and can never permit to be killed, the cattle trade of this country.  Because that trade is her only safeguard and her only assurance in time of war.  While Britain ultimately cannot do without our cattle trade, there are many of her manufactures exported here upon very profitable terms, exported to this country at prices from 20 to 25 per cent. higher than she is compelled to sell them in Continental and other markets, and there are many items of that valuable trade which we can do without.  We can dispense with her coal; we can dispense with her steel; we can dispense with her cement; we can dispense with a hundred articles that she supplies to us, but there is one thing that we supply to her which she cannot dispense with, and that is the essential foodstuffs which she must rely upon to feed her people in time of war.</P>

      <P>I do not propose following on the red herrings the Minister has dragged up.  The implication of our criticism was that the Government policy being what it is, <Col N="321" /> and the legal statement of the position being what they assert, that that Estimate should not be there.  The Minister has got up, and the only inference to be drawn from his statement is that he wishes to amend that Estimate to exclude that sum.  It is impossible to follow all the red herrings that he dragged across.  Taking his reference to our position in regard to England&mdash;well I do not want to go into that.  Every man in this country and in England knows the truth or the falsehood of the position as represented by him there.  He spoke about Mr. McGilligan's statement being harmful to the Government, and stated it in such a way as to imply that it was harmful to the Government here in connection with its relations with the British Government. I should like to know where that comes in.  We have asked for the legal opinion and the names of the legal men.  The Minister gave a high-flown account of the legal adviser or advisers.  He spoke about the standing of the legal advisers and the eminence of the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We begin to believe that that must be quite so, and that the man who gave the advice was so conscious of his eminence and of his authority that he made one strong stipulation, and that was that he should be kept anonymous, that he was not going to be put into the position&mdash;even for anything he might get from the present Government&mdash;of selling his reputation. He was to be kept anonymous, and the Minister has very carefully kept him anonymous.  When we asked for the reasoned case, is that calculated to assist the British?  Last week the Minister and his colleagues were over in England, and for two days talked to the British.  We must assume, as far as we can judge from the newspapers, that whatever reasoned case they had from this man, who is so conscious of his standing as a lawyer that he refuses to have his name associated with this advice, was put before the British.  The Minister got up and made a speech that did not even purport to deal with the matters raised.  In so far as it touched on the thing at all it entirely <Col N="322" /> supported everything that has been said by Deputy Anthony, by Deputy McGilligan and anybody else here, namely, that the Government's conviction of the legal position being what it is and the Government's policy being what it is, that the Government has no right to introduce that item N here and inflict this extra unnecessary taxation upon the people.  The Minister was very anxious to run away and drag red-herrings across, and made a speech trying to mislead the people of the country.  As I said before, I do not want to go into everything he said, but he spoke of prior assent of the Dáil.  What does he understand by that?  What he wants to convey to unenlightened people is that before any negotiations were opened with the British in 1925 and 1926 or any other time that the thing should first of all be brought before the Dáil.  The Minister and his colleagues went over to London last week to negotiate with the British. They might, if they had been different Ministers, come to some agreement with the British and might have put their names to it.  Would that have been breaking any resolution that was brought in here at any time?  If it was, it was a resolution that should be disregarded.</P>
    <P>Neither the late Government nor the present Government could carry on in its relations with other countries if it could not negotiate and could not come to agreement with those other countries unless it had what is called the &ldquo;prior assent of the Dáil.&rdquo;  They have made an agreement with the British Government.  That agreement would be merely pledging their reputation or pledging the support of the Ministers who were parties to it.  The authority behind it would have been that they were practically pledging their own political future.  If they came back to the Dáil the Dáil might have rejected it, and the only persons who would suffer by that would have been the men who in their judgment had put their names to an agreement that the Dáil would refuse to sanction afterwards. What the Minister is trying to imply is that nobody has any right to go to England or any other place to enter <Col N="323" /> into negotiation with any Government and to come to a decision, in so far as they can come to a decision, to the point of saying that the negotiators agree, put their names to it, and they are prepared to come back and recommend that to the Dáil here.  The Minister took one letter of the late Minister for Justice and Vice-President. He took that by itself.  Now, on Friday and Saturday last in those long harangues which presumably took place when members of the Irish delegation brought in going off the gold standard and all the rest of it I have no doubt that even the present Ministers would have agreed that some slight modification of the enormous claims that they put up might have been a reasonable thing to accept, and if for instance, on the gold standard the British had agreed, imagine it, that they would have to pay over to us a sum equal to 99 per cent. of the difference between the value of the £ on the gold standard and the value of it now, I presume, if I can presume, that the Ministers who were negotiating would have accepted it.  Would they have considered themselves bound thereafter by every argument they had put up in favour of getting the 100 per cent.? Often I have argued with the British, and have put up arguments and have afterwards agreed to something which was not a complete acceptance of the arguments one had put up, and if one is to be condemned thereafter because one does not insist on getting 100 per cent. there is no use ever to go to negotiate with anybody, because you will never come to anything in negotiation. The whole trouble in this country at the present moment is the peculiar purblindness of the present Ministers and that constant attempt&mdash;when they are asked to justify one item in the Estimate, to get up and make a speech for no other purpose than to mislead the whole people of this country, instead of dealing with the matter that has been discussed.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement implies clearly that the proper course for the Minister at this moment is to get up <Col N="324" /> and propose that the Estimate that is before us be amended to the exclusion of item N and the amount to be reduced by the sum of £1,126,000&mdash;what other case has he made?  I do not want to take up any more time.  No doubt there will be other opportunities of dealing with this fantastic perversion of the facts with regard to 1923 and 1926.  We know that is recognised as good tactics at the moment for a Government who went around and told the people they had a good case.  This is now a run away.  He referred to the Agreement of 1923 and to the secret nature of it.  He knows perfectly well that everything in that Agreement relating to land annuities, which is the vital point, was made abundantly clear here in the Dáil even though he was not here, and the attempt to pretend otherwise is only an attempt to mislead the people of the country.  It is not an attempt to mislead the people in the Dáil because that is not very important.  The majority is established here, and the only worry is about what the people in the country are thinking.  I think it is absolutely scandalous for the Minister to get up and talk about Deputy McGilligan wasting time here&mdash;what was his statement but wasting time.  Was there any one attempt whatsoever to justify the retention of item N? He himself got up and made a much better case than I could make or anybody on this side could make, because we are unfortunately handicapped by having to stand by what we know to be the facts.  The Minister can get up and talk about his anonymous, concealed legal luminary whose advice was given but he will not give the legal luminary's name, he will not give any statement, he merely comes along and gives his own luminous exposition of the position.  I again repeat that this country has a perfect right to know, quite independent of the promises given by the Government party in the election.  The Government party said they would get the advice of counsel and there again they would be directed by the advice given.  The Minister gets up and in a most unfair, and I might say <Col N="325" /> cowardly way, proceeds to draw a picture of the counsel eminent at the Bar, far more eminent than Deputy McGilligan can hope to be when he is as long at the Bar as this wonderful man, but he would not tell the man's name and why?  For this reason, and this is the only possible reason, that the man who, paid or otherwise by the Government, agreed to give the Government the advice it wanted stipulated one thing and that was that his name was not going to be associated with that advice.</P>

      <P>We had not the <Col N="326" /> benefit of Deputy Corry in the Dáil in 1923 to give advice.  I think it will at least be interesting to the country to know the man or men who gave this advice, having seen what the effect was of the seven legal luminaries who advised on the Land Annuities point, and knowing, as the Government itself now knows, that that advice was wrong and was misleading and led this country into one of the worst messes it has ever been in.  The present legal luminary is certainly going to remain anonymous, and, apparently, stipulated very strongly that the Government could use the advice but not his name.</P>

      <P>I take it there will be a special Vote for the £250,000 Supplementary Agricultural Grant this year. I do not think the Minister is in a position to give any information to the Dáil as to the actual position of the grant in relief of rates.  There is this sum and a sum chargeable on the Central Fund payable in relief of rates, and there is also the £250,000 mentioned in this year's Budget.  It would be of interest to the House to know what are the prospects of the local authorities in the matter of receiving these grants.  The grants due <Col N="332" /> to local authorities are liable to deduction in respect of unpaid land annuities.  The moratorium declared by the Government, I take it, means that there is going to be a considerable excess deduction from the grants to which local authorities are entitled.  If there is a cessation of the collection of old arrears it means that a certain flow into the Guarantee Fund which would tend to reduce the deductions would cease.  I do not believe there is going to be any improvement in the current collection.  I take it that a very large proportion of the money covered by the moratorium is actually money to be deducted from this grant, from the original grant, or from the new supplementary grant, so that the position of local authorities will be prejudiced to that extent.  Perhaps there is a further falling off.  I do not know what return the Minister may have, or whether he can yet have got a return, but when the House is voting this sum, it would be of interest and of value if it had some forecast as to the proportion of this, and the related sums that will actually go to local authorities, and what their position will be in relation to the grants.</P>

      <P>With regard to the point the Deputy has raised I should say at once that it is quite true that the arrears in respect of land annuities are greater this year than last year, and that the county councils have suffered accordingly, in so far as they have not received their proper share of the Supplementary Grant.  At the same time, in that connection, we have to bear this fact in mind, that there is a surprising difference between the amount of arrears in one county and in another, and it would seem that in some counties, where the ability to pay is as great as in others&mdash;and often greater&mdash;there is an inclination on the part of certain annuitants not to make the necessary payments.  The whole matter has been engaging the attention of the Government for some time, and I believe that when the Supplementary Estimate for the additional Agricultural Grant, which we propose to make this year, comes before the House with the necessary Bill, we will be in a position to make a <Col N="333" /> full statement as to how we propose to deal with the situation.</P>

      <P>The original grant, the sum voted here, and the new grant of £250,000 will bring the total up to something like £2,200,000.  Has the Minister any idea of how much of the £2,200,000 Agricultural Grant the councils are likely to receive this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not able to make a definite statement in that regard for the reason that we recognise that some part of the arrears do possibly, arise out of the present situation, and that some part of the deficiency in respect of the Supplementary Agricultural Grant, which the councils might normally receive, would fall to be made good out of the Emergency Fund.  We are not yet in a position to satisfy ourselves how much of such deficiency should be made good as arising properly out of the emergency.  Unfortunately, owing to a number of statements made in the House and in the country, some people have convinced themselves that they will not be called upon to pay, that they are not bound to pay, and accordingly are not paying.  We will probably have to take measures to disabuse them of that.  Until we have tested the efficacy of these measures we are not in a position to form an opinion for ourselves exactly as to the extent to which failure to pay the annuities which are due, arises out of the present emergency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of the Moneylenders Bill.  It has been through the House in the last Dáil and amended after evidence being taken from the moneylenders themselves, from Government officials, and with the co-operation of the whole House.  The Bill, therefore, through the evidence which appeared in the Press at the time, is familiar in its principle to everybody.  Everyone realises the necessity for it, therefore, and it would be waste of time to go over it again.  The only point I want to draw attention to is the amended rate of interest.  In the Bill as introduced it was 20 per cent.  After careful consideration, that has been changed to 39 per cent., because we found that the usual rate varied from 150 to 200 per cent. at present and, in England, where the standard rate was fixed at 48 per cent. a great many of the moneylenders who were producing the worst effect of the moneylending business were wiped out by reducing the rate to 48 per cent.  We felt, therefore, that 39 per cent. as a maximum fixed rate would be the best thing to introduce into the Bill here.  In the Bill, as originally drafted, the principle was that the 20 per cent. should be a standard but should not be a maximum.  We think it is better to fix a maximum and to make that maximum 39 per cent.  The reason that figure is chosen is because it is easily dealt with in connection with weekly payments.  It is a Committee recommendation and the amendments are all of necessity Committee recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> The issue that was exercising the minds of a great many people on the Committee was whether we should arrange the Bill so as to wipe moneylenders out altogether, but we came to the conclusion that it was better to take the other course for the reason that prohibition generally has the effect of driving people underground. It is better to have it controllable, even though it is recognised as an evil&mdash;and I am afraid, a necessary evil&mdash;than to drive it underground and so prevent the possibility of supervision. In such a case there would be no protection for people in desperate straits, and we think it is better to give them whatever protection we can by allowing moneylenders to become registered.  Another point is that in Ireland we have no charitable institutions such as they have in other countries like Italy, for helping people out of their difficulties.  Until we have such we would not be justified in wiping out the moneylenders entirely, but we are placing them in the position of carrying out a very excellent function for society, if they wish to do so, by helping people in great necessity out of their difficulties, and, at the same time, not encouraging people who want to get a large loan for betting purposes and who do not care what interest they pay.  When this Bill is passed, we hope it will facilitate the Administration in following up moneylenders who do not intend to get registered.  It is difficult for the police to deal with the matter, but we hope that the effect of this Bill, which is now in a form which is largely the result of police investigation and the evidence of District Justices, will be to help them considerably. I anticipate, therefore, that there will be no difficulty in getting the Bill through all its stages, but, being a Private Bill, it would require to be sent to a Special Committee and it would take about a fortnight to deal with it passing through Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was considered in Committee during the existence of the last Dáil, and considered very carefully.  The Committee had a considerable body of evidence <Col N="337" /> before it, and the Bill is a result of the efforts of that Committee to place before the House the best solution it could find of the moneylenders' problem.  I may say the Committee investigated the matter as fully as lay in their power to investigate it.  They received, as Deputy Little informed the House, the most valuable evidence from the Chief Commissioner of the Garda, the Senior District Justice in Dublin and various other witnesses.  Speaking frankly, from my point of view, the impression left upon my mind, as I considered the evidence put before the Committee, was that it did not seem to me that the moneylenders really succeeded in establishing a case for the existence of moneylending in this country at all.  We pressed them very much to show any particular examples that could be given, or any concrete examples that could be given, that any person had been substantially helped, or got out of difficulty once they got into the moneylenders' hands.  And certainly, although we had a great number of moneylenders represented before us, and they put forward the very best cases they could, it seemed to me, at any rate, that there was no real substantial hope of anybody, who got into the hands of moneylenders, ever getting out of their grip.  That was the impression left upon my mind. I certainly would like that the people should know that that was my impression and I think it was, practically, the impression of everybody who was a member of the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly hope it will not get into the public mind that because a Bill is passed, putting 39 per cent. interest as the maximum interest, that now the ordinary man in the street can, as a prudent and cautious man, have dealings with moneylenders.  As I said, the very opposite impression was left upon my mind, and I hope the public will, in as far as I am concerned, and I think as far as the other members of the Committee are concerned, understand that the impression left upon our minds was that nothing more disturbing could happen to a person than to get into moneylenders' hands. I hope they will take the passage of this Bill not as an encouragement to <Col N="338" /> deal with moneylenders, but will take it as the view of a Committee that examined the matter impartially, that nothing more foolish could be done by people than to allow themselves to get into the hands of moneylenders.</P>
    <P>While it is fashionable to talk of a high class of moneylenders and moneylenders not of so high a class, and that one would be perfectly safe in the hands of Mr. Jones but would be hopeless in the hands of Mr. Robinson, no evidence brought before the Committee showed that there was any real or substantial difference between Mr. Jones and Mr. Robinson, and that once the fly gets into the spider's net it does not substantially matter which is the particular spider that spun the net which caught the fly.  While I say all that I do think, at the present moment, it would not be feasible to completely stop moneylending.  I do not think very much for the reason put forward by Deputy Little that that would be completely feasible or possible at present.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that moneylending is an evil&mdash;a very real, serious evil&mdash;which all communities will have to face until such time as common sense gets right down into the understanding of prospective borrowers.  Therefore I do think that the best course we can adopt at the present minute is to pass this measure, letting it be clearly known that we are aware of the evils moneylending is bringing about, and that while we cannot completely abolish it we recognise this Bill as giving a palliative and nothing else except a palliative.  In consequence of this I personally am in favour of the passing of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Committee which sat to consider this Bill I endorse practically everything said by Deputy Little and Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, that this Bill is more or less an attempt to check what we believe to be an evil in our midst and to control it to a certain extent. We do not pretend to say this is going to bring about the desired change that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney wishes for. But we do feel that one element connected with this particular business <Col N="339" /> will be so controlled and checked that it will be no longer profitable to carry it on.  The Committee, representing all sections of the House, approached this matter in the spirit of getting down to business.  There was no distinction of Party, and everybody felt that we were doing these things in the interests of the whole community as legislators should approach the matter.</P>
      <P>Every one of us was impressed by the serious condition that exists in the case of people in the hands of a certain class of moneylenders.  One thing I am glad to see in the Bill is that where a workman's wife, or any man's wife, depending upon him for maintenance, attempts in the future to borrow money, such money will only become legally due if given to the wife with the knowledge and consent of her husband.  That was one of the items upon which much stress was laid, and its adoption, I believe, is a good day's work.  With regard to the general run of the thing, I believe that efforts will be made to continue in the business by moneylenders without being registered, and I hope when this Bill becomes an Act that the appropriate department of State will make it a very unhealthy thing for anyone who tries to carry on moneylending outside the control of the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse what has been said by previous speakers and particularly by Deputy Little, who introduced this Bill.  I suggest that there is no necessity for wasting much time at this stage upon it.  This Bill has already been through an elaborate Committee Stage.  The Committee went to great trouble over it and, as Chairman of the Committee, I confess I received very great assistance from every section and party represented in this House.  Nothing could be fairer, and nothing could be better, than the way in which the Committee helped me through the various stages of that Bill.  It was to me a lesson which I shall not soon forget of how much better business can be done by a small Committee representing all sections of the House in a matter of this sort than <Col N="340" /> it could be dealt with by the whole House.  I may say, and I think Deputies who spoke before me will agree, that before the end of the Committee Stage we arrived at such knowledge that we found no need to go forward another day.</P>
      <P>We tried to come together, and as a result the report of the Moneylenders Bill Committee, which was prepared at a good deal of expense, and cost a good deal of time to various people, is before the House.  It has come before you as a practically unanimous report.  That being so, I would suggest that there is no necessity for any waste of time at this stage.  If there are any amendments they can be put forward on the Committee Stage.  There should be no further time wasted on the Bill at present.  It has cost the country enough already.  We heard at great length representatives of every class who could possibly be affected by it. I would ask the House to give the Bill an unanimous reading, to shorten the discussion, leaving any amendment for a later stage.  There might have to be a few technical amendments&mdash;I think there must be&mdash;when the Bill comes before you at a later stage, but we are only wasting time by discussing it now.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  As Deputies will see, it is a very short and simple Bill.  It is a one clause Bill and I do not anticipate that there will be any serious, or indeed any, attempt to contest the principle in the Bill.  It is the principle that was originally thought out and did in fact underlie the whole scheme of the Hospitals' Trust which we have evidenced within the last two or three years.  A certain number of hospitals were included originally in the scheme and since then there have been a number of additions.  I should like to say that generally speaking the hospitals that came into the scheme originally have discharged their duties and the responsibilities which they took on themselves under the scheme fairly and honourably.  There are some exceptions, and it is well to remember that certain institutions which originally benefitted under the scheme have been very chary about carrying out their obligations in full.  It seems to me that the attitude of certain institutions in connection with the matter has been to obtain all the fruits that they could under the scheme, and to discharge as little of the responsibilities they accepted as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To give emphasis to that it may be necessary to quote instances.  Instances of that kind have been brought under my own notice and I have had to make inquiries with regard to certain institutions that were very tardy about accepting particular cases.  I have before me particulars of a case which deserves to be mentioned in support of the principle which this Bill asks the House to adopt.  I have a letter written by a Dispensary Doctor to the <Col N="342" /> Board of Health for his area.  He says:</P>
    <P>I have here a case (giving the name) who has a cataract of the eye that requires specialist operation. She evidently went to (mentioning a certain Hospital) on her own and brought me back a letter from the Hospital, saying she was to be sent up by the County Board of Health. I have made inquiries from her, and the lady said she could pay £1 per week herself.  She did not want to go to the County Board of Health, and she did not consider herself entitled to Poor Law Relief.  She however could not possibly pay more than £1. I wrote to the Hospital myself, and explained the situation.  I had a letter back saying that unless she was sent in by the County Board she would have to pay the full fee, namely £2 per week.  Now, this is a big question.  Why should this poor woman be made to go to the County Board when she is willing to pay what I consider a reasonable fee herself? It is not fair to the County Board to be made pay for her simply to give the Hospital more money.  I do not think there is need for all this grabbing, especially since the Sweepstake. The poor are catered for by the County Board, but what is to become of a person who has a little means, but who could not possibly pay the full fee?  That is the question I would like answered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Where was that hospital?  In what city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the City of Dublin. That is the question I would like to have answered, too, and that is the question that I am seeking to provide an answer for in this Bill.  The interests of patients who are normally catered for by the Board of Health are protected.  A person who can afford to pay the full fees demanded by a Hospital is quite independent.  I want to seek protection for persons in the country, in towns and in cities who are neither County Board of Health cases nor sufficiently independent financially to enable them to pay Hospital fees.  I brought to a certain Hospital in the City of Cork which recently <Col N="343" /> benefited under this scheme the case of a child of a West Cork farmer. The man concerned would not be entitled to be assisted from the County Board of Health.  He had a farm of fairly substantial valuation, but he has encountered heavy difficulties, financial, domestic and otherwise, for the last nine or ten years.  He found himself quite unable to pay the full fees. He would be willing to make a contribution to the cost of the treatment of the child.  It was a pathetic case deserving the fullest and most generous measure of sympathy.  The hospital in question absolutely refused to take in that case.  That is happening all over the country at the present time.  As I said in the beginning, the principle underlying the whole hospitals scheme was that people not in a position to pay full fees should get the best possible services in the hospitals by reason of the money the hospitals were to receive under this scheme.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that there has been steadily growing up a flagrant disregard for the arrangements entered into by some institutions.  I admit they are very few.  I admit that in the case of other hospitals that have been brought within the confines of the scheme recently that they entirely forgot they had any responsibilities whatever.  It is true that there was no legal responsibility on certain institutions recently included.  I think it is quite fair and equitable, in return for the contributions, for the very generous assistance which such institutions will get through the Sweeps, that they be asked, if they wish to continue in the scheme, if they are prepared to accept responsibility for a certain number of patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether this Bill is capable of amendment in any direction. I do not think so.  It has been suggested to me that some special case might be made for the sanatorias. If that is so, I would like to have the matter discussed, but there ought not to be any objection in this House to the principle underlying this Bill. Because I think no serious objection will be taken to the principle of the Bill, I ask the House to give it a <Col N="344" /> Second Reading.  I feel that no further argument is necessary from me to recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward) Francis Constantine (Dr.) Ward">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position regarding the hospitalisation of this country is undoubtedly unsatisfactory and especially, in so far as accommodation and treatment for the very poor are concerned, for the class of people mentioned by Deputy Murphy in the course of his speech, who are not entitled to free treatment through the poor law institutions and who cannot afford to pay the ordinary maintenance fees in the institutions here in the city. Now it is suggested, and rather freely alleged, that these difficulties have not been lessened to any very great extent as a result of the large allocations that have been made to the voluntary hospitals out of the Sweeps. It is true that before an allocation is made to one of these voluntary hospitals inquiries are made as to the accommodation available for poor patients, and allocations are made on the understanding that 25 per cent, of the beds are available for the poor. Now that appears to be all right until the allocation is actually made, but there appears to be no statutory power to ensure that the 25 per cent. beds that are available before the allocation is made shall continue to be available after the money has been disbursed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that aspect of the situation, it appears to me that we are not taking the very best possible advantage of the wonderful opportunity that we have in this country, arising out of the Sweeps, to secure the best hospitalisation system perhaps in the world.  While I think it will be generally admitted that the Committee of Reference have done excellent work in their examination of the position and the various matters that have been brought to light in connection with it, they have undoubtedly by force of circumstances approached the question not so much from the point of view of the hospital accommodation required by the community as from the point of view of the accommodation that the governors of a particular institution thought they required <Col N="345" /> in order to enable them to carry on.  The result is that we have reached the position where we have a number of hospitals in competition with one another, and proceeding along the same lines of surgical and scientific development.  We are not securing the highly specialised accommodation or equipment that we should like to see as a result of the financial opportunity that has been presented to us.</P>
    <P>We have been giving this matter a considerable amount of thought recently, more especially since the publication of the report of the Committee of Reference.  It is intended to introduce a Government measure&mdash;as a matter of fact it is in draft at the present time&mdash;that will be calculated to secure better results out of the moneys that have been made available. The point that Deputy Murphy intends to cover in this Bill will undoubtedly be included in the more comprehensive measure necessary to deal with this whole situation.  At this stage I do not want to anticipate to any greater extent the terms of the Bill that will be introduced, but I think that in the circumstances Deputy Murphy might postpone the further stages of this Bill for some few weeks until we get an opportunity of introducing our measure, and I think that at that stage the Deputy will be satisfied that what he is aiming at will be adequately covered in the new measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree largely with what the Parliamentary Secretary has said, that the money that is being raised as a result of these Sweeps could have been allocated in a very much better way, and no doubt would have been had anybody visualised at the outset that the Sweepstakes were going to be of the enormous proportions which they have assumed, and if anybody had thought that the vast sums which would be made available by those Sweepstakes would be available for hospital development in the country.  If that had been visualised at the outset, no doubt a very different method of dealing with these very large sums of <Col N="346" /> money would have been adopted.  I know that when the first sweepstake was started there was a very large hope in the minds of some people, taking as they thought, a very sanguine view of the matter, that you might get in between £10,000 and £20,000 as a result of the Sweepstake and have that available for the hospitals. Well, I need hardly say that that hope has not only been realised, but has been realised one might say a hundred, almost a thousand times over.</P>
      <P>If it were known that sums running into millions would be raised by these Sweeps, no doubt the proper course would have been to keep the entire of that money and probably to amalgamate all the existing hospitals in Dublin, not possibly all, but at any rate, to have three or four at the outset absolutely up-to-date hospitals equipped in every way in this city.  That would have been a far better and a more economical way of spending the money, but as I have said nobody has visualised that these large sums would have been raised, and in consequence they had to be dealt with piecemeal. I am afraid that it will be very difficult now, because a great deal of money has been expended, to do more than deal with it not completely piecemeal but in rather a piecemeal fashion. I know it is suggested that certain hospitals in Dublin should amalgamate instead of having two or three small hospitals.  That seems to me, so far as I can gather from those who have expert knowledge on the matter, to be a consummation devoutly to be wished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that something of that nature will be embodied in the new Bill which we are promised.  At any rate, I trust that an effort in that direction will be made.  It was pointed out in a debate in the Seanad by a Senator who is a master in this particular line that in the city of Vienna, which is very much larger than the city of Dublin, there is only one hospital. That obviates the duplication of equipment in a large number of hospitals and other expenses of that nature. That makes for efficiency and economy, and I should like to see carried out as near an approach to amalgamation <Col N="347" /> of hospitals here as is possible.  I do not mean that existing hospitals, which have been very largely improved by this expenditure, should necessarily be scrapped but that the hospitals should be more specialised, one hospital being almost confined to surgical cases and another almost confined to medical cases.  I do not suggest that there should be a hard and fast line in that respect.  I do not believe that that would be possible, but I believe that something in that direction should be done and that these large sums should be made available, so that Dublin would have the best hospital system in the world, as it has, undoubtedly, got the largest amount of money for hospital purposes of any city of its size.  The same remark applies to Cork because, in proportion to size, Cork has received a larger sum from the Sweepstakes than Dublin has received.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary, in the absence of the Minister for Justice to consider certain points in Section 2, which is the keynote of Deputy Murphy's Bill. Certain hospitals cannot provide the accommodation required under Section 2.  It was for that reason that certain institutions, such as the Eye and Ear Hospital, the Consumptive Home, the Cabra Institutes and certain other institutions of that type had to be specially mentioned.  It would be impossible for them to provide accommodation at the rate suggested here.</P>
    <P>I find very grave difficulty in discovering how a provision of this nature could be carried out.  How long is it to be carried out, and what are the methods by which it is to be carried out?  A hospital board may say to the Minister for Justice: &ldquo;Yes, we shall provide a certain number of beds.&rdquo;  What machinery are you going to have, five years or ten years from now, when the Sweepstakes have ceased to be, to see that that undertaking is being carried out and, if it is not being carried out, what punishment are you going to inflict upon the offending hospital for failing to keep its engagement?  A great deal of the money will have been expended <Col N="348" /> and it will be almost impossible to get it back.  I see very grave difficulty in making this an effective and workable measure.</P>
    <P>I am entirely in favour of the principle of Deputy Murphy's Bill. During the debates on one of these Hospital Bills&mdash;I do not know whether it was the main Bill or one of the amending Bills&mdash;I expressed the hope that when the hospitals had received very large sums of money, when the hospitals which were struggling had become wealthy institutions, they would be in a position to deal with the cases of the poor in a way in which they could not deal with the poor before they had received these sums of money. It may not, at present, be quite right to condemn a particular hospital for not acting precisely in the way one would like to see it act and in which that hospital, without any legislation, may, on its own initiative, act two or three years from now, when it has carried out the improvements which it intends to carry out and when it has invested the moneys, finally and completely allocated from Sweepstakes, for the purpose of its maintenance.  I still take the optimistic view.  I still think that the hospitals and the boards controlling them are philanthropic, that they are not out to make money, that they are out to make ends meet, and that if they cannot make ends meet without receiving payment from patients, then they have to receive payment.  I believe that as soon as they can make ends meet without receiving contributions from poor persons or struggling persons, they will cease to levy these contributions. It is not only the class of persons referred to by Deputy Murphy that is affected in this connection. There is another class which is, perhaps, harder hit.  I mean the clerical class who cannot receive public assistance and who find it very hard indeed to make ends meet.  When a member of that class has to go to hospital he is crushed down by the weight of the cost of treatment.  That section of the middle class is really in as much need of free treatment or treatment at very moderate cost as any other class.  I believe that that will be recognised by <Col N="349" /> the boards of the hospitals, and that when they are enriched an effort will be made to help not merely the poor but the struggling middle class by providing treatment free or at very moderate cost.</P>
    <P>I have not the remotest idea of what hospital Deputy Murphy is referring to, but before he completely condemns that hospital I would ask him to ascertain what position it is in&mdash;how much money it has received and how much of that money it has had to spend on necessary improvements, because I believe that some of the Dublin hospitals were in a most shocking condition.  Some of them had no baths for their patients.  That was true of even one very large Dublin hospital.  They were in a shocking state as regards equipment and they had to put money, in the first instance, into alterations of that type, which while they made them better hospitals did not place them in a better position to deal with the poor.  I hold no brief for any hospital committee and I am not a member of any hospital committee, but I would ask Deputy Murphy and others not to condemn any hospital hastily.  They may have a very good answer in their balance sheet to the case made against them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputies on every side of the House will congratulate those charged with the administration of this fund, and particularly the Parliamentary Secretary, for the manner in which it is being administered. Those associated with public boards and members of hospital committees appreciate very much the very marked change which has taken place in the administration of hospital treatment for the poor in voluntary hospitals.  I should also like to emphasise the improvement which has taken place in the medical and surgical services under the various boards of assistance and the hospitals administered by them.  It is not so very long ago since very poor patients were continually refused admittance to institutions of a voluntary character. These patients were compelled to go to the poor law hospitals, which were not exactly ideal and did not by any <Col N="350" /> means appeal to the people who had to go to them for treatment, because these institutions were administered on principles of very rigid economy, and it is even questionable if the treatment given was by any means such as those who sympathise with the poor would desire and such as they have in institutions like the South and North Infirmary.  We must admit that the contributions which have been made from the Public Charitable Hospitals Sweepstake Fund have been an enormous boon and have certainly brought sunshine into the lives of those who have to lie on a bed of sickness and pain.  If there is anything that Deputies can congratulate themselves upon it is upon having brought into existence this fund out of which a great many contributions have been made.</P>
      <P>One matter that the Parliamentary Secretary will remember my having brought to his notice was the provision of a country hospital for the North Cork area.  Anybody who has visited Mallow Hospital and who has seen the conditions which prevail there, must realise what an enormous boon has been conferred and what a reform has been brought about in the administration of the poor law services by the provision of a grant for that hospital. I certainly thank the Parliamentary Secretary on behalf of the North Cork Board for his help in bringing about such a remarkable change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a few years' time, when these various hospitals have been built, they will be a lasting monument to the efforts that have been made by those representing the people to provide institutions for their welfare.  A deputation from the South Cork Board recently visited the Parliamentary Secretary, and the grants which he has given to Midleton, Youghal and Cork certainly are very much appreciated by the people of these areas and they are very grateful for the assistance he has given.  The members of the deputation which went to the Parliamentary Secretary have reason to congratulate themselves upon their powers of persuasion. Even though we may not always agree with everything that the members of <Col N="351" /> that deputation say, still they have done good work for the poor in bringing to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary the disabilities under which the poor labour in those particular areas.</P>
    <P>I should like to say, however, that there are hospitals of a voluntary kind which have not extended to the poor the same consideration that has been shown by such hospitals as the North and South Infirmary.  We have very considerable difficulty in getting deserving cases into these hospitals.  I might remind the House that there is in the South Infirmary an opthalmic department presided over by one whose name is known through the length and breadth of the Free State, a young surgeon who has undoubtedly made a name for himself, which is extending every day.  It certainly is an enormous tribute to the medical profession in Cork that some of the most difficult cases have to be sent to the City of Cork from very remote areas outside the county.  I was not able to follow the last speaker in his claim that only Dublin hospitals should treat these specialised cases, because although we pay a high tribute to Dublin, the City of Cork is the second city in the Free State.</P>

      <P>At any rate, I have to pay a very high tribute to those who have charge of this fund for the good work they are doing.  The improvements which have been brought about in the hospitals will be of great educational value to the students. There are now facilities provided in <Col N="352" /> Cork for treating cases which might otherwise have to come to Dublin.  In the county hospitals also X-Ray and other forms of treatment of a highlyspecialised character are now provided, and they would not be available if the fund were not in existence.  I sincerely hope that if any grants are going to be given to hospitals not receiving them at present those in charge of the distribution will see that these hospitals will receive poor patients.</P>

      <P>I should like to dwell on one feature of the Bill in particular. Last year a Bill was introduced here to include certain hospitals in the Sweepstakes grants.  The Bill was introduced, I think, by Deputy Anthony. From enquiries I have made since I find that these hospitals are refusing to receive poor patients, although they have got grants from the Sweepstakes Fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the condition of the Midleton Hospital was a disgrace&mdash;that is the least I can say of it.  On behalf of the South Cork Board, I wish to express appreciation of the manner in which the Parliamentary Secretary met us by providing us with decent hospital accommodation throughout the South Cork Board area.  I would be very anxious to know from those who previously included certain hospitals in the Bill they introduced if these hospitals are now receiving poor patients.  I should like to hear from them whether they will continue to support the inclusion of these hospitals.  As far as Cork City is concerned, which is the centre of our hospital treatment for the South, it is entitled to at least equal treatment with Dublin.  I think Dublin has already got its share or more than its <Col N="353" /> share of the proceeds of the Sweepstakes, and it is about time that Cork got its turn.  While I appreciate Deputy Anthony's proposals in that light, still I think it is unfair for any hospital that has received financial benefit from the Sweepstakes to turn away any poor persons just because they could not pay.  It is an outrageous thing, but unfortunately it has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We are sick of this talk about there being no room.  It is very easy for any hospital when a poor man seeks admittance to say, &ldquo;We have no room.&rdquo;  Any hospital that is financed out of the Sweepstakes should certainly make provision for the poor, including any specialised treatment that may be necessary.  I am sure that Deputy Brasier, even though he represents the aristocratic classes, has at least sufficient sympathy for the poor not to defend the action of hospitals that refuse to accept patients because they are poor. It would be wrong of him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am supporting this Bill and I accept the assurance given by the Parliamentary Secretary that he will, at a later stage, introduce a measure which will meet the points not covered by Deputy Murphy's Bill. I think Deputy Murphy has also accepted the Parliamentary Secretary's statement.  In order to correct any misconception that may exist in Deputy Corry's mind, or in the minds of any poor persons in his constituency, I want to point out that the Deputy has built up a case on a false thesis.  It is absolutely untrue to say that the hospital he has in mind at the moment has received up to now one penny piece from the Hospitals' Trust Fund.  A case has been made here against a hospital which has not received one penny of that money. The hospital was included amongst those that will benefit in the last Sweep, but that does not mean that <Col N="354" /> it has received any money.  In due time, I expect, that hospital will receive its share of the money that has accrued by way of Sweepstakes.</P>
      <P>I hope Deputy Corry is re-assured on that point.  It will be time to raise the point as to whether a poor or an indigent person has been refused admission or treatment when this particular hospital receives its share of the Sweepstakes money.  The position of this little hospital should be properly understood.  It is a very small institution and the management asked to have the hospital included in the last Sweepstakes in order that they might be able to cope with the type of patient that Deputy Corry and Deputy Murphy seek to help.  According to the last published returns this hospital treated, during the year, 4,215 persons free.  That was the number of free extern patients.  The number of intern patients treated during that period was 817 and the number of persons who attended at the extern department for free treatment was 11,291.  These are the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Where did the Deputy get his figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give them to Deputy Corry with pleasure.  They are the result of an examination of the books of the hospital.  They are figures that were given to me by one of the most eminent surgeons in this particular branch of surgery.  I am sure that will be adequately recognised by the Parliamentary Secretary, Dr. Ward.  The institution has been maintained for a number of years very largely by public bodies sending paying patients.  There appears to be a lot of confusion of thought on this matter.  It is very easy to indict the Board of Management administering the affairs of a hospital because one or two persons may have suffered some hardship.  I have had considerable experience as a member of a Board of Management and my experience goes to show that no matter how we may like to conceal it&mdash;it is not a very popular thing and certainly cannot be construed as appealing to the gallery &mdash;the fact remains that there are many persons who can well afford to pay <Col N="355" /> for treatment who, when they enter the portals of a hospital, try to get out of payment by every means in their power.  There are many cases where wealthy people enter a hospital and immediately put on the poor mouth when asked to pay the very moderate fees charged.  Cases like that are known to every one of us and we could refer to them if we possessed the ordinary courage to say what we really feel about the matter. I know cases in which well-to-do farmers went into these institutions and when asked about their means or capacity to pay they told lies, misrepresented their whole state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy already said there were no well-to-do farmers now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to questions they said they had just a few acres of land and a couple of cows.  When investigations were made it was found they had 200 or 300 acres of land and many cows.  The hospital authorities are often blamed for refusing to treat poor people, whereas the contrary is really the case.  Ample evidence in this regard has been given by the hospitals who have sought permission to be brought in under the Sweepstakes system.  In nearly all these cases the hospitals were in a bad financial condition.  One or two hospitals in Dublin were on the point of closing down.  These were the arguments used on the introduction of the original legislation in this House. I am aware that nearly all the hospitals in Cork City were considerably in debt.  That debt has been to a large extent removed.  It cannot be forgotten that voluntary subscriptions have fallen away to a considerable extent.  In many cases now there are no voluntary subscriptions, although they were forthcoming fairly well some time ago.  It would be well to bear in mind that in the majority of cases if the money realised by way of sweepstakes and already allocated to hospitals were invested at 5 per cent. the amount accruing therefrom would <Col N="356" /> not be sufficient to maintain these hospitals for more than three or five years at the outset.  The sums allocated to different hospitals may appear huge.  A sum of £30,000 may appear very large, but relatively it is a small sum when one considers the cost of maintaining a patient for one, two, three or four weeks.  In most of these hospitals the greater number of patients do not pay.  It is very easy to seize on a single case of hardship or on two or three cases and condemn the whole hospital system.</P>
      <P>As regards the cases referred to by Deputy Corry and Deputy Murphy, I will repeat that this hospital has not received one penny yet from the sweepstakes.  In due time, of course, it will receive its share, and then that institution will be able to extend its operations.  The intention is to have an extension of the building with a view to accommodating more patients. If any money is left they will be able to give free treatment to a bigger number of persons in the institution. Extra buildings are required for nurses and for surgical and medical purposes.  I am sure every effort will be made to meet the points brought forward by Deputy Murphy.  None of us will stand for anything that will tend to inflict hardship on the poor, but at least we might approach this matter with an unbiassed mind.  We should not condemn one hospital or all the hospitals because of one or two isolated cases of hardship.  Any person conversant with the working of hospitals must admit that from time to time cases of hardship will arise. A very deserving case may be turned down perhaps for want of accommodation. That is the case very often. Deputy Corry said that he was sick and tired of listening to want of accommodation in the hospitals when it is a case of accommodating a patient. Well, surely if there is only accommodation for 100 patients one cannot put 200 patients into that accommodation unless two patients are put into the one bed.  In this matter the hospitals must cut their cloth according to the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had not intended saying so much were it not for the statement made by <Col N="357" /> Deputy Corry that the hospitals in Cork had already received money from the Sweepstakes Fund.  That is not so.  The hospitals in Cork treat 4,000 persons annually free.  In a great many cases about admission to the wards referred to by Deputy Murphy there arises some hardship. This is so in Dublin and there may possibly be cases in Cork also about which Deputy Murphy knows.  I know that Deputy Murphy is a very humane representative, as humane as any representative in this House, but I want to make the explanation I have made in reply to the remarks of Deputy Corry fearing that the Minister or Parliamentary Secretary may think that the Cork hospitals have received Sweepstakes money.  They have not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesKeogh" hpid="Dr. Myles Keogh Dr. Myles Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Myles Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>On general principles, none of us has any objection to Deputy Murphy's Bill.  I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary has promised to supply us with further information. That knowledge will possibly assist us in carrying on the work of the hospitals to his satisfaction. If so I expect the suggestion will be accepted and Deputy Murphy will wait until the Parliamentary Secretary brings in his new Bill.</P>
      <P>There are ten clinical hospitals in Dublin, and I have the privilege of serving on the Committees of Management of five of these clinical hospitals.  I have never known of a case where a poor person was refused admission to one of these hospitals when his case was a deserving one and was a case for hospital treatment. Sometimes cases come to the hospitals and the staffs do not consider it necessary to take them in for treatment. They get extern treatment. Some of these people afterwards complain when they go home.  Treating such cases in the hospitals instead of giving them extern treatment may not be necessary for the patients.  I cannot speak of what is done by the Cork hospitals, but I am satisfied the staff of the Cork hospitals do the best they can for all the patients who apply to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Anthony spoke about the impossibility of accommodating 200 <Col N="358" /> patients when there are beds only for 100.  Personally I know that in the Dublin hospitals with which I am connected every available space in the hospital is used when there is a demand by people requiring hospital attendance.  I have known cases where the corridors and every available floor space have been availed of to accommodate patients.</P>
    <P>I have risen mainly to protest against the statement that Dublin hospitals are callous in their treatment of poor patients.  That is not so. The poor are treated in the Dublin hospitals with every consideration.</P>

      <P>I appreciate very much indeed the manner in which the Bill has been received in the House.  I feel that my task in this connection has been considerably lightened if it has not altogether disappeared by the statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  The method suggested by the Parliamentary Secretary is clearly the best one of dealing not alone with the problems raised by this Bill, but with many other aspects of the whole position.  There was, for instance, the matter raised by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney as to the liability of the hospitals in five or ten years hence.  That and other matters could not be covered by a Bill of this kind. I would not feel competent to deal with the other aspects of the whole matter that would arise in the manner that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite content if the House will agree to the Second Reading and then postpone the remaining Stages to any time that is desired.  Before the debate concludes I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he is in a position to give an undertaking that pending the introduction of his measure no further payment will be made, because I want to safeguard and preserve as far as possible the principle of the Bill. I quite appreciate, as I have always appreciated Deputy Anthony's position in this matter.  This Bill is in no way a disapproval or an attempt to disagree with his attitude.  I am very <Col N="359" /> much afraid, however, that the information the Deputy has given the House in connection with the facilities in particular hospitals is not accurate.</P>
    <P>The information I got about certain hospitals was what largely influenced me in bringing forward this Bill.  In the particular hospital to which Deputy Anthony referred I must say that the information given was that they had no free beds, and that they had no intention of providing free beds. I found after weeks of subterfuge and excuses that the hospital authorities had clearly no intention of providing these beds.  They have no such intention at the present time, nor do they intend to provide them in the future.  In their own words, they do not intend to provide any accommodation of that kind, yet they hold out their hands and they are willing to accept money.  That is a principle that could not be defended, and I know very well that Deputy Anthony would not desire that it should be defended.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, this matter can be best dealt with by the Department of Local Government.  A comprehensive Bill dealing with the very many other aspects of the hospital problem will easily be the best method of dealing with the situation.  I now ask the House to agree to the principle of the Bill, and I ask that the further Stages be postponed pending the introduction of the Bill by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Murphy only raised one question that would call for an answer.  That was the question of the further payments out of the Sweepstake Funds already in hands. I may say in that connection that it is not intended to make any further disbursements until the entire situation has been examined.  I may state that it is intended in the new situation to set up an Hospitals Commission to review the hospital problem in the Saorstát and to make representations to the Government as to the manner and amount of the allocations to be made in the future.  I would like to feel that I could agree with Deputy Dr. Myles Keogh in the point that he has <Col N="360" /> made with regard to the ease with which it is possible to get accommodation in the Dublin hospitals for poor people.  My own personal experience has been the experience of Deputy Murphy.  I find it almost impossible to get a patient into a Dublin hospital at the present time unless somebody is going to pay.</P>

      <P>Might I make a slight personal explanation?  It is in answer to Deputy Murphy's suggestion that this hospital I had in mind was not giving free beds.  A letter dated 24th October to the persons in charge of the Sweep at Dame Street, addressed Lannigan O'Keeffe, pointed out that this is a renewed application and goes on to say: &ldquo;You may remember early in the year a request was made for inclusion amongst the recipients of the fund, but it was then decided that the hospital was not strictly charitable under <Col N="361" /> the terms originally laid down regarding qualifications for participation. Since then I believe these terms have been somewhat modified with regard to certain hospitals at the discretion of the Minister for Justice, and among others the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital was admitted as a beneficiary. It would therefore follow that if this hospital was admitted as a beneficiary it must have complied with all conditions laid down in the Act, and I take it one of these conditions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move: That the Dáil is of opinion that a committee should be appointed by the Executive Council to inquire into and report on claims:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  arising out of the billeting of Volunteers and members of flying columns during the period 1916 to 31st December, 1921, and for moneys claimed to be due in respect of food, clothing and transport, including petrol, provided for such Volunteers or members of flying columns by merchants and traders during the said period;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  for arms, ammunition, and bicycles voluntarily surrendered <Col N="362" /> during the said period by householders and others;</P>
    <P>(c)  in respect of the granting of adequate compensation to the parents or partial dependents of officers, section commanders and Volunteers who were killed on active service or who died as a result of illness contracted on active service during the period 1916 to 31st December, 1921;</P>
    <P>(d)  in respect of the granting of adequate compensation to the parents or partial dependents of officers N.C.O.'s and men of the National Army or Defence Forces who were killed or died as a result of illness arising out of active service in the years 1922 and 1923.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Government that it is not my intention to move any contentious matter, and that, were the present Government on these benches and the people who are on these benches on the others, this motion would be moved at this particular time.  Moving it under those circumstances when my late colleagues were occupying the Government Benches it could not be taken that I was moving something for the purpose of moving, but simply because there is an absolute necessity. Now at very many times during the past two years and previous to that some little bit I found very grave hardships, and found people suffering from great hardships because of something that was not done, and that was the giving to them of recognition or giving them compensation for the hardships they underwent in 1920 and 1921 in particular.  I do not intend to make a very long speech except to explain each of the sections, and then having done so to give an estimate of the probable cost to the country and to the State.  It may be argued that the sum I will mention is much too large, but I want to point out the larger the sum is maintained to be, the more imperative it is that it should be paid because you are having a small number of people bearing this burden which I feel the State should not insist on their bearing.  Now in connection with the billeting of Volunteers <Col N="363" /> and members of the Flying Column from the periods mentioned, and for food clothing and transport and everything like that, in the counties where the struggle was hardest you will find that these counties were generally the poorer counties, and in most cases where food and shelter were given it was the poorer people and poorer farmers who really gave it and you found the small farmer who found it very hard to exist being suddenly called upon to give food and shelter to anything from five to thirty of a column for perhaps one, two or three days a week, and that even perhaps six or seven times in a month or two.  You will see, therefore, a debt was incurred by that poor farmer that he has never since been able to rise out of and because he gave it voluntarily and because it was not seized there was no means by which any of the previous Acts could give him redress.</P>
    <P>Now in that, there are very grave hardships amongst these people and my appeal to the House is that they should be dealt with in the most sympathetic way possible.  The same thing applies for arms and ammunition and those things voluntarily surrendered. Section (b).  Again for some reason I do not know, under the Indemnity Act it was possible for persons from whom arms were taken to get compensation, that is provided they were suing the individual officer who was taking them or something like that, but if they surrendered them voluntarily they could not either get them back or get paid for them. Again I think that is something that should be really remedied and remedied very quickly.</P>
    <P>Now we come to Section (c), and this is, I admit, a most difficult section to deal with adequately, because it is a question of dependency and it is very hard to prove dependency.  If the parents have a small farm or a small business or something like that it is immediately argued that those parents were not solely dependent on that dead officer, N.C.O., or man. Now I want to make the case that the <Col N="364" /> fact of the father or mother having a son killed is sufficient.  Whether that son is an only son or one of six does not make any difference.  The fact that they have a son killed should mean that recognition in a very definite form would be given.  I know for a fact that there are people whose relatives were killed in that struggle, that there were mothers who lost sons and who have never received one penny of compensation and I feel that this is a condition of affairs that should not obtain&mdash;it is a thing that we should change.  The same thing applies under Section (d) to the officers, N.C.O.s, and men of the National Army.  Section (c) of course relates to the pre-Truce people and then (d) is post-Truce, and in that case it is also a question of dependency. What I want the House to agree to, and what I want the Executive Council to do is to appoint a Commission or appoint a committee&mdash;one more will not make any great difference I suppose&mdash;to inquire into the matter and report to the House.  I have gone fairly seriously into the probable cost of the whole four sections, and after careful examination by many people I estimate that the total cost to the State would be about half a million, or, to be correct, £540,000&mdash;slightly over half a million.  That is, for the Twenty-Six Counties.  The numbers are not very great, and I argue that it is too much to ask that section of the people to bear that load.  The more the Government resists on the question of cost, the more they make that sum, the more imperative, I argue, it is to give that compensation and relief. Now I do not know what the Government's intentions are in the matter, but I do want to assure them that this motion is one that would come at the earliest possible moment that I could bring it, and that is after the last general election, and that no matter who forms the Government this motion is coming, and I can assure you that I can produce reports of speeches I made at various times since 1929, when I came into political life, and that since then I have found those hardships, and since then only could I take the necessary steps <Col N="365" /> in having this particular motion brought before the House.  I do not know that I should go any deeper into the matter.  I could talk on it for a considerable length of time, but I do not think it is going to help.  Most people on the Government Benches, and most people on these benches, know of these facts, know of the situation I have put up, and know that it is true, and therefore it is only a question of whether they are prepared to meet the demand or not.  I move the motion and I beg the House to deal generously with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that this motion which has been down on the Order Paper since before the last session of the Dáil was concluded would possibly not have appeared there if Deputy MacEoin was aware of the intentions of the Government in regard to a number of matters which have been raised by it, because I am perfectly certain that quite a large number of the cases of hardship which the motion is intended to remedy will be dealt with by legislation which we hope to introduce shortly and which will deal particularly with those cases where compensation is refused because of the effect of Sections 9 and 15 of the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923.  It will be remembered that in the case of damage to property under the Act of 1923-26, Section 9 definitely prohibited, I think, the Minister from paying compensation in the case of damage where those involved were proved to the satisfaction of the judge to be members of or helpers of or active sympathisers with any organisation engaged in armed opposition to the late Provisional Government of Ireland or the Government of Saorstát Eireann.  And while Section 15, sub-section (9), paragraph (a), sub-paragraph (2), provided that in the case of claims for goods taken away a report could be made only when they were taken without the consent of the owner, and it was the invariable practice, <Col N="366" /> I think, of the late Government to interpret that particular section in such a way that where a person was thought to have been or to be a sympathiser with the Republican side in the civil war compensation was withheld particularly for goods taken away.</P>
      <P>In addition to that, apart altogether from the effect of those two provisions in the Compensation Act of 1923, there was the fact that owing to the political feeling which existed at the time a considerable number of persons who might have had sustainable claims under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923, and under the Indemnity Act of 1924 refrained from making such claims or from pressing them.  We hope at an early date to introduce legislation which will cover all property losses in the period from 21st January, 1919, to 12th May, 1923, in which (1) a claim was not made to the Compensation (Ireland) Commission, (2) a claim in respect of goods taken was disallowed by the Compensation (Ireland) Commission, (3) a claim was not made under the 1923 Act, (4) a claim was made under the 1923 Act but was dismissed by the court on political grounds, and (5) a claim was not made under the Indemnity Act of 1924.  That will give us statutory powers to deal with a large number of claims for damage to property, and for goods taken, which were ruled out under previous Acts, and which, apart altogether from the fact that they might have been statute barred, were not pressed by the persons for political reasons. The fact that this legislation is in contemplation will dispose very largely of the claims under the heads set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Deputy MacEoin's motion.  With regard to (c) and (d), a good deal has been done under the previous Wound Pensions Acts of 1923 and 1927, and a good deal more will be done under the Pensions Bill introduced by the Minister for Defence last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not quite sure, and Deputy MacEoin, in proposing his motion, did not show how far the existing Pension Acts and the new <Col N="367" /> Pensions Bill failed to provide for the claims which would arise under paragraphs (c) and (d).  I think that what was really in Deputy MacEoin's mind is fully covered by the existing legislation and by the proposed legislation. I take it that where he speaks of granting adequate compensation to the parents or partial dependents of officers, he means such compensation as would recoup them for their loss in cases in which they were dependent on the Volunteers or the officers and men of the National Army who may have been killed.  I do not think that he put forward the proposition&mdash;I would be surprised if he put it forward&mdash;that, irrespective of whether the people to be compensated were dependent on the deceased or not, they should be paid for the death of their son.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind always that the I.R.A. was a purely volunteer organisation, and that the sacrifices which those who enrolled in it made, whether of time, of property, or of life, were purely voluntary ones, and that when they enrolled in that Army, there never was any suggestion and they never had in mind or had any thought that they would receive compensation for the services which they offered or for the risks which they ran purely as a patriotic duty, I think that the utmost the State could be asked in this case, and, in the case of those who enrolled later as regular soldiers in the Army of the Saorstát, would be that their dependents should not be left entirely unprovided for.  And I think that adequate provision in that regard has been made, at least, such provision as the State, taking into consideration its financial position, could fairly make, having regard to its duty to the general body of the citizens.</P>
    <P>With regard to paragraph (a) of the motion, in which he asks that a Committee should inquire into and report on claims arising out of the billeting of Volunteers or members of Flying Columns during the period 1916 to 31st December, 1921, and for moneys claimed to be due in respect of food, clothing and transport, including petrol, provided for such Volunteers or <Col N="368" /> members of Flying Columns by merchants and traders during the said period, the first observation I have to make is that the Deputy has not been too precise in delimiting the time in respect of which claims may be made. As it stands, it might be the beginning of 1916, it might be the 1st January, 1916, or it might be the end of 1916&mdash; 31st December, 1916&mdash;or it might be some other date in between.  But assuming that it is the period of Easter Week&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is that, I would like to point out that he is going back very much further than was ever contemplated before.  Hitherto, in all legislation, and for very sound and historic reasons, the 21st January, 1919, has been taken as the date from which any liability in respect of the conflict between Great Britain and this country might be said to run.  I cannot see any very good reason for going outside that date.  As a matter of fact, I think that, after the Insurrection of 1916 there was comparatively little martial activity throughout the country until the establishment of the First Dáil.  There were one or two incidents which were very significant and, no doubt, by reason of the fact that they did blaze the trail, might be regarded as important. But I do not think that, bearing in mind all the circumstances of the period, we would be justified in considering any event anterior to the 21st January, 1919, and, in that connection, it has got to be remembered that private generosity and private patriotism did provide in a considerable measure for the alleviation of hardships arising out of the 1916 Insurrection.  We had the National Dependents' Fund, which disbursed large sums of money.  We had during that period also many voluntary efforts made to raise money and, in addition to that, we had the general economic circumstances of the country. We all know that between 1916 and 1919 we were going through a boom period, when money was <Col N="369" /> very much easier to get, and I believe that, consequently, sacrifices were very much less than they would appear to be if they were measured in terms of the monetary values of to-day.</P>
      <P>I do not see how we could possibly, at this period, assess the real value of claims which might arise out of the period Easter Week 1916 to the 20th January 1919, even if I felt that there was&mdash;and I do not feel that there is&mdash; any obligation upon the State to deal with these claims.  With regard to the period from the 21st January 1919 to the 11th July 1919, I think the Indemnity Act of 1924&mdash;except in the case of those individuals who for political reasons felt themselves precluded from going before the Committee set up under that Act&mdash;dealt with this class of claim, and I am advised that in every case in which compensation was asked for arms and ammunition, vehicles, and means of transport surrendered or given to the I.R.A. in the period 1919 to 1921, the Committee set up recommended that compensation should be made in every case in which a claim for compensation was properly sustained before the Committee.  I am quite willing to admit that there was a large number of claims which, for political reasons, never came before that Committee.  In the legislation we hope to introduce at an early stage, we are going to give the people who refused to press their claims for this reason an opportunity of submitting them to another tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with what I have just said regarding claims for arms and ammunition put before the Indemnity Committee I would like to say that over £80,000 was paid in respect of such claims, so that the number and the ambit of them was very considerable. Certainly, so far as arms, ammunition and bicycles are concerned, I should say that sum covered, at any rate, every really sustainable claim that could be made to the Committee. With that feeling in my mind, and with every sympathy for the position that those who served as Volunteers during that period may find themselves <Col N="370" /> in now, I cannot leave out of consideration&mdash;and the House cannot&mdash;the fact that those services, and in many cases the equipment surrendered were given purely voluntarily, and because the people felt it incumbent upon them as patriots to act as they did.</P>
    <P>I do not see how we can depart from the voluntary principle in this matter.  Thirteen years after the event, when there is possibly no machinery for judging the circumstances under which the goods or arms might have been given to Volunteer officers or to Volunteers as individuals I do not see how, except as a result of a very strict judicial investigation&mdash;and even then, I must confess I cannot see any process which would carry conviction&mdash;we could determine whether these arms were voluntarily surrendered, or whether they were taken because those who held them were thought to be hostile to the objects of the Republican Army at that time.  In any event, if there is any remnant of just claims still remaining unconsidered they will fall to be dealt with by the tribunals which will be set up under the legislation we hope to introduce in the House at an early date.</P>
    <P>I think only one problem remains to be considered, and that is the problem of billeting.  What I have stated in regard to the voluntary nature of services rendered must, to some extent, apply to billeting.  At any rate there is one thing in regard to that problem, that during 1924, when claims under this head might have been more reasonably considered, and more accurately investigated, and when a good deal of evidence in relation to them might be available which is not available now, the Dáil, in setting up the Committee under the Indemnity Act, directed that &ldquo;in assessing compensation the Committee should not take into consideration any loss or damage arising from the billeting or quartering of troops.  What the Dáil could not find it possible to do in 1924, when the machinery which was investigating claims of this sort might have operated with much greater efficiency than it could to-day, eight years later, when financial <Col N="371" /> circumstances and the general economic conditions of the State were better than they are to-day, I do not see how any Government could now accept responsibility for claims <Col N="372" /> regarding billeting.  I move the adjournment.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 2 p.m. until Wednesday, October 26th, at 3 p.m.</P>
