    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state, with regard to the requests or representations as to information about or discussions on matters likely to arise at Ottawa stated to have been made to the British Government by the High Commissioner, (a) if the High Commissioner suggested discussion on any occasion since April 20th, and, if so, how often and with what result; and (b) if the High Commissioner requested information on any occasion since April 20th, and, if so, how often and with what result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (The President) Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The President)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information sought for by the Deputy relates to communication between this Government and another Government.  The giving of such precise details as the Deputy requires concerning the actions of a particular civil servant in relation to such communications could hardly serve the general interests of the State or the efficient working of the Department of External Affairs.  The Deputy will have to be satisfied with the information that no change has taken place in <Col N="2" /> the situation described in my answer to his question of the 25th May relating to the same subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask any question about what a civil servant may have done.  My previous question, to which this question is really supplemental, as requested by the Vice-President, related to requests made on behalf of the Free State Government and reference to a civil servant did not enter into it at all.  I am asking now with regard to the High Commissioner on behalf of the Free State Government; I am asking as to whether or not certain requests were made since 20th April.  I have not got an answer and I would like to have an answer.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not a copy of the reply then given to the Deputy, but I saw it before it was given to the Vice-President, and it seemed to me completely to cover the grounds set out in the Deputy's question.  It certainly embodied all the information at our disposal or that we thought it necessary to give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>To take one part of my question, I have asked whether or <Col N="3" /> not discussions were suggested on any occasion since 20th April and no answer has been returned to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated, I have not the last day's reply.  So far as I know, a long list of the dates on which communications took place from January to 18th April was the foundation of that reply.  I think the reply covered all these points.  It indicated in general terms that in January there were communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not stated in any reply to me up to date; there was no statement as to communications made.  I hope the Vice-President will corroborate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply on the last occasion&mdash;I have just received it&mdash;was as follows:</P>
      <P>No exchange of views has taken place between the Saorstát and British Governments on the questions which might come up for discussion at Ottawa.  We understand that our position in this respect is not different from that of at least two other States of the Commonwealth.  The High Commissioner asked for information or suggested discussion on five distinct occasions between the beginning of January and the middle of the present month.  He received certain documents relating to the trade between these two countries on the 18th April.  Further information was promised.  It must be remembered, however, that the agenda for the Conference was not circulated by the Canadian Government until yesterday, and without the agenda discussions could hardly be expected to yield concrete results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked for information as to the occasions upon which discussion was suggested.  That was the only point about which I was concerned and it was the only point to which a reply was relevant.  The rest was pure irrelevancy.  The Vice-President asked me to put down a question for some day when the President would be here, as he was not so familiar with the details.  I have now asked if the <Col N="4" /> High Commissioner suggested discussion on any occasion since April 20th, and, if so, how often and with what result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given to the Deputy the only reply I have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the circumstances, I intend to raise this matter on the motion for the adjournment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy set a very good headline on a previous occasion and I intend to follow it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the President be a little more precise as to what he means?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to discuss this matter any further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that within the past six months substantial increases in salary have been granted to certain higher officials of the Dublin Corporation following the passing of the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930; if he is also aware that the work of the lower officials has increased without any corresponding increase in their remuneration, and if in view of this fact he will state on what grounds this increased remuneration of the higher officials was sanctioned and whether sanction for similar increases in the case of the lower staff came before his Department, and, if so, with what result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that some officials of the Corporation have been granted increases of salary, based on increased duties and responsibilities consequent on the passing of the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930.  I am not aware that there has been any general increase in the duties which fall to be performed by members of the junior <Col N="5" /> staff, which has been considerably augmented by the absorption of officers of the abolished bodies.  No application for sanction to increased remuneration of the lower grades generally has been made to my Department, although some junior officials have received increased remuneration.</P>

Scott and Co., Ltd., MacCurtain Street, Cork, is being held in bond for the payment of a customs duty at the ad valorem rate of 50 per cent. because the handles are not fitted to pickaxes; that the rate of duty on the article complete with handle is less than that on the handle alone and will give a preference of about 20 per cent. to British makers of the complete article; that the firm in question manufacture pickaxes, and this imposition of duty on the handles will necessitate the cessation of such work, and if in view of this he will consider having unfitted pick handles exempted from the duty, and also whether he will give instructions to have the consignment released without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of the anomaly caused by making every holder of 1,000 pounds or more of tea liable for the payment of an excise duty of 4d. per pound on the tea, while the holder of less than 1,000 pounds pays no such duty and is consequently in a position to undersell the holder of tea who has paid such duty; and if he will take steps to remove this anomaly by allowing <Col N="11" /> the first 1,000 pounds to be held free of tax.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that there are many retailers of tea who had one thousand pounds or more of tea in stock on the 12th May, 1932, when the imposition of the excise duty on tea took effect and who did not become aware of such tax for forty-eight hours afterwards, and sold tea during that period at the price prevailing before the tax was imposed, and if in, view of this he will take the necessary steps to grant reliefs to such retailers from payment of such tax in respect of tea so sold.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to reply to questions Nos. 14 and 15 together, and also to a question in similar terms of which I have received notice from Deputy Dillon.</P>
      <P>I have given this matter the fullest consideration, and in all the circumstances I propose to allow a remission of the Excise duty on tea in respect of 500 pounds of tea in all cases where stocks liable to duty as being in excess of 1,000 pounds are in the ownership or possession of any individual or firm.</P>
      <P>As a further measure of relief I propose to allow, where desired, payment of the duty chargeable, in two moieties, one being made forthwith and the other within a period of three months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister state why he fixes it at 500 lbs.?  Will he state to the House why he will not agree that the duty should be charged only on the tea in excess of 1,000 lbs? As stated in the question, the present position is that a person could have 999 lbs. of tea and he would have to pay no duty at all on it, while another person who would have 1,001 lbs. of tea would have to pay the duty on the 1,001 lbs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JasperTraversWolfe" hpid="Mr. Wolfe Mr. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not allow the matter to remain over until the Financial Resolution comes before the House?  From the point of view of the Department of Finance it is a small matter and will mean very little in revenue.  I think the Minister might <Col N="12" /> see his way to give way and fall in with the suggestion of Deputy Morrissey and say that the first 1,000 lbs. would be exempt from duty; or failing that, would he allow the matter to remain over until to-morrow and so not jump too quickly to a decision?  This question does affect a lot of small traders and it would result in a certain amount of injustice being done to them.  I would urge on the Minister to look into it and agree to what Deputy Morrissey has suggested or else allow it to remain over until the Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is a small one as regards the amount of money the Minister for Finance is to get out of it, but having regard to the number of traders who are affected by it, it is large.  With regard to the reply to question 15, it is a very important matter. In the big cities a large quantity of tea was sold on the Thursday after the Budget was introduced, and it was sold at the old price; but on Friday morning those merchants received notice that they would be held liable for the 4d. per lb. duty on the tea sold in the interval.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am meeting Deputies Dillon and Wolfe by allowing the first 500 lbs. free of duty irrespective of whether the stocks were in excess of 1,000 lbs. or not.  There are reasons why the middle figure should be fixed rather than that total exemption should be given.  I would be prepared to state these reasons more fully on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  At the present moment that is the offer of immediate relief which we are making.</P>

      <P>This case was considered by the then Minister for Justice last October.  He decided that having regard to the fact that the Guard in question had already been punished by having to pay the damages and costs awarded in the Circuit Court, the case would be met from the disciplinary point of view by his transfer to another division and the suspension for three months of his promotion to the rank of sergeant, which he would have received at once but for this offence.  In these circumstances I feel that I must regard the matter as having been adjudicated upon and disposed of before I took up office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware that sheriffs' costs are based at too high a rate and that in many cases the costs are nearly equal to the amount of the decrees; and if he will take the necessary steps to have the scale of such costs revised with a view to reducing them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the scale of fees chargeable by undersheriffs is too high.  The scale is fixed by the Under-Sheriffs' Fees Order, 1926, as amended by the Under-Sheriffs' <Col N="15" /> Fees Order, 1931.  The cases the Deputy probably has in mind are those in which the amount involved is small and in which it becomes necessary to make a seizure.  In such cases it is obvious, especially if the party against whom the execution order is directed resides at any great distance from the under-sheriff's headquarters, that the expenses incurred must be out of proportion to the amount of the decree.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if his attention has been called to the urgent need for the restoration of the telephone service formerly existing between the island of Cape Clear and the mainland; and if in view of the fact that there is no resident medical officer on the island and of the grave risk in life caused in the delay in procuring medical attendance, and of the serious handicap to the fishing industry, the main support of the inhabitants of the island, caused by the lack of information of the current prices of fish, he will have the telephone service restored without delay.</P>

      <P>There was never a telephone or telegraph service between Cape Clear Island and the mainland. The question of providing communication was considered some years ago, but was found not to be feasible because, by reason of the heavy cost involved and the very limited revenue likely to be derived, the service would be unremunerative.  I am, however, having the matter reviewed, and I will inform the Deputy of the result in due course.</P>

      <P>Could we have some <Col N="16" /> indication of the pressure of business which renders this motion necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware I think, it has been indicated already to the Opposition that we propose to adjourn on 8th July.  The deputation going to Ottawa would require to leave on that date in order to have sufficient time in advance to make preparations.</P>
      <P>From this date until 8th July there are only five parliamentary weeks, if we exclude the Eucharistic Congress week.  This period of time is further shortened by the fact that Wednesday, 29th June, is a Church holiday, and it is not proposed that the Dáil should sit on that day.  In that time, besides the Bills that are already before the Dáil, namely the Dairy Produce Bill, the Old Age Pensions Bill, the Dublin and Blessington Steam Tramway Bill, the Finance Bill, the Appropriation Bill and the Detained Animals (Compensation) Bill, there are a number of heavy Bills in course of preparation, such as the Housing Bill, the Flour Industry Control Bill, a Price Fixing Bill and a New Companies Bill.  These are fairly heavy Bills, and for the discussion of them a considerable amount of time will be required.  Altogether, I have before me a list of eighteen Bills.  For instance, the Finance Bill, the Appropriation Bill, the Diseases of Animals Bill and the Eucharistic Congress Bill will be introduced shortly, while the preparation of the other Bills is rapidly proceeding.</P>
      <P>I think in these circumstances it is reasonable to ask the House to sit four days a week.  It is also proposed to appropriate for Government business Private Deputies' time for the remainder of the Session from to-morrow. I was asked by Deputy Morrissey to give time for the conclusion of the particular motion that appears on the Order Paper in his name.  We propose to give half an hour for that to-morrow, and I think that will be sufficient to enable the Deputy to close on his motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In reference to this motion that has been put down, the only reason given for it is that there is pressure of business, but the pressure of business appears to be such that there seems to be no great prospect <Col N="18" /> of getting even this House to conclude the various stages of these measures before 8th July.  In those circumstances, I think further consideration should be given to the proposal to have such pairing arrangements made as to enable those who have to attend the Ottawa Conference, for whatever purpose their attendance there may be desired, to leave in good time.  Personally, I would be very willing, and I would even ask the House to facilitate the departure of those who are going to it to leave at least by 8th July so that they may be in time for the necessary and ordinary opening proposals which always mark these conferences.  But if that proposal is said to be undesirable, that is to say, if it is thought to be undesirable that they should leave in time for that particular proposal, of course a particular delaying motion can be put down, and it would meet with the ordinary tactics which the President follows on such occasions.  Otherwise, there does not seem to be any great reason whatever for believing that the programme of business outlined can be got through even by meeting four days a week and sitting until 10.30 on three nights.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that a final decision on this motion might be postponed until such date as we have these heavy Bills, as they have been described, put before us.  I refer again to the Housing Proposals Bill, the Flour Industry Control Bill, a price fixing Bill, and a Bill dealing with new companies.  Quite clearly it is impossible at this stage to say whether, even granted the time necessary, if it be decided to adjourn on 8th July, it would be possible to have these Bills put through all their stages by that date.  In that event, there is no reason whatever for sitting on this extra day a week and to such a late hour.  If these measures have got to be postponed they can be taken at an early stage in the Autumn Session.</P>

It is with a view to allowing the House to adjourn on the 8th July and &ldquo;for that purpose,&rdquo; to use the phraseology of the Government, to have the business concluded here to enable a delegation or deputation from the Government to go to Ottawa. What I was going to suggest is that <Col N="20" /> considerable business falls to the lot of particular Ministers, and that that business might, and could be expedited and passed through the House, and the remaining business, which could be dealt with by those Ministers who stay at home, can be then taken up after the 8th July, if it were necessary. When representations were made to us by the Parliamentary Secretary that there was a desire to sit until the 8th July because, as he put it, they could not take the risk of staying on, with some of the reserves on the Canadian front, it was put to him that we would accommodate them, and he said that he was astonished that such courtesy should be extended by the Opposition, that it raised a new question and altered the situation and that he would have to consider it.</P>

      <P>There has been no point made against this proposal, because, in the past, we have had to sit up at nights to get a certain amount of Governmental work through.  We are not asking the House to sit up at nights, but we are asking Deputies to come to the House for an extra day which is provided for in the Standing Orders.  Originally, it was anticipated that the Dáil would sit on four days a week.  The former administration, with its majority, cut down the time to three days and we are only proposing to restore what was the original intention, clearly shown in Standing Orders, of working four days a week. Every one of these Bills, which I have described as fairly heavy, are urgent Bills.  The Flour Industry (Control) Bill, the Price Fixing Bill and the new Companies Bill are bills that are made urgent in view of the general tariff policy of the Government.  The Housing Bill is also urgent.  I have a list, here, which will be communicated to the Opposition, of 18 Bills which we hope to put through, in addition to the Estimates.  I might say, in regard to the Estimates, that they have been prepared altogether by the Opposition and, therefore, the delays that might occur through a body that did not examine them in detail before, having to criticise them, ought not to be expected on this occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>It appeared from the questions put towards the adjournment on Wednesday last, that further elucidation of the method of calculating the means of claimants for old age pensions would be necessary. Owing to the many amending Bills to the Old Age Pensions Law, the position had become rather confusing, and, although I had not a lot of sympathy with Deputy Mulcahy at the time he put the question, when I looked into it afterwards, and realised the amount of research that was necessary in order to get a clear understanding of the various things that are taken into consideration, in estimating the means of a claimant, I had to admit that there was a good deal of justification for the question.  Consequently, to-day, for the information of Deputy Mulcahy, and for the information of the House I propose to outline the method of calculating the means, and to indicate, briefly, the proposed changes in relation to existing legislation which the present Bill will bring about.  The Act of 1911, Section 2, sub-section (1), paragraph (a), as amended by Section 4 (1) of the 1919 Act, and Section 5 of the 1924 Act, says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In calculating the means of a person for old age pension purposes account shall be taken of the yearly value of any property belonging to that person (not being property personally used or enjoyed by him) which is invested, or is otherwise put to profitable use by him, or which, though capable of investing or profitable use, is not so invested or put to profitable use by him, the yearly value of that property shall be calculated as follows: (1) the first £25 of the yearly value of the property <Col N="24" /> shall be excluded, and (2) the yearly value of so much of the capital value of the said property as exceeds the sum of £25 shall be taken to be one-tenth part of the capital value thereof.</P>
    <P>Under Section 5 of the Bill before the House, it is proposed to substitute one twentieth for one tenth, as the proportion of the capital value in excess of £25, which is to be taken as the yearly value.  It is generally assumed that such property consists of invested money, but I am not so very much concerned with the class of people who have £500 or £600 invested, and whose income would be calculated under this particular section.  What I am concerned about is the case in which the capital value of property, other than money, is taken into consideration in estimating the means.  Take the case of a farm which is capable of being operated, or being put to profitable use by a claimant, but which is not operated or put to profitable use by the owner, for the reason that he is physically unable to cultivate the farm himself, and that he cannot afford to pay a labourer to cultivate his farm for him. The result is that instead of cultivating the farm or having it cultivated, he lets it annually.  In such circumstances it is open to the pension authorities to estimate the capital value of that farm rather than the actual income from it. Let us take a farm with a capital value of £325.  The man who is unable to cultivate that farm, and lets it annually, might only make about £15 or £16, out of which he would have to pay land annuities and rates.  For old age pension purposes such a farmer would be credited with having an income of one-tenth of the capital value, namely £30.  That always appeared to me to be a considerable hardship, and it is because that particular class of people are affected by taking one-tenth of the capital value, instead of one-twentieth, that it is proposed to have this amendment inserted in the old age pensions code.</P>
    <P>In the same way the capital value of house property is very often taken into consideration rather than the actual value in cash receipts from the letting.  Let us take the case of <Col N="25" /> a man who has put his whole life savings into building a house, or buying a house, who, in his old ago finds that it is not possible to live up to the same standard of respectability as he lived when younger, and who has to let the house to increase his income, perhaps taking lodgings in a room or in more modest surroundings. A house the capital value of which might be £500 might only bring in a rent of £15 or £16 to the claimant. Under the existing law if the capital value were £500 the amount that would be credited to the old age pensioner would be £50 yearly, while the actual income would be only £15 or £16.  That appears to me to be unfair, and these are the class of cases we hope will be covered by the amending legislation.</P>
    <P>I quite admit that theoretical cases can be made against this amendment. It is quite possible that we will be told about the terrible injustice to the taxpayers if people with £600 or £700 in the bank get a few shillings of an old age pension.  Such theoretical cases may be met, but in actual fact we do not find people with £300, £400, £500 or £600 cash in bank or invested getting old age pensions, and I do not think we are likely to find them in future.  The number of people with over £100 in cash, or invested, in receipt of old age pensions, at the present time, would not exceed fifty.  I do not think that figure will be more than doubled as a result of this Bill.  At any rate I think we should approach this matter, rather from the point of view of the cases of hardship that existing legislation brings about, than from the point of view of the possible abuses that the amending of the law may bring about.  Personally I am prepared to risk giving a pension to an undeserving case in order to ensure that all deserving cases will secure the pension.  Section 2 (1) (b) of the Act of 1911 says that in calculating the means of claimants there shall be taken into consideration:</P>
    <P>The income which that person may reasonably be expected to receive during the succeeding year in cash, excluding any sums receivable <Col N="26" /> on account of an old age pension under this Act, and excluding any sum arising from the investment or profitable use of property (not being property personally used or enjoyed by him), that income, in the absence of other means for ascertaining the income, being taken to be the income actually received during the preceding year.</P>
    <P>We do not propose to make any alteration in the present Bill in that particular section.  Account shall be taken of &ldquo;the income which that person may reasonably be expected to receive during the succeeding year in cash.&rdquo;  That will mean taking into account income from the estimated profit from a farm, a shop, or wages&mdash; in fact the entire cash income which a claimant may reasonably expect to receive during the coming year.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1911, Section 2 (1) (c) as amended by the 1909 Act, Section 4 (1) (c) provides that account shall be taken of the yearly value of any advantage accruing to a person from the use or enjoyment of any property belonging to him which is personally used or enjoyed by him.  It is not intended to make any alteration in that.  That section will stand in the old age pension code when this Bill is passed.  Such a section might come into operation for example where a claimant assigned his property, but reserved to himself a definite and specified portion of that property&mdash;a certain room, or a certain section of the house for his own use in his old age.  The yearly value of such reserved portion could possibly be calculated and included in his estimate of means for old age pension purposes.  Under the Act of 1911, Section 2 (1) (d) it is laid down that account shall be taken in estimating the means of a claimant to an old age pension of the yearly value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by the person.  It is proposed to repeal that paragraph completely.  It is admitted quite frankly that the repeal of that section will have very far-reaching effects.  The yearly value of charitable donations maintenance, food, clothing and shelter at present extended to the aged or the blind is <Col N="27" /> estimated as means for old age pension purposes under this paragraph. In repealing this paragraph we intend to secure that nothing will be taken into account in estimating the means of a claimant to an old age pension unless what these people have in the form of cash income, or unless what they derive from investments, or what they have in their own legal right.  I think this section will have a particularly far-reaching effect in so far as blind pensioners are concerned.  I cannot conceive that many blind persons in this country will go with less than the full 10/- per week blind pension in future, as a result of the removal of this section, for the reason that the earning capacity of blind persons, or persons whose sight is so defective that they cannot follow their ordinary occupations, must be very limited indeed. When we secure that maintenance, food, clothing and shelter extended to them by friends or relatives or charitably disposed persons will no longer be taken into consideration in estimating their means, it is highly probable that most blind persons will be entitled to receive, and will actually receive, the full old age pension.</P>
    <P>I was never satisfied that this particular section could be followed out and administered to its logical conclusion, if there is any logical conclusion to legal enactments.  There does not appear to be any logical conclusion to this section.  The means schedule under the recent amendment of the 1924 Act, provides that if a person's means from all sources exceeds the sum of £15 12s. 6d. he shall not be entitled to a pension of 10/- per week.  The &ldquo;estimated means&rdquo; includes the estimated yearly value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by the claimant.  It appears to me that any claimant who did not enjoy benefits or privileges, such as food, clothing or shelter exceeding in value 6/- per week, could not exist.  Consequently, if an accurate return were being made of the benefits and privileges, as well as the other sources of income which these people have, <Col N="28" /> nobody could receive the full old age pension, because every claimant would be in receipt of income in excess of £15 12s. 6d.  It was a physical impossibility to give a 10/- pension and logically administer that section of the Old Age Pensions Act.  I do not believe that it was ever intended to include free maintenance or charitable donations but, whatever it was intended to do, what we have to consider is what it was actually doing.  It was doing a number of things that we did not like to see being done. The safest thing to do is, I think, to remove the section.</P>
    <P>In that connection, it was sometimes argued that there is a moral obligation on children who have been successful in life to maintain their parents in their old age.  It appears to me that there is a moral obligation on the State to maintain people who have no means of maintaining themselves or who have reached an age or a physical condition when they are no longer capable of maintaining themselves.  It is seriously argued by some people that if children succeed in life, have homes of a certain standard of comfort and take in the old people, that that standard of comfort should be estimated as &ldquo;means&rdquo; against the claimant.  If that is maintained, the people who put forward the argument ought to be logical and should argue also that the pensioner classes who have been in a position to educate their children and place them in key positions, with a high earning capacity, should be maintained in their old age by their children just as well as the parents of the labourer or the farmer.  It has never been argued that the children of people with salaries of £1,500 a year who can, at 65 years of age, retire on a pension of two-thirds their maximum earning capacity&mdash;£1,000 a year&mdash;it has never been argued that the children of these people should have any obligation to them or that they should be maintained by their relatives.  If it is not argued in the case of the wealthy, it should not be argued in the case of the poor.</P>
    <P>I think that practically covers the <Col N="29" /> entire method of calculating the means of the claimant.  Sub-section (2) of Section 2 of the Act of 1911 provides:</P>
    <P>In calculating the means of a person, being one of a married couple living together in the same house, the means shall be taken to be half the total means of the couple.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with and explained that in some detail.  Put in a nutshell, the amendment means that if one of a married couple dies, no question will be raised to deprive the survivor of the pension that that survivor enjoyed while he had his partner.  It is also proposed, as I mentioned before, to repeal completely Section 7 of the Act of 1924.  That section provided that if within three years before, or at any time after a person received an old age pension, property or income was assigned &ldquo;such property or income shall be taken into account in calculating for the purpose of the Old Age Pensions Acts... the means of that person unless it shall appear that the assignment was a conveyance or transfer by operation of law or was a conveyance or transfer on a bona fide scale for valuable consideration in money or money's worth amounting to not less than four-fifths of the value of the property or income or ...that the property comprised in the assignment consist only of a farm of land the poor law valuation whereof (including the buildings thereon) does not exceed £10....&rdquo; Leaving aside altogether the various interpretations of that section and the draftsmanship of the section&mdash;I do not think we need waste the time of the House in discussing that&mdash;the section, at any rate, conceded the right to the farmer to assign his farm. If the farm was under £10 valuation, the farmer could apply for the pension immediately after the assignment and not have the income from that farm taken into consideration in estimating his means.  If the farm were over £10 valuation, the farmer could, at the expiration of three years, apply for the pension without having the income from that <Col N="30" /> farm taken into consideration in calculating his means.  I cannot see&mdash; I am open to conviction on the matter&mdash;that a case can be made, once the principle of assignment is conceded, for making a man wait three years after the assignment to qualify for the old age pension without having income from the farm taken into consideration.  In practice, the section has always meant that the farmer who was well up in the law, or who could afford legal advice or who had people well up in the law taking an interest in him, assigned his farm at the age of 67.  When he became 70 years of age, he became, if otherwise qualified, entitled to the old age pension without having the income from that farm taken into consideration.  But if he were an unfortunate man without friends to advise him&mdash;he might, perhaps, be illiterate&mdash;he did not assign his farm until he was 70 years of age and he discovered then that he had to wait three years until he was 73 years of age&mdash;before he could get the old age pension without having the income of the farm charged up against him.  If the principle of assignment is conceded at all, I think we should not put up barriers, and we should certainly not put up barriers which will operate against the most defenceless of this particular class of the community.</P>
    <P>Probably again it will be said that the principle of assignment should not be conceded at all.  Again, that is a question that is open to debate and it can be freely granted that there are two sides to it.  But, again, if the State can afford to pay a two-thirds retiring allowance to people paid a sufficiently large salary, perhaps, to make provision for their old age, and if all public officials can retire on a large pension reaching two-thirds of their maximum earning capacity, I think that that class of the community who put up these pensions, and who put up these salaries in the form of taxation, ought to be allowed to retire when they reach a condition of life that they are no longer able to look after themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="31" /> I hope that during the course of the debate on this Bill Deputies will approach the matter in a reasonable spirit, and that they will not take up the time of the House advancing the theoretical arguments that may be advanced practically against any common sense suggestion, either in the way of legislation, or in any other form.  I would be sorry that advantage would be taken of this Bill by any section of the House to make political capital out of it, or to try to approach it from the political point of view.  We are trying to do the best we can, as we see it, for the most deserving section of the community, and I venture to hope that this Bill will have the support of a majority of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary covers over the case he makes on this Bill by a kind of suggestion that this measure is to deal with the most deserving section of the community and with the most defenceless of the particular parties who are connected with old age pensions, and by suggesting that this is being done in respect of a particular class that ought to have been attended to long ago.  We are dealing here with a class of pension which absorbs one-eighth of the whole taxable revenue of the State.  If we take the revenue for the last five years, and the demands made in respect of old age pensions during these five years, we find that for every £8 of tax revenue collected, £1 has gone in old age pensions.  The proposal is put before us now to increase the amount of money that is to be spent on old age pensions, and to increase it in respect of a particular class who are not without means; to increase it by a sum that the Minister says will, in his opinion, be not less than £300,000, and in respect of a class who are of such a kind that he sincerely hopes is going to be more. The tax revenue for the year 1931-32 was £21,286,000 and the estimated expenditure in respect of old age pensions out of that was £2,750,000. The year in which there is proposed to be added another £300,000 at least <Col N="32" /> in respect of these old age pensions, is a year in which the Minister for Finance has accepted and put before the House an estimate that the taxation which last year brought in £21,286,000 would only bring in this year a revenue reduced by about 6.5 or £1,933,000.  At the same time, the general circumstances are such that about £4,000,000 extra taxation is being imposed.</P>
      <P>As I say, it is in these circumstances that this Bill is put before us. The Parliamentary Secretary says that it deals with a class who have no means of maintaining themselves or who have reached an ago, or who are in such physical condition, that they are no longer capable of maintaining themselves.  That is the kind of gloss put over the proposal.  A Deputy belonging to the Parliamentary Secretary's Party last week at Ballinderrig cross-roads, County Galway, said:</P>
      <P>Old age pensioners will get the pension irrespective of means so long as they are of age.  There was no reason why an old man or woman having reached the age of 70 years should not get the pension because they may have a couple of cattle for which they would not get £8 in the fairs to-day.  These things will not come against old age pensioners unless they are extraordinarily rich, so that, when this Bill is passed, anybody enjoying a pension of 5/- or 6/- can be looking for an increase and getting his application filled now, because they are sure to get it, and those refused a pension entirely can get their forms filled at once because the money is already provided for and can now be got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the position that a Deputy of the Parliamentary Secretary's Party puts before his own people.  I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that there may be a very considerable increase in the amount of money going to be paid under Section 6 in respect of blind pensions.  I think he will be able to find information with regard to particular areas where some time ago there might have been a certain looseness in respect of the granting <Col N="33" /> of pensions to blind pensioners, and he can see a sample of the figure to which the blind pensions can run if there is not careful supervision over them.  But, with the relaxation of the description of blindness, the reduction of age and doing away with a certain part of the means test, I quite agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that there may be a considerable increase under Section 6.</P>
    <P>It is under that part of the schedule which says that paragraph (d) of sub-section (1), section 2, is repealed, that I think the Minister will admit the great incidence of this additional burden is going to fall.  The fact is that the whole of the Parliamentary Secretary's speech and most of the pronouncements of various members of the Ministry at present in connection with this matter are an appeal, at any rate in rural areas, to persons over 70 years of age to get rid of their holdings and hand them over to their children and to continue to live with their children on the farm while drawing the old age pension.  The proposals in the Bill put no restriction on the circumstances in which persons over 70 years of age can live on in a farm as long as they have no cash means or income from some property. The motto is that we must have early marriages and persons over 70 years of age must hand over their farms to some of their children, and they are going to get the old age pension in return.  As far as I know, there is nothing to prevent persons in any other walk of life, besides farming, disposing of their property to their children before or after 70 years of age and drawing an old age pension.  The Parliamentary Secretary, I am afraid, has not fully opened his mind to what may happen in this matter.  He objected to my looking for some information with regard to what the means were exactly going to be estimated at, but he admitted, after he looked into the matter, that he found there was something in the question I was putting to him.  I feel that after he has looked into the matter further as the result of experience, he will find that he is putting a very unnecessary burden on the already over-burdened taxpayers in this matter and putting, <Col N="34" /> to a large extent, a burden on them in respect of a class that cannot be described as in any way in want.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this Bill to prevent a mother maintained by a son, rather than by a husband where he is in receipt of £500 or £600 a year, drawing the old age pension or a father in similar circumstances drawing the old age pension.  Where you have increased taxation for purposes such as this and where you have cuts in this or that or the other way, certainly there is a reason to expect that a class who in ordinary circumstances might never be tempted to look for the old age pension for their parents will feel that the State and the political Parties in the State now regard them, from an entirely different point of view, and will seek for that payment from the point of view that it has been well earned as a result of the work they have done for the State in their long lifetime.  So that you find it in Mayo, or Sligo or Roscommon or Donegal to-day old age pensions paid amounting to £1 8s. in Donegal and more than £1 8s. in Mayo.  But in respect of each member of the large population you have in the County Dublin there is only 8s. paid per member of the population in respect of old age pensions; in Kildare 14s. and in Meath 16s.  You have whole sections of the country to the East and South where you will find that, as compared with the population, there is a great discrepancy between the amount of money paid out in old age pensions. If the Minister will refer to the last report issued from the Revenue Commission, I have only the second last one here, it would give some idea of the matter.  In Donegal the amount of old age pensions paid if raised on the rates would represent 11/11 of the total rateable valuation; in Mayo, 13/5; in Leitrim, 10/8; whereas in Kilkenny, 2/9; in Kildare, 2/3; but the figures per head of the population would perhaps give a better idea of the results. You are certainly going to have in urban districts and in counties such as Dublin, Wicklow and Louth, in these new circumstances, because their children are paying taxes, they are going to pay these additional moneys, a demand <Col N="35" /> for the old age pensions, in respect of the class of people you never had before.</P>
    <P>The way is completely open, because no matter what the circumstances of the person as to their living, if he has no property or income of his own there is nothing to prevent him getting the full 10/- old age pension.  When the various calls are taken into consideration that are laid on people to-day in respect of public purposes for taxation or rates it will be very easy for many classes of people who have not availed of the old age pension up to the present to avail of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes a certain amount of play about the anti-Irish and unfair way in which certain property is assessed against married couples for old age pension purposes, and that the pension of the remaining one is liable to be reduced if the other dies. The proposal to leave the pension stand in this case is a thing I do not question very much.  It is one of the inevitable things that arises.  For instance, under the Minister's proposal, if we accept what he is doing in regard to the means of a man whose wife died when, say, he was 69, he might avoid getting a pension he would have if she only died when he was 70, even under the Minister's proposal. But if the Minister's policy, as running through a lot of his discourse, is that he wants the older people to hand over the farm to the children so that the property will be better managed and will be in younger hands and that he can have his early marriage policy fully gone ahead with, this proposal is cutting across his policy in that it contemplates the farm being held by the couple.  One of them dies and the other, being over 70, continues to hold on to the farm.  His proposal here makes it easier for that person to hold on to the farm, and entirely cuts across the proposal to have the land, in so far as it can reasonably be put into the hands of the younger people at the present moment.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister, in regard to Section 4, if he would say what kind of mutual arrangements <Col N="36" /> there are between the Free State and Northern Ireland in connection with this matter.  As I understand, the change he proposes to make in Section 4 is that if an old age pensioner born in Fermanagh and living in the Free State and enjoying the old age pension in the Free State, decides to visit the scenes of his youth for a month or two his old age pension will be stopped while he goes to see his friends in Fermanagh and to see his native surroundings for the last time, probably, before he dies.  So that if he is getting sentimental about the old age pensioner he might consider whether there is not something wrong in Section 4.</P>
    <P>Deputies must get very clearly into their minds that when we have a condition of affairs where we are spending one-eighth of the whole taxable revenue upon old age pensions, that whatever margin of hardship there may be among the class looking for old age pensions, as a result of the legislation that exists at the present moment there cannot be very much hardship as regards old age pensions when we are spending one-eighth of our whole taxable revenue upon them. Whatever hardship there is, certainly, in my opinion, does not warrant opening a door which is being opened by this particular measure here to bring in, on the old age pension list, every person over 70 years of age who can claim that he has no private income, no matter what his circumstances of living may be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that I welcome this Bill, and I think that the Government are to be congratulated not only on introducing it, but on introducing it so early in the Session.  I think that most of the points made by Deputy Mulcahy are points which will arise more properly in Committee.  If there is one blot in the Bill, to my mind, it is that it is about the finest example of legislation by reference that we have had for a long time in this House, and it is very difficult for the ordinary member, unless he has the whole old age pensions code of Acts of Parliament before him &mdash;Acts passed both by this Parliament and the British Parliament&mdash;to follow <Col N="37" /> the Bill.  I agree that the Parliamentary Secretary has done his best to give us an idea of what the effect of the repeal of the different sections of the different Acts will mean.  But undoubtedly, in my opinion, one of the most undesirable and unjust Acts of the late Administration was the introduction of the Old Age Pensions Act of 1924.  In my opinion it was never desirable, and I believe to-day as I believed then, that it was not necessary to do so, even at that time.  I am glad that the Minister is going in some way to remedy the position which was brought about by the 1924 Act.  But I do not know that he is going far enough, and going far enough in particular for the poorer classes of old age pensioners.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to tell us, when he is replying, what is the position to-day with regard to the maximum income.  Following the introduction and passing of the 1924 Act, it was commonly said that the effect of the Act was, to reduce old age pensions by 1/- per week, but those of us who know anything at all know quite well that in very many cases it meant a reduction of 4/- per week instead of 1/-. Under the Old Age Pensions Act, prior to 1924, a person who had an income valued at 10/- per week was entitled to the maximum old age pension of 10/- per week, bringing it up to £1 per week; but immediately the 1924 Act was passed that pension of 10/- a week was reduced not by 1/- but by 4/-, because the maximum under the 1924 Act was 16/- per week.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to tell us also what the position would be with regard to that type of person when this amending Bill goes through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the introduction and passage of the 1924 Act there were many old people in the country, say, an old person who had a son killed during the Great War, and that person had, say, a pension of 10/- per week for the loss of his or her son from the British Government and also 10/- per week old age pension.  Immediately the Act was passed in 1924, the old age pension was reduced by 4/- and we found our own Government here taking advantage of <Col N="38" /> the pension that had been granted to one of our own citizens by the British Government.  Of course, after a short time, the British Government began to see what was happening, and they said if there were to be reductions at all or savings made they were going to make them, and they reduced their pension to this particular person by 4/- per week, so that we had to pay the full 10/- a week.  But in any case between the two Governments the old person lost not 1/- but 4/- per week.</P>
    <P>I welcome in particular the Section dealing with blind pensions.  I was a member of the Old Age Pensions Commission which sat, I think, in 1926 for over six months.  Our Terms of Reference were rather restricted, but one of the matters to which we gave very careful consideration was the question of blind pensions, and we were satisfied that it was almost impossible for any applicant for a blind pension to get a pension unless he or she was stone blind.  As a matter of fact, one pension officer who was being examined before the Commission admitted that in every case when an application was made for a blind pension, accompanied by a certificate from the local doctor, he automatically appealed that case to Dublin without any consideration whatever.  And it was admitted that a person who had, as the-Parliamentary Secretary explained the-other night, been engaged in a certain occupation all his lifetime up to, say, the age of 60 years, and at 60 years of age became so blind as to be unable to continue in that occupation, would not be granted a pension; in fact, so long as the pension officer or the medical officer employed by the Department in those cases was satisfied that that person had sufficient eyesight even to shovel mud into a cart he was not entitled to the pension.  Therefore, I am glad the Minister has introduced this particular Section, not only with regard to the question of the degree of blindness but with regard to the question of the reduction of the age.</P>
    <P>I would like to return just for one moment to this question of means, and I am not thinking altogether now of the farmer.  But let us take two men&mdash;for instance two working men. <Col N="39" /> One man has been an industrious, hard-working, thrifty man, has lived carefully all his lifetime and put a bit by for a rainy day.  He has saved his little mite week in and week out in order to provide for himself, and when he comes to apply for the pension, whatever he has saved is brought up against him and the pension is granted of anything from 1/- to 10/- a week in accordance with his savings. But take his next-door neighbour, who has not been so thrifty, who has wasted his money rather than saved it, and when he comes to 70 years of age he is automatically entitled to the full pension.  Now I do not say that a man who reaches 70 years is not entitled to the full pension because he has nothing, but I do say it is unfair to penalise thrift and to penalise the man who has been industrious, hard-working and saving.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his speech on, I think, Thursday night, mentioned that they proposed to take certain powers regarding pensions clerks.  That is a matter, of course, into which we can go later on in the Committee Stage.  I wonder if the Minister had thought of the recommendation made by the Commission and under consideration I understood by the late Government regarding the conditions under which those clerks should be employed in the future and whether they should be salaried officials rather than paid, as I think they are at the moment, by results? I would like if he would give some information on that point when replying.</P>
    <P>There is another matter on which I am very anxious to get some information. I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary will be only too glad to give me this information because I know that for a long time he was anxious to get the information himself.  I wonder has he had any talk with the Minister for Finance regarding what are known as secret instructions issued to pensions officers, and would he tell us if there are such secret instructions?  If there are instructions issued to pensions officers with regard to old age pensions and <Col N="40" /> in particular with regard to the assessing of means, would he tell us why they should be secret?  I was going to say would he tell us what they are, but if he did they would be no longer secret.  I suppose that I will get no more information on that point than I got from the late Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about the secrecy or otherwise there is no doubt that they are very effective.  It might be no harm, during the course of this Bill through the House, for the House itself to consider whether it is desirable that in the administration of this old age pension scheme two departments should be brought into the matter.  I think it leads to a good deal of confusion.  We have the Local Government Department coming in at a certain point.  We have, as a matter of fact, the case against the old age pensioner compiled by an official of the Finance Department and all the steps taken, up I think to the final appeal, are taken by officers of the Finance Department, but the appeal itself is decided by the Local Government Department on information supplied by an officer of another Department.  I do not know whether that is desirable or not Personally, I do not think it is.</P>
      <P>Another matter that most of us are concerned with is this, that in nearly every case, unless an applicant for an old age pension is practically destitute, the pension officer appeals against the granting of the pension, and even when that case comes to be considered by the local pensions subcommittee and is threshed out there, when a decision is given in favour of the applicant in practically every case there is an appeal to headquarters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that I would like to bring before the Parliamentary Secretary.  It was one of the recommendations, as far as I can recollect, of the Commission; that is with regard to the question of appeal and the forms which are sent out to old age pensioners.  I would suggest, <Col N="41" /> first and foremost, that there are too many forms.  When an applicant applies for an old age pension he gets a very complicated form.  He has to answer almost as many questions as a farmer who applies for a loan to the Credit Corporation.  He is then informed that the case will be heard on a certain date.  He is next informed that his pension has been granted or disallowed and that the pension officer has appealed.  Very many of these old people are illiterate.  They are living in remote places where they are not in a position to consult a person who would be able to put them on the right road, so to speak. I suggested at the Commission&mdash;I think it was contained in the report&mdash;that these forms be simplified and reduced in number, if possible. Further, I think in every Post Office or Garda barracks in the country, there ought to be a poster giving simple instructions to old people as to how they are to frame their application or suggesting what the Department requires.  That is very essential I think with regard to affidavits and cases where old people cannot get documentary proof of their age.  As the Parliamentary Secretary knows, there is quite a large number of those at present, and old people are told that if they get two people as old or older than themselves who are able to vouch that they are over 70 that that would be accepted in lieu of a baptismal certificate. We know that that is not the case.  We know that for every affidavit that is accepted as proof of age there are twenty turned down, and the reasons given by the Department are that the affidavits are too vague, that they are not definite enough.  It is very often the case that persons making the affidavit cannot make a definite affidavit because they do not know what is required and they do not get any information either from the pension committee or the pension officer.</P>

Of course on the Second Reading, I think if I may say so again with all possible respect, I am entitled to discuss not only what is in the Bill but what I would like to see in it.  There are very many things that I would like to see in the Bill that are not in it.  However, as I have said, I welcome the Bill.  I think it is a step in the right direction and I think the Government is to be congratulated on introducing it. So far as I am concerned, I will give them any assistance that I can in putting it through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose this Bill, not because I am opposed to the principle of giving pensions to persons who have reached old age&mdash;more particularly I am not opposed to giving pensions to blind persons at an earlier age&mdash;but there are times both in the history of individuals and of countries when we cannot afford to do the things we would like to do.  One would like to see in this country social services brought up to levels at which they are in other countries, but the question at once arises &ldquo;Can we afford these things?&rdquo;  That is the aspect of this particular question that I would like Deputies to concentrate more on.  As to the principle, I think on all sides of the House we would like, if we possibly could afford it, to do better for those poor people than we are doing at the moment, but on this question as to whether or not we can afford it, I would like to remind Deputies that a great portion of the wealth of this country comes from our agriculture.  If we put on this additional burden of some £400,000 to £500,000 which seems to be the <Col N="43" /> amount that will be incurred if we pass this Bill, is agriculture at the moment in a position to carry the major portion of that burden?  If agriculture is not in a position to produce this money will some Deputy interested in economics tell me where the money is to come from?  I think in a House like this and at a time like this it is essential that we should devote a considerable portion of our inquiry to this particular aspect of this problem.</P>
      <P>As I understand the case put forward by the farmer or those agriculturists who are represented in this House, they tell us that at no time in the past fifty years was agriculture so depressed as it is at the moment. At no time during the last fifty years were prices in the agricultural industry in relation to costs of production as low as they are to-day. In fact if one were to sum up from what one hears in this House and elsewhere, from representative members of the farming community, one might fairly gather that agriculture is in any condition at the moment but a profitable one, in other words, that it is being carried on at a loss. Let those Deputies who represent agriculture stand up here and contradict these facts, if they are going to support this measure, and tell us that agriculture is in a position at the moment to carry this additional burden.  If they can prove this to my satisfaction they will carry my vote, but if what they have said here in the immediate past is true they will have some difficulty in satisfying me and this House that agriculture is in a position at the moment in which it can carry this additional burden. I shall await with interest some of the spokesmen on behalf of the agricultural community who may speak on this particular aspect of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary was dealing with this matter a few nights ago, he said that the only objection he had to this measure came from a body known as the Associated Chambers of Commerce.  I think he told us that that was the only objection he had.  I did not happen, <Col N="44" /> although I am a member of that body, to be at that particular meeting when this resolution was passed.  I have in my hand, however, a recommendation that appeared on the agenda of that particular body and it was in the following form:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Council (that is the Council of the Associated Chambers of Commerce) expresses the opinion that in the present state of national finances the addition of a sum estimated at £400,000 to annual expenditure is unwise and more than the country can in the present circumstance afford.</P>
    <P>I think every agriculturist in this House and in the country, if I know them aright, if they were expressing their views on this Bill and on this proposed burden, would express them in identical terms to those expressed by the Council of the Associated Chambers of Commerce.  They would not, as I said, object at all if the country were in a financial position to afford these additional pensions, these additional social services, to give money when it is able to give it, but the position at the moment is that it is called upon to grant moneys and to carry burdens which it is unable to carry.</P>
    <P>There is only one other point to which I would like to draw attention in connection with this Bill.  Possibly the Parliamentary Secretary might be able to give us some information in regard to it.  I note that in Section 2, these pensions are to be given to persons who have not less than 30 years' residence in the Saorstát.  That is qualified in sub-section (3) of that particular section by the following words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Any absence from Saorstát Eireann in such period during which such person has maintained or assisted in maintaining any dependent in Saorstát Eireann shall be reckoned in and form part of such period.</P>
    <P>The point that has been mentioned to me in connection with that section is this: supposing a person, a member of an Irish family, has been absent from this country for a number of <Col N="45" /> years, in America, Canada or Australia, and has sent during that period a contribution of, say, £5 or £10 to some dependent in this country, would that entitle that person return to this country after the lapse of a number of years to become entitled to a pension under this pension scheme, having spent practically all his life out of the country and given his services to build up the wealth of some other country&mdash;to come back to this country and enjoy a pension from this country?  I do not know whether that is the intention, but it appears to me that such is the intention if we are to judge by the present wording of the Bill.  I should like to have some information on that point from the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T. Murphy Mr. T. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a matter of special pride to all those who were in the House in 1924, and who are here at the present time, to take part in a discussion arising out of a Bill that seeks to remedy the position that was given effect to in the 1924 Act. The 1924 Act was the biggest blot on the legislation enacted in this House since it was set up.  I am specially glad and proud to have the opportunity afforded to me to assist the passage of a Bill that seeks to remove that blot. This Bill will remove practically all the obstacles that have been built up under the Act of 1924 and that have operated so unjustly and so harshly in hundreds of cases throughout the country. The widening of the definition of blindness is going to be a tremendous advantage, and, of course, it is unnecessary to say that that also obtains in the reduction of the age period, but to my mind the most important and far-reaching provision in this measure is the one that abolishes the means test that existed in this country.  One heard a great outcry in the last five or six months about a means test that existed in a neighbouring country, but we have a means test no less severe in this country since 1924 and I am glad we are going to see the end of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been no criticism of this Bill.  One would not expect that Deputy Good would make any speech other than that which he has made. <Col N="46" /> It is a speech that I have listened to since 1922 or 1923 on every conceivable occasion, on every measure, seeking to do in some way, great or small, the things that we are attempting in this Bill.  I can find no other description for the speech of Deputy Mulcahy than that he felt it his duty to say something. His criticism of the Bill was the most feeble criticism I have ever heard directed against any measure. That was inevitable because, of course, no case whatever can be made against the Bill.</P>
    <P>On the question of the state of the national finances, which was the basis of Deputy Good's speech, he need not have any worries whatever about what the agricultural community will think about the Bill.  Not one member of the agricultural community in my opinion will object to paying for a service of this kind.</P>

I do not believe, as I said, that there will be the smallest complaint against the provisions of this Bill, and I believe that the people of the country, irrespective of Party or Party affiliations, will join in welcoming it, and that they will unite in admitting that it removes the greatest series of injustices that were ever condensed into any single measure passed by this House&mdash;the Act of 1924.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that I have not had an opportunity of hearing the opening portion and the major portion of the Parliamentary Secretary's statement. I only mention this because I read the newspaper reports very carefully&mdash;the official reports are not yet available&mdash; I read the newspaper reports of what he said as carefully as I could.  I should like to ascertain from him in <Col N="47" /> the course of his reply whether there is to be any change&mdash;of course, it is a matter of administration, but he will not mind giving us the information if he has got it as to whether there is to be any change in the method of approaching cases where a doubt arises on the question of age.  Deputy Morrissey has dealt with this matter to some extent.  Clearly there has been very great difficulty that has been accentuated by reason of the fact that people with a little education, a great many of them illiterate, were asked to provide in a special manner and under a certain form indisputable evidence as to age.  The evidence necessary in cases of that kind ought to be simplified. I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary has referred to this matter or whether it is the intention of the Department to give attention to it, but it will probably remove the remaining difficulty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey referred to certain instructions issued by the Department of Finance to the Pensions Officers. There can be no doubt whatever about the issue of instructions of that kind, because in this House several years ago I asked the Minister for Finance if he was willing to lay a copy of such instructions on the Table of this House. He declined.  I do not repeat that invitation to the Parliamentary Secretary, but I ask him, as soon as he gets the opportunity, to scrap them entirely. They should have gone long ago, or rather they should never have been in existence.</P>
    <P>There is only one other aspect of matters arising under this Bill that I should like to refer to, and that is that here and there through the country and particularly, so far as I know, in my own county there are some cases pending between the pensioners or claimants for pensions and the Revenue Commissioners with regard to over-payments, perhaps I should have said, alleged over-payments.  I do not know whether this is a matter that I ought to mention at this Stage or not, but I take the risk of mentioning it and of asking the Minister for Local Government to go into the cases of that kind.  Some of them have been <Col N="48" /> already brought in to the Courts and they have been scouted out of court by the Circuit Judge in my own county.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I shall get another opportunity of mentioning that matter.  I believe that this Bill wipes out practically all the obstacles that arose to block the way of genuine applicants for old age pensions; and I am entirely with the Parliamentary Secretary when he says&mdash;and this is the most effective answer that can be given to some of the opponents of this Bill&mdash;that he would rather risk one or two undeserving people or more getting pensions than seeing one genuine applicant debarred.  This is the spirit in which the Bill should go through this House.  I believe that it will have a speedy passage through this House, and a hearty welcome in the country.</P>

      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill in its general principle.  But I should like to refer to some of the things that the Parliamentary Secretary said in the course of his speech dealing with the Bill.  One thing that struck me as quite misleading was his suggestion that there is any real connection between the principle governing old age pensions and the principles governing the pensions of Civil Servants. Part of the remuneration of a Civil Servant is his right to a pension when he retires.  Were it not for that right, presumably his salary would be larger. The same principle does not govern the two things at all.  We shall have an opportunity of dealing in greater detail and in a different way with this measure on the Committee Stage, and I want to avoid, as far as possible, making a Committee speech now. Everybody knows that this Old Age Pensions Bill is a Bill about which it is very easy to wax enthusiastic and to rejoice in it, and the more you rejoice about it the more popular you will be in the rural parts of your constituency. But I think a greater responsibility <Col N="49" /> rests upon Deputies in this House than to cultivate popularity by rejoicing in a measure of this kind. Instead of doing that they should carefully examine such measures and make constructive and, I hope, helpful suggestions to the Minister in charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the means test, that means test that was imposed by the 1924 Act undoubtedly wrought great, and, in my opinion, unjustifiable hardship on a large section of pensioners in the country.  But there is no use in jumping from the frying pan into the fire; and if we correct these hardships and alleviate the sufferings of deserving pensioners whose pensions were unjustly reduced, there is no need to give pensions to a vast number of persons who can have no claim on the community whatever for old age pensions.  There is no necessity to forsake moderation, because we have endured injustice for a considerable time, and I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will take steps during the Committee Stage of this Bill to mitigate the completeness with which he has dealt with the means test.  There are certain sections of the community who have no claim upon the taxpayer for old age pensions. There are other sections of the community referred to by Deputy Murphy who have exercised thrift and who have been putting a little by for a rainy day, and it would be obviously a gross injustice that such a man should be victimised as if he was a person thriftless and extravagant and who found himself without means in his old age and without anything to his name.  I quite agree that if a man has been thrifty there ought to be no objection against him when he applies for an old age pension.  But on the other hand I say that it seems to me as far as I can understand this Bill&mdash;it is rather a difficult Bill to understand because half of it consists of the repeal of sections of other Acts and one would have to have a reference library by one before one could get a grip of it&mdash;but as far as one can see, in its present form this Bill opens the door to pensions to a number of persons to whom I do not believe this <Col N="50" /> House would wish to give pensions at the expense of the already heavily burdened taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Good said that in the present condition of agriculture it was unjustifiable to lay further large additional burdens on it.  That was immediately repeated by Deputy Murphy, as I have often heard other remarks repeated, in such a way as considerably to alter the significance of Deputy Good's remark.  I do not say for a moment that it was Deputy Murphy's intention and I am sure it was not, but it struck on Deputy Murphy's ear in a special way and he reproduced it carrying with it a very different sense to what Deputy Good implied.  But my answer to Deputy Good is this: That in the Budget recently introduced with I thought very many good points, there was one resolution&mdash;the Tariff Resolution&mdash; which is going to mean £900,000 of a burden on the backs of the agricultural community.  I welcome the Bill that is going to appropriate £400,000 of that £900,000 and so return a very large part of the latter sum to the agricultural community from whom it is to be taken.  I would sooner that the Minister responsible, not the Minister in charge of this Bill, had not put that blister on the agricultural community.  We hope to get rid not of all that blister but I am glad of having an opportunity of getting a portion of this diverted to the people from whom it is going to be taken.</P>
    <P>I would expect to be reproved by the Chair for saying now something that should be said on the next stage. The great difficulty&mdash;to my mind, one of the greatest hardships on the old are pensioners all over the country&mdash;is this: That they do not know and a great many people who ought to know and who would know if the matter were simple, do not know what proofs the Department of Local Government and Public Health will take as evidence that an individual is entitled to the old age pension.  The moment the claimant for an old age pension gets into the toils of the Department of Local Government and Public Health <Col N="51" /> when he has made an application for an old age pension, he is up against this problem; he is questioned about this and that and he is asked for affidavits, records and testimonies as to age and so on and he is completely bewildered.  I am not ashamed to say that sometimes when I have taken part in the task of trying to secure an old age pension I am completely bewildered and I virtually despair as to what I am to do in order to convince the Department that the claimant is the age which he alleges himself to be.</P>
    <P>On a recent occasion I advanced what I thought was a conclusive proof that a man was 70 years of age, whereupon the Department came back and said that they had conclusive proof that the man was 69 years of age.  I then went to the man and I said &ldquo;There is no use in getting further into the mess; will you wait another year?&rdquo;  And he said &ldquo;Yes, very well.&rdquo;  I wrote back to the Department and said to them &ldquo;You have now asserted to me that the man is 69 years of age.  Will you promise to give him a pension in a year's time?&rdquo; They said &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;  They would probably start discussing it again.  I have the papers here and I will show them to the Minister.  These are the papers which bear out that statement that I have made.  That sort of thing simply exasperates the claimant for an old age pension.</P>
    <P>I do think it would be a very good thing and of great assistance if a schedule were introduced into this Bill stating the proofs which the Department would accept as final when a pensioner is before them.  Such a clause in the Schedule would be a great blessing and of great assistance.  I think I am entitled to suggest a thing that might be included in the Schedule in the Bill.  At present a birth certificate will be accepted as conclusive proof of age.  I would suggest that a certificate from the school roll where such was available, particularly the certificate from the manager of the school, would be accepted by the Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I shall take courage from the experience of Deputy Wolfe.  That is only one instance. Secondly, I suggest that if an affidavit is forthcoming from two pensioners who are prepared to swear the applicant is 70 years of age, unless the Department of Local Government and Public Health is prepared to prosecute these pensioners for perjury, any such affidavit taken before a Commissioner for Oaths ought to be accepted as conclusive proof of age.  Deputy Morrissey suggested a poster setting out simple instructions to pension claimants.  I suggest that the Department would set out a Schedule of certain things which they would accept as proofs of the claim for a pension. These would simplify, as far as it is possible to do so, the routine through which the old age pensioner must go when applying for a pension.</P>
      <P>In the next place, I would suggest that the present system of appeals be altered and that a Commissioner or some official should hear those appeals and not necessarily in Dublin.  I do not see why a Commissioner of appeals should not attend in the areas served by the Pension Committees and hear the pension claimants themselves.  At present, I do not quite know who puts the pensioner's case for a pension.  I suspect nobody does.  I think a pensioner is entitled to a personal hearing before his case is turned down, and I think the responsible official would find, if he had the opportunity of hearing the pensioner himself and not depend on a formal report from any Civil Servant, that the claimant would be able to lay before him much fuller information than could be extracted by correspondence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, with reference to blind pensions, I do not think there will be any very serious opposition to that part of the Bill.  There will be, and there should be, the gravest possible consideration given to the steps that must be taken to ascertain that that social <Col N="53" /> service is not abused.  Any reaction that arises in any country against social services has its foundation in the abuse of these social services. Deputy Murphy referred to the means test in a country close at hand.  But the principal reason why the means test is at present being used in the unjust way in which it is being used in portions of England is because of the abuse of the transitional benefit and the unemployment benefit in England. These abuses were scandalous, and the result is that a violent reaction arose and the people who ought not to be suffering now are suffering injustice as a result.  The Minister, I am sure, will endeavour so to construct this Bill that no person will receive a blind person's pension under circumstances which would give honest men an opportunity of saying, or an occasion for saying, that there was grave abuse of this social service.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should consult competent members of the medical profession and get their advice as to what would be a reasonable test of virtual blindness.  In that way he would be able to exclude from the benefit of this Bill people who are suffering from nothing more than serious deficiency of vision.  It is manifestly not the purpose of the Bill to relieve such persons, and it would be impossible to extend the social services so far.  I do not know if the Minister has consulted the medical profession. I am sure if he does he will find that a test can be devised, which will not be subject to abuse, by the Department of Finance, and will secure that everyone who ought to get a pension will get one and those who ought not will be properly excluded.</P>
    <P>Other questions will arise at a later stage and opportunity will be given, on looking into them when in Committee, of making suggestions to the Minister. I only hope that when we reach the Committee Stage the Bill will be considered by the Minister in the same spirit as the Minister for Agriculture considered the Butter Bill recently. The House then resolved itself into Committee for the purpose of improving the Bill, and the Minister showed himself anxious to meet any <Col N="54" /> legitimate objections that were raised and quite prepared to accept suggestions from those who criticised the measure in a helpful spirit.  I hope the same spirit will prevail when we consider this Bill in Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JasperTraversWolfe" hpid="Mr. Wolfe Mr. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish enthusiastically to support this Bill.  I am, and have always been, in favour of the principle underlying it.  I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary upon the fact that he made no delay in bringing in this measure.  He brought it in at the earliest possible moment in order to get rid of a long-standing grievance amongst the most deserving and needy population of this country.  I could never understand the morality that lay beneath the Act of 1924 when, at a time when economy was needed, the first attempt to bring about that economy was made at the expense of people who ought to be immune, people who had nothing between them and the grave except the workhouse or the old age pension.  I could never regard the 1924 Act as other than an immoral Act, an Act which ought to be got rid of at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary suggests that this measure is going to cost £300,000 a year.  Deputy Good thinks it is going to cost £400,000 a year. If I might venture a suggestion, I would be inclined to say that we could add another £100,000 and make the total £500,000.  That, however, does not get rid of the principle underlying the Bill.  I have no doubt that it will cost £500,000 a year.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary has underestimated the cost and I think Deputy Good, with great deference to his views on economy and finance, has also underestimated it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to observe that Deputy Good is coming round to our way of thinking.  He displayed a very enthusiastic interest in the agricultural population.  We are glad to find he is saying good-bye for the moment to the commercial interests and he is going to look after agricultural interests, interests that affect some of us very strongly.  Deputy <Col N="55" /> Good is afraid the agricultural interests will suffer.  He does not mind what will happen to commerce. He is afraid that this Bill will overtax the agricultural community of which, unfortunately, I am one, and a rather heavy taxpayer at that.  We are very glad to find we have a new recruit.  I am sure Deputy Good, now that he has joined our ranks, will remain with us as long as he remains in this House and that, I hope, will be a long time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Good forgets one point, and that is that agricultural ratepayers will not have to pay rates on agricultural land so long as the present Government remain in power.  The Fianna Fáil Party has pledged itself to grant complete agricultural derating. Deputy Good forgot that we, agriculturists, are entirely immune from rates.  I think when the Deputy was speaking of agricultural interests he was really thinking of commercial interests.  If he wants to join the agricultural party we would be very glad to have his support, but let him clearly remember that so far as we are concerned we are going to pay no rates.  I am with Deputy Murphy in saying that if we had to pay a little rate for the old age pensions we would not mind very much or have any great objection to doing so.</P>

      <P>I will try not to.  I agree that there are certain portions of this Bill which should be subjected to revision.  I think that this revision would be better carried out by a Select Committee than by a Committee of the Whole House.  The only <Col N="56" /> objection to a Select Committee is that there might be too much delay. There are certain questions as to cost and means which could not be debated satisfactorily across the House.  Nobody wants to deprive the old age pensioner of what has been taken from him or her since 1924.  I think it is generally recognised that a grave mistake was made in 1924 and the sooner that is put right the better.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of discussion about the present method of appeal.  There is a suggestion that there should be some alteration.  It has been suggested the question of age is a very difficult one to prove. I quite agree, but I will not stand by anybody who says that under the present system you do not get from the Local Government officials a full and fair hearing.  I have had experience of the fact that if you put up a reasonable case they will give you, to use a popular phrase, the fall of the trick.  They will do all they can to help.  My experience of the Old Age Pensions Department&mdash; and it is considerable&mdash;is that their methods do not give any grounds for a single grievance.  I will say the same with regard to means.  I do not know how Deputy Dillon or anybody else could suggest a court of appeal more favourable than the one that exists.  It costs nothing to go there.  I cannot conceive, and I would like to hear from Deputy Dillon in Committee, how he could suggest a method of appeal more favourable, less expensive&mdash;there being no expense attached to it&mdash;than the present method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have got a sympathetic hearing from the officials in the Department of Local Government, before whom I have appeared in connection with old age pensions.  They did everything they could to facilitate me: not only as to the question of means but also that of age.  Somebody has told Deputy Dillon that there was some difficulty about school certificates.  I want to make it clear that from officials in the Department of Local Government I have got suggestions to produce these certificates.  I have produced them where they were available, and <Col N="57" /> they looked upon them very favourably. The officials certainly give the appellant a fair run for his money, and if he has a prima facie case showing that he has reached the required age then his appeal succeeds.  Deputy Dillon suggested that instead of school certificates there should be affidavits from two people as to an applicant's age.  I am not going to say anything against affidavits.  The preparation of them is one of the methods by which I make my livelihood.  I much prefer the present system of school certificates to compelling people by set rule to produce two affidavits, and that when these are produced the old age pension is to be granted.  If that procedure is to be followed, then there is no applicant for an old age pension that I know of who will not be in a position to produce affidavits from two reputable people.  I think we should stick to the present system.  I suggest this to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the Minister, whom I am glad to see present: be sympathetic to the old age pensioners, try your appeals as you are doing at present and in a sympathetic manner.  If you do, there will be no grievance at all as regards age.</P>
    <P>On the question of means, I think that also has been fairly dealt with by the officials.  I am not at all sure that in getting rid of the section in the 1911 Act you are not landing the officials into a more difficult position than they are in at present.  I agree that this is not the time to discuss that, as it is a Committee point.  On the question of means, I found that the officials in the Department of Local Government, in every case I came across, dealt fairly with it, subject to statutory limitations put upon them.  They have to decide on a question of fact.  My experience of them has been this: that if the evidence enabled them to do so they decided in favour of the applicant. I would impress on the Parliamentary Secretary that he should be very slow before making any change in the present system or agree to send roving commissions around the country. If such commissions are sent out, they will mean that the unfortunate applicant for an old age pension will <Col N="58" /> have to go before a court and produce his witnesses.  He will have to get some sort of an attorney to appear and make a case for him, and before all that is done these old people will find themselves committed to a lot of expense which under the present system they are saved from incurring.  I do not think the present position, so far as the hearing of appeals is concerned, can be improved on at all.  I have always found it to be an extremely fair system.  Without any reservation whatever, I have very great pleasure in supporting the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. B. Maguire Mr. B. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>The criticism of this Bill has so far been very mild.  With one exception, the criticism that I have heard of it indicates a feeling of support for the measure.  There may be &ldquo;buts,&rdquo; but it seems to be generally agreed that the Bill is a good one. Some Deputies, in supporting the measure, have made advances on the recommendations contained in the Bill. Appeals have been made to the Minister to improve the measure so that further facilities may be given to old-age pension applicants.  The Minister has also been appealed to to interpret the Bill in a sympathetic manner so far as the old age pensioners are concerned. I myself believe that this Bill is a good one.  If it were possible to do so, I can see directions in which it could be improved as a medium for giving assistance to those in need of it in the country. If a spirit of kindliness is displayed in the House towards the Bill generally I suggest that is due not so much to love for the Bill itself, or to the kindliness that Deputies would extend to those concerned with the measure, but rather to a love of wooing the electorate in their various constituencies.  It is that I suggest that is at the back of their minds.</P>

      <P>Everything that has been said in approval of this Bill is in reality approval of the Budget passed here a few weeks ago, a Budget of which we heard such strong condemnation. This Bill is an interpretation, or part interpretation, of a <Col N="59" /> Budget that met with such severe criticism from the benches opposite. Deputies who opposed the Budget here, in the Press and down the country since have come in here to-day and approved of this Bill, which, in reality, means putting into effect part, at least, of the proposals that the Budget contains, proposals which at the time we were told were to bring such terrible consequences on the country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Good, at least, was honest. He has consistently advocated that this is a wrong thing to do.  He opposed the Budget and he opposed this Bill. He says this Bill is going to damage the farming community.  I do not agree with him there.  Of course, it is going to mean increased cost, and that will have to come out of revenue. Revenue will have to be raised somehow from the community.  I am rather surprised that Deputy Good has discovered now that the agricultural community are the people who are going to bear the cost of this.  Two years ago or so we discussed in this House the estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  On that occasion I referred to the very fact that Deputy Good dealt with here to-day: that the cost of the services of that Department was ultimately borne by the farming community, and that the people in the city of Dublin were getting far greater facilities under that Department than they were entitled to.  Deputy Good challenged my statement, and said that the city of Dublin was quite independent of the farming community and that my assertion was quite wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy on that occasion said that it was nonsense&mdash; nonsense was the actual word used&mdash; to suggest that the business people of Dublin were in any way dependent on the farming community.  Now we find, when it is convenient for Deputy Good to do so, that he discovers that increased expenditure for social services in the form of old age pensions is going to fall directly on the farming community, and he asserts that the <Col N="60" /> farming community is not able to bear any additional expenditure.  I agree with the latter part of his statement. They are not able to bear it, and I am sure they are not going to bear it, nor are they going to be asked to do so. The Budget that was criticised so severely by Deputy Good and Deputies of his sort on the benches opposite will find the revenue required, not from the farming community, who are not able to bear it, but from that portion of the community who can afford it, such as Deputy Good and others of his ilk.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon also said, I think, that the farming community would have to bear the cost of this.  The reply that I have made to Deputy Good extends to him.  He said that it was not fair to draw a parallel between the civil servant who receives a pension and the farmer or labourer down the country who will receive a pension under this Bill when it becomes an Act.  I entirely disagree with him.  I maintain that the farmers and the labourers whose production and work contribute in such a large degree to maintain the services of this State, if they are forced to produce at an uneconomic price and to live on the standard of living far below what is regarded as decent in any of the services referred to here, should at least, out of their own resources, get something, small though it be, in the form of a pension such as is contained in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The improvement in this Bill is welcomed by the farming community, despite Deputy Good's opposite opinion.  It is welcomed by them as a good thing, because they know the value of that service in their own homes or in their neighbour's homes, and I say that this Bill should be interpreted widely enough, that every person in this country who has worked up to the age of 70, be he labourer or farmer, should get a pension at the end of that service, and that that should be a first consideration and not a secondary consideration to any other service.  Deputy Dillon believes that the money will come back to the agriculturists in the country, and will be a sort of recompense, or reward, for the sum of money that the agriculturist is going to pay through tariffs. <Col N="61" /> I do not believe that the agriculturist is going to pay any such sum through tariffs.  Personally, I do not believe that he need pay an extra penny in tariffs, because he can buy Irish manufactured goods, and if he does so, he will pay very little in tariffs. I suggest that the sum of money required to finance this service will come out of the economies that are being effected by the Government, and that out of these economies, there will be saved enough to carry through this essential service.</P>
    <P>I do not like people to become alarmed over things they have not seriously considered, or, if they have considered them, have considered them from a partisan point of view, and to come and ask this House to consider their individual point of view as opposed to that of the general community.  I believe, as I say, that Deputy Good is, at least, honest in his criticisms.  Deputy Wolfe, when he appeals to the Minister to interpret this Act generously, is certainly not speaking his honest opinion.  I heard him, not much more than six months ago, in this House, denounce, in the strongest possible manner, an amendment introduced by the present Parliamentary Secretary to provide facilities to enable old age pensioners to have their case put in the best form before the Appeals Officer in the Local Government Department. He opposed that as wrong, and he was bigoted in his opposition, and now, when this Bill is introduced, despite his opposition, he is not satisfied with its contents which are certainly generous, as compared with the Bill it amends, and he wants it to be more generously interpreted. That is his appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary.  That sort of criticism and approval is the sort that is misleading and of no use.</P>
    <P>This Bill, I repeat, is a useful Bill, and it is a good Bill.  Unfortunately, the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister responsible, have not been able to include all the classes that I am sure they would like to have included, and the classes that we would all like to have included.  These are the cases that are just as deserving <Col N="62" /> as the cases of the blind people or the old age pensioners&mdash;the mentally defective, and chronic invalids.  These are people who should have this social service, but I am sure that it is not the will that has prevented their inclusion, but the resources available. With this Bill, wide as it is, I think the least that we could expect would be, at least, a cessation of that mock hypocrisy of asking for a wider interpretation.  The Bill satisfies the general farming community and for that reason I approve of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects of this Bill, at least, that appeal to me.  One&mdash;the major one, so far as my constituency is concerned&mdash;is the inducement held out to fathers and mothers, to assign their lands to some one or other of their sons.  If this Bill did nothing else, irrespective of its other provisions, I would approve of that aspect of it, so far as many areas in my constituency are concerned.  I have observed, in going around that constituency, entire townlands, in which the major portion of a large family has remained at home, while the father still persists in clinging on to the legal title to the piece of land. He dies ultimately between the age of 70 and 80, and the entire family is left without any settlement or arrangement.  When the father dies, equity proceedings are brought to apportion the shares, and the whole thing winds up in law costs, and nothing is left for the next-of-kin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Bill acts as an inducement or a tonic to the old men to part with their title, I welcome it, and I think it will have that effect.  If it has that tonic effect, it will mean that large tracts of quasi-barren land, which, by the industry of generations, have been made to produce something in the nature of crops, will be prevented from becoming derelict.  I can visualise large areas of County Donegal which, in fifty years' time would have gone barren again, if this did not take place, because what would happen is, that while three or four sons remain at home, the father retains the legal title to the holding, and when the father dies, none of <Col N="63" /> the sons would get anything, and there they would remain until they all died of old age, and the homestead toppled down and all the land became waste.  That may appear, perhaps, an extravagant statement, but I assure the House it is absolutely correct.</P>
    <P>The second part of which I approve &mdash;and I am open to conviction as to whether or not the distinction should be drawn&mdash;is the question of means. In a constituency like mine, you have perhaps industrious families, the members of which, owing to economic conditions at home, had to strike out for themselves.  You have the case of one family which had an adventurous spirit, and which struck out, and made good, and the parents, out of money which their children sent home, renovated their existing house or built a new house&mdash;a house, in many cases, completely out of proportion to the size and value of the holding. When the old people became of age to qualify for a pension, and applied for that pension, the pension officer, knowing the house, which has been provided through the generosity and good-will of their children, in America, perhaps, comes to the conclusion that these people are in comfortable circumstances, and lodges an appeal against the decision of the Pensions Committee to grant the application, knowing the actual conditions of the household.  In many cases, it is very difficult to dislodge that appeal.  In County Donegal, there are thousands of cases where that applies, and if this Bill abolishes that line of demarcation and that handicap, I welcome it.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of muddleheaded talk here with regard to the conduct of the Old Age Pensions Department. I do not know whether Deputy Dillon was actually talking about that Department, or whether he was dreaming, but I say that it is not fair to make this onslaught on civil servants in this House, when they are precluded from defending themselves, and I join with Deputy Wolfe in saying that, in any contact I had with that <Col N="64" /> Department, when I had a reasonable case that convinced myself, I was able to convince the officer, and any time I have not a case that would convince myself, I do not want to convince anybody. I must say that I have put forward cases of the kind Deputy Dillon referred to and succeeded, and I cannot say that in any case I put forward to the Department there has been any cause for complaint by reason of the attitude of the officials. I want to put that on record as against what Deputy Dillon says.  In so far as the small farmer in County Donegal is offered an inducement to assign his land to one of his sons, and to give him the right to this quasi-barren land, and in so far as the line of demarcation that was previously drawn is cleared away, I approve of this measure.</P>

      <P>If there is anything that will cause a wave of rejoicing throughout the whole country it is the speech made by the Parliamentary Secretary on this Bill.  A very great tribute has been paid to the Parliamentary Secretary, because those who voted against this Bill when it was introduced two years ago are now silent. When I heard Deputy McMenamin speaking I was wondering if he accepted all the implications of the policy of the Cumann na nGaedhael Party when he was standing as a candidate at the General Election, seeing that that Party, after this House voting for the Bill, refused to find the money to relieve old age pensioners.  This Bill will undoubtedly benefit the farmers and I am glad that there is a Government in power that is going to give them fair play, despite the wails of the Chambers of Commerce as echoed by Deputy Good.  The Deputy stated that the country could not afford this measure.  We heard the same thing before, and particularly that the agricultural community could not afford it.  Deputy Good represents a County Dublin constituency, and I would remind him that he supported here proposals to give pensions to individuals who are not as badly off as the farming community.  At that period Deputy Good did not show any <Col N="65" /> sympathy with the poor farmers and say that they could not bear this extra burden.  We did not hear that proposal from Deputy Good when the Military Service Pensions Act was being passed, or when the Act giving pensions to civil servants was being passed.  Not a word did the Deputy say then about how he felt.</P>

      <P>It is about time we turned to the money bags of someone other than the farmers.  I can assure Deputy Good that his turn will come. Anybody who has been in any way connected with the administration of old age pensions during the last few years will welcome this Bill.  They will be glad the time is ended when a gentleman visits a poor old man to find out how many hens he had, how many eggs they laid, and inquires if he got any money at Christmas from his son in America.  At the end, the man would nearly be persuaded that the cocks would lay.  It is rather amazing that in the whole House only two Die-hards raised their voices against this measure, Deputy Good and the ex-Minister for Local Government.  Deputy Mulcahy, who, whether he likes it or not, was a member of a Government that refused to provide the money for this Bill two years ago.  Of course Deputy Good represents the old Diehard class, and will never be converted. I ask Deputy Good, as he was a fairly consistent supporter of the last Government, to remember the actions of that Government, and to remember <Col N="66" /> that any farmer or man who works on the land up to seventy years of ago is much more entitled to a pension than a civil servant, no matter who he may be.  Work on the land is tougher and the hours longer than in the civil service.  It is only last year that I saw the system that was being adopted to prevent an agricultural labourer, on reaching 70 years of age, getting the pension.  In this instance a gentleman came round in a motor car and inquired if the labourer had worked anywhere during the previous twelve months, what he was paid, and whether he got food and lodgings and an ounce of tobacco on Saturday night. The value was totted up and, between the food the man got from the farmer, the couple of shillings he got once in a while, and the ounce of tobacco, it was decided that he was only entitled to a pension of 6/- That was the state of affairs under the régime of the late Government, which was supported by Deputy Good.  I am sure the country, is glad as I am, that that régime is finished.  If there is one thing that we can congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on it is, that, within three months of this Government coming into office, he is carrying out the, pledges that were given to the old age pensioners. I am glad that the House practically unanimously endorses these pledges, considering the fate that the Bill introduced two years ago met with, preventing old age pensioners getting their right, and considering the fact that the Executive Council of those days, which refused to find the money, went out of office rather than give any relief to the poorest section of the community.</P>

      <P>As one who supported the Bill introduced by the present Parliamentary Secretary when he was a Deputy, I have much pleasure in supporting this Bill.  It follows, more or less, along the lines of the one which was then introduced and is, I feel, an attempt to deal in an equitable and in a generous way with a very deserving class of the community.  It removes very many anomalies which were present in the old Acts and I believe will have the whole-hearted backing of the citizens of the State. <Col N="67" /> One would think by the way some Deputies have spoken that when this Bill becomes law no inquiries whatever will have to be made into the circumstances of an applicant for the old age pension.  I am in entire sympathy with the Bill, and I intend to support it in all its Stages, but I want to get rid of the false impression that must be pretty generally accepted in this House&mdash;if I am to judge by the speeches recently delivered&mdash;that when the Bill becomes law no inquiries whatever will be made, and all that an applicant will have to do will be to walk up to the pension officer or the Pension Committee and state that he is 70 years or over, and, hey presto, the money will come from some unknown source and everything in the garden will be lovely.  That is a kind of criticism that one would not expect from a House constituted as this is. I deprecate that kind of criticism because it gives a very false impression to the country.  I fear many people will be disappointed when they go to look for pensions if the class of speech to which we have listened is delivered at the cross roads.  I have said that this Bill attempts to deal in an equitable way with a deserving class.  I will mention at random one section, the young man or woman upon whom was cast the grave responsibility of supporting an aged parent.  I want the Parliamentary Secretary, to make that perfectly clear in the Statute.  I hope that there will be no ambiguity about it.  Where an aged parent has a son with the sense of filial affection so well developed that he is prepared to maintain the old person, the cost of maintenance does not debar that old person from getting the old age pension.  The Parliamentary Secretary has made the matter fairly clear, but I should like to see it freed of all ambiguity.  That was one of the greatest blots on the old Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another feature of this Bill will be welcome to many thrifty persons. Many persons make provision, through the medium of trade unions and other agencies, such as insurance companies, for benefits or allowances when they reach a certain age.  In the <Col N="68" /> majority of cases, they are struggling workmen or workwomen who pinch and scrape to make provision for old age.  Under the old Act, if the sum payable amounted to 10/- or 12/- weekly, a person of 70 years of age would get only a small allowance up to about 6/-.  I understand that the effect of this Bill will be that the person who is thrifty enough to make provision for himself to the extent of 8/- or 10/- a week will not be debarred from receiving the full pension of 10/- when he reaches the eligible age. Another useful feature of the Bill is the extension of the pension to blind persons of 30 years of age.  I came across many cases of blind persons who were forced to enter county homes or unions, as they were then called.  They were unable to follow their usual occupation owing to early blindness. In many industries here, men and women lose their sight quickly.  This is so in the tailoring and lace-making industries.  Many persons engaged in those industries become blind very early in life or their sight becomes so imperfect that they are unable to follow their usual avocations.  Those people have to be maintained by the community, somehow, and I think that this is an attempt to enable those people to live in some kind of decency and to maintain their self-respect rather than to have them seeking entry to the county homes.  There are many features of the Bill with which I should like to deal, but I do not want to delay the House. The section dealing with assignment of farms should have very useful effects in many directions but, particularly, in the direction of encouraging members of the farming community to marry at an earlier age than at that which they are marrying at present.  There is an abnormal number of bachelor farmers. They are precluded from marriage until a very late age, the result being that there are numbers of women widowed at an early age, sometimes with young families.  That is not a desirable state of affairs in this or in any other country.  The fear is ever-present with the old people that if they make over the farm to one of their sons they will be no longer masters in their own <Col N="69" /> house.  This measure is calculated to relieve that position somewhat and to lead to a reduction of the number of bachelor farmers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, as I welcomed the former measure introduced by the Minister.  I hope that it will get the support of the majority of the House. The kind of criticism directed against members of the House, who may be as sincere as the Parliamentary Secretary and as sincere as I am in supporting this measure, is not helpful.  It should not be said that members of the Opposition who intend to vote for this measure are acting with motives other than those of the best interests of the country.  If we are to be told that members support this or that measure because of political considerations at times of election, it will not be good for politics nor will it be good for the tone of the debates in this House.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the Second Reading of the Bill, and I welcome it for the help that it gives with regard to such things as the question of means.  Those of us who have been connected with old-age pension committees have experienced very considerable difficulty in getting over the impediments put forward by local pensions officers in connection with deciding what are the correct means whereby to estimate an applicant's right to an old-age pension.  I must candidly say that the impediments that have been placed in the way and the value put on means have certainly been illuminating from our point of view. Every impediment that could possibly have been put on a person getting an old-age pension has usually been put by the local pensions officer when overruling the views of the local sub-committee. An old woman living in a labourer's cottage has been debarred because she did not happen to be the mother of the occupant.  The god father of a small farmer's wife has been debarred because the estimate of means carried him beyond what was laid down by the regulations as interpreted by the local pensions officer. This Bill is certainly giving a very elastic interpretation to the question of means.  I believe that it is rectifying what was undoubtedly a grave injustice to those people in denying them the right which they were morally bound to get under the Act of Parliament. Blind people who are debarred by their affliction from earning their livelihood deserve our greatest sympathy. I think this Bill is removing a very great disability under which many of these people laboured in connection with the question of means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that that part of the Bill which deals with the question of the farmer who would be induced to assign his farm to his son requires the exercise of the greatest caution.  In a great <Col N="71" /> many cases farmers put their eldest son to work&mdash;they get him a position. These sons are a very great help either in keeping the farmer in his farm or educating the younger brothers.  I have not come across the difficulties enumerated by other speakers with regard to them, although I daresay they are as eager to retain their farms&mdash;refusing to go out and let the younger generation take possession of their holdings&mdash;as a shopkeeper is to retain his shop.  I feel that this is one part of the Bill in regard to which caution should be exercised, as it would be most liable to abuse.  At this time when agriculture is subject to such disabilities I can foresee that a very large number of farmers, even those holding large farms, would be very likely to hand over their farms, in order to get another 10/- per week added to the income of the household at the expense of the State.  We have an aged population very much out of proportion to the younger generation in this country owing to the tremendous volume of emigration in the past, and I think we would be very wise to explore very carefully that side of the Bill and insert certain safeguards.</P>
    <P>I know one case where an elder brother of a small farmer was denied an old age pension because the estimate of the pensions officer was very much exaggerated with regard to the means.  I think that this Bill will be of great help in such cases.  There will also undoubtedly be a very great amount of good done in the case of an old age pensioner who has to enter a county home or hospital in giving him the right when he comes out to get his old age pension again. It will certainly be an act of justice and Christian charity and it ought to be welcomed by everyone.  Even if it involves a little more taxation, it will certainly help the rates and certainly help to do what I believe to be right.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of criticism of civil servants receiving pensions.  I think the two cases are not exactly on all-fours.  It would be impossible to hand over every section of the community to the rates and taxes for pensions.  If we did <Col N="72" /> we probably would have to tax the community very much beyond the extent to which we are taxing them to-day.  The reduction of the age of the blind person for pension meets with my approval, and I believe it is a step in the right direction.  However much we may have to increase our taxes we have to do this act of common justice.</P>
    <P>There is another side of the Bill and that is that in the past those in receipt of pensions from the British Government, for certain considerations, were debarred from getting old age pensions because of the size of the allowance that was given them in respect of certain losses that they had sustained.  That I believe was a wrong principle, and I believe it could be rectified in the Bill it would be a great act of justice.  I do not think any of us that have to do with the administration of the Old Age Pensions Act could fail to be gratified at the assistance this Bill is going to give in obtaining for those entitled to the benefit of the Old Age Pensions Act the privileges to which they are entitled.  I think the fact, that after a long life of usefulness in the State those people are being remembered and helped, is something that every one of us will welcome.  I for one heartily welcome the Bill for the help it gives.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill as a measure that will alleviate the sufferings, privations and hardships of a large number of people in their old age.  It seemed to me that there was something wanting in the previous Old Age Pension Acts to make them the success they were intended to be.  As far as I can see, this Bill will, to a very great degree, remove these defects.  As regards pensions for blind persons of 30 and over I think that the phrase &ldquo;so blind that they are not able to earn their living at their ordinary occupations&rdquo; is the only one that is justifiable.  I do not wish to go into details on the Bill except to say that I approve of it, and I am sure if the financial circumstances permitted it there would be a greater degree of support to the aged.  I hope to see the day when an arrangement between <Col N="73" /> the Department of Local Government and the National Insurance Societies will be arrived at whereby every person not able to earn his own livelihood will receive a pension at 65 years of age.</P>

      <P>I want to make a few remarks, particularly because some Deputies challenged the direct representatives of the farmers as to what their attitude upon this Bill is. As one who has experience on pension committees I would say this: this Bill is removing a barrier that is depriving and has deprived a good many deserving applicants from the relief they are entitled to.  It will certainly put an extra burden on the taxes but I am quite satisfied that the advantages which will accrue will more than counteract that.  The only thing I ask is that in the Committee Stage of this Bill care would be taken that it should not be left open to any one to take advantage of the taxpayers. I welcome principally the provision in this Bill which gives independence to the poor, unfortunate person who has to seek the county home or the hospital, and at the same time comes to the assistance of the ratepayer.  I welcome this Bill in its entirety.  As a direct representative of the farming community I say it is supplying a long felt want and I believe that whatever sacrifices the farmers have to make in the way of extra contribution will be more than counterbalanced by the good that will result from this Bill when it becomes an Act.</P>

I suggest to the Minister that he might use his influence in the Committee Stage to make this a purely departmental affair under the direction of the Minister for Local Government.</P>

      <P>It is pleasant to hear <Col N="74" /> the approval with which this Bill has been received on all sides of the House.  At the same time, it should not be necessary for us to emphasise our approval except for the fact that Deputy Corry would tell us that if we remain silent we should be showing signs of a guilty conscience with regard to the administration of this Act.  On the other hand, Deputy Maguire tells us that if we approve of it in an outspoken manner our approval is either hyprocisy or is misleading. At the expense perhaps of offending both these Deputies, I wish to approve of the Bill on behalf of a portion of the country where its advantages will be very great and where it will be very well received.  Its cost will have to be borne by another portion of the community.  I say on behalf of that portion who will have to pay the cost that they will be very glad to do so because they will feel that the advantages that will accrue from the Bill will more than compensate for the expense that it will entail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told here this evening that approval of this Bill means approval of the terms of the Budget. I do not see that there is any connection. I do not see that one proposition is the converse of the other.  I maintain that whatever party came into power and would be in power and whatever Budget would be brought in or whatever financial regulations would have to be made for the administration, of this State for the next twelve months, this Bill would be necessary because the administration of the Old Age Pensions Act has come to such a degree that it is overloaded and bristling with objections and disadvantages for those who should be in receipt of the old age pension.  You will see that the Parliamentary Secretary has found it necessary to frame this Bill practically altogether on amendments.  That shows us that in the past the old age pensions have not been administered with sympathy towards the deserving class that it was intended to relieve. I have been connected with the administration of old age pensions for nearly a quarter of a century&mdash;since they were first instituted.  Originally, <Col N="75" /> the Bill was brought in for the purpose of providing pensions for those who had attained the age of 70, after working until they were no longer able to work.  I think that every amendment that was brought in since was brought in for the express purpose of preventing those needy and deserving people from getting relief.  I think, on that account, that this Bill comes at a very opportune time.  It is intended to bring this Act back to what it was originally intended to be, to bring relief to the most deserving class of our people who have worked hard and who are unable to work any longer. It is necessary to emphasise the word &ldquo;deserving&rdquo; because whatever you do there will be undeserving persons who will try to avail of the clauses of it.  I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary will see that the Bill will in no way cover the claims of those who will be undeserving and who may have deliberately deprived themselves of their own means in order to get the pension.  There is a class in the community who I am sure at all times are only too ready to avail of such Acts as this.</P>
    <P>During the debate to-day there was a good deal of criticism of the present administration.  Some of it was levelled at the pensions officers.  I think if there is any charge to be levelled at the pensions officers it is owing to the fact that they were tied up by restrictions, and any blame there may be cannot fairly be attributed to them.  I think they did their best in most difficult circumstances, and often went to a very great deal of trouble, outside their official duties, to help claimants in getting the pension.</P>
    <P>With regard to the notices that Deputy Morrissey suggested should be put up in certain offices, I think that case would be met by the issue of instructions to the pension officers and the Old Age Pension Committees.</P>
    <P>Another matter that I might raise here is that in some cases old age pensions were granted to people over 70 and it was found after some time that some mistake had been made in the granting of them.  These old people were brought before a Court on <Col N="76" /> charges of fraud, and orders for the recovery of these sums were made.  In cases of that kind, if not in all cases, I think very often the trouble was due to some technical error by the Committee or the pension officer.  I think in future these cases should not be pursued.  I think the Bill on the whole is a good one, and if it is worked properly it will do very much to smooth the administration of the Act as it was originally intended, and to provide for a deserving and helpless portion of our population who had worked hard, and who were unable to provide for themselves when they could no longer work.</P>

Is mór an tairbhe dhéanfaidh an Bille seo do mhuintir na tíre, go mór mór do mhuintir Chiarraighe mar gheall ar an méid daoine atá ansan go mbeidh neart dóibh pinsean d'fháil fén mBille seo nuair a bheidh sé ina dhlí.  Is mór an congnamh a thabharfa sé do sna daoine seo.  Táimíd go léir ag súil leis an am go mbeidh an Rialtas ábalta ar phinsin do thabhairt do dhaoine nuair a bheid cúig bliana is trí fichid, agus tá súil agam nách fada go bhféadfaimíd cógháirdeachas a dhéanamh leis an Rialtas mar gheall ar é dhéanamh ach tá a lán constaicí rompa fós.  Dubhairt an Teachta O Néill ná raibh aon bhaint ag an mBille seo, agus ag an mBudget le na chéile. Deirim-se go ghfuil, mar beidh ar an Aire Airgid an t-airgead is gá i gcóir costaisí an Bhille seo a sholáthar.</P>

      <P>There are a few blemishes in previous Old Age Pension Acts that I do not think the provisions of this Bill are going to remove. For instance, the value of maintenance was always considered against an applicant even though the person is maintained in the house of some person who is no blood relation at all.  Their maintenance there was taken at a certain assessed value and their claim to a pension was lessened accordingly.  I see nothing in this Bill to remedy that.  I do not know whether this is the proper place to do it.</P>

      <P>If it is repealed I will be very pleased.  There is another matter. It is the case of two or three people on a small farm who have reached the age of 70.  Although the vesting order has been made out in the name of one member of the family and he is in possession for 37 or 38 years, the rest of the family are debarred because of the means clause.  I say it is an evasion of the terms of the Act.  It may not be possible to remove that disability in the case of one person but certainly it ought not to apply to any of the others.  A man is in possession for 37 or 38 years.  A vesting order is in his possession for 20 or 21 years. Still every member of his family would have, according to the pensions authority, an equal claim to the means derived from this smallholding.  I say that is cruel, and if this Bill removes it I welcome it for that alone if for nothing else.  I do not see, however, where it is done.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, it is a very pleasant task to conclude the debate on a Bill that has been received with such general approval as the Bill at present before the House.  For all practical purposes, there has not been <Col N="78" /> any real opposition to the Bill.  There were two or three Deputies who made some kind of a case against it, but I think it could be observed that they were more or less halting about the case, and they did not have their heart in it.  I presume some people in this House have to take up the position of opposing certain measures whether they approve of them or not. In the course of Deputy Mulcahy's remarks on the Bill, he complained that this particular class of the community absorbed one-eighth of the tax revenue.  That may or may not be so, but I am not particularly impressed by, that.  When one considers the amount of tax revenue absorbed by the old age pensioner class in this country, one must also take into consideration the contributions that that particular class of the community makes towards State revenue, and I think it will be generally agreed that the class affected by this Bill contribute at least three-fourths of the tax revenue of this country, and in that way I think they are morally entitled to a retiring allowance when they have reached the time of life when they are no longer able to earn a living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy was critical of the effects of the repeal of Section 7 of the Old Age Pensions Act, 1924.  I think that on Wednesday night, and again to-day, I dealt with the effects of Section 7 in considerable detail. Under Section 7 a farmer could assign his farm regardless of the valuation or size of the farm, and after a period of three years the income from that farm would cease to be taken into consideration in calculating his means. That is the law at the present time. What this Bill proposes to do is to remove the three years' limit so that if a farmer does will or assign his farm he will not have to wait three years after assigning, until he is 73 years of age, before that farm would cease to be taken into consideration. It appears to me, apart altogether from the other arguments advanced regarding the right of a farmer to retire from business after his 70 years of contribution to the State service in taxation, direct or indirect, that the son, who, by the time the old man has <Col N="79" /> reached 70 years, has himself reached the age of 35 or 40 years and has worked on the farm for a period of 20 or 25 years, and has given his labour free&mdash;it seems to me that the son has established a moral claim on that holding that would be sufficient to buy out the average holding, and that the old man when he has reached that age has thereby to a great extent forfeited his moral claim&mdash;at any rate, to a considerable amount of the income from the holding.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy complains that there is nothing in the Bill to prevent a mother maintained by her son from drawing a pension.  Well, there is not. There is no intention of preventing this.  That is  the very case that Deputy Gorey referred to where the father and mother remain on in the holding after it has been assigned and they are still maintained by the son. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent that.  As a matter of fact, the Bill has been deliberately aimed at securing that the free maintenance that is at the present time taken into consideration in estimating the means of a claimant, will cease to be taken into consideration.  At the present time, if a farmer assigns his place to his son and remains on under the roof, the benefit or privilege of remaining under the roof will accrue to him.  And though he has no legal right to be there, though he is there by virtue of sentimental ties binding a son to his parents and not by any legal claim that benefit or privilege is estimated at being worth so much per week ranging from 10/- to £1 of income.  That, I think, is the most far-reaching section in this new Bill&mdash;the repeal of paragraph (d) of the Act of 1911 that up to the present has operated to take into consideration charity and free maintenance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy said that the amount spent on old age pensions in County Donegal would represent, I think he said 11/11 in the £ of rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>About that, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>And 13/- odd in Mayo. That appears to me to be an indication of the poverty of the people in Donegal and Mayo.  Under the present Bill I <Col N="80" /> believe and hope that in these poor counties where there are so many small holdings and where free maintenance would no longer be taken into consideration the amount per head of the population in these areas that will be spent on old ago pensions will be considerably increased.  I would like to point out in that connection to Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Good and the other Deputies in the House that the effect of this Bill merely brings about a distribution of the country's resources.</P>
      <P>Three hundred thousand, four hundred thousand, or half-a-million pounds in the year&mdash;whatever the sum may be, we are not able to estimate it with any degree of accuracy at present-that money is going to be distributed amongst the poorer section of the community. It is going to be taken from the people who can afford to part with it, namely, the people who will now pay 5/- in the pound income tax and the people who will pay super-tax.  The Deputy, of course, will not like that, but the destitution which now exists amongst the poor must be relieved and the people who can afford the burden of relieving that destitution will have to shoulder that burden.  I might mention in connection with this expenditure that the money will not be hoarded, and it will not go out of the country.  The 10/- a week that certain people will get as a result of the Bill will be spent in this country, and will be spent on providing the necessaries of life for those pensioners, their dependents, or the children of their dependents.</P>
      <P>A point has been mentioned about the possibility of mutual relations between the Free State area and the Six-County area.  The fact is that we have not had any such relations up to the present regarding old age pensions. Any person can come into the Twentysix County area and can claim a pension, but a person going from the Free State into the Six-County area could not make such a claim.  It is merely to regularise the position that this question of residence and nationality has been brought into the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey makes the complaint <Col N="81" /> that the Bill is largely legislation by reference.  That is so and I suppose the time is approaching when, if there are many further Amending Acts to the old age pensions code, a codifying measure will be necessary.  Short of a codifying measure any Old Age Pension Bill must be naturally legislation by reference. I think Deputy Morrissey also made the point that the thrifty man who has amassed or saved a certain amount of money and put it into banks or otherwise invested it, is going to be penalised or that he is penalised under the existing law.  Apparently he is under the impression that we are going to penalise him under this Bill.  I do not think Deputy Morrissey has read all the sections of the Bill very carefully. Under the section of the Bill that deals with this particular class, the section that alters the method of calculating means in the case of money or property invested or capable of investment; at the present time, such property or such income is estimated to be one-tenth of the capital value after setting aside a sum of £25.  We propose under this Bill to take one-twentieth of the capital value of such money so that instead of such income being calculated at the rate of 10 per cent. under the Bill, it will be calculated at the rate of 5 per cent., so that the accumulation of a couple of hundred pounds by a thrifty man, the accumulation of, say, £200 will not operate to deprive him of a pension under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Morrissey also raised the question of the status of pension clerks.  The status of pension clerks is at present under consideration and on the question of remuneration, so far as I am aware, pension clerks are now being put on a salaried basis and the other basis of remuneration is being discontinued. The question of secret instructions does not arise under this Bill.  I think it was Deputy Morrissey referred to that.  I am not aware that there is any reality in the phantom of the mysterious instructions alleged to be given to pension officers, but I think if there are such mysterious instructions Deputy Morrissey will have to tackle the Minister for Finance on that particular issue.  There is not <Col N="82" /> any doubt that appeals in future will be much fewer than in the past because we are removing by this Bill all the clauses that have created confusion in the minds of pension officers and claimants.  The result of the Bill will be to simplify the administration of the old age pensions laws, and I anticipate that the necessity for appeals will be very greatly diminished and that the number of appeals will be considerably less after the Bill is in operation for a short time.</P>
    <P>I believe that Deputy Good in his heart feels some sympathy with the old age pensioners.  He complains here that we cannot afford to do the things that we would like to do.  I assume from that that Deputy Good would really like to be more generous to the old age pensioners but that he feels that we cannot afford to be more generous.  If it comes to that, it is a matter of making up our minds as to whom we can afford to be generous. The Deputy says that there are other classes in the community, the people he represents here, and he would naturally stand up for them, the people who pay income tax and super-tax and, I presume, the members of the Associated Chambers of Commerce, who deserve consideration. He thinks we should be careful of their interests.  Frankly I am more concerned with the people affected by this Bill, the poor and the old age pensioners, and if anybody has to go to the wall, as I said before&mdash;I do not know if Deputy Good was here then&mdash;if anybody has to go to the wall in finding the finances for the Bill, the people who least feel the sacrifice are the people who will be called upon to make it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Good talks about the agricultural position being depressed.  We all agree with Deputy Good in that. He says that the agricultural community cannot carry the burden, but the two most far-reaching clauses in this Bill are meant to secure and will in actual operation secure, that a very considerable sum of money will be taken from people who are not agriculturists and distributed amongst the agricultural community by allowing the farmers to assign their farms to their children and by taking out <Col N="83" /> the clause whereby free maintenance on the farmstead is counted as income for old age pension purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and the income tax. Deputy Murphy raised some other questions that could be more appropriately raised on the Estimates, questions of over-payments and the question of evidence of age, but at any rate I think it will be admitted that so far as old age pensions appeals are concerned on the ground of age, any reasonable evidence of age, anything that will indicate in a reasonable manner that a person has reached the statutory age, is being accepted and has been accepted in the Appeals Department and will continue to be accepted.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon hopes that later, on the Committee Stage, there will be some amendment that will mitigate the sweeping effect of the means test. I do not know if Deputy Dillon understands the natural consequential reactions of this Bill any more than Deputies who have no knowledge of the law.  Means will still be taken into consideration.  This Bill does not propose that old age pensions should be awarded in future regardless of whether people have means or have not.  Means will still be taken into consideration, but charity will no longer be taken into consideration, nor will the things that a person gets, the various benefits and privileges such as free food, clothing and shelter, be taken into consideration.  Income will be taken into consideration, income from cash, income from investments and anything that can be looked upon as constituting income in the ordinary common-sense interpretation of the term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has also mentioned the question of accepting school records and affidavits as evidence of age.  School records are accepted as evidence of age unless there is something extracted from a school record that would go to indicate that such <Col N="84" /> school record could not be relied upon. School records very often operate against a claimant for the reason that children were registered considerably younger in school records than they actually were as a general rule.  When you find such obvious inconsistencies in a school register as that two children were born in the same family within a period of six months of each other, then obviously that school register cannot be relied upon.  Deputy Anthony was worried that the means test was being abolished.  I think that between this and the Committee Stage, when the Deputy gets a better opportunity of studying the clause, he may realise that we have not put an end to, or abolished, the means test.</P>
    <P>Deputy Goulding seems to have been worried on the same point.  He was enquiring whether anyone cannot get a pension.  It is not true that anyone can get a pension, and when Deputy Goulding begins to advocate the giving of pensions in the County Waterford he will realise that we have not been so sweeping in our amendments as he seems to think. Deputy Brooke Brasier is terribly upset about Section 7.  He apparently does not understand the section.  I would not blame him for not understanding Section 7, but he does not even understand what the effect of repealing Section 7 would be.  He warns us that we will require to approach the administration of old age pensions law with great caution if section 7 is taken out of the old age pensions law.  Deputy Brooke Brasier should realise that we are not compelling any farmer to assign his farm at the present time.  We are not compelling him to hand it over to his son, but we are providing that if he wants to hand it over to his son he will not have to wait three years in order to qualify for a pension.  At the present time, as has been pointed out repeatedly in the course of the debate though apparently it has not sunk in, a farmer can assign his farm and if he waits three years after the assignment he can apply for a pension without having the income from the farm taken into consideration in calculating his means. <Col N="85" /> What we are now doing is to enable such a farmer without having to wait for three years to assign his farm and apply right away.  He can divest himself of his property for family reasons or for other reasons other than purely to enable him to apply for an old age pension.  Deputy O'Neill was telling us that any Government would have introduced an Old Age Pensions Bill such as this.  So far the debate had been conducted, as one would like to see a debate such as this conducted, and the Bill has been examined and approached purely on its merits, and we had to wait for Deputy O'Neill to introduce a political element.  When Deputy O'Neill does that we must reply in his own way and we must point out to him how a much less far-reaching Bill was introduced in this House and passed in this House, and that the Government of the day, the Government of the Party to which Deputy O'Neill is now attached resigned rather than give effect to the terms of that Bill.  And it is nonsense for Deputy O'Neill to come in now and try to cover up his political face, to make political capital out of it and say that he cannot oppose this Bill.  It is going to be carried whether Deputy O'Neill opposes it or not.  Deputy Gorey raised two points. He understands the position now in reference to the first point he raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The other point he raised was that if there were three members of a family to one of whom the place had been willed and if the person to whom the place had been willed did not take out probate, then no one of the three could get the old age pension in such a case.  The only possible explanation of that would appear to be the interpretation that is given to paragraph (d), namely, that account shall be taken of any privilege or benefit enjoyed by the claimant.  The free maintenance that was extended to the other two members of the family by the person benefiting under the will was estimated as being worth so much that neither was entitled to an old age pension under the existing enactments if that interpretation is correct.  Under <Col N="86" /> the present Bill both those old people who did not own the place, but who lived with the person who did own it, would become entitled to pensions.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary did not reply to my question in reference to sub-section (3) of Section 2: Whether a man who had been away say for fifty years in America and who had contributed some small sum annually to some dependent here could come back at the end of that time and claim a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I overlooked that point raised by Deputy Good.  Apparently Deputy Good is on new and strange ground in a discussion about old age pensions.  Deputy Good is altogether unaware of the fact that this very enactment is a repetition of the existing law.  This very enactment of which he complained has been the law since the first Old Age Pensions. Act was passed and a person who, while in America had contributed to the upkeep of a dependent relative here at home, would have the time during which he contributed taken into account as residence for old age pension purposes.  That was the law even before the Free State came into existence and while England administered the law here.</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary say whether it is not a fact that under the Bill, as it now stands, a man owning a substantial farm, say in Waterford or Dublin, of 150 acres and having no capital invested and having passed over the farm to his son living on that substantial holding, could on reaching the age of 70 years apply for the old age pension and get it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact that in theory such a farmer could apply for an old age pension and get it, and it is equally a fact that under the Act of 1924, which we are now amending, if such a farmer assigned his farm when he was 67 years of age, if he was well enough informed to do so, when he reached 70 years the income from the farm would not be calculated against him in the calculation of means.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's point appears to be that a farmer can assign his farm regardless of the size and immediately apply for an old age pension and get it under the terms of the Bill.  My reply is that he certainly can, but under the Act of 1924, for which the Deputy had some responsibility, a farmer was empowered by Section 7 to assign the farm, but he was compelled to wait at least three years before applying for the pension; otherwise the farm would be taken into consideration in calculating his means. There could be no point, that any common sense person would advance anyhow, in allowing a man to assign his farm if it was intended to deprive him of the old age pension, following the assignment, by reason of the fact <Col N="88" /> that he got free maintenance, food, clothing and shelter from the person to whom it was assigned.</P>
      <P>This Bill requires that if a farmer assigns his farm, free maintenance, food, clothing and shelter from the son will not operate to prevent him getting the pension.  The reason ought to be obvious.  A farmer assigns his farm under the existing law and waits three years.  The position is if the son takes him by the shoulder and puts him outside the house, he gets a pension of 10/- a week immediately, but if the son does the christian thing to his father and gives him food, clothing and shelter, which his 70 years in that home entitle him to, he loses his old age pension.  We want to preserve the christian conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The assignment of the farm is simply obscuring the situation. Under the Bill, no matter what luxurious circumstances a person may be living in on a farm or in a city house, if that person has no means directly coming to him he becomes entitled to the pension.</P>

Take a person living in a city house.  Can that person claim a pension, on attaining 70 years, if living with wealthy relatives in Dublin, Cork, Waterford or anywhere else?</P>

A man can divest himself of a farm by way of family settlement. Presumably he can also divest himself of other property by way of family settlement, but I think this will not operate to any great extent outside farms.</P>

    <P>I move these amendments with the object of getting the schedule at the end of the Bill deleted.  It was thought that this was the best form in which it could be done.  There are several consequential amendments. In debating Amendments 3 and 4 we will decide all the amendments.  There was a certain amount of debate on the question on the last day mainly as regards the amendments to include new creameries in the schedule.  I believe that a fairly good case was made for the inclusion of some of those creameries.  I did not take part in the debate.  But as the amendment in my name proves I was opposed to the whole idea of the schedule itself.</P>
    <P>I think the principle of giving undue preference to any body of traders, creamery proprietors or others, as against their brother-traders in the same business, is indefensible, and in this case of the creameries it is particularly indefensible.  We are in this Bill considering the giving of a bounty of 4d. per lb. to certain creameries.  This is to be given out of a fund contributed to by the creameries themselves by means of a levy of 2d. per lb. on the butter they manufacture in their creameries.  The schedule provides that these creameries instead of paying a levy of 2d. contribute only ½d. per lb. thus giving them a preference of 1½d. per lb. over the ordinary competitor in other creameries in the various counties. The Minister advanced in defence of that attitude various reasons.  One was that they were not competing; <Col N="92" /> they were in areas not in competition for milk suppliers from other creameries; they were set up at recent dates; they have heavy overhead charges and other matters.</P>
    <P>Speaking on the last day I said possibly as good a case and perhaps a better case could be made for some creameries that were asking to be included in the schedule and that I myself could have put forward as good a case for some creameries in Limerick which is the greatest dairying county in the country.  There are in my county a very great number of creameries with overhead charges of £3,000 to £5,000 in the way of undischarged debts.  There were a number of creameries acquired within the last four or five years under the recent Act for which the suppliers have to bear a burden of £3 per cow over eight years.  In some of these creameries the amount of the debts would be from £3,000 to £5,000.  These creameries have to bear that and to provide for it out of their milk supplies.  Possibly some creameries in this schedule are in the same condition. There are possibly no creameries that have not these debts and possibly they are in debt for the cost of building.  They are possibly in debt to the bank or to the Government under the Trade Loans Act and they are paying interest on these sums.</P>
    <P>But these creameries have not certainly any greater burden of debt than many creameries I could name.  They compete in the same market.  If we give them an undue preference of 1½d. per lb. it is not unnatural to assume that they will use it to certain extent even in the home trade. It is not a very extreme statement to say that if there was a city merchant in Dublin, Limerick or Cork anxious to buy a large quantity of butter in tons over the year these creameries would use this advantage.  These large merchants approach the creameries and get the best quotations they can. It is quite natural that the creamery with a preference of 1½d. over competing creameries could offer an inducement which would make it certain <Col N="93" /> that they would secure the contract. The Minister said on the last occasion that that could not occur.  Any business man knows it can occur.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that the Minister is aware that some of these creameries, owing to their proximity to large towns, to Dublin and elsewhere, have a great advantage over other creameries.  There are a great number of these creameries scheduled that supply milk at various times in the year to the milk distributors in Dublin and Cork and get prices better than other creameries can secure by manufacturing their milk into butter.  Such creameries selling milk to a retailer in Dublin would make far better returns than those manufacturing it into butter.  In fact a dairy sending milk to Dublin to a retailer can get a great advance over the creamery converting it into butter and selling it at 1/- per lb.</P>
    <P>I do not think that a great case can be made for these scheduled creameries.  Possibly they are in the position that they have to compete with the farmer manufacturing his own butter.  Having regard to the quality of butter between the two makers, the farmers and the creameries, I do not think there is any grave danger of their trade in that respect.  They will only be in the same position with regard to the makers of the farmers butter as a creamery in any other county will be.  All creameries will have to compete with the farmers selling butter, and against the factories selling the farmers' butter. Scheduled creameries will not be in any worse position in that respect than the other creameries.</P>
    <P>I do not think anything can be gained by making a very long speech on the subject, but to me the whole thing appears indefensible and no good case can be made for it.  No case can be made for giving one body of traders an undue preference of this kind over another body of traders.  This preference amounts to three-fourths of the whole bounty.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the schedule, and as far as the creamery proprietors in the large dairying counties are concerned I <Col N="94" /> want to say they are in opposition to it.</P>

      <P>On general principles the case put up by Deputy Bennett seems to me a convincing one and an impregnable one.  Without at the same time wishing to commit myself as yet to actual opposition to the schedule being included, I would like to ask the Minister, if he has not already done it&mdash;possibly he has in my absence &mdash;to explain exactly what was the procedure by which these particular creameries were arrived at.  Did the Department of Agriculture go through the list of creameries in the country? Were the creameries invited to state a case for their inclusion in that Schedule?  Was every one given an opportunity of showing that they should be treated on a more favourable basis than the others?  If that has not been yet explained, it appears to me that it would not be unreasonable to ask the Minister to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shaughnessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish on principle to support the suggestion put forward by Deputy Bennett.  We have certain creameries here scheduled for preferential treatment, and apart from this question of preferential treatment giving them an advantage in the matter of local contracts, there is another point, and to my mind it is the principal point and the one on which this giving of preferential treatment to the creameries in the Schedule should be rejected.  We had a Deputy from Cork putting forward here the other evening, on the introduction of this Bill, a very strong case for the inclusion in the Schedule of a Bandon creamery.  There was another very strong case put forward by Deputy Morrissey on behalf of a creamery in Tipperary.  But the fact remains that because these dairies were in existence prior to 1928 they were not included and they were not in the position that they would come under the benefits that will be given to dairies in the Schedule.  I hold that it is altogether wrong to give preferential treatment to any dairy on a time limit. I know dairies in the County Limerick that are as embarrassed financially as any dairy in the Schedule, but they are not included in it by the Minister <Col N="95" /> simply because they were in existence prior to 1928.  That, I believe, is the one great defect in this Bill.  I want to make my position clear.  I am not in opposition to the Minister bringing forward any scheme for the relief of dairies that are in danger, but I am opposed to him making demands on dairies simply because they have been in existence for a long time and giving the assistance so obtained to the dairies brought into existence since 1928, though the former are just as much financially embarrassed as the dairies that are getting the help.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I made an appeal to the Minister on the last occasion that we debated this Bill to approach the Minister for Finance in connection with this matter, particularly in view of the fact that the Finance Bill has not yet been passed.  I repeat the suggestion now.  I have no objection whatever to the dairy societies in the Schedule being relieved in what I consider to be a proper way.  Anything done for the dairying industry in the past by this House has been done at the expense of the State.  That has been done more than once, so that in what I am asking there is no precedent. Now for the first time it is proposed to give the assistance required at the expense of the other people engaged in the industry.  It is being done with somebody else's money.  The proposal is to put your hand in somebody else's pocket to do something you feel you are not prepared to do yourself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since we discussed the Bill in Committee I have made inquiries about the position of some societies in my county.  I am sorry to say that at least six of them, there may be others that I am not acquainted with, are in a very peculiar financial position.  The Minister, I think, is acquainted with the circumstances of most of them. Representations have been made to him about their position.  Their prospects are anything but rosy.  The idea of having these dairy societies contribute something out of what is coming to them under the scheme to subsidise other people engaged in the industry is one that should not be approved of. To meet this would be a small matter <Col N="96" /> for the State.  It is a big matter for the societies.  I appeal to the Minister to approach this from another angle, and to do the right thing in the right way.  This is not doing it in the right way.  It would not serve any purpose if I were to mention the names of the societies, but the Minister is aware of the position of most of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>When we got the first print of this Bill reference was made to these societies in the First and Second Schedules with particulars given by the Minister for their inclusion in the Schedule.  I understood the reasons given were single and not cumulative.  I understand now that the reasons for the inclusion of these societies in the First and Second Schedules are cumulative, and that unless you come within the cumulative effect of the Minister's prescription you cannot get into the Schedule.  That being so, I think it will be admitted by the Minister that there are numerous societies in the country in as bad a position financially as those included in the Schedule, that the societies that have been included in the Schedule are included simply because they come under what may be described as the orphan societies of the creamery industry of this country. It does not necessarily follow at all that they are entitled to be there and to get that particular protection. There are other creameries in the country that will have to contribute to the benefits to be conferred on the scheduled creameries that are in a much worse financial position than the latter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Second Reading of the Bill I referred to the balance sheet of a creamery whose costs of production were 67/- per cwt.  I ventured to suggest that there was not, perhaps, another creamery in the Saorstát whose costs of production were 67/- per cwt.  Last year it only produced 277 cwts. of butter.  Yet, even though it is a creamery of considerable age, it does not come into the category of an orphan society, and because it does not come within the four walls of the cumulative effects of the tests the <Col N="97" /> Minister applies it cannot be included in the Schedule.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider the representations that have been made to him by farmer-Deputies.  He has done his part by trying to confer a benefit on those new societies who had money advanced to them by the Agricultural Credit Corporation, directly by the Government or by the banks. If they are now in financial distress like the others they should row in with the crowd.  Let all row together.  In view of the expressions of opinion that we have had in this House from farmer-Deputies who represent creamery constituencies I think the Minister should adopt their views and let these two Schedules go by the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephGorry" hpid="Mr. Gorry Mr. Gorry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorry</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose the amendment.  I am connected with the newer creameries.  I would be very pleased indeed to have heard the Deputies speak on this Bill in the same spirit as Deputies spoke on the Old Age Pensions Bill that we discussed a short time ago.  As most of the creameries are run on co-operative lines it does not speak well for cooperation if the older creameries, who are in the majority and have an assured milk supply which the newer creameries have not, refuse to give the small percentage asked for.  That small percentage will help to keep their brothers in the newer districts going.  The milk supplies to the newer creameries are in a rather precarious condition.  If the conditions that obtained in 1928 and 1929 when the new creameries were set up had continued, the latter would not have had to ask for any assistance from their neighbours.  Unfortunately, the times changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind Deputies who are in opposition to the scheduled creameries that if this Bill had not been introduced the creameries they are interested in would be getting no bounty.  Speaking on behalf of the scheduled creameries I think I am justified, therefore, in suggesting to those Deputies that the least they might have done was to let the Bill go through.  They must admit that this Bill has saved the dairying industry <Col N="98" /> and incidentally, the newer creameries, because I consider that the new creameries have definitely got a new lease of life as a result of the introduction of the Bill and the encouragement to the farmer to come to the rescue again and to maintain supplies.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Bennett's point as to new creameries going into unfair competition with the old creameries, I assure him that we have no such intention, so far as the creamery I am associated with is concerned. As a matter of fact, I can produce for Deputy Bennett quotations from southern creameries, old established creameries, under-cutting us to the extent of 2d. a lb. in our next-door market, a couple of years ago.  I assure him that that is not the spirit, or the way, in which we approach this matter, because overhead charges and loan repayments are sufficiently high to absorb anything we can get out of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>When any particular section of the community gets a certain privilege, it opens the door to a very large number of the same class to ask for similar privileges, and I can appreciate the difficulty the Minister is under in making his discrimination against certain creameries that ask for inclusion in the Schedule. The last speaker seemed to be under the impression that all creameries are in similar circumstances, and, perhaps, the same abilities to get milk supplies, but a creamery that is set up in a district largely devoted to tillage is labouring under very serious difficulties, compared with the creameries in the Golden Vale of Co. Limerick.  A great number of the creameries in the Gaeltacht are similarly circumstanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made an appeal recently to the Minister to include on the Schedule a creamery in my area, called the Imokelly Creamery, which undoubtedly answers the description given by the <Col N="99" /> Minister, if any of the creameries put forward answer it.  It is labouring under certain disabilities.  It is in the Gaeltacht; it is in a tillage district and it is new.  On the other hand, it is well managed; its milk supplies are not large and it also has to pay off a very heavy loan.  If any creamery is entitled to consideration on the lines laid down by the Minister, I think this is it, and I, therefore, repeat my appeal that it should be included, or else, having regard to that position of affairs, let the whole of the creameries go by the board.  We are in this difficulty, so far as the country is concerned, that if there is any merit in the Bill at all, let these creameries get the benefit of it.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the Co-operative movement, but it has not always been successful.  These creameries that are suffering disabilities have to contribute to the funds which go to make a success of the other creameries, and when they are not in the same position as those in the more favoured districts, I think they are entitled to certain consideration, and I would ask the Minister to give them that consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacDermot asked me what was the procedure adopted by the Department in classifying these creameries on the schedule, and Deputy McMenamin said that the test that we applied was not one single test, but an accumulation of tests and that unless they could get clear from everyone of these tests, they would not get on to the Schedule.  I explained this rather fully before, but I will refer to it briefly again for the benefit of Deputy McMenamin, and to clear up some of the points raised here to-day. First of all, we have not placed on the Schedule any creamery that was not recently established, and established in a non-creamery district, where we might call the new creamery a pioneer, and where it had to fight its way against whatever prejudices there were for other forms of farming and disposal of milk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far, it does, and there are many others that answer to that, so far.  There was, of course, naturally, very heavy capital expenditure in the establishment of creameries from the year 1927 down to 1930.  If things had gone on as they had been going on, and if the price of milk had remained at, say, over 6d. per gallon, none of these creameries would, I believe, have any difficulty in paying off debts, but owing to the rather sudden and very marked fall in prices at the end of the year 1929, these particular creameries found that they could not give as good a price for milk as would induce the suppliers to remain with them.  The suppliers being accustomed to making use of their milk in other ways thought they could do better, and a number of them left these new creameries and went back to the making of farm butter, the rearing of calves, the feeding of pigs and so on, and the new creameries, having lost a number of their suppliers, found that they could not give an economic price to the farmer for his milk, and things went from bad to worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That meant that we only applied it to new creameries in non-creamery districts, creameries that had incurred big capital liabilities, which they were unable to clear off, and it meant, also, that we could not include a creamery that was in competition with other creameries, because, of course, that could not be classified as a non-creamery district.  We laid down these conditions, with the other condition that, I think rules out perhaps, Deputy Brasier's case, that &ldquo;they are in such a precarious condition that they cannot continue to exist without the proposed concession.&rdquo;  The particular creamery mentioned by Deputy Brasier is quite capable of existing without this.  Against that, of course, I have been accused of only including creameries that were badly managed, because the particular creamery mentioned by Deputy Brasier was evidently well managed and therefore, we did not include it in the Schedule, but we have, however, another clause which says that &ldquo;their present position is not due to any fault of management.&rdquo;  There <Col N="101" /> are other creameries that could be on the Schedule were it not that we are quite satisfied that their condition is due to bad management, and therefore, we have kept them off.  These were the general conditions that every creamery would have to fulfil before coming on to the Schedule.  I was asked, again, by Deputy McMenamin if every creamery was invited to apply for inclusion in the Schedule. They were not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacDermot asked me if we invited creameries to apply for inclusion in the Schedule.  We did not.  We have, as Deputies are aware, full returns from each creamery in the Department of Agriculture, showing the financial position, the capital liability, the number of gallons received, and the price paid per gallon, and any other information we require, in relation to a creamery, and by going through these returns in the Department, we picked out those that we thought should be put on the Schedule, and left off those that we thought should be left off.  Apart from that I can assure the Deputy that the creameries did not want to be invited.  I think there are very few creameries that did not apply to be put on since this Bill was introduced.  Various points were raised.  Deputy Bennett says that there are several creameries in County Limerick with a capital debt of £4,000 or £5,000.  I am sure that is true.  He referred to creameries having to pay £3 per cow.  Take £3 per cow as a test and how does that compare when the Schedule is examined? We boast that our cows are giving on an average 500 gallons per year, so that £3 per cow would mean that we would lay it down that about 166 gallons of milk is capable of carrying a debt of £1.  That is for £1 of capital liability we should have at least a milk supply of 166 gallons.  I was asked on the last occasion what were the capital liabilities of creameries on the scheduled <Col N="102" /> list, and what were the milk supplies and other facts.  I got a considerable amount of material.  If I take the first one, I find it was established in September, 1927, that the supply of milk has diminished during the last two years from 575,000 gallons to 318,000 gallons.  That is a very big drop in the supply of milk.  The capital liability is £2,500 and the number of gallons of milk per £ of capital debt is 127.  If I am asked about any particular creamery I am prepared to give the figures.  I will give the number of gallons of milk to the £1 debt in each case, 127, 130, 92. 120, 135, 33, 63.  I think it is obvious to Deputy Bennett, or to any other Deputy who comes from a creamery county, and who is in the habit of dealing with these figures, that it is absolutely impossible for any creamery to try to carry on and to give a fair average price for milk, and at the same time to try to do something in the way of meeting the debt, if the debt is £1 for every 30 gallons supplied.  That is the lowest, but the figures range from 30 up to 130 gallons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Compared to the new creameries, where we put on £3 a cow, every one of these creameries is much worse off. I may say that there is a very big agitation in the country that £3 a cow is too much.  Many people believe that that is more than farmers can afford to pay.  We have letters about the matter every day and very often deputations. It is being made known in other ways that these people consider £3 a cow too much and more than they can continue to pay.  As I have already stated £3 a cow means a capital debt of £1 for every 166 gallons, so that these creameries are much worse off.  Deputy Bennett said that if we continued with this Schedule and gave the concession, certain creameries may undersell those in competition with them.  It is quite true that they may.  I am prepared to admit that there has been too much underselling by creameries.  I do not say that this particular concession is going to make them do it, any more than if we did not give it.  After all, if a creamery is very badly off and has to meet a debt it is compelled to sell <Col N="103" /> what butter it has on hands, and, perhaps, to sell butter not on hands, in order to meet the debt.  I am sure that selling in that way is more responsible for falling prices than anything else.  If we had our creameries in a little better condition financially there would not be so much underselling.</P>

      <P>I will refer to that.  It is very small.  We do not favour underselling for creameries engaging in a contest with one another.  We would take it as an offence, as far as we are concerned, if it was reported, or if underselling was serious we would regard it as sufficient cause for removal from the Schedule, as we have power to do.  One point I would like to stress more than anything else and that is, that the new creameries are in a different position.  They were encouraged through Government policy to start in 1927-28.</P>

      <P>Through Government policy they were encouraged to start, and I think the Deputy should give me credit for being magnanimous in trying to compensate farmers who put money into creameries on the advice of the last Government.  He should regard it as magnanimous on my part to prevent them turning in their indignation on the last Government. That is what I am doing.  I am trying to save the last Government from what should rightly come to them.</P>

      <P>By giving them a little more help in order to gloss over the mistakes made by the last Government, and not make it so apparent to them that they are going to be fleeced by the banks or by anybody else who lent them money.  For the last couple of months I have had letters from at <Col N="104" /> least four or five different districts asking the Department to help them, to start creameries.  As far as I could I have discouraged those people.  We have no power to prevent them if they want to start.  We cannot stop them legally but, as far as I am concerned, I try to discourage them by telling them that it was not advisable to start creameries at the present time. Deputy O'Shaughnessy mentioned creameries not on the list because they were established before 1928.  Any creamery established before 1927 does not fulfil the conditions laid down. Deputy Gorey said we should approach the Minister for Finance.  He says that as the State has already contributed a good deal to the creameries it should be prepared to contribute something further.  I do not think that would be fair.  The Deputy says that we are being generous with other people's money.  There are six creameries in County Kilkenny that require assistance. I am prepared to accept that. As Deputy Gorey has mentioned it, I know of at least two or three creameries which are not on the right side in the bank and owe a certain amount of money.  We are not really being generous with other people's money.  We are going to ask the consumers in this country during the next three years to contribute almost £2,000,000.  We were accused of asking more than that.  Some Deputies accused us of asking £800,000 or £900,000 yearly.  The amount is going to come to £2,000,000 over three years and out of that pool there is £18,000 for creameries that are down and out. That is less than 1 per cent. for the lot.  If the consumers have to give the creameries £100 owing to legislation passed here, is it too much to ask the creameries to hand back £1 in order to save the weaker ones amongst them?  It does not amount to very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle may be wrong of asking any body of traders to help the weaker ones amongst them.  In practice, however, the amount of assistance is not very much.  I do admit also that we are going to take this one per cent., or less than one per cent., from the very weak creameries, as Deputy <Col N="105" /> McMenamin has mentioned, and, perhaps, give it to creameries on the scheduled list which are not in as bad a position as the creamery Deputy McMenamin had in mind.  That may be so but it is very difficult&mdash;almost impossible&mdash;to be just when making a law.  I admit that there are creameries on the scheduled list which differ very little from the creameries which are not on it.  It would be impossible to make out two lists, one of them being for the Schedule, and to draw a line between those lists so that no Deputy could raise objection to the selection made.  There must be a certain amount of difference of opinion on those matters.  The Department had no wish to put on one creamery more than another.  In going through the list of creameries in the beginning, the officers of the Department picked out every creamery which they could possibly put into the Schedule and which were able to stand the test. They left off those which did not stand the test.  I must insist on the Schedule being left in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister admits that the principle is bad.  I would like him to say definitely whether there are not a considerable number of creameries in a worse position financially than are the creameries in this Schedule.  If that is so, how can he defend these two Schedules?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given a very fair explanation.  I admit that there was difficulty in approaching the matter.  I am quite sure that the Minister and his advisers made every effort to be just but it is to the principle that I am opposed. The Minister will admit, if he has not already admitted, that as good a case could be made for some of the creameries that are not included in the Schedule as for some of them that are. I am prepared to prove, if necessary, that as good a case could be made for at least fifty or sixty creameries as could be made for the majority of the scheduled creameries.  If I were to put in an amendment to include all the creameries that need relief in my constituency and if every other Deputy were to do the same in relation to his <Col N="106" /> constituency, we would render the Bill inoperative and useless.  None of us wanted to do that.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave us figures as to the overhead costs of the creameries affected in relation to the £3 per cow test.  He gave us the figure of £1 for every 166 gallons of milk.  He quoted figures then which went down to 30 gallons.  A creamery with an overhead charge of £1 for 30 gallons of milk is clearly one that cannot be carried on. No measure of relief will enable that creamery to be carried on.  In relation to other creameries, he gave the figures of 120 gallons and 130 gallons of milk to the £.  I am quite sure that many of our creameries in Limerick, valued at £3 per cow, are in that position.  The assessment was made at the peak point of the milk supply. The supply was much greater then than it is now.  The Minister referred to the falling supplies of these creameries. Their supplies, he said, were very much less than previously.  We can quote the same case, point for point, as regards the Limerick and Tipperary creameries.  The supplies have gone down very much.  Last year, the decline was caused, to a great extent, by the season.  In addition, the people are going out of dairying and engaging in other forms of farming. Dairying did not pay.  For various causes, the milk supply has gone down but no case can be made that it has gone down in any of these creameries which are well managed to a greater extent than it has gone down in creameries in old-established creamery districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has, I think, admitted that all our grievances with regard to creameries are due to falling prices. He said he was saving us from the disasters of the last Government.  I think the Minister is fair enough to acknowledge that our legislation was brought about at a time when milk was 6d. a gallon.  We are not to be blamed for the dire consequences of world depression.  No set of fallible men could have got out of the position created by world conditions. At various times, we have told the farmers that their difficulties were brought about, in the main, not by the <Col N="107" /> legislation of the last Government but by world causes and the fall in prices not alone in the farming industry but in every other industry.  The Minister has admitted that if it were not for that the creamery industry would be in a very sound position.  I have endeavoured to emphasise that aspect also.  I admit that the creameries agitating for the remission of the £3 per cow debt have the same grievance as everybody else.  They had to suffer owing to the depression of the times. There is a charge of £1 to 166 gallons of milk.  That 166 gallons would work down much lower in the case of many creameries. The Minister did not make any allusion to the fact that some of the creameries with which he was dealing are supplying milk to Dublin. Some of those scheduled creameries were in the habit of supplying a portion of their milk to Dublin at very lucrative prices.  When they were not able to get out of the rut when doing that, how will they do so when they are confined solely to trading in the ordinary creamery way&mdash;turning their milk into butter possibly at a price of 4½d. a gallon?  I think that more than half of those scheduled creameries were in the habit of sending milk to milk distributors in Dublin at prices altogether above what they would be able to obtain by turning that milk into butter.  Deputy Gorry said that we agreed to many of the new creameries. We did not.  We went on the principle that undue preference should not be given to one set of creameries over another or to one set of traders of any description over another set of traders in the same business.  Deputy Gorry said that he could prove that a certain established creamery undercut them.  I quite admit that that is possible. If anything it proves my argument, that undercutting is possible.</P>
    <P>When the weapon is put into their own hands, being human they will use it.  It would be very hard to prove it.  The Minister said he might cut them off the Schedule.  These things can be done in a very small way, if carefully managed, sufficient to obtain a contract which an established creamery <Col N="108" /> would be looking for.  They could easily do it without asking the whole of the 1½d. preference.  They will certainly be in a position, if they wish, to compete in an unfair way with creameries in other districts.  It would be very hard to prove that they did. That in itself will have the effect of bringing prices down and defeating in a way the prime object of the Bill, which is to keep up the prices to an extent that will recoup the farmer in some way for his losses, because it will not recoup him altogether.  On the whole, the Bill will not give the farmer his cost of production, but I give the Minister the credit of making an honest attempt to try to do that.  I believe it will not absolutely achieve that.  At present, owing to world depression and other causes, it would be impossible to devise a scheme which would give the farmer the cost of production, but it is an honest attempt to do it.  I think we ought not to leave in the Bill anything which will tend to injure that prospect, and I believe there is danger with this Schedule of that happening.  Again it is unfair, not alone to the general principle of the Bill, but to those creameries for which a very good case was made the last day to be included in the Schedule, just as Deputy Brasier made a good case for a creamery to-day and other creameries, for which no amendment was put down and for which a good case could also be made.  It is unfair to these creameries who are suffering from as great a disadvantage as the scheduled creameries that a certain number should be picked out and included. I am afraid I shall have to insist on asking the Minister, even at this late hour, to withdraw the Schedule.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy has supplied one argument against his own amendment when he talks about creameries in the Schedule supplying milk to Dublin.  Surely that is lessening the burden which is caused by putting the Schedule in the Bill.  In so far as they are sending milk to Dublin, they are not making butter and, consequently, the burden is all the less. I thought it a rather strange argument for Deputy Bennett.  I think Deputy <Col N="109" /> Bennett has fought shy of the point that there is a moral responsibility on the Government with regard to these particular creameries.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that when the leader of agriculture in this country, from the high pinnacle of his position as Minister, told the farmers that there was a wonderful market for butter, that there was a wonderful future for farming if they gave up the foolish practice of growing grain for profit and concentrated on the production of milk and butter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not understand these interruptions.  I think the gentleman might at least keep silent while a Deputy, who does not often trouble the House, is endeavouring to make a few remarks appropriate to the Bill. I know he is pretty ignorant, and I can find an excuse for him, but I think he should be told to conduct himself. When that is the case, and the Minister for Agriculture, in his position as leader of agriculture in the country, told the farmer to go in for the building of creameries, for keeping cows, and to give up grain growing, with the result that a certain number of creameries were established in the country, then I think that when these creameries walked into the storm, so to speak, and found themselves confronted by an unexpected and unprecedented slump, the Government have a moral responsibility in connection with them, and I hope the Minister will not give way to Deputy Bennett's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister I think has given away his case when he candidly admitted that the erection of these creameries on the Scheduled list was encouraged by the Government.  His Party is now the Government and they are the successors of the other Government, and the responsibility, if there is any responsibility, is the responsibility of the Government.  Deputy Moore has admitted the same thing.  He said the moral responsibility is on the <Col N="110" /> Government, but the facts are, according to the terms of the Bill, that the moral responsibility is on other people engaged with the trade.  These other people engaged in the trade it is that are going to pay the bounty, out of a levy that the scheduled societies do not pay.  That is where we differ.  With what Deputy Moore says as to the responsibility of the Government I agree.  It should be met by the Government and by State funds, and not by the other people engaged in the trade who are in, if not a worse position, certainly as bad a position as the creameries on the scheduled list.  I am prepared to admit that apart from this question of the method of meeting it, and apart altogether from the principle involved, the Minister has met the matter quite fairly.  I am prepared to admit that creameries on the scheduled list are not in a sound financial position and some of them are in a hopeless position.  I agree the Minister is right in saying that they deserve assistance, but it is equally true that a considerable number of other creameries&mdash;there are six in my county; I do not know what the position is in other counties&mdash;are equally in a bad position.  And there is this difference that the creameries put up newly in new districts have a possibility of expansion and of getting auxiliaries; they have wide territory for working.  I have seen a creamery in the south-east with fifteen or twenty miles of country in one direction to work.  The same would apply to the creamery that Deputy Gorry is connected with.  It has a wide territory to develop, but in the case of some of those creameries that I have mentioned they are locked up in a small pocket of country.  There is no future for them in these days of getting rid of the overhead charges.  These creameries have to be brought in as auxiliaries and no other creamery will take over auxiliaries except they are in a fairly sound financial position.  Where there are huge overhead charges no one will take them except forced by legislation. They are in a much worse position than some of the new creameries.  If it is the responsibility of anybody at all it is the responsibility of the State and <Col N="111" /> not of the other creameries.  Deputies on the other side seem to suffer from lockjaw in reference to this question of principle.  Deputy Gorry said that the true principle of co-operation was that creameries in a worse position should come to his aid and subsidise others not as badly off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is all wrong.  I said I had no objection to those creameries getting assistance because I admit they deserve it, but I object to the other creameries who are in as bad a position having to come to their assistance. If there is a responsibility in this matter let it be the responsibility of the State and let them do the right thing in the right way, and do not let us put that blemish on what would otherwise be a well conceived measure. I know some of the creameries have been supplying milk to Dublin.  I do not think that that is a case that can be put up against them because they have done that.  It is said they have incurred capital liabilities and of course they have; so have other creameries incurred capital liability that they have no prospect of discharging.  One of the conditions that the Minister puts <Col N="112" /> creameries off the scheduled list for is they have not efficient management. The Minister knows as well as I do or he will know in the course of some time that many of the creameries that were victims of bad management found it almost impossible to help themselves. It was no fault of the Committee.  The responsibility and loss were the Committee's. The manager in many cases had gone.  It is no excuse to tell them that they had a bad manager.  Whether the management was good or bad it was all a question of luck.</P>
    <P>Local Committees did not know enough about business to supervise the manager.  I again appeal to the Minister who is fighting for this matter that it should be done by the State. Let the State do it.  It is their responsibility and as Deputy Moore said the Minister and the State should shoulder that responsibility.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 5:</P>
      <P>In page 5, Section 7 (1) to add at the end of the sub-section the following words &ldquo;nor, in respect of the period commencing on the date of the passing of this Act and ending on the 31st day of March, 1933, be less than twenty-five per cent. of the general rate, nor, in respect of the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1934, be less than fifty per cent. of the general rate, nor in respect of the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1935, be less than seventy-five per cent. of the general rate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It deals with the creameries in the Schedule.  I undertook in the Committee Stage, in reply to Deputy Blythe, that we would introduce some scale whereby the levy that would be collected from the schedule of societies would come nearer the levy collected from the other creameries each year.  Now it reads: &ldquo;That for the present year it must not&rdquo; be less than twenty-five per cent. &ldquo;of the general rate&rdquo; and for the next year, &ldquo;not less than fifty per cent.&rdquo; and for the third year, not less than seventy-five per cent. of the general rate.  So that if the general levy remains 2d., we can make it ½d. this year but not less than 1d. next year and 1½d. the following year.  It means really that the benefits that the creameries on the Schedule were to get at first would be considerably cut down.  As I explained here a few minutes ago, the total which would be paid to the scheduled creameries for three years would not exceed £18,000.  Under the arrangement as it stood in the beginning with the five years' schedule, it would have amounted to somewhere about £45,000, and now it is £18,000 which would be the total benefit received by the scheduled creameries in three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I still have the same objection to it substantially.  My objection was in the case of a manager or secretary of a creamery company neglecting to discharge his duties. The general rule or practice is that a Creamery Committee only meets once a month, that is to say, when they are paying their accounts.  This negligence might occur between two meetings of the Committee, and the Committee which would have to pay would be salted and the period of seven days here is too short and does not solve my difficulty at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now with regard to the Minister not accepting this amendment of mine I can see no point, because there, is no point in not making this return except through the negligence of the secretary or the manager and it would be unfair if a Committee that meets only once a month to pay accounts and sign cheques find on the agenda an assessment by the Minister of a certain amount which they would have to pay.  I think it would be very unfair not to leave an opening to the Committee, who are really the responsible <Col N="116" /> people, and not to give them ample opportunity to meet the case.  This return should be made and there is no point in not making it unless it is a question of negligence on the part of the manager or secretary.  For that reason, I think the Committee should have ample time in the fourteen days which I have given them.</P>
    <P>We all know that these things may happen&mdash;the manager or secretary might be ill and that might be the reason of the negligence.  It is merely a business amendment so far as I am concerned to protect the Committee as distinct from their employees, and we know that these things do occur regularly in business.  The Committee, I am sure, would do it because there is no point in not doing it if it is a thing that should be done.  Through the negligence of the manager or secretary the Committee might have to pay a sum of money that otherwise they would not have to pay.</P>

      <P>I would like to know on what the Deputy is going to base the certificate that he is to issue in cases where no return has been made.  The Bill prescribes that returns shall be made.  If any person fails to make a return certain penalties are imposed, but it does not provide any method of getting a return from that offending creamery.  The Minister, whether the return is made or not, has to issue a certificate.  On what does he propose to base his certificate if no return is made?</P>

      <P>I cannot follow Deputy McMenamin's reasoning very closely. If the objection is only to the number of days I think we can meet that objection all right, but otherwise I think his amendment is more severe on the Committee than our own, because as far as I can see&mdash;of course, I have not got the legal mind&mdash;if the Committee, under Deputy McMenamin's amendment, did not appeal to the District Court within the fourteen days they could not appeal at all, but under ours they can appeal at any time.</P>

      <P>I am advised that that makes it a debt just like a debt due to a shopkeeper by a customer.  If the customer likes to refuse payment he goes into the District Court.  He may prove that it is not a proper account, just as our creamery man here, if we bring him into Court to recover the amount of the debt, may prove to the satisfaction of the District Justice that the amount was not correct.

      <P>In the Committee Stage, Deputy McMenamin asked for a clearer amendment on this particular section.  It is with regard to selling on commission.  We have made it a good deal clearer in this particular amendment to Section 12, before sub-section (3), what we mean by that particular sub-section that was under discussion during the Committee Stage. I think what Deputy McMenamin had in mind was that a retailer who took butter in exchange for goods or for cash, and was only operating in a small way might be brought under the amendment as we had drafted it in the Committee Stage and that we really did not mean to bring such a man under the provisions of the Bill. I think the Deputy will be satisfied that we are not dealing with that particular class of trader.</P>

      <P>I would be quite satisfied except for the fact that the butter factor is not included in the definition.  There is no such person. He is left here an undefined unit in the Bill.  The Minister's amendment reads &ldquo;any person in this Act referred to as a butter factor.&rdquo;  Apparently he is overlooked in the Bill; this gentleman has not been defined in the definition section.  That was my difficulty too in drafting a suitable <Col N="120" /> amendment to this section, the fact that there was no definition in the definition section of a butter factor.</P>

It is for that purpose, in order that we might have powers to make a levy in such cases where possibly a merchant might evade payment of the levy, that the amendment is suggested.</P>

      <P>In page 8, before Section 15 (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) Where a butter factor who has paid in respect of any farm butter a levy under Section 12 (which relates to levy on other manufactured non-creamery butter) of this Act proves to the satisfaction of the Minister that a levy has already been paid in respect of the manufacture of such butter, the Minister shall refund to such butter factor a sum equal to the levy paid by him in respect of such butter under the said section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>15.  In page 8, Section 16, to delete lines 21 and 22 and substitute the following words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where any butter manufactured during a levy month by the registered proprietor of creamery premises or of premises registered in the register of butter factories or any farm butter acquired during a levy month by the registered proprietor of any registered premises is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputies would look at Section 16 they will see that if the words &ldquo;manufactured or&rdquo; were left out&mdash;I believe legally it might be argued that they could be left out&mdash;the section would read in this way: &ldquo;Where any butter acquired by the registered proprietor during a levy month is placed in cold storage in Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; and so on.  If read in that way it might be interpreted to mean that the creamery that had sold butter to another person for cold storage would not be liable to the <Col N="122" /> levy until the butter was taken out of cold storage in the following February or March.  That would be unfair to the pool because naturally if a creamery were to sell butter to any person inside the country during the present month or at any time up to next September that creamery would be in receipt of the internal price, the price that is there because of the bounty on exports and therefore the creamery should properly pay the levy.  As I say, we are advised that the section could be interpreted in such a way that the creamery could get over the responsibilities of paying the levy.  This amendment is drafted in order to prevent that being done. If we delete the first two lines, we read the section then:</P>
    <P>Where any butter manufactured during a levy month by the registered proprietor of creamery premises or of premises registered in the register of butter factories or any farm butter acquired during a levy month by the registered proprietor of any registered premises is placed in cold store in Saorstát Eireann; etc.</P>

      <P>(1)  The Minister may, subject to the provisions of this section, make regulations prescribing the general rate of bounty on creamery butter, but the general rate so prescribed by any such regulations shall not exceed the rate of the butter duty.</P>

    <P>(2)  The Minister may, subject to the provisions of this section, make regulations <Col N="123" /> prescribing the special rate of bounty on creamery butter, but the special rate so prescribed by such regulations shall not exceed the rate of the butter duty nor be less than the general rate.</P>
    <P>In this section the expression &ldquo;the special rate&rdquo; means the rate (if any) for the time being in force by virtue of regulations under this sub-section.</P>

    <P>These amendments are also put in, in response to Deputy Blythe.  As the Bill stands the Minister has entire discretion over the funds that may be available at the end of the financial year in the miscellaneous account.  Deputy Blythe thought that it was not proper <Col N="124" /> that the Minister should have this discretionary control over any funds of this sort and I, on the Committee Stage, agreed with Deputy Blythe in that matter.  I undertook to try to have it amended in such a way that before disposing of this fund the Dáil would have an opportunity of voting on it.  It will be disposed of now in this way: that the Minister will propose at the end of the financial year to dispose of the fund in some certain way and a proposal will be put before the Dáil for approval.  Deputies will see that under amendment 18 it is not being laid on the Table like other regulations.  Other regulations under the Bill will be laid on the Table of the House and will pass automatically unless disapproved of by the Dáil. This, however, will have to be passed positively by the Dáil before the Minister can do anything.</P>

      <P>I move the Second Reading. This Bill is an amendment to the Bill of 1928, which was a Bill passed in that year which gave the cattle trade statutory powers to collect a levy on exported cattle of so much per head and also on pigs and sheep.  There were regulations laid down providing that the fund should be managed by trustees and how it was to be invested; and out of that fund the trustees were authorised to pay compensation for animals slaughtered owing to the Foot and Mouth Disease&mdash;for animals landed in Great Britain or exported from this country.  The fund has been growing very steadily since and at the present time it amounts to over £20,000.  The only loss that exporters suffered during the intervening period was during the scare regarding Foot and Mouth Disease owing to animals being detained on the other side before they were released.  During their detention the owners suffered certain losses with regard to lairage and the feeding of those animals, and the owners think that they might ask for compensation for that loss, seeing that the fund is so healthy, and seeing that they have been paying into the fund now for practically four years and that nothing has been paid out.  There has been no big outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease.  This Bill seeks to give power to pay compensation for the cost of the detention of animals in such cases&mdash;compensation such as was given under the old Bill in cases where animals were slaughtered.  The Bill also seeks to give power to the trustees to allow the fund to go to £40,000 instead of the £20,000 previously authorised.  It is quite a non-contentious Bill.  It was introduced at the request of the cattle trade in the country, and it might possibly be regarded under these circumstances as a Private Member's Bill.  But as the previous Government adopted the Bill of 1928, I felt that the precedent might be followed and that the Government should now pilot through the amending Bill.</P>

      <P>In the debate on the Land Commission Estimate every year we have the same complaints to make.  Perhaps it will be no harm to reiterate a few of them now.  One is in connection with the derelict farms throughout the country.  There are quite a number of them in my area, and it is time that something should be done about them.  Farms are left in such a condition that they are of no earthly use to the past owners or to the community generally.  I think the Land Commission make a very grave mistake in not taking steps to see that some use is made of them.  I take the particular case of one or two farms which I know well.  They have been vacant for the past four or five years and the lands have become a commonage. In one case in my own place a certain man applied to the Land Commission for permission to graze those lands.  It happened to be a relation of the person from whom the land had been taken, and he claimed that he had a right to graze the land. He was refused permission to take the <Col N="128" /> grazing, and for some years past that land has been grazed by all and sundry.  Cattle and sheep and horses and donkeys have been turned into it, and instead of that land being of any use to the community or returning any revenue, it is used as a commonage. Would it not have been better business if the Land Commission had agreed to let this land to this man and have got the rent for it and have saved the community from the annuities and the taxes which have been accruing on it every year and which the local ratepayers have to bear?  That is only one specific case.  There are several other cases throughout my county and there are others, I am sure, throughout other counties.  In many cases the annuities have been allowed to run on for several years.  I know of one particular case where the arrears of annuities amount to nearly £1,000.  There are other cases where, if men are only short half a year, they are jumped on at once and before they know where they are they have a solicitor's letter, and they are rushed into court and they have to pay heavy costs, whereas other people are allowed to drift on from year to year with the result that the land has become useless to the country and in the end becomes a terrible charge on the people.</P>
      <P>Then this question of the embankments comes up every year.  A tenant reports a break in his embankment, and applies to the Land Commission. An inspector is sent down and he is told that the work will be done next year or when the weather gets finer. Time passes and the work is not done. In the meantime the stream has encroached inflicting further damage. What could be repaired for a few pounds in the first year costs a considerable amount in the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has been going on for quite a long time.  It is the old case of the stitch in time.  This is one of the things that is causing a considerable amount of irritation in many parts of the country. Every year this matter is brought forward. I suppose next year some Deputy will say the same thing all over again.  Of course it is only by <Col N="129" /> hammering at this question in such a place that we will eventually succeed in getting the work done properly.  We keep writing letters to the Land Commission, we get a courteous acknowledgment and the matter ends there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKiersey" hpid="Mr. Kiersey Mr. Kiersey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiersey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Goulding has dealt with nearly all the points that I was anxious to mention.  He referred to the conditions existing on the land in his portion of the county.  In my end of the county there are several farms in the same position; we can get neither rates nor rent; we are carrying them on our backs.  Deputy Goulding mentioned that one can see on the Co. Council lists where certain tenants are four or five years in arrears.  I have observed within the last couple of days that the process servers were very busy serving writs for the November rent. There are many tenants who have been years in arrear.  Of course they have been passing through a bad time. On the other hand, there are tenants who have been only a few months in arrear, and I think in those cases the Land Commission should not be too hard.</P>
      <P>With regard to the condition of river banks, in many cases they are allowed to get into disrepair, and they cost a great deal of money.  I know of cases where for years the people have been looking to get something done.  The land is absolutely useless during the winter months.  If something were done in the early part of the year, if the Land Commission put in the stitch in time, the expenses would be very much lighter and the tenants would have the use of the land during winter and spring.  At the moment large areas of land can hardly be walked over.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JasperTraversWolfe" hpid="Mr. Wolfe Mr. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express how much I appreciate the work that the Land Commission has done during the last year.  That work reflects great credit, not alone on the Department but on the Saorstát.  I am told that the Minister for Finance is looking for money.  I will give the Minister for Lands and Fisheries a little tip that he might convey to him.  I believe it will produce money very effectively without doing harm to anyone.  At the moment there are in the Land Commission <Col N="130" /> bonds held up representing compounded arrears.  If the Minister could arrange for the payment of those compounded arrears, or rather for the bonds representing the compounded arrears, which are a personal debt due to the former landlord, without waiting for the final allocation of the estate, upon the condition that an affidavit would be filed setting out the ownership of the bonds and, in addition, exhibiting a certificate from the Estate Duty Office that all estate, duties have been discharged, the result would be that the Minister would get quite a substantial amount of money for estate duties which otherwise would only be collected by his successor or, at all events, would only be collected many years hence.  If the owners of these compounded arrears now lying in the Land Commission Office were told that they are entitled to the compounded arrears if they produce a certificate from the Estate Duty Office that all death duties for which they could be held liable are paid, in many cases they will avail of the opportunity and they will pay claims that are now hanging over.</P>
      <P>We are told that the Government are going to provide work for the unemployed. They have plenty of work at hand in the Land Commission Office. There are numbers of examiners on title required to finish the job that has been undertaken there.  At present only temporary hands are being appointed, but even so, there are vacancies.  I suggest that the Minister should look into that matter.  I am not very much in favour of employing people temporarily, because I think the temporary hand does not do anything like the work done by the permanent hand.  The Minister will find that there is sufficient room in that department for the employment of extra hands and, to some extent at least, he would be relieving unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to examiners on title, I hope he will be in a position to tell the House how many have been appointed since the Land Act of 1931 came into operation.  He could also tell us how many of those examiners are solicitors and how many are barristers. If the barristers predominate <Col N="131" /> I expect the Minister will justify their appointment as against solicitors.  We look to the Minister to carry out the honourable understanding of a very distinguished predecessor of his who, in connection with a similar office, led us to understand that these appointments were to be made on a fifty-fifty basis.  I do not object to that basis, but if the appointments in this instance are not so made we will expect an explanation from the Minister.  He will have to justify his attitude if he does not make a fair division of the offices.  I wish the Land Commission every luck.  I must congratulate them on the work they have done.  That work has been due largely to a Cork man, who has done more than anybody in the entire office.  Naturally one would expect that such a man came from Cork.</P>

      <P>When I was speaking on this matter on the last occasion I reported progress.  I am very glad that my colleague, Deputy Wolfe, referred to the matter of the tip he was giving to the Minister.  I hope that tip will not be acted upon.  On a large number of those estates on which these compounded arrears are being anxiously awaited by the landlord I would remind the House that on a large proportion of these the landlords are being paid rents or interest in lieu of rent under false pretences. Compounded arrears are held up, certainly, particularly on account of objections which have been lodged in connection with these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I know just a little more about it than Deputy Wolfe.  Of course the landlord's solicitor should know more about it than I do, I admit that, but I would ask the Minister to go slowly in the paying out until such time as this matter has been adjusted and until the machinery has been, as Deputy Wolfe himself said, implemented. That was the handy phrase the Deputy used.  I would ask him to wait until the machinery is implemented by which these unfortunate tenants will get back a little of what was stolen from them.  I believe that steps have been taken in that direction and I wish the Minister Godspeed in it.</P>
      <P>I was rather amazed at the statement as to a bargain being made between the late Minister for Lands and Fisheries and Deputy Wolfe as to the number of solicitors and barristers employed in the particular Department. I would like to hear a little more about these bargains.  A little more enlightenment would be welcome at present.  Perhaps if the heads of the agreement were placed on the Table of the House they would be most interesting.</P>

He did not refer to any bargain in the matter of appointments between the last Minister for the Department of Lands and Fisheries and Deputy Wolfe.</P>

      <P>I quite understand.  The principal reason why I stood up was to make an appeal to the Minister not to be led away by the soft solder of Deputy Wolfe in regard to compounded arrears.  There was another matter to which I wished to call attention. Costs in those cases are unfortunately continuous, and I would suggest definitely to the Minister that at this stage when in 99 out of every hundred cases on which decrees are given in the land courts there is no defence; the judge goes through them as a matter of form, and when there is no opposition to the decree, he should implement some machinery by which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my point also. There is no existing legislation compelling the Minister to give the issuing of these civil bills to any particular solicitor.  I here suggest to him and I could guarantee that nearly 70 per cent. economies would be achieved if he put the issuing of decrees in these matters up for public tender between all the sharks, and the lowest shark will get the job.  I think I will guarantee that in that case we would have 30/- clipped off the cost of the issuing of one civil bill and as much as £3 or £5 in some cases.  The Minister would find that under tender the jobs would be done for 5/-.  I would suggest to him in the interests of economy and in the interests of the unfortunate tenants affected that he should do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="135" /> I believe this is a fair and sound proposition and one that has been carried out in numbers of societies and there is official precedent for it. It has worked out successfully as some Deputies on the opposite benches can vouch for.  I would suggest that to the Minister as the way out of the matter of getting rid of an intolerable burden on the shoulders of the poor tenants where the cases are not defended and where the decrees go through as a matter of form. It is really only a matter of costs for the solicitors concerned.  I really believe that if the Minister tries this plan he will find it work out most successfully and he will find that the cost on these unfortunate tenants will not amount to one-sixth of what they are now paying.  I put that to him as a matter with which he should deal.</P>
    <P>I also wish to impress upon him that it is high time the Land Commission ceased acquiring land from the banks.  I put it to him very seriously that at present unfortunate people are in this position: their farms are seized by the bank; the tenants are evicted and the banks get possession.  Then these farms are taken over by the Land Commission and the amount due to the Bank is clapped on to the annuities due on the farms when they are being divided up.</P>
    <P>In those particular cases when a bank took possession of a farm the Land Commission had a perfectly sound tenant in the bank to pay the annuities.  The county council had a perfectly sound ratepayer in the bank to pay the rates.  During the past two years the Cork County Council has suffered severely owing to the action of the Land Commission in taking over those farms.  Three were taken over in East Cork, and at present they are lying derelict in the hands of the Land Commission.  The land annuities are piling up on them and the ratepayers are out of pocket. I think it was a false step on the part of the Land Commission to step in in those cases as emergency men for the banks.  That is a mistake that should be rectified now.  One of these farms has been lying in the hands of <Col N="136" /> the Land Commission for nearly two years.  I alluded to it last year. Nobody will take it because of the amount of the annuities the Land Commission was compelled to put on it, due to the fact that they had to pay £800 or £900 to the bank, due by the former tenant.</P>
    <P>As I have said, that was a false step on the part of the Land Commission, one that will have very disastrous results all round.  I suggest seriously to the Minister that he should look carefully into that and see that his Department does not proceed further in that direction.  I say that because if the banks find that the Land Commission are going to step in and relieve them of their burdens then you will have 40 or 50 per cent. of the tenants in this State evicted by the banks.  They will evict the tenants if they feel that the Land Commission will then step in, pay them their money and relieve them of their obligations. That was a false step for the Land Commission to take and I suggest to the Minister that he should abandon it.  There is only one other point that I want to impress on the Minister, and that is that he might consider putting up for tender between solicitors the issuing of those decrees or writs.  I am sure that if he does so that between all the sharks we will get some shark who will take the job at a cheap rate.</P>

      <P>Some time ago when this Estimate was under discussion some statements and speeches were made on the strength of the idea that nothing had taken place with regard to land policy in this State within the last nine or ten years.  Two of the Deputies who have spoken made reference to the rancher.  The rancher as he was understood five or six years <Col N="137" /> ago does not exist at all to-day.  As we understood him in 1922-23 he has gone out of business altogether.  In nearly every case the ranches are now divided up.  If they are not they are in the hands of the Land Commission. The only person who can be called a rancher to-day is the farmer who owns 100, 150 or perhaps 200 acres.  It was said here that that class of man only produces summer beef and that he was of no use to the community.  I think if that class of man is eliminated a good many people in this State will come to realise that a grave wrong has been done.</P>
      <P>It has also been said that winter beef is produced by the small farmer. That is not so.  It is produced by the fairly large farmer.  The small farmer only produces beef in small quantities. The man who produces beef is generally a tillage farmer who has to grow corn crops, manure the ground through the cultivation of root crops, and who has to feed in the winter.  In most cases, beef is produced by the tillage farmer, and the holdings of those farmers are bigger; they are as big, anyhow, as the ranches as they exist to-day.  High annuities are payable in regard to the estates that have been acquired within the last eight or nine years.  If that is so, it is not the fault of the Government that negotiated the sales.  It is the fault of the mobs that were misled by certain agitators down the country who forced the Government to buy regardless of the price.  Time and again we have heard this: you buy, no matter what the price is.  In almost every case the estates were bought in or about the market price.  Many of us gave advice at the time not to force these estates for division: to wait until things became normal.  That advice was not taken either by the people who wanted the lands divided or even by the Government at the time.  We advised the Government not to be too hasty or to accede to the howlings of the mob, even though it was led by men who are now members of this House.</P>

      <P>With regard to the purchase of tenanted land at least a certain principle was laid down here for guidance.  I would like to hear whether that principle is denied or not; that is to say that the vendor was entitled to the price that his land would fetch at a public auction.  Does anyone contend that the price of tenanted land should be anything less than the price it would fetch at public auction?  On the last occasion we discussed this Vote I heard Deputy Curran say in respect to the price paid by the Land Commission for land in the County Dublin that the land would not fetch half that price at a public auction.  That is a statement that ought not to be allowed to go unchallenged even by the present occupants of the Government Benches, because it is not true.  We know that the price paid by the Land Commission in recent years for any class of land is much less than the price the land would fetch by public auction, and where the Land Commission is operating freely, land is worth very much less than it is in districts where the Land Commission is not operating, or in which there is no necessity for it to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a long discussion here, on nearly every Vote for the last seven or eight years, with regard to derelict farms.  Some Deputies, and, perhaps, some members of the public, will say that if a farm is taken from a certain occupier, it is an eviction, and that a great wrong is being done to him.  There are people who are occupying land which would come under this heading of derelict farms, who will never make good and the longer they are left there, the more derelict will the farm become, and the less interest, and the less value, will it be to the occupier. Would it not be much better in cases where the Land Commission make up their minds that certain men cannot improve their position, to try and have a free sale by which some decent amount of money would come to the unfortunate occupier of such a derelict farm?  With a restricted sale, no money at all is going to come to him, but with a free sale it would, perhaps, <Col N="140" /> be of some good to him.  That is an angle I would like to have considered. Farms sold with the consent of the occupier, will fetch two or three times as much, and more maybe, than they will fetch if they are put up otherwise, and in that respect, something should be done for the unfortunate owner.  Again, if the annuities are allowed to pile up year after year the occupier's interest will be becoming less all the time, while his position is not being improved, and, as a matter of fact, he will be unfitted for doing anything else.  That is an aspect I would put up to the Land Commission.  I say that it would be better for him to quit before the load becomes too heavy, and, in that way, the owner's interest would be enhanced, because if the land is put up under his consent, the chances are that he will get two or three times more.</P>
    <P>There is, perhaps, some truth in what Deputy Corry said, although I do not agree with him.  Trade is so brisk at present, in the issuing and serving of writs, that I think it would be good business to get it done at almost a quarter of the charges that obtained a few years ago.  Yesterday, when I was coming from Waterford, I met a process server&mdash;I do not know what the correct term is&mdash;a court messenger, who told me that he was making between £7 and £12 a week.  He said that formerly the most he could get was one job in a month or so, while now he had a dozen a day.  There might be something in what Deputy Corry says, as to putting these positions up for contract, because it is the only business thriving, at least, in my part of the country, and you might get it done at rates cheaper than the rates originally fixed.</P>
    <P>It is rather tragic when one comes to think about the present position. Writs and court orders for small amounts are not, in my opinion, justified, and reasonable efforts should be made before putting people to a lot of expense.  I know that certain formulae have to be gone through, and when they have not been gone through, it is the man's own fault, but there is <Col N="141" /> quite a difference between &ldquo;writting&rdquo; a man for a year or two years' annuities and &ldquo;writting&rdquo; him for six months' annuities.  Unless it is the policy of the present Government to stampede the people into paying, no matter what the justice of the demand is, I suggest that they should revert to the methods of the late Government. It is not the fault of the annuitants. Time and again, we have listened to politicians on public platforms&mdash;I will admit that the President did not, but the men further down the line&mdash;advising the tenants, and asking &ldquo;Do you pay any annuities here?  We are not paying any in our part of the country,&rdquo; and again, &ldquo;Wait until we get in,&rdquo; followed by a wink with either eye, and a nod and a grin.  I know of hundreds of people in my own constituency, who have been led into their present position because of tactics of that description.</P>

Those were his exact words, and if that has been translated into actual practice by the annuitant who is to blame?  I will admit that the President has not spoken anything like so plainly as some of the lesser lights, but the President has said, time and again, and the President, or anybody else, cannot deny it, that the annuitant must pay something for possession of the land, based on his capacity to pay. In that case, I suppose we are to establish capacity courts to try the annuitants' capacity.</P>

      <P>If I am not allowed to deal with it, very well.  I do not know what sort of services have been rendered by the Land Commission in the past with regard to embankments. Some simple jobs have been done, such as repairing embankments twenty-five or thirty yards wide.  The Dutch were able to keep the sea out two hundred years ago, and the Shannon scheme was constructed, but small embankments on the Nore and on the Barrow have not been made perfect yet.  Two or three attempts to do the work were failures.  The original embankments were made, but smaller jobs have been failures, because what were small gaps at first have now become enlarged seven or eight times the original size.  I do not think that is a tribute to our engineers or to the Department.  I am not expecting the Minister or his officers to do the work, but I am expecting that the experts from the Department or the Board of Works, wherever they are, would have dealt with this matter.  Up to the present they have done damn bad work.</P>

      <P>It is often used in this House.  Very bad work has been done where attempts were made to do it. In some cases practically the entire holdings have been swept away. The injury done to land is very bad in the parish of Tullavin, on the banks of the Barrow.  I ask the Minister to make another attempt to deal with the problem, and to send someone down to these districts in order that the banks would be restored to their original position.  I understand that work was begun on the bank of the river as originally constructed but that the work gave away.  The officials concerned then went back a considerable distance on the land and when that failed they went back further but the attempt was also a failure.  I would ask the Minister to send down men who would restore the bank to its original position, <Col N="144" /> because by doing so he will be restoring property to the owners and preserving a security to the State, seeing that the State is security for the annuities.  The Sinking Fund and the principal have to be met.  If the Government gets away with the annuity it will be all right but at present we have to pay the debts and our security is disappearing in this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one item in this Estimate, amounting to £100, dealing with unoccupied holdings. Surely anyone who knows the amount of unoccupied land in County Cork must realise that there is a larger loss than that.  It seems incredible that this particular aspect of the land question has dragged on the length it has, without something being done to rectify an evil that entails loss to the whole community.  There is a double loss on these holdings, a loss of the annuity charge on the agricultural grant, and a loss in unpaid rates. There will be a loss, while no effort is made to adopt curative methods. While the debt remains on these holdings nothing will be paid on them, and no attempt will be made to let them. The occupants will continue to drag out an existence, akin to starvation, in the hope that they will be able to retain land that belonged to their ancestors. I suggest to the Minister that the time has come when he should introduce some measure to alleviate the position and to deal with these arrears in a sympathetic manner.  There is no hope of collecting these arrears as matters stand at present.  If the Minister would permit them to remain a debt on the farm, it might work out all right.  That might involve legislation, but it would be well, I think, if they were permitted to remain a debt on the farm.  Let the public and the tenant understand that.  You could then try to deal with these farms in various ways.  Portion of them could be sold at the regular annuity at present on them or they could be sublet. Probably they would be let for grazing or something would be done which would render them an economic proposition. As they stand, they are an absolute loss to the whole community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="145" /> I should like the Minister to say if it would not be possible to put those arrears back to the end of the repayment period.  Let them be a debt on the farm and, when the purchase price has been paid, they can continue to pay these arrears as an annuity.  As matters stand at present, there is no hope of getting the arrears.  Why then continue them as arrears?  My suggestion would not involve a loss to the State.  At the end of sixty years or so they would be wiped out.  It would be possible under my suggestion to put these farms once again on the market.  Many of the tenants of these farms are in a hopeless position.  In all probability, these farms would then realise their full value in the open market.  There may be a judgment mortgage upon them.  They are loaded with debts to bankers and shopkeepers, and something will have to be done with regard to the arrears and the rates.  Two years' arrears would be accepted if the farms were being sold by the county councils.  You could start with a clean sheet if somebody else was in occupation who could make them pay.  These men have no capital.  They have in many cases lost interest in their holdings.  The farms have become ineffective as wealth producers. The holders have lost the capacity to make them pay.  I suggest seriously to the Minister that the time has come to deal with this question of arrears sympathetically.  These men have fallen, perhaps, through no fault of their own.  Even if it was their fault, we are all aware of the change of conditions in recent years&mdash;the enormous gap between the receipts of the farmer for the produce of his land and the amount he had to pay.  No aspect of this Vote would call for more sympathetic treatment by the Minister than this, and I ask him to deal with it at once.</P>

      <P>In connection with the sub-head to which the last Deputy referred, I should like to draw attention to a farm in my own area.  The annuity in respect of that farm is £60. With the exception of one year, it has been derelict for a very long period. I understand that the position is that there is about £600 of arrears on it. <Col N="146" /> The Land Commission cannot let it unless the arrears are paid up.  I bring the case before the Minister in the hope that he will look into it and see if anything can be done to remove the difficulty.  The money is due to the county council and, at present, nothing can be done to improve the position. I am sure that a number of tenants would pay something to get into occupation, but I think the annuities are difficult to meet.  I hope the Minister will inquire into the case.  I shall give him particulars as to the situation of the farm any time he wishes.</P>

      <P>Deputy Roddy, at the opening of this debate, explained the obvious reason that this Estimate got such a smooth passage.  The Estimate was prepared before the present Government came into office.  The figures set out in it are the figures prepared before the late Government left office.  The criticism to which the Vote has been subjected was largely concerned with details of administration and with matters that can be dealt with administratively.  Deputy Roddy referred to one aspect of reclamation work, and Deputy Lynch dealt in greater detail with another aspect of reclamation work.  What Deputy Roddy had in mind, I understand, was reclamation work, experimented in by the Land Commission in Galway, Mayo and Donegal.  Comparatively large areas of mountain or bog were taken over by the Land Commission in these counties, and experiments were carried out by way of reclaiming those areas. Deputy Lynch dealt with another aspect of reclamation, which appeals to me more than Deputy Roddy's aspect, and which I think would appeal more to the House as producing better and earlier returns so far as the tenant farmers are concerned&mdash;that is reclamation that might be carried out by the tenant farmers of bog or mountain contiguous to their holdings. Both these aspects of reclamation work are in an experimental stage.  As every Deputy will recognise, it is costly work.  At the same time it must be recognised by the Land Commission that in a country like this, where every foot of land that can be made available <Col N="147" /> is valuable, no opportunity must be lost sight of so far as reclamation is concerned.  They must try to avail to the fullest extent of the land that can be made available for the people. I can assure Deputy Roddy, Deputy Lynch and other Deputies interested, that it is not the policy of the Land Commission to turn back the hands of the clock, but that it is their policy to pursue the lines of experiment that they have pursued up to the present. They hope to push it forward at a faster rate, so far as they can economically do it.  Before the energies of the Land Commission can be turned in that direction to any considerable extent, we have to deal with the more urgent question of acquiring and dividing the untenanted land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Roddy referred to the cases under Section 44 of the 1931 Act and wanted to get some information.  From the way Deputy Roddy referred to them, one would assume that these were simple cases and could be easily dealt with.  Up to the present, about 280 applications have been made.  Of these, about 80 cases have been dealt with or are in course of being dealt with.  Two inspectors have been set aside specially to deal with these cases and every effort is being made by the Land Commission to expedite and hurry up that matter.  Deputy Brasier, Deputy Gorey and other Deputies have referred to the question of erosion and embankments.  Several commissions&mdash;royal and otherwise&mdash; were set up in connection with this matter.  They made reports and recommended experiments.  Yet, we find that the position at present is as acute as, if not more acute than, it was before these commissions were set up. This is a big matter.  It may appear to Deputy Gorey that these banks along a river are easy to deal with.  To deal with this question effectively would entail a cost that I do not think would be justified.  To establish protective works where erosion has been affected by the sea or by rivers would entail expenditure of such magnitude that I do not think the House would Vote the sum if we came and asked for it.  The Land Commission are considering <Col N="148" /> at present how far they can deal with this matter administratively. It may be necessary to introduce legislation.  As Deputies are aware, where erosion brings about a reduction in the area of tenant purchasers, it does not relieve them of liability for the annuities nor does it relieve the Land Commission of the obligation to collect the annuities.  Ameliorative measures may have to be resorted to to meet this aspect of the case.  It seems eminently fair that such steps should be taken in cases where considerable areas have been submerged or have been eaten away.  It may be necessary, in order to remove that hardship, to introduce legislation.  That is being considered at the moment. Deputy Gorey may have in mind particular cases where only a small expenditure of money would be required.  The Land Commission are quite prepared to examine any of those cases which are brought to their notice and to try to remedy them.  If Deputy Gorey has any special cases in mind and if he brings them to the notice of the Land Commission they will be dealt with as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Curran, on the last day, referred to lands in County Dublin which were divided up, the grazing afterwards being taken by the former vendor.  The only case that I have been able to trace to which his remarks would apply is that of the Counihan farms at Swords.  I think he referred to Swords.  Those lands were taken over at what would not be considered an exorbitant price and were allotted.  In one of those cases, I think the person to whom the land was allotted had died and the family were not able to arrange matters. Trustees had to be appointed.  Others of them may not be able to stock the land for the time being.  Some difficulties have arisen.  The land was let back to the former vendor by the allottees but they made a substantial profit over and above the rent charged by the Land Commission.  I think that would be a complete answer so far as the statement goes that an exorbitant price had been paid.  One of these allottees got 67 acres.  His annuity is £67 and the land is at present let at <Col N="149" /> £100 to the vendor.  Another of the allottees got 14 acres.  The annuity is £16 3s. 0d. and the land is at present let at £25 per year.  Another of the allottees got 14 acres, subject to an annuity of £16 5s. 0d.  He has also made a substantial profit.  I have not been able to obtain the exact figures. There may have been cases here and there through the country where what might be considered exorbitant prices were paid.  It is quite possible, if these cases were examined, that it will be found that there was an agitation and a demand from the people to take over the lands at whatever price they could be got for.  I think every Deputy has experience that farmers who are badly in need of land are prepared to give any price to get into land and think they will be able to make it an economic proposition.  It is only years afterwards that they see the futility of it, and see how short-sighted they were in thinking that on such an annuity they could make any reasonable profit or decent livelihood out of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Reilly (Meath) referred to a case near the commons.  I have tried to trace the case, but I have not been able.  He referred to another case that he raised some question about in the House.  As regards the lands of the commons there were only 36 acres available.  I think the other farm he has in mind is rather convenient to that and at the moment is the subject of inquiry.  He also referred to a migrant who was employed as a ganger.  There is one migrant who was brought from Galway, I think, who was formerly employed by the Land Commission in that and other areas.  He was an experienced ganger and his services were taken on, when he was transferred to Meath, by the Land Commission for a very limited job and a very limited period owing to his experience.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hassett has referred to the position in Tipperary.  I think the Deputy and other Deputies from Tipperary are well aware that for the last month or so the position in Tipperary has been brought very <Col N="150" /> acutely before the Land Commission. Tipperary has had more ranches divided than any other county in the Saorstát outside Galway.  I know that a considerable area of land was in the hands of the Land Commission. When representations were made to me some six or eight weeks ago, I took all possible steps to try and speed up the division of these lands. I think that after some short period we are in the position of having over 7,000 acres actually allotted, subject to putting the scheme into operation. I think that within a fortnight or three weeks from that period it was calculated that we would have allotted altogether in Tipperary something over 15,000 acres.  That was in respect of some schemes that had been partly considered, schemes held up for some time, and other schemes that were in a backward way.  Difficulties have arisen at the moment in Tipperary as to these allotments.  I believe that these difficulties will be overcome.  It has been represented to the Land Commission that, so far as Tipperary is concerned, and so far as other counties are concerned also, there is no advantage to be gained by the new allottees being put into possession at this particular time, and that it is in the interests of the new allottees themselves that their actually being put into possession should be put off until October.  That is the position with other counties as well as Tipperary, to some extent.  It is not considered suitable that fencing should be proceeded with at this time of the year, and the lands in the meantime between now and October can be economically let for grazing or meadowing or other purposes like that.</P>
    <P>There was a complaint made by Deputy Flynn (Kerry) with regard to the amount of money spent in Kerry on improvement works and relief works in comparison with the County Galway.  To understand the position with regard to Kerry and Galway one has to take their relative positions.  He said that a sum of only £75,000 was spent on improvement works in Kerry during the seven years ending March 31st, 1931, as compared with £276,500 <Col N="151" /> spent in the same period in Galway, and that only £43,000 was spent in relief works in Kerry compared with £64,000 in Galway during the same seven years.  As I pointed out in my opening statement, improvement works are in a different category from relief works.  Improvement works are related to the work of the Land Commission when they take over an estate, and are parcelling it out and dealing with it.  These improvement works have to be closely examined, and they are entirely apart, and considered in a different way altogether from that in which relief works are considered.  Relief works can be examined on the spot and dealt with expeditiously and are not subject to the same methods of examination as improvement works. If we take the amount of untenanted land dealt with by the Land Commission in Kerry during that period, and contrast it with the amount of land dealt with during the same period in Galway, it will give some relative idea, at any rate, as to how this money was spent.  Up to 30th September last the Land Commission acquired 4,400 acres of untenanted land in Kerry.  In Galway they acquired 99,000 acres. In County Kerry they actually divided 3,450 acres, and in Galway 63,000. That will, to some extent, explain why there is such an exceptional difference between the amount expended on improvement and relief works in Galway, as compared with the amount spent in Kerry.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have raised the question of derelict farms and the present position of the Land Commission with regard to seizures and so on that might take place on these lands that the Land Commission have decrees against.  I am afraid very few Deputies have examined into the real cause of these farms being derelict. I am sure that if Deputies examined into the cause they would find that at least in over 70 per cent. of the cases the Land Commission are not responsible. In the great majority of cases, although there may be arrears of annuities due to the Land Commission, it will be found that it is creditors, such as banks and others, who have <Col N="152" /> really a hold over these lands.  They are paying the annuities to the Land Commission as they collect them. There may be a few cases here and there, but the number of derelict farms that are non-productive for the Land Commission is very small.  What is the alternative?  In every one of these cases we are told that the people are afraid to stock the farms as the sheriff will seize the stock; that other people are afraid to graze them because their stock will be seized.  There is not a single case where a reasonable proposition is put up to the Land Commission with regard to the payment of arrears out of the letting of these lands that an arrangement cannot be come to.  All the Land Commission ask is that where there are arrears due the annuitant who is in default should go to an auctioneer and that the auctioneer should give an undertaking that out of the grazing money he will pay a certain proportion to the Land Commission, and so far as the Land Commission is concerned no sheriff will seize the stock.  If anybody's farm is derelict it is his own fault.  There may be exceptional cases, but they are very rare, and there is no ground whatever for the case made here that holdings are derelict through the fault of the Land Commission.  That is not so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of leaving over arrears.  What we want to get, and what we are trying to get the tenants to do is that, so far as they can, they will make arrangements to pay the Land Commission by instalments. After all, if we owe rates out of our holdings we have to pay them; if we owe debts to the shopkeeper or other people, we have to pay them, and the Land Commission in this matter is in the position of any other creditor.  They are anxious to make arrangements without any degree of harshness, and they are always agreeable to take payment of arrears by instalments that will be considered suitable and reasonable.  If such <Col N="153" /> propositions that may appear harsh to Deputies, are brought to the notice of the Land Commission they will be sympathetically considered, and such have been so considered, I am informed, when brought to the notice of the Commission from time to time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister state the policy of the Commission on the matter of arrears?  Take the case where there are four or five years' arrears upon the farm.  No effort will be made to deal with these unless a public representative puts some sort of a policy before the people in arrears. Until they take that course nothing can be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The step that I have suggested to the Deputy is one way of dealing with it.  If lands are derelict, I say that when you get down to the root of the matter, you will find, in 90 per cent., they are not derelict owing to the activities of the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>But what arrangements can the Land Commission make when you have other creditors who can seize and give trouble and bring instalment orders and get enforcement of Court order against these people? What can the Land Commission do? All the Land Commission wants is that a portion of these arrears should be paid to them and any reasonable proposition with regard to meeting these arrears will be considered.  As regards the question suggested by Deputy Flynn (Kerry), that the sheriff might be empowered to take arrears by instalments when he comes there with a judgment, that is a practice that could not be resorted to by the Land Commission.  That is a power that could not be delegated to any official. If the tenant farmer, decreed either for rent or arrears, comes to make a settlement through the Land Commission payment will be taken from him by instalments&mdash;reasonable instalments&mdash;but they cannot make a departure from the practice presently in force, and they must insist on the sheriff collecting what he can get at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="154" /> Suggestions were made with regard to the question of costs.  It is not the Land Commission costs more than any other costs.  The scale of costs may be high but that must be dealt with in another way.  It is not the fault of the Land Commission.  When this was examined before the Courts of Justice Committee the Land Commission made a certain suggestion.  When the Rules of Court came before the Dáil I opposed them, not with regard to the Land Commission, but on the ground that the scale of costs was too high. This is being looked into by the Land Commission at the present time with a view to seeing what can be done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wolfe referred to the question of the bonds.  What he had in mind, I think, was that the bonds should be released without waiting for the final allocation.  That may be very desirable in so far as the present Minister for Finance is concerned, but I am surprised that Deputy Wolfe is not looking further ahead and hoping against hope that at some time there might be some other Minister for Finance who might profit by that in the future.  I am sure it is a matter that will be sympathetically considered by the Minister for Finance and I shall bring it to his notice.  Another matter Deputy Wolfe raised was the question by which he wanted a fifty-fifty basis for the appointment of solicitors and barristers as examiners.  A number of examiners were appointed in the last 12 or 18 months, and so far as I am aware there is no necessity to increase that number.  The objection is taken by Deputy Wolfe that these appointments are temporary but the work is of a temporary character.  It is a loss to the State if you make permanent appointments where the <Col N="155" /> work is of a temporary character and that is not the practice in the Department. You cannot go on any basis of percentage for solicitors and barristers. These positions are open to solicitors and barristers; they are positions for which both are eligible. They are filled by the Civil Service Commissioners who recommend to the Minister the most suitable people for the position.  We cannot consider if they are solicitors or barristers and I do not think that any Deputy in the House is serious about it except Deputy Wolfe and I doubt if he is serious about it.</P>
    <P>On this question of the arrears I notice that Deputy Roddy complained on the last day that some particulars were not given to the House as to the position of the arrears of land annuities.  I think that when Deputies hear the figures they will be satisfied that the arrears of land annuities are being collected and that there has been no attempt, no organised attempt, at any rate, to prevent their payment.  The arrears are being collected satisfactorily and they are coming in much better than this time last year.  I shall deal with that in a moment.</P>
    <P>As to what Deputy Gorey said as to sheaves of civil bills being sent through the country, take the position on 31st January in the present year. At that time, there was £776,352 of arrears of land annuities.  Now for the months ending February and March of the present year the Land Commission collected £226,715, so that in two months the Land Commission collected something less than a quarter of a million pounds arrears.  The figures at the 31st March, 1932, were £549,643, and if you take the payments from 31st March down to the present time, taking the latest date that we can get, 18th May, the arrears amounted to £485,495.  Now from 1st April to 18th May last year, the sum of £47,103 was collected; for the period 1st April to 18th May this year, £64,232 was collected.  Even if you take it by weeks you must take in conjunction with that the moneys that are paid in respect, not of arrears, but of <Col N="156" /> current annuities falling due.  From the 21st May to the 18th May of last year there were 74,354 separate payments, representing £415,773.  From May 2nd, 1932, to the 28th, there were 73,502 payments representing £378,920. There were practically the same number of payments, but some of those payments were not so large.  That is the position with regard to the collection of those arrears.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gorey is inclined to blame everybody without naming anybody for something that he is really not informed about, and that is the position with regard to arrears.  He has represented that civil bills are being sent out wholesale through the country. No such position has arisen.  The normal procedure of the Land Commission is being followed, and that is simply about the month of March in each year a schedule or a list of defaulters is made out.  That schedule is sent to the State solicitors through the country and proceedings are taken.  Prior to that being sent out, six-day notices had already been furnished and demands made upon those people.  After all, in any business, if you send out your demand note in the ordinary way and that is ignored and you send out six-day notices, which is a very definite notice, and that is ignored, and three or four months afterwards you send for the State solicitors can anyone complain?  Meantime you have done nothing, you have made no representation to the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I am not aware and the Land Commission do not appear to be aware that anything abnormal has happened this year with regard to sending out sheafs of civil bills.  There has been no attempt made by the Land Commission to shut its eyes to the depressed condition that exists in agriculture in the country.  There has been every attempt made by the Land Commission to meet people in a reasonable and understanding way.  If people are complaining about the number of civil bills that have been issued through the country it is because representations have not been made by these people showing the true state of the facts.  There is no use in <Col N="157" /> Deputy Gorey making the statement that somebody had stated that they would not have to pay.  Can he give us the name of that person?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>That same thing is bandied about this House and through the country that some mysterious person went through the country telling people, as Deputy Gorey said, with a wink, that they would not have to pay their land annuities.  I want to know who stated it and where it was stated.  We have got an opportunity in this House.  The statement has been made that it was made by somebody lower down.  When we get a chance like this to challenge it we do so.  I ask Deputy Gorey to say who is the person who made that statement. You have Deputy Gorey and other Deputies going through the country and stating on every side that Fianna Fáil Deputies told them not to pay the land annuities.  They know perfectly well that that is untrue, that Fianna Fáil Deputies have told them quite explicitly that the land annuities would have to be paid.  I am glad that Deputy Gorey made that statement for the simple reason that we get a chance here across the House to pin him definitely down.  If Deputy Gorey could state who this person is who made that statement.  I say that nobody here made it.  I do not know what visions or dreams Deputy Gorey had.  In any case I hope there is an end to such statements.  The figures I have read out indicate very clearly that the people were not advised not to pay land annuities, because the people are paying them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down a question which appeared as No. 1 on the Order Paper to-day.  A particular answer was given with which I expressed my dissatisfaction and indicated that I would raise the matter to-night.  That question was only supplemental to one put down on the 25th May.  That was supplemental to certain things which happened earlier in this House and to those I want to refer.  When I was speaking on the Budget on the 20th May I asked:</P>
      <P>Does the Minister for Finance found his anticipation of the yield on a continuation of trade, as it runs at the moment?  Does he feel that Ottawa is going to be of any advantage to us in retaining certain preferences which we have at present?</P>
      <P>Then I continued:</P>
      <P>I have been anxiously waiting news for weeks past about a certain suggestion made before I left office and which was agreed to, namely, that there should be meetings between our High Commissioner in London and British officials to discuss State matters, and that there should be, at the same time, meetings between the British Trade Commissioner in this country and high officers of State to discuss the same trade matters.  That was the preamble to a good Ottawa Conference, and without such a preamble and without discussion of economic matters no good will come out of the Ottawa Conference, even if there were no political clouds in the background.</P>
      <P>Then I asked:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Have these meetings taken place? Have preparations been inaugurated with the British?  Have the British been asked to have that preparation, have they refused to meet us? <Col N="160" /> Remember it was their suggestion at the beginning, a suggestion that we accepted, and that the present Government should have adopted and carried out.  I should like to have that question seriously answered.  Have these meetings taken place, and if not, why not? If they do not take place, what are the prospects for Ottawa, and if Ottawa offers no prospects what are the Minister's prospects in getting in the yield of taxation he hopes for, and what hope is there in this year of getting his Budget balanced?</P>
    <P>That was Friday, 20th May.  That evening an official communication was issued by the Government.  It runs as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A suggestion was made by Great Britain last December to the other Governments of the Commonwealth that an informal exchange of views should take place on the questions which may come up for discussion at Ottawa.</P>
    <P>The late Government of the Saorstát accepted this suggestion on the 1st January last but, so far, no discussions have taken place.</P>
    <P>The acceptance of the invitation, however, holds good and the Government will be quite willing to commence discussions when its preparations for the Ottawa Conference are sufficiently advanced.</P>
    <P>That was the first day on which this matter was raised by me by reference to the suggestion made on which I founded certain questions, the gist of the questions being: have discussions taken place, have they been requested, and if so, with what result?  That led to the official communication from the Government which I have just read and the gist of which I think might be said to lie in the last paragraph.</P>
    <P>The acceptance of the invitation, however, holds good and the Government will be quite willing to commence discussions when its preparations for the Ottawa Conference are sufficiently advanced.</P>
    <P>I think it is a fair interpretation of that statement to say it was meant to <Col N="161" /> convey an implication that no requests for discussion had up to that date been made and that the reason why no requests for discussion had been made was because the preparations made by the Government were not sufficiently advanced.</P>
    <P>I took the matter a step further on the 25th May, when I put down the following question:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for External Affairs if, in relation to the suggestion made by Great Britain last December to the Government of the Irish Free State that informal exchanges of views should take place on the questions which might come up for discussion at Ottawa, any representation or request has been made to the British Government by or on behalf of the Government of the Irish Free State to have the discussions commenced, and, if so, with what result.</P>
    <P>The reply was read by the Vice-President on behalf of the Minister for External Affairs to this effect:</P>
    <P>No exchange of views has taken place between the Saorstát and the British Government on the questions which might come up for discussion at Ottawa.  We understand that our position in this respect is not different from that of at least two other States of the Commonwealth. The High Commissioner asked for information or suggested discussion on five distinct occasions between the beginning of January and the middle of the present month.  He received certain documents relating to the trade between these two countries on the 18th April.  Further information was promised.  It must be remembered, however, that the agenda for the Conference was not circulated by the Canadian Government until yesterday, and without the agenda discussions could hardly be expected to yield concrete results.</P>
    <P>On that I made certain supplemental remarks and questions to the effect that the suggestion for informal discussion was made last December and envisaged discussion taking place prior to the circulation of the agenda. <Col N="162" /> I went on to ask if the High Commissioner, on behalf of the Government of Saorstát Eireann, made any request to have discussions commenced, and, if so, what reason was returned to him?  The Vice-President on that occasion told me that he was not familiar with the details and requested me to put down a question once more, and I did put it down for to-day.  Before coming to what happened to-day, I want to point out what I think can be said to be the correct interpretation of the second question.  I asked previously had any representation or request been made to the British Government by or on behalf of the Irish Free State Government, if these discussions had commenced and, if so, with what result. The reply I got contained about seven sentences, only one of which was really relevant.  It is:</P>
    <P>No exchange of views has taken place on the questions which might come up for discussion at Ottawa.</P>
    <P>The second thing was explanatory and by way of excuse and it showed a bad conscience.</P>
    <P>We understand that our position in this respect is not different from that of at least two other States of the Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>The third sentence gave me this information which contradicted the official statement of the 20th May.</P>
    <P>The High Commissioner asked for information or suggested discussion on five distinct occasions between the beginning of January and the middle of the present month.</P>
    <P>I want that put in contrast to the phrase used in the official communication that the Government will be quite willing to commence discussions when its preparations for the Ottawa Conference are sufficiently advanced. A few days later we were told that although the preparations are not sufficiently advanced on five distinct occasions information was requested and discussions suggested and we do not know what happened.  What we do know is this: the High Commissioner received certain documents relating to the trade between these two <Col N="163" /> countries on the 18th April.  The date is significant.  Two days before the introduction of the Bill with regard to the removal of the Oath.  He did receive a document on that date.  The answer continued:</P>
    <P>Further information was promised.</P>
    <P>He does not continue to tell us whether the further information promised ever reached the hands of the Government.  All that we do know is what is contained in the last sentence that the agenda for the Conference was not circulated until yesterday, and without the agenda discussions could hardly be expected to yield concrete results.  Again I want to make a suggestion and it is this: that clearly the present Government of this country has not received any communication from the British Government since the l8th April, because if they had it would have been stressed, and the date is significant, and realising the significance of the date at the request of the Vice-President to put this question down I phrased it for this morning in this way:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for External Affairs if he will state with regard to the requests or representations as to information about or discussions on matters likely to arise at Ottawa stated to have been made to the British Government by the High Commissioner (a) if the High Commissioner suggested discussion on any occasion since April 20th, and, if so, how often and with what result; and (b) if the High Commissioner requested information on any occasion since April 20th, and, if so, how often and with what result.</P>
    <P>The answer given to me this morning was as follows:</P>
    <P>The information sought for by the Deputy relates to communications between this Government and another Government.  The giving of such precise details as the Deputy requires concerning the actions of a particular civil servant in relation to such communications could hardly serve the general interests of the State or the efficient working of the Department of <Col N="164" /> External Affairs.  The Deputy will have to be satisfied with the information that no change has taken place in the situation described in my answer to his question of the 25th May relating to the same subject.</P>
    <P>It is to be noticed that there is, as was clear from the President on another occasion, a definite attempt to throw on to the shoulders of the civil servant a duty which should have been performed by him, an omission which was in fact the President's.  I put a supplemental question.  I said I was not concerned with what any civil servant may have done.  My previous question to which this question is really supplemental as requested by the Vice-President related to requests made on behalf of the Free State Government. Everything said since was supplemental to that and that runs right through the whole question.  I did go on to ask if any discussion had been suggested by the High Commissioner since the vital date, the 20th April, this year, if so, what was the result.  To that I was told that no further information could be given to me except what was already given. What is the situation in which we find ourselves?  That there is an important Conference coming off, that until arrangements have been made to formulate any legislation arising out of that Conference a certain preference now given to our goods on the British markets holds and the date up to which these things hold is to be mid-November of this year.</P>
    <P>That date was fixed according to the spokesman of the British Government in the House of Commons when the date was mentioned because it was thought that any arrangement come to at Ottawa would require a couple of months to get formulated in precise Parliamentary language.  Consequently, the 15th November was put down as the extreme date to which the original preference would hold.  We got considerable advantage from this preference.  We saw statements in the Press.  We got a confirmed statement to-day to some extent that a delegation of ours was going to Ottawa.  We <Col N="165" /> were told to-day also that it is necessary to meet four days a week from this until the 8th July and to sit until 10.30 on Tuesday nights because we have such a pressure of business which it is necessary for some of the Ministers going to Ottawa to get through before they leave the country on the 8th July, the last date possible if they are to be in time for the Ottawa Conference.</P>
    <P>We have five Parliamentary weeks and a mass of business for these five Parliamentary weeks.  We have an invitation hanging fire from the British Government since last December to have informal exchanges of views, and nobody in this country knows precisely whether or not any proper return has been made to that invitation to have these exchanges of views; or alternatively nobody in this country knows whether, a proper approach having been made by this Government to the British Government, that approach has been turned down.  We have only five short weeks of Parliamentary time, with a mass of business awaiting these Ministers, in which to get the necessary discussions&mdash;what I described as the necessary preamble to the Ottawa Conference.  We get instead of it what I have read out to-night, and I think there is sufficient mystification and sufficient contradiction in what I have read to-night to make people wonder what exactly is the situation with regard to these preliminaries to a good Ottawa Conference.</P>
    <P>On the first day I raised it we got the hasty rush into print that the official invitation was received and that the acceptance of it still holds good.  That is followed with the precise statement, meant to delude the public, that the Government here would be quite willing to commence discussion when its preparations for the Conference were sufficiently advanced. A variety of things can be read into that; but two or three things clearly must be read into it.  One, that there has been no attempt to initiate the discussion up to the date of that communication of the 20th May, and the reason that there had beer no attempt to initiate a discussion was <Col N="166" /> because the Government here was not sufficiently advanced with its preparation. Yet, five days later, I could be told, in answer to a question, that the High Commissioner had on five distinct occasions approached the British Government.  The answer ceased to be precise at that moment.  The High Commissioner had either asked for information or suggested discussions. At any rate, he did suggest discussions. That is clear.</P>
    <P>Some time between January and the middle of May discussions were suggested by the High Commissioner and information was requested, and the only information that apparently was got, that was thought worthy of note, in the reply to this question of mine, was that certain documents relating to the trade between the two countries were received on 18th April, with the added information that further information was promised, but without the additional information as to whether or not that information came to hand. Lastly, we get the farce by way of answer this morning when I segregated it to the precise item, had the High Commissioner asked for information and had he suggested discussion since the 20th April?  I am told that it would not serve the general interests of the State to give any information on that point.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which is relevant to this.  It was introduced as a relevant matter to the answer I read with regard to the information given and the further information promised. Since the Canadian Parliament adjourned an official communication has been issued on their behalf stating that now that Parliament was out of session the Canadian Government hopes to find time to discuss the long document communicated to them by the British Government suggesting a list of materials on which the British Government thinks the Canadian Government might make concessions to it. The Canadian Government says they circulated that document to their manufacturers and that they are going to have a conference with them.  It has also been rumoured&mdash;I cannot say if it has been officially communicated &mdash;that a document similar to that <Col N="167" /> document has been received by the New Zealand and Australian Governments and there has been a suggestion in the papers that the South African Government is in possession of a similar document.  I think it is clear from the answers made to me that we have not received such a document, because the only document referred to is the document relating to the trade between the two countries, circulated on the 18th April.</P>
    <P>If we have not got that document why have we not got it?  First, have we got it?  I am saying that the suggestion clearly lies to be made that that document is not in the hands of our Government or at least a document similar to it.  Will it strike the people of this country as peculiar that if the Government of Canada certainly, and the Governments of New Zealand and Australia probably, and the Government of South Africa possibly, have got the same document and we have not got anything something similar to it, that there is something peculiar about the attitude of the British Government with regard to the position of this Government at Ottawa?</P>
    <P>I said that there was an excuse made.  In the first sentence of the reply to my question asked on 25th May I was told that &ldquo;no exchange of views had taken place between the Saorstát and British Governments on the questions which might come up for discussion at Ottawa.&rdquo;  And then this followed: &ldquo;We understand that our position in this respect is not different from that of at least two other States of the Commonwealth.&rdquo; Then there is this sentence: &ldquo;The High Commissioner asked for information or suggested discussion on five distinct occasions between the middle of January and the middle of the present month.  He received certain documents relating to the trade between these two countries on 18th April. Further information was promised.  It must be remembered however that the agenda for the Conference was not circulated by the Canadian Government until yesterday...&rdquo;  When it is stated that our position is not <Col N="168" /> different from that of at least two other States of the Commonwealth, is that a precise statement of fact?  Did either of those two States of the Commonwealth make any representation to the British Government through any of their officials in London that they would like discussions commenced?  If they did and if they have been treated in the peculiar way in which we have been treated then their case is on all fours with ours.  I think, then, it cannot be said that our position in this respect is not different from that of these two other States of the Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>That is the sorry story.  We are going to send, at the taxpayers' expense, a delegation to Ottawa.  We have no discussions previous to the departure of the delegation up to five weeks before it actually departs.  We have a request made by our High Commissioner on some single occasion that there should be discussions commenced and, if anything has been sent by way of a return to that suggested discussion, it is a document sent to him relating to the trade between the two countries and further information will come.  I suggest the further information never came or else we would have been told about it.  Our delegates are supposed to set out for Ottawa, where preferences are to be had in greater number than they are at the present moment or where they are to be maintained at the present height.  Discussions have been advanced or else discussions have been requested and have not been granted.</P>
    <P>Before we go to the expense of sending people across the water looking for preferences that might be denied to us, the people of the country should know what has happened between this Government and the British Government.  There should be an answer given to my question.  It is merely shutting their eyes to facts if they neglect that duty.  We know very well that since 20th April a particular situation has arisen.  We know very well that a particular point of view is taken here with regard to certain measures and a widely different point of view is taken on the other side, and all that might have repercussions on <Col N="169" /> the discussions at Ottawa.  We should be given an answer to this point: Was any request with regard to discussion made since the 20th April and, if so, was it turned down?  If the request was not formulated inside the framework of a suggestion as to discussions we should have an answer to the second part of my question: Was there, since 20th April, any request made to the British Government for information and, if so, was that acceded to or turned down?</P>
    <P>We hear talk also as to the personnel of the delegation going to Ottawa.  We are told that quite recently it has emerged that financial and monetary matters, things about gold and golden ounces, are going to come up for discussion at Ottawa, and we have included a person described as a financial expert for the purpose of these discussions.</P>
    <P>Have we any information as to what matters have been put on the Agenda by the Free State Government, if any? Have we any information as to why this team has been chosen that we hear spoken of?  Why is it the Minister for Finance is supposed to be accompanying the delegation?  Why is it we are told somebody connected with currency in this country is going?  Is this merely striking out in the dark?  Have there been any returns from the British Government to requests made by the High Commissioner on behalf of the Free State Government that there should be discussions commenced preliminary to Ottawa?  Has there been any return by the British Government requesting information on the matters that are likely to go down on the Ottawa Agenda?</P>
    <P>If we have not these, I suggest that it is useless to send a delegation to Ottawa, even with the best of good will operating at the moment between the British Government and our own Government.  Without good and sound preparation there is going to be no good result from that Conference. Supposing we take merely that side of it&mdash;that there is good-will operating. If there had been no discussion or proper intercommunication of opinion, then surely it is madness for us to load <Col N="170" /> up a delegation with the people who are said to be members of it, when we do not know what are the subjects in which our delegation is likely to be interested, and from which they are likely to get good results.  Let us take the alternative&mdash;that there is no good-will as between the two Governments. Would it not have saved the rebuff which is certain to come later from the British Government if the invitation for an informal exchange of views, issued by them last December, were attended to during the intervening months?  Would not that have cleared the air, and would it not have been better to have a precise answer returned to a Free State Government request about discussions in London before the delegation crossed the water rather than have the same answer, whatever it may be, returned at Ottawa when the delegates get there on a fruitless errand?</P>
    <P>I raised this matter originally in the course of a debate and following that there was an official communication to the Press.  On a second occasion I raised the matter by way of question. There was then a golden opportunity of clearing up a mystifying situation. Instead of that I got information which did not add precisely to what the House was given before.  Then when I raised the matter to-day, refining it to the very last point of discussion&mdash;was information suggested or requested since 20th April?&mdash;I got the statement that it was really a matter for a Civil Servant.  It was a cowardly attitude to start with, trying to throw responsibility on to the shoulders of an official.  In addition to that, I was given in reply a few phrases which were not relevant to what I had raised and which did not add to the information of the House.</P>
    <P>At any rate, that question has to be answered.  As long as no precise answer is returned to the questions I put down, undoubtedly the feeling is going to prevail amongst the people that the suggestion as to discussions was not favourably received by the British Government and that the request for information was answered up to the 18th April, but has not been answered since.  A great many people <Col N="171" /> will ponder over why things happened prior to the 18th April and nothing has happened since that date.</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy state that the President has adopted a cowardly attitude?  Is that his statement? I say the Deputy has a lot of <Col N="172" /> check looking for information here considering the amount of information he gave to this House and to the country about the agreements made in regard to land annuities in 1923, and the agreement also made in 1926.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.55 p.m. until Wednesday, 1st June, at 3 p.m.</P>
