      <P>asked the President whether he is aware that the Minister for Education, speaking at Bray on October 25th, as reported in the Press, announced that, if capital is not forthcoming for the expansion of industry, it might be necessary for the State to take further action; whether this announcement has the sanction of the Executive Council, and what is the nature of the action contemplated by the Government in the event referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must know that the sanction of the Executive Council is not necessary for statements of such a purely hypothetical character.  I do not propose to state what course the Government would adopt in an eventuality which may never occur.</P>

      <P>The provisions of paragraph 14 (a) and (b) of the Memorandum referred to have recently been revised in my Department. A copy of the revised Memorandum is being sent to the Deputy and its amended provisions will, I trust, meet the requirements of the persons interested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if he is aware of the present precarious condition of the sea fisheries of the Saorstát seeing that now only 12,055 men and 3,437 boats are engaged in fishing as against 14,619 men and 4,405 boats in 1925 and seeing that the value of the fish landed has declined in value from £413,236 in 1925 to £188,736 in 1931; and whether realising the seriousness of this situation he will take immediate steps to bring in the Bill promised last June to afford more adequate protection against foreign trawlers, and at the same time endeavour by mutual arrangement to have the limit for steam trawlers fixed at six miles (at least) instead of three.</P>

      <P>The Bill in question is under consideration, but at present I cannot indicate the date on which it will be introduced.  There is not, I am afraid, any immediate prospect of obtaining such an arrangement as is suggested in the latter part of the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's answer, I want to ask is he <Col N="939" /> aware that that Bill has been under consideration now for nearly three years and that not once but four times in this House an answer in almost precisely the same terms has been given and yet the trawlers continue to increase and multiply?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the large number of sailors in our coastal towns who find themselves without berths and seeing that these men are deprived of the benefits of unemployment insurance owing to being domiciled in the Free State will he take steps to remedy this condition of things either by (1) making an effort to come to an understanding with Britain on the matter of the unemployment insurance benefits or (2) by providing some suitable alternative form of work for such sailors; and if in connection with this latter he will represent to the Sea Fisheries Association that the trawlers now chartered by them should contain a fixed proportion of Free State nationals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there is a number, not large, of seamen registered as unemployed whose unemployment may be attributed to the cause mentioned in the Deputy's question. They are not entitled to Unemployment benefit because, having been employed on ships registered outside Saorstát Eireann, they are not insured <Col N="944" /> at all against unemployment.  Seamen domiciled in Great Britain and Northern Ireland who were employed on ships registered in Saorstát Eireann are in a similar position.  Unsuccessful efforts have been made from time to time by the Saorstát Government to come to a reciprocal arrangement with Great Britain by which such seamen could come into Unemployment Insurance but I cannot say that there is at present much hope of bringing about such an arrangement.  Efforts are being made and will continue to be made to find alternative employment for those men who are known to be unemployed. I am informed that the Sea Fisheries Association are gradually increasing the numbers of Saorstát nationals employed on the trawlers they have chartered but they require men experienced in the fishing industry for these boats.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The duties shown in the table referred to were considerably modified in scope subsequent to the dates of the original Orders and Resolutions, and other tariff changes have also been introduced affecting the yield from these protective duties.  For these reasons <Col N="945" /> it is not proposed to circulate a revise of the table.</P>
    <P>(2)  The approximate receipts of Revenue from the new protective duties (as distinct from the yield from articles already dutiable) in the period from 1st April, 1932, to 22nd October, 1932, amounted to £111,400.</P>

I am informed by the Minister for Agriculture that the number of licences of this sort issued up to the 15th ultimo by him was 233, and the quantity of cheese covered by these licences was 5,621 cwts.  The value of the cheese is not known to the Department of Agriculture.  The rule has been to grant licences only to persons or firms who have been regular cheese importers in the past, and for quantities not greater than their imports during the corresponding period last <Col N="948" /> year.  According as Saorstát-made supplies come to the market the quantities for which licences to import will be issued will be reduced.</P>

      <P>Since the 1st April last the prerogative of mercy has been exercised in 97 cases, in 43 of which it was exercised with particular reference to the holding of the Eucharistic Congress in Dublin, in consequence of representations made to me to the effect that the occasion was an appropriate one for the granting of remission of sentences of imprisonment.  The compilation of a return to show the particulars asked for in sub-heads (a), (b) and (c) of the second part of the question would involve a considerable expenditure of official time, and would, so far as I am aware, constitute a precedent which I am not prepared to create.

Surely, in any Department of State, it ought to be very easy to find out, by reference to the Department's records, what was the offence and what was the sentence?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated in my reply, there are 97 cases.  To state the offence, the sentence and the remission, would necessarily mean a very long answer and would take a very long time to deliver, but as I have stated in the answer, apart from the expenditure of public time that would be involved, I cannot find any precedent for the divulging of such information, nor can I myself see what purpose it would serve.  In some of the 97 cases the remission has been as little as one day, while in others only two or three days were taken off a sentence so that a prisoner might return home on a Saturday instead of on a Monday.  On this matter of the exercise of the prerogative of mercy or the kindred subject, the statutory remission of penalties, if there is any real interest shown in this House on the matter, I am prepared to prepare and circulate a paper dealing with the history and nature of this prerogative, with the statutory amendments and with the principles that, in my opinion, ought to govern the exercise of that prerogative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Two or three years ago, an Act was passed by the Oireachtas which contemplated that the University College, Galway, should gradually become a college in which all the staff would be competent to give instruction in Irish and in which the greater part of the instruction would gradually be given in Irish.  I would just like to express the hope that the Minister and the Cabinet generally will bear in mind the importance of doing all that can be done to speed up that particular work.  Provision was made in that Act for an increase in the University College grant of £2,000 annually by means of Orders for the purpose of providing additional facilities for <Col N="954" /> giving instruction through Irish.  I think that Orders have been made increasing the grant up to the present by a sum of £1,500.  There is still a small amount that can be used to assist the College in this way, therefore. There is power under the Universities Act for the Minister to give additional grants, although some years ago when University Finance was overhauled, these various extra statutory grants were consolidated in a fixed sum.  I think that in general the position should be that as far as possible the colleges should have a fixed sum and the question of these extra grants kept low.  In the case of Galway where a change is to be effected, I think that the Minister should not hesitate, where he thinks it desirable, to give an increased sum in order that this transformation in the college should take place.</P>
      <P>Personally, as I said recently in the House, I regard the Gaelicisation of Galway city as the thing that is going to decide whether or not the language can be preserved.  I feel that if we cannot Gaelicise one town&mdash;and there is no town certainly so suitable as Galway&mdash;there is little hope of preserving the language.  Galway is a small town, and the university, if it were Gaelicised, could exercise a great deal more influence in that town than even a bigger college with a more numerous student body could exercise over a bigger town.  I feel little doubt that in a city like Galway, with 46 per cent. of its people already knowing Irish, if its college were Gaelicised the schools in the whole district would be very greatly influenced indeed.  The students living in the town, and going about the town, would have a great deal of influence on the opinion of the people and their attitude towards the language.  I believe that in fact if the college could be Gaelicised it would result in the Gaelicisation of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I believe that that cannot be done in any sort of a reasonable time without monetary assistance from the Government.  I am not advocating that money should be too readily granted, or that money should, as it were, be thrown away in the matter, but I do feel that the Government <Col N="955" /> should make it clear to the college authorities that any reasonable and genuine steps taken for the Gaelicisation of the college will be helped by the Government with the financial assistance necessary.  I think that the Government should make it clear that if there are very good people, who are masters of Irish and good in their own subjects, available for appointment to the staff of the college, it would be made by the Government financially possible for the college to create posts in which these people could be employed, that is posts that are reasonably necessary or useful in the college. In that the Government should also make it possible in case a very good man appears who can lecture through Irish and who is very good in his subject to make special arrangements for, say, the retirement on extra pension of those who are already there, so that the teaching work of the college may as soon as possible be put into Irish.  The Government should also make it possible, in case a college decides to do its work through Irish, that there will be additional scholarships and other facilities available, so as to prevent an undue number of good students being thrown away.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to say that, if the college will prove that it needs it, and if the college will do the work that we all desire it should do, the Government would not hesitate to increase the annual grant to the college by, say, another £10,000.  That may seem a relatively big sum.  It is not very large, compared with the total amount that we are spending on universities, and if it were to result in the Gaelicisation of the college it would be a trivial sum, having regard to the results that might be achieved by it.  I should like, therefore, as I said, to press on the Minister that he should intimate that he is not confining any additional help that may be given to the remaining £500 that is provided in the statute, but that he is prepared to assist the college to go further, if the college is prepared to go further, along similar lines, and to do it as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy may take it that so far as this Government is concerned it is not in any way inferior to the last Government in its desire to revive the language, and it is not any less prepared to provide the financial resources which may be necessary to achieve that purpose.  The position at the present moment is that though the Act of 1929 specifically empowered the Minister to provide additional grants up to £2,000 per annum, up to the present moment we have received an application from Galway College for a grant of only £1,500, so that, even so far as that comparatively small grant is concerned, so far Galway has not been in a position to put forward a scheme to utilise the whole of the amount.</P>
      <P>If any well considered proposal is put forward by the college, and if it is one which is likely to yield good, practical results, I do not think that the Government would have any hesitation in providing a reasonable sum, taking into consideration the requirements of all the other public services, and not merely that, but the requirements of the other parts of the country in regard to Gaelic education.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one matter of rather cardinal importance that I should like to mention on this Estimate.  Last week I asked the Minister, in regard to certain road tenders, whether he had instructed any local authority to accept a tender that was not the lowest tender, and he replied to the effect that in one particular case in the City of Dublin he had instructed the city authorities to accept a tender for a piece of roadwork&mdash;£15,495 as against a tender for £12,833, that is an increase of about £2,660, and he stated:</P>
      <P>Do shocruíos, i gcás connartha i gCathair Bhaile Atha Cliath chun bóthar asphalt do chur síos, gur cheart glacadh leis an dara tairisgint ba shaoire.  B'é fáth go ndearna amhlaidh ná go bhfuaireas comhairle eolgaisigh gur dheallruigh an tairisgint ba shaoire gur mó a theas-tuigh o lucht a déanta tithe gnótha eile do dhúnadh amach ná mar a theastuigh uatha gnáth-shochar do dhéanamh as an obair.</P>
      <P>That is, he said, that the reason for refusing the lowest tender was that he was advised on rather good authority that the lowest tender appeared to show that the person making the tender wished more to crowd out other persons tendering than to do the work at a reasonable cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="958" /> I appreciate that the Minister is perhaps trying to do the best that he can, but I do submit that the matter has been dealt with without any thorough examination at all, and so much dis-turbance of mind has been caused, both to the local authority and to the persons who are looking at the way in which the Government is doing its business, that I think some kind of statement from the Minister is desirable in order to ease people's minds.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to this matter is that a pretty large contract for asphalting concrete, that is, ordinary steam-rolled asphalt, for about 72,000 yards, was being given.  The cost of this concrete has been reduced very, very considerably in recent years.  Six or seven years ago it was 15/- a square yard.  In Dublin in 1928 it was 7/-; in 1931 it had gone down to 5/-, and this year the lowest tender was for 3/5 a square yard.  Now the tender that was accepted was for 4/1 per square yard, and again I say that the Minister's explanation was that he considered that the company that quoted 3/5 per square yard was not tendering in a reasonable way to make a reasonable profit but was attempting to crowd out other companies. Now I suggest that the matter has not been fully examined.  I have pointed out very great reductions in costs in the last few years on this particular class of work.  I would also point out, and I have instances in which similar work during the current year or during the last twelve months carried out in Britain was carried out at a cost in three instances to my knowledge at 2/11 per square yard; in three instances at 3/11 per square yard, and in two instances at 3/3 per square yard, showing that the tender of 3/5 can certainly not be regarded, from a critical examination, as being a more or less price-cutting tender.  The acceptance of the higher tender in the city of Dublin has meant this.  Taking the smaller tender of £12,833, normally about 70 per cent. of the total cost goes to labour, that is including the quarrying of stones as well as the laying of the road and making the necessary preparations, so that out of <Col N="959" /> £12,833, which the lowest estimate was for, £9,000 would have gone roughly for labour.  Now it is quite conceivable that any good company, such as the company that actually got the contract is, would be very much more out than £9,000 in respect of the labour side of the carrying out of that work, although whereas in one case there would be £3,800 odd left to pay for materials, to pay for overhead charges generally, and to give suitable return to capital on the basis of the costs for labour for £9,000, which I think the Minister would find on examination to be a reasonable figure, even to the firm that is actually carrying out the work, it leaves them £6,495 to cover materials, to cover overhead costs, and to cover return to capital.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister in this case what labour will get out of this contract is exactly what it would get out of the £12,000 contract and what really has happened is £2,600 of public money has gone to the new company partly as a return to capital.  I do not know what the capital involved in the present company that has got the contract is, but I really would suggest that it amounts to a presentation to the company of public money to the extent of nearly half the capital of that company on this one work. It has, I submit, left the city of Dublin in the position that it could have got one-fifth more work done and labour could have got an additional £2,000 into its pockets as wages if the lower tender were accepted, and I submit to the Minister the case requires very, very critical examination, and the House, local authorities and the public generally would welcome a statement on the matter that it was going to be thoroughly examined.  I would almost suggest that the new price controller, as a kind of a trial run as to what he is worth, might be brought in and given the job of examining what exactly the position is with regard to these three contracts.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, in years past I have been a very severe critic of many things and one of the contentions I upheld for many <Col N="960" /> years was that there should be a Minister of Public Health.  I had to give way on that, and subsequently I was willing to accept a Parliamentary Secretary of Public Health.  I could not get anything done until the present Government came into office, and I am glad to say that the present Government fulfilled one of my hopes in appointing a Parliamentary Secretary of Public Health, who himself was a doctor, and I wish to congratulate the Government in doing that.</P>
      <P>There are two or three points I wish to make.  We have been promised for a long time a Bill dealing with clean milk.  Now it is a very necessary thing that that Bill should be got through this House.  I need not go into the matter now.  I need not explain further but I will say this, I have figures, not in my pocket, but figures in my possession which will show the necessity for very drastic changes to be made in the production of milk.  I will say no more about that.</P>
      <P>The other point I would like to make is this, we want something done with regard to the regulations of traffic. Buses are still allowed to start wherever they like and run down anybody they please and nothing is being done at the present time to make the road safe.  I, myself, was nearly killed the day before yesterday by a man who ran straight into me, straight on the road where I was crossing, and there is nothing being done to prevent the murderous conditions prevailing on the road from public traffic.  I appeal to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to move in these two matters, i.e., the matter of traffic and in the matter of a Clean Milk Bill.</P>

      <P>Last week on the vote for education I raised a matter and I was informed it was connected with the Department of Local Government.  It is in connection with two ex-teachers of Cork Union.  Those two teachers under the Amalgamation of Unions lost their positions&mdash;you could not exactly call it losing their positions&mdash;but they were immediately transferred as two principal teachers of two national schools and in that capacity they are still serving.  It is some ten years ago <Col N="961" /> since the change was made.  Now those two teachers come along and claim pensions from the Cork County Council.  Pensions have been granted under sealed order of the Ministry, but the point I wish to make in connection with the matter here is, in one case one of these teachers is getting over £80 a year pension whilst at the same time continuing in his capacity as principal teacher of a national school, and drawing his salary for that.  The other is getting something like £70 a year pension and is continuing his job as principal teacher in a national school.  I think that it is simply scandalous that individuals should be drawing pensions and salaries at the same time.  I would not mind if it was a matter of a man losing his position.  I could then understand giving him a pension, but I cannot understand men who were merely transferred under what I might say the same Department&mdash;from one school to another in Cork&mdash;as a matter of fact it was promotion.  In the second place, we in the Cork County Council, do not like pleading the Statute of Limitations but I would say in these cases certainly, the Statute of Limitations could be pleaded.  It is ten years since they made the change over and during those whole ten years we have got no application from them until now for pensions.</P>
      <P>I argue further that it is unfair at this stage that the present ratepayers of Cork should be asked to pay back money to the amount of £800 odd in one case and £700 odd in the other as pensions to those men, seeing that the ratepayers of the present were not the ratepayers of eight or ten years ago, when these men, if they felt they were entitled to the pensions, could have made a claim.  I consider it is a matter on which there should be some explanation from the Minister.  If these men are entitled to pensions, large pensions such as they are supposed to be entitled to, I hold that they should not have other positions at the same time in the public service.  I consider it unfair to the ratepayers that men who are drawing large salaries should also be in receipt of pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of very severe local irritation and I regard <Col N="962" /> it in the nature of an accidental happening.  The very spirit of the amalgamation scheme was simply to see that when a man lost anything through such a scheme he was compensated for that loss.  The gentlemen referred to from the opposite benches have got their compensation by being absorbed in the very same activities as they pursued under the board of assistance in Cork.  They were school teachers under the National Board and were paid for for the time being by the local authorities.  They were transferred into other schools, being paid by the National Board, and the local authority holds that it would be only equitable, on pensions becoming due to these people, if they were not made liable for the amount of time spent in their schools.  When they were transferred out of the service into better positions than they had and at higher salaries, the very spirit of the amalgamation scheme was outraged to the extent that those men, instead of sustaining any loss in respect of any pension to which they were entitled, got increased salaries and better positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To prove that those men shared the same point of view themselves I may say that for five years they never even thought of looking for compensation for loss of office, because there was in effect no loss of office.  They were transferred to other positions at higher salaries.  After five years some application was made to the local authority. The local authority did not treat it very seriously, and then it came to the Minister.  The Ministry, I am quite satisfied recognised that there was a technical point that the amalgamation scheme provided for loss of office under a local authority.  It is here I claim the accidental happening came in. Provision was not made in the amalgamation scheme to eliminate the danger that men in positions such as these could avail themselves of better positions and receive, at the same time, superannuation from their former positions.  That is where I claim the power of the Minister for Local Government comes in.  Has he not power in himself to rectify a gross injustice, because it is undoubtedly an injustice to the local authorities to <Col N="963" /> compel them to pay in one case a pension of £92 to a man who has taken office under the National Board of Education subsequent to his being employed in Cork under the local authorities, entitling him to a payment at the expense of the local ratepayers of a sum of approximately £1,340?</P>
    <P>I do not think it is any answer to an outrage of this kind to say that the law does not make provision for selection between the local authority and the National Board.  The money is paid out either from the national exchequer or from the local authority, either from the taxpayers' or the ratepayers' pockets.  I do not think anyone or any side of the House will deny that it is a gross injustice to the ratepayers to be called upon to pay compensation for loss of office, when in effect there is no loss of office, and to pay that compensation at the ratepayers' expense.  I leave it to the Minister if I have not made my case perfectly clear.  I shall go further, and I leave it to the sense of justice of the Minister to say if it is not a misinterpretation of the terms of the amalgamation scheme to award compensation for loss of office to these men, and if it is not an outrage on the spirit of the scheme that men transferred to better positions should be compensated by pension for loss of office.  I should like to know what these men's pensions will be when they come to be fixed by the National Board.  Will these men be entitled to a pension under the National Board and a pension from the local authority, entitled to two pensions from the same set of activities?</P>

      <P>The matter raised by Deputy Mulcahy with reference to the giving of certain contracts to a certain firm by the Dublin municipality is, undoubtedly, an important one.  It is one that received long and serious consideration by officials of the Department first and then by myself.  It was only when the matter had been very fully examined that it was decided to recommend the municipality to give the contract to the firm which had not the lowest tender.  I quite agree that there are dangers in such a course and <Col N="964" /> that the system is not one that should be adopted without the deepest consideration. I know that the question is likely to arise again.  I had intimated to me in the last few days that some question of the same nature was likely to come to the Department from Cork City so that the matter will have to be gone into again.  In respect of this last particular contract, it was only when I was advised on the best authority I could get and the best information available to me, Departmentally and otherwise, that the lowest tender represented a firm that had been for a number of years endeavouring, by sending in tenders that were not valid tenders, to crush out Irish companies&mdash;companies owned by Irishmen and run with Irish capital&mdash;it was only when that information was conveyed to me and when I was assured that that was correct that I consented to recommend the municipality to accept another tender.</P>

      <P>So I am informed.  I was satisfied on the information given to me that that was so.  I was also satisfied that there had been a considerable amount of competition amongst purely Irish contractors, and that the competition amongst purely Irish contractors was such that it kept down the prices in Ireland and had kept them at a lower level in the Free State than in England for the same class of work.  However, I agree with the Deputy that it is a matter that requires constant care and supervision and whenever the same subject arises again, as I believe it will arise, all I can say is that no tender that is not the lowest tender will be accepted without very strict examination.</P>

    <P>I am glad that Deputy Sir James Craig raised the question of clean milk.  I know that the matter was being considered by the late Government and that considerable progress had been made in the matter of the preparation of a Bill.  Since we took over and since Deputy Dr. Ward came into the Department he has given a considerable amount of time to the <Col N="965" /> subject of clean milk.  In the last couple of weeks we received a deputation from the Clean Milk Society of Dublin.

      <P>I cannot at all say when that will be but the matter is receiving attention and as soon as we possibly can, we shall put proposals for legislation before the House.  The other point was one raised by Deputies Corry and William Broderick, about two teachers in Cork who had been employed by the local authority of the county and who, because of the amalgamation scheme had been given other places when dispossessed of their then posts, and, also, had to be superannuated. When the matter came before me, shortly after we took up office, I was struck with the fact that these pensions had not been applied for.  I raised that point with the officials, and understood that there was some doubt, at the time, as to whether they were entitled to the pension.  The matter was properly and adequately inquired into and it was found that they were entitled to superannuation allowance, and, under the law as it stood, we had to sanction them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the old position in Cork Union they were employees of the local authority, now they are employees partly of the State and partly of the manager.  They are employees of the manager subject to the State.  The salaries are paid by the State, but the school manager nominates them and they were given their posts by the manager.  Neither the late Government, nor the present, had anything to do with them.  The manager selected these teachers and gave them their posts, and I presume that when their time is up, and they relinquish their office, they will look for superannuation and they will have to get it, but they will not get it for the same period of office.  They are now pensioned for the time which they worked under the old local authority.  Later when they get their pensions, if they <Col N="966" /> live long enough, they will get them out of the Teachers' Pension Fund. Of course, it is all coming out of the one pocket, but legally they are entitled to both, and unless the law is changed in the meantime, there will be no way of depriving one or other of them of what would be their legal right.  I was rather agreeably surprised to hear two Cork Deputies objecting to money going into Cork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>They are paid by the ratepayers of Cork.  Would the Minister consider putting a stay on these pensions until such time as these men retired.  I can understand the Cork people being compelled to pay pensions for the periods of office that these men served, and to have them taken into consideration when they were about to retire.  In these circumstances the ratepayers of Cork would not object to pay these men their pensions, but they have a decided objection to paying men pensions for jobs which they still hold.  They are teachers to-day as well as they were teachers under the old regime.  It does not matter what particular set of children they are teaching.  One of these men is earning £370 a year in salary.  I think it is a disgrace that that salary should be paid by unfortunate men, some of them hungry and unable to pay their rates.  I think it is a disgrace to be compelled to pay out of their pockets the salary of £370 to a man with a pension.  I ask the Minister if necessary to introduce amending legislation to deal with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJosephBroderi" hpid="Mr. W. Broderick Mr. W. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite recognise the point dealt with by the Minister and referred to as an accidental happening, but my point was that he should not allow, or permit an accidental happening of this kind. We were very particular, under the amalgamation schemes that no one should suffer for loss of office.  There was no loss of office here, yet the Minister allows the ratepayers to be penalised in an annual sum of £140 and £1,300 arrears.  I understand that the interpretation the Minister has put upon this matter is not that understood by the local authorities.  If I understood the <Col N="967" /> matter rightly these pensions would not be due until these men went out of office.  The interpretation of the local authority is that the pensions would accrue from the moment they are entitled to superannuation, that is, since they went out of office.  We contend it is not legal that the ratepayers should be saddled with a sum of £1,340 and a continual liability of £140.  With regard to Cork men objecting to money being paid in Cork this money is collected in Cork, also.  But I do not want to deal with a small point.  This accidental happening is a gross injustice to the local ratepayers and a grave abuse of the principle of men being compensated for loss. For here there has been no loss.  There were many cases in the last ten years where claims were made upon the authorities in Cork and the local authorities recognised their moral right.  They never pleaded the Statute of Limitation nor the Gaming Act either.  As they have done their duty so heroically I would ask the Minister to use any power at his disposal to have this matter put right.</P>

I think the Minister has exceeded his office in taking up the position he has taken in this matter. He should not have done so.  As I read this case promotion was actually given to these teachers.  Did the amalgamation pre-date the time that the offices of the local authorities were transferred to the Education Board? If it did not, it is possible that there is no claim whatsoever.  As a matter of fact I believed they were transferred on promotion.  What justification was there for the Minister sending down a sealed order in this case?  These gentlemen had the courts to enforce their claims if they have any.  The <Col N="968" /> Minister made himself court, judge and jury in this matter, and I believe exceeded his authority.</P>

The Minister, however, says that there is nothing to say on the matter and I <Col N="971" /> therefore find it difficult to make a speech on it.  There will be within the next few days opportunities to criticise various portions of agricultural policy.  Possibly, the Minister himself is not responsible for many of the disadvantages which agriculturists suffer under at present, and the Ceann Comhairle would probably rule me out of order if I referred to them&mdash;tariffs and other things for which the Minister is not directly responsible.  The agricultural condition generally, however, is in a very deplorable way.  One would have expected that the Minister would have made some references to conditions generally, but, the Minister having refrained from doing so, I do not intend to contribute anything more to the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">

      <P>Before the Recess there was an arrangement that I should move to refer this Vote back for reconsideration with a view to dealing with a very minor matter as compared with matters which have arisen since but a matter which is of some importance; that is the question of carrying out minor drainage works in the country.  My idea was to ask the Minister to appoint an additional member to the staffs of the County Committees of Agriculture on the same basis as any of the other Instructors, with the same status and salary, as say, a horticultural or agricultural or any of the other Instructors.  If that were done, this official would be able to supply expert advice to people who may need it on the question of drainage.  That advice could be supplied in that way at the least possible cost, and the person appointed could make out a plan for every man in the county who would need it.  A lot of this small drainage work could be done and would be done if occupiers had expert advice, and with the addition of an official like that to the staff of the County Committees of Agriculture it could be carried out at the least possible expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that is needed is advice and example. I proved that for myself last year and this year.  I had to undertake a drainage job of my own and, <Col N="972" /> in order to begin at the proper point, I had to go into another man's farm and do about half a mile of a job until I got the proper depth.  I had grave doubts with regard to levels and that sort of thing, not having the implements to take levels, and I did not know what levels I would ultimately get at a certain point.  I used the best judgment I had, and I had some judgment in these matters, and I got just what I wanted and a little more.  I know that numbers of men, who would not have as much experience as I had, and, especially, young men, suffer because of the lack of expert advice. For instance, they would not know offhand what depth they would gain after travelling a certain distance by maintaining a proper level.  There is no use in doing big schemes unless you have facilities to do the minor schemes. The effect that this has on the country is beyond any calculation I could make. The Minister and everybody knows that the bog and wet land of the country is not carrying anything like its fair proportion of cattle compared with what it carried thirty to fifty years ago.  It also undermines the health of the cattle.  You have more fluke now than ever you had.  There is more tuberculosis in the country than there ever was, and, when one talks about fluke and tuberculosis and the other diseases that can be traced back to lack of drainage, the importance of the problem is apparent.  Particularly with cattle which give milk, the influence of cattle on their own kinds and on human beings is immense. You cannot have healthy families, healthy people or children unless they have healthy milk and anything that could be done at the lowest cost to the community should be done by the Ministry of Agriculture in this matter.</P>
    <P>The suggestion I make will cost the County Committees scarcely anything &mdash;£300 or £400&mdash;and the only expense will be to the farmers who can do it in their own time.  They can spend a fortnight at it and three weeks at it later on, and the only expense will be the expense of sweat, and it will do them no harm, besides giving them an opportunity of exercising their intelligence. There is no doubt at all about <Col N="973" /> it that if example is shown by one or two persons in a district and expert advice given, the matter will be followed up and will be done at the lowest possible expense.  I can go into the details with the Minister if he would entertain the suggestion and talk over the matter with him if he is agreeable.  Having said that, we will leave it there.</P>
    <P>With regard to other matters, Fianna Fáil, when they went to the country this year, had as one of their foremost planks the increasing of foreign markets.  &ldquo;While extending the home market, Fianna Fáil is determined to hold the grip we have on the foreign market&rdquo;&mdash;what has the Minister done or what has his Department done to hold the grip on the foreign market?  What advice has the Minister given to the Executive Council with regard to holding the grip on the foreign market?  Was it on his advice that all our stock ceased to go out of the country before mid-July to the foreign market?  Was it on his instructions that certain statements were made, before he and his colleagues went to Ottawa, to induce people to keep their cattle off the market?  Was it on his advice that the President made a statement at Limerick and Ennis urging farmers not to put their cattle on the foreign market?  Was it on his advice that the Vice-President made a statement in Ottawa that it was only a question of a short time before there was a settlement of the question and again induced people to keep their cattle off the foreign market? Was it on his advice that a present was made of the foreign market to the Argentine?  The Minister knows or should have known, having advised the Executive Council, that there are two competitors for the English trade on that foreign market&mdash;the only foreign market he has.  Did the Minister tell them that on one side was the Argentine, with £500,000,000 of English money invested in it, and that there was always a fight between them and the other competitors in the English market?  I put the Argentine on one side and, on the other side, I put the English, Scotch and Irish feeders&mdash;if you like, you can add the Canadian, <Col N="974" /> which does not affect it very much.  I put the Englishman first, the Scotsman second and the Irishman third.  I put the Irishman in the weakest trenches, the trenches most easily attacked by the Argentine and the first trenches to fall if there is going to be any fall.  The Minister and the Executive Council made a present of the English market to the Argentine&mdash; they made a present of the first line trench, and the position is now that the Argentine jumped in and gobbled the market you were supplying.  Your market has gone now and your stuff is on the English market in competition for that portion of it that the Scots and English had.  That is the position to-day.  You are going to keep your grip on the foreign market&mdash; that is how you got elected.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about different classes of agricultural economics.  Did he think, when he decided to make a step in another direction, that it was necessary to write down the capital of the country by fifty per cent? That is what has been done.  He has twenty per cent. of an embargo, ten or twelve per cent. loss of goodwill and he has made a present of the other market to the Argentine.  It is nearer to fifty per cent. than forty per cent. in actual fact.  The late Minister for Agriculture used to be described as the Minister for Grass, and now we have the Minister for Scutch grass and you might say the Minister for Scutch grass and bran.  The Minister is going to save the country now by growing bran.  What is he going to feed the bran to?</P>

      <P>They are the only things that would pay and the only things worth their salt and worth their grub. Will the Minister say that bran would be an economic proposition to feed to pigs at present prices; to feed to milch cows at present prices; to feed to beef at present prices, or to feed for the production of eggs at present prices? Does the Minister think that bran, or some of the ingredients he has in maize, will induce any man to keep a pig in the country?  Does he think that with 25/- or 22/6d. a cwt. for <Col N="975" /> bacon, anybody is going to buy feeding stuffs or that he is going to have a pig at all in the country in six months' time?  Does he think that 18/- to 22/6d. a cwt. for beef is going to find a market for his bran?  We heard a question to-day, or yesterday about the foreign market outside the present market, and I believe that the Minister has sent a special ambassador to the Continent to develop the foreign market and the only result of it was a certain amount of stuff which he sent into Belgium.  He would not tell us the loss yesterday.  The facts are that there are three great men in Ireland to-day&mdash;De Valera, Johnny Lord and Mosey Lee.</P>

      <P>The only thing is that I have never engaged in the foreign markets.  The Minister and the President have deliberately entered into competition to put Johnny Lord and Mosey Lee out of business, and the only market they can get is the trade those men had in Ireland of sending old horses to Belgium to make sausages.  They brought down the best agricultural produce so as to enable them to compete with the trade of Johnny Lord and Mosey Lee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know what did the Minister do in this crisis.  He is the man in charge of the Department and I would like to know what advice did he give to the members of the Executive Council.  What advice did he give his fellow-delegates in Ottawa, to the Vice-President, for instance, who was responsible for holding the cattle in this country for three weeks? I was one of the fools and it was because of his advice that this country lost nearly one million pounds.  That is a serious point to remember&mdash;that it cost this country nearly one million pounds because the people took the Vice-President's advice.  The people acted on the indication he gave in the course of an interview in Ottawa.  You are a most unreliable lot, the whole of you.  As Deputy Bennett mentioned, we will have another opportunity of dealing with this matter later on.  I thought it a pity to let the Agricultural Vote pass without a little <Col N="976" /> reference to the subjects I have dealt with.  Having made that little reference, I will leave the matter so for the present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only three matters to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention at this stage.  One is the position of the agricultural instructors throughout the country. There is a popular impression amongst the people, partially due to oldfashioned prejudice and partially well-founded, that there is no use in asking the agricultural instructors anything. In my opinion, that is a very regrettable state of affairs, because if the people made more use of the knowledge that the agricultural instructors are prepared to impart to them, it would be greatly to the advantage of the people.  If you want to bring the instructors into closer touch with the people, you have to get over those two existing obstacles, prejudice and a reluctance on the part of the people to trust them.  So far as prejudice is concerned, I suggest to the Minister that the best way to overcome an unreasonable prejudice is to give an ocular demonstration to the people that the methods advocated by the instructors are the best methods and that if they are followed out they will result in a substantially improved return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In pursuit of that idea I suggest that the Minister should at least experiment in certain areas with small demonstration farms.  If it is true, as I believe it is, that the Department's methods are an improvement on old-fashioned methods in the country, there is no reason why an instructor should not earn his salary on a demonstration farm.  I am not talking about an experimental farm, which is quite a different proposition altogether.  I am speaking of a demonstration farm where the instructor could demonstrate the results of conclusions that have been arrived at by experiments in Glasnevin and on other experimental farms.  I believe that if an agricultural instructor had a small farm of that character in any area, he could pay his own salary and that farm would be a standing exhibit for all the small farmers of the district; it would be an <Col N="977" /> indication to them of what better farming methods could do in their area.</P>
    <P>It would serve another purpose.  It would bring home to the authorities in the Department of Agriculture that there is no use in training an agricultural instructor in Glasnevin under the conditions that obtain in Glasnevin and then sending him down to West Donegal to teach the farmers there how to grow crops on rocks, because the fact is that the farmers in West Donegal know a great deal more about the management of that class of poor land than a great many thoroughly well-intentioned young instructors. Unless the Department will awaken to the fact that there are areas, particularly in the West and North-West of Ireland, where very specialised knowledge is necessary in order to make an instructor an efficient man, the instructors will be able to do very little good work in those areas.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister should look into the question of giving the instructors whom he proposes to send into the areas of West Donegal, West Mayo and West Galway special instruction in the types of agriculture that are appropriate to the kind of land the people have there.  I suggest also that there should be demonstration farms set up in a few selected areas so that the instructor will have an opportunity of putting into operation the schemes he recommends to the people.  Let the instructor, on his demonstration farm, prove to the people that with proper methods of production the most remunerative return can be got from the land, and I think it will then be found that there will be a very great change in the attitude of the people towards the instructors.  If that suggestion is carried out there will be, I believe, a very great all-round improvement amongst the small farmers who, at present, are not getting all they might get through consultation with the local agricultural instructor.</P>
    <P>I believe that the agricultural instructors are anxious to help and they are only too glad when they are approached by small farmers.  At the moment I think they find that if they volunteer advice to farmers they get <Col N="978" /> a short answer, and in those circumstances their usefulness is very much restricted.  My experience of agricultural instructors has been that whenever I required their assistance on any problem they have been extremely helpful and have displayed every anxiety to do all they could.  I think if the Minister inquires into the position he will find that the instructors find themselves harassed by the reluctance of the ordinary small farmer to trust them.  While a great deal of that is due to prejudice, a good deal of it is due to the fact that some instructors are trained under circumstances entirely different from those prevailing in the areas to which they are sent to instruct.</P>
    <P>The next matter I would like to touch upon has reference to the ravages that take place throughout the country by reason of the effect of fluke in sheep and cattle.  In my opinion much greater damage is caused by contagious abortion.  So far as fluke is concerned, most of us who have an interest in the matter know that adequate drainage will greatly mitigate the evil, and the prudent use of specified drugs will tend to cure the affected animals. That knowledge requires to be more widely spread.  There are enormous numbers of calves lost every year, and a very considerable number of sheep also because of the prevalence of fluke. I think what is required is some form of propaganda informing the people how to avoid the disease.</P>
    <P>The question of contagious abortion is entirely different, and it is becoming a very great menace to the cattle trade of this country.  There are hundreds of small farmers, particularly in the congested areas, which I know best, who have contagious abortion on their farms and they do not know it.  What is worse, there is a popular belief amongst the country people that if you find contagious abortion in one beast the best thing you can do is to turn the animal out on grass.  They believe that the bacillus of contagious abortion, like all the others, is very rapidly weakened by exposure to the air.  In that belief, as the Minister knows quite well, the people are entirely mistaken. The result of turning cattle suffering <Col N="979" /> from that disease on to the grass land is exceedingly injurious.  Not only is the particular stable in which the beast is housed at night in the winter months affected with the disease, but the whole of the land on which the animal is grazing is also affected.  In those circumstances there is a very great danger of the spread of the disease over a far wider area.  In order to prevent anything of that nature, very intensive propaganda is required so that the people may be properly warned of the dangers of contagious abortion.</P>
    <P>There is also very much required in this country a more intensive veterinary research than is at present going on.  I fully appreciate the difficulties of veterinary research and I know that on the Continent, in England, and even in Ireland, work is at present being done on this question.  I think the Minister should consult his expert to ascertain if any financial assistance the Oireachtas could give would bring us nearer the day when there would be a discovery of some effective cure for the disease.  As far as I have been able to find out there is at present no cure for contagious abortion.  It is very difficult to get a definite and unequivocal diagnosis from a veterinary surgeon.  If a man has a valuable pedigree beast, and if a veterinary surgeon comes and states that he thinks, but is not sure, that the animal has contagious abortion&mdash;yet the cow is not having any calves&mdash;he is placed in a very difficult position.  He does not want to take the animal to the fair while there is a suspicion of contagious abortion; he does not care to turn it on to the land and, at the same time, he does not want to have it slaughtered or destroyed, so long as there is a reasonable hope that it is suffering from some other disease from which it may recover.  As the Minister is aware there are a number of other troubles in animals closely resembling contagious abortion.  To my mind the loss to small farmers owing to the prevalence of that disease is alarming.  If the Minister could state what the annual loss is as a result of cows failing to have calves in due time owing to <Col N="980" /> contagious abortion I think it would surprise the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The only other matter I want to refer to is the question concerning premiums for bulls.  I have not been able to discover if there is any system in the Department dealing with the giving of premiums.  The result at present is that where there is a pretty good foundation stock of shorthorn heifers, if an enterprising person applies to the Department for a premium, he gets one for an Aberdeen Angus bull and in about three generations there is not a single pure-bred beast in the district.  You can argue with the country man and try to persuade him that any good-looking cow will produce a good first cross between two different breeds, but you will never persuade him that that cross-bred calf has in her qualities which prevent her from being a really good breeder herself.  I suggest that the Department should consider the question of surveying the country, should ascertain what type of cattle are in each area, and provide where there are good foundation stocks of Shorthorn cattle a generous premium for Shorthorn bulls and, similarly, where there are good foundation stocks of Aberdeen Angus cattle, a more generous premium for an Aberdeen Angus bull.</P>
    <P>I believe that Deputy Hogan, when he was Minister for Agriculture, introduced a scheme on these lines in County Kerry.  It was a great success and, although the Minister was probably roundly abused at the time, it was the means of saving for the people of Kerry a very valuable asset, even though it was done under compulsion. In Kerry they could not have anything except a Kerry bull.  I appreciate that it would not be possible to act so drastically in all areas.  I think the Minister should be persuaded to give larger premiums for bulls to encourage the breeding of pure-bred cattle throughout the country.  If he does he will do a service which may not be appreciated now but will be of great value and be appreciated in fifteen years time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will probably be disappointed that the Minister of <Col N="981" /> this Department, in asking for the Vote, did not support his application with some preliminary remarks, explaining the operations of the Department and dealing with the activity of the previous Government with agriculture. Deputies who discuss the position of agricultural instructors must pay a tribute to these men and to the work they do, as far as is in their power to impart information to those requiring it, on any subject so varied as the agricultural policy as it exists in this country is.  The last Deputy who spoke stated that we should have demonstration farms worked by the county instructors.  There are in this country farmers second to none, men who are carrying out scientific farm work on the most up-to-date lines, who are working in active co-operation with the county instructors.  We have them in Co. Cork.  Deputies from that county will bear me out when I say that there are farmers in that county whose methods are second to none. Some of them are small farmers, but they work hard and they are carrying on on the most modern scientific principles.  I think these are the best demonstration farms the country could have.  We have also demonstration plots of various crops, such as potatoes, and in County Cork prominent agriculturists and the public are invited to visit these places.  I cannot see how the taking of farms for demonstration purposes could in any way help agriculturists to assimilate any more information than they get from the itinerant instructors.  These men will visit any farm and will give all the information that they possibly can to those who require it.  They are attending to their duties from an early hour in the morning perhaps until 11 o'clock at night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no hesitation in paying a high tribute to the work of this Department.  Some very ill-advised people suggest that the Department should be scrapped and that the money it costs should be devoted to some other purpose.  If Deputies look back on the record of the work done by the Department of Agriculture, even in the giving of premiums for bulls, they will appreciate that fact.  Deputy <Col N="982" /> Dillon will be glad to know that the procedure he suggested has been adopted by the County Cork Committee of Agriculture.  The highest premium is given to the dairy shorthorn bull.  The utmost care is devoted to the selection of bulls for premiums. The Dairy Shorthorn Society is doing a tremendous amount of work, and while it may be open to some criticism in developing the beef bull which is a very valuable asset, at the same time there is development on lines suitable for a dairying county like Cork.  A tremendous amount of good work is being done in that way.  I am in agreement with keeping both the polled angus bull and the dairy shorthorn bull in the same neighbourhood, as the bad milkers can be sent to the polled angus bull, and the good milkers to the dairy Shorthorn bulls. On these lines you can develop the milking qualities.  In fact we need only refer to the enormous trade in high-class heifers with England which has very wisely been stopped by the present Government and the effort made to help the farmer to get these dairy heifers, keep them in our own country and thus retain an enormous asset which has been built up with the greatest care.</P>
    <P>I cannot sit down without referring to one important work and that is the cereal development which is carried on by the Department station at Ballinacurra. In view of the future activities of the present Government I think a very wise provision has been made at that station for the development of pure line seed barley and various other grains.  Having regard to the importance of that cereal development to the country, I believe that even a larger amount should be devoted to that particular station and that more assistance should be given.  I am glad to say that the price of barley has not fallen, and although it has not responded to the tariff in the manner which we would anticipate, still, at the same time, I have no hesitation in saying that the absorbing of the greater portion of the crop by maize mixtures has a tendency to provide a market which would otherwise not be available and thus keep up the <Col N="983" /> price of that particular cereal which is so important to farmers of the tillage areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to the subsidies which are given on cattle at the present time perhaps it is useless to go into this matter on this Vote or to refer to the necessity which has arisen for this subsidy.  That subsidy is bound to cost the country an immense amount of money and it will undoubtedly have a tendency to increase by taxation the cost of living.  Deputy Gorey referred to a very important question and that is the matter of minor arterial drainage schemes. Only the fringe of that problem has been touched in this country.  Under the old land system the land owners were able to join together and form drainage boards.  But now that the farmer is the owner of his own land it is absolutely necessary for the State to step in to a much greater degree than at the present moment.  There are areas where the lands are waterlogged and useless.  These lands are a danger to cattle and to every class of live stock, even to human life.  Therefore I believe that the attention of the State should be directed towards helping to a much greater degree than it has done up to the present to carry out minor drainage schemes.</P>
    <P>Quite recently owing to the enormous amount of derelict land in the country the county councils were enabled as the local authorities to give grants or at least loans for the provision of seeds.  I think that that undoubtedly has enabled a great deal of land to be put under cultivation that would otherwise be derelict.  I hope that that system will be continued in the future. That will enable farmers who have no money for stock nor any means of seeding their land to put in a crop.  I would suggest to the Minister that he might assist these in a much greater degree than he has done in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (Galway) Mr. P. Hogan (Galway)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Galway): I take it that though it might be in order to deal with the policy of the Government as regards agriculture it would be better perhaps to confine ourselves to details on this Vote.  So far as I am <Col N="984" /> concerned I regard the general policy of the Government as sheer lunacy for which there is nothing good, bad or indifferent to be said.  I used to be Minister for Agriculture myself and I was always annoyed when well-meaning Deputies and Deputies who were not well-meaning got up and made speeches at me.  It often occurred to me that it would be an education to them to see their policies in operation The carrying out of a policy is better than speaking about it.  Let their policy be put into operation for a period of years and then we will arrive at some conclusion about it.</P>
      <P>I suggest there have been more idiotic theories in connection with agriculture than with any other industry in the country.  These idiotic theories are particularly rife amongst non-farmers.  For the last year, particularly, these have held the stage. Teachers, doctors, politicians, and lawyers of all sorts all have their theories about agriculture.  They now have a Government which will put every single one of them into operation. I talked against these theories for years and years, but it was not too convincing.</P>

I have come to the conclusion that putting this into operation will cost the country an enormous figure, though now that we have begun to do so&mdash;including the policy of grain mixing of which Deputy Brasier is so enamoured&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have this policy of mixing maize or Indian meal with the home grown grain.  We might as well continue this policy out, and after a year or two all the soft-headed people in the country will have got a demonstration as to whether it is good or not.  At any rate there seems to me to be no other way out of it.  We are doing these silly things at present. The education the country is deriving from it seems almost to compensate for <Col N="985" /> the financial loss.  The losses that will be incurred in the future in carrying through the policies of the Government will be great, but, nevertheless, I think we might as well put up with them so as to test them out.  It seems to me that in agriculture and otherwise in this country we have for a long time been going around in a circle.  Nothing has been tested out.  The Minister will agree with me that we did get a fair test for our policy of producing and encouraging the production of live stock products.  We got a fair test for that policy.  I make you a present of the results.  Some people say these were good, others bad.  At any rate, we tested the policy out.</P>
      <P>Let us have a shot now at growing wheat, mixing Indian meal with home grown grain and subsidising the sale of heifers.  That latter scheme has had attached to it the provision that there must be two solvent sureties.  Now that takes all the good out of it.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should withdraw that condition.  It is not Fianna Fáilish enough.  It does not trust enough.  Having two solvent sureties is rather an aspersion on the character of the poor borrower.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should withdraw that condition.  He knows perfectly well that he will never get the money back.  This condition as to having these two solvent sureties is taking the good out of it.</P>
      <P>There is another scheme about providing seed wheat, seed oats and seed barley.  We all know that seed can always be provided by a farmer.  Even this year, when goodness knows things are bad enough, a man could provide seed.  There will be no shortage of the seed potatoes or seed oats required to be sown.  No farmer will have any difficulty in providing this seed in the ordinary way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless the Minister for Agriculture insists on these schemes of his because he read about them in some copy book.  He must make advances to the county councils to supply the wheat; he must subsidise heifers; he must mix maize with tailings and so on.  There are people who ought to be sensible, but they believe in that sort of thing.  Now we are getting these <Col N="986" /> schemes into operation.  This is exactly opposite to the policy that has prevailed here for ten years.  I would like to see it tested out, and I put it to the Minister for Agriculture that he ought to do his best to keep the present Government in office for the next two years, so as to be able to test out this policy of subsidies and bounties.  I think this sort of foolishness must be killed once and for all, and there is only one way of doing that, and that is &ldquo;put it into practice.&rdquo;  There is one rather important phase of agricultural policy which is very much beloved by the patriotic people in the country that has already been pretty well blown upon&mdash;that is tariffs on agricultural produce.  For seven weary years I told the people that tariffs on agricultural imports would not increase prices.  For the same seven years every patriot in the country, every Republican, all the select people, the University professors, all the so-called educated people and especially the politicians told us: &ldquo;Protection is the thing, protection is the stuff, it will get you higher prices.&rdquo;  I remember reading about all the bacon that used to come into this country, Polish bacon and, worst of all, Chinese bacon&mdash;about all the dreadful stuff that we were told was coming in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I remember correctly Deputy Brasier was a firm believer in tariffs, like myself.  At any rate, we used to hear about all the butter, all the oats and all the beef that was coming into the country.  It used to be said &ldquo;this is an agricultural country, and look at all the agricultural produce that is coming in.  Is it any wonder that prices are low and that the farmers are not prosperous?  There is an obvious remedy and it is to stop these things coming in; put on high tariffs against these agricultural imports.&rdquo; It was suggested that any other Government <Col N="987" /> except the Government which notoriously was in the hands of English importers, like the last Government, would clap on tariffs: that at once prices would go up and all would be happy.  Is not that, I ask, a fair picture of the sort of propaganda that came from the Fianna Fáil Party in the last five or six years, or are they getting away from it now?  Did they not tell everyone that what was needed were agricultural tariffs and that these would lead to prosperity at once? Now we have prohibitive tariffs on beef, mutton, bacon, eggs and on every possible form of live stock and live stock products, prohibitive tariffs that are almost embargoes.  We have had them for the last year.  Have we learned any lesson?  Have they increased prices by one copper?  Remember I do not mean have they put up prices, but have they increased prices above last year's level?  What I mean exactly is, have they stayed the fall in prices by one copper?  There is not a lb. of beef or mutton coming into the country now.  What is the price of mutton now?  3d. or 4d. What is the price of beef?  22/- a cwt. If you had not the English embargo, what would it be?  About 30/-.  Is not that the world price in spite of all your tariffs?  What are pigs at the moment? 22/- or 24/-, and that with your prohibitive tariff.  The world price is something like 33/- or 34/-.  Yet the Party opposite spent the last five or six years, their friends, their propagandists and themselves telling the country that tariffs would be its salvation. We have a high tariff on oats, but what is the price of oats this year? 10/-, I think, for black, and 11/- for white.  I think that lesson will sink in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing at any rate has been proved, and it is that tariffs, no matter how high, are no protection for a product that has to depend on an export market.  We have the extraordinary situation here, that the Party that spent five or six years telling the electorate that tariffs would be their salvation, that the home market was the real market for this country, <Col N="988" /> are now subsidising exports.  Was there ever such a situation?  Is there any other country in the world where that could occur?  I do not believe it. I think the policy should be carried out logically in all its stark foolishness, because I think that the people should get a demonstration, a complete demonstration, as to what the Fianna Fáil plan for agriculture is.</P>
      <P>Coming down to details, one may say that almost every scheme of the Department of Agriculture has been wrecked, all the sound schemes that were there long before I took office. The Department had some very sound schemes which were being administered with great value to the country. They were there always, and all the energy that should now be going to administer them properly is being spent on foolish experiments, the sort of experiments that I have already mentioned, experiments such as the buying of cattle for the Belgian market.  I asked a question yesterday as to how many cattle have been bought and as to what was the result of the transactions.  I would not be told.  I was told it was not in the national interest to do so.  That is an extraordinary point of view.  I do not think that any man closely in touch with the cattle market and with the prices of cattle would give that answer because he must know that I would have no difficulty in finding out.  But then he might reply, &ldquo;why did you ask?&rdquo; My answer is that I am entitled as a Deputy to ask for information for people who should not have the trouble of finding out.  They should get it from the Minister.  Just imagine when cattle are being bought at 25/-, 26/- and 27/- a cwt. sending officers of the Department to the market to buy them to sell in Belgium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely it was not necessary to lose big sums of money in order to prove that cattle bought here at 26/- and 27/-a cwt. could not pay in Belgium.  The market reports give one that information. Yet, yesterday the Minister told me that I might be disappointed.  I assume that what he really means is that they will pay later on.  If that is what he means then I say it is a <Col N="989" /> blue look-out for the country.  What it comes to is this, that cattle are going to fall to such an appallingly bad price that it will pay to buy them and sell them against old horses in the Belgian market.  If the price of cattle falls much below what it is at present, then of course you can sell them against horse flesh in the Belgian market and you will not make a loss.  But it ought not to be necessary to carry out actual experiments to get that information. It is to be found in the market reports, and these are available to the Department of Agriculture and to enterprising farmers in the country.  I suggest that the Minister ought to have realised that if there was a market for cattle in Belgium you would have plenty of enterprising men in the Dublin Cattle market buying cattle and selling them there, men who already had been selling certain types of cattle there.  He should not have wasted the public money in a futile piece of nonsense such as sending up his officers to the Dublin Cattle Market to make a laughing-stock of them by sending the cattle across to Belgium to lose money.  That is the sort of thing that can be done now.  All you have to do is to pretend to be a patriot or to call yourself a patriot and you can do anything you like.  I would not have been allowed to be a Minister for two hours if I had attempted to do such a thing.  There are at least half a dozen schemes embarked on by the present Minister for which, if I did one of them, I would have been marked down as&mdash;&mdash;.</P>

      <P>(Galway): Yes, as a traitor, as the Deputy remarked.  As I was saying, you can get away with any of this foolishness or lunacy if you call yourself a patriot and say that you are doing it in order to do your bit in this war with England.  But this period of lunacy will pass.  I am certain it will pass.  It may be that certain people in the country at the moment, from one reason or another, are ready to see out that foolish policy. I have heard people make speeches in the present crisis who would not have dreamed of saying these things a few <Col N="990" /> years ago.  However, that lunacy will not last, and I suggest to the Minister that, even though he feels that he must do those sort of things, he should at least try to keep the large number of first-class schemes which are in the Department at the moment.  He should try to keep them together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apropos of that, Deputy Dillon said that it would be well if the agricultural instructor was in closer touch with the farmer.  Of course it would. But I do not agree with Deputy Dillon's remedy of demonstration farms. I think there are a lot of objections to that, but I would point out this: At the moment you have a fine Department with a big number of efficient officers, who have been educated and trained not only with a view to giving instructions in the rich places like Meath but also in the Gaeltacht, because you have not only instructors but overseers specially educated to give instruction in the district.  They cannot do their work properly&mdash;I have got no information from them&mdash;but I know they cannot do their work properly. When we took over the Department in 1922, we helped to make a certain number of changes and experiments, some good and some bad, which upset the Department considerably. What we must realise is that ordinary day-to-day administration is far and away more important than experiment. Experiment has its place.  I suppose every Department which is energetic does make experiments, but what is important in a big Department like the Department of Agriculture is not the experiments, but the seeing to it that the day-to-day work is done efficiently, that the staff is kept up to scratch, that the senior men are doing the work they should do&mdash;checking the work of the junior men and seeing that they are doing their work efficiently. Without such work you can have no proper administration.  I believe that while this phase of foolishness lasts, while these frantic efforts are being made to develop foreign markets that do not exist, and to cover up losses of money&mdash;I believe that while all this lasts, the ordinary normal administration of the Department, which is far and away more important than any of <Col N="991" /> these experiments, is bound to suffer. That is one of the losses which the country is incurring at present, the size of which they do not really appreciate.</P>
    <P>If I might mention one detail in connection with their administration it is this.  I believe that the Live Stock Breeding Act improved the quality of the cattle in this country, generally, very much indeed, and by live stock I mean not only the cattle, but pigs.  I believe that our cattle were approaching something like perfection and our pigs very near it.  The pigs are very good indeed in this country.  Just before I left office, however, I was coming to the conclusion, and my experience since then has strengthened that conclusion, that the Live Stock Breeding Act, as it is operating, is operating against the dairy cow and in favour of the beef animal.  I think, if it is operated as it is being operated at present, without making some attempt to encourage milk as against beef, that in a comparatively short time you may find yourself with magnificent looking cows, very fine cattle and pigs, but that it will be extremely hard to get a good milking dairy cow in this country.  The Act is operated in this way: There are licensing shows in practically every parish twice a year&mdash;in spring and in autumn.  The animals are inspected there entirely on view.  That is to say, pedigree or other qualities are not taken into account, and they are inspected as they would be on their appearance or, in other words, on beef. That is bound to give an advantage to the animal that is bred from beef animals, and it is undoubtedly working out in that way.  While the quality of our cattle and live stock, generally, is being improved from the point of view of beef and bacon, there is no doubt about it that we are gradually breeding out milk.  That is a very serious problem for the Department of Agriculture. I confess myself that I do not see a way out of it at the moment. I do not think that Cow-Testing Associations will remedy it, but I am satisfied that some way out will have to be found; otherwise the milking <Col N="992" /> qualities of our dairy cows will deteriorate and deteriorate very gravely.  If the Minister, in the intervals when he is not engaged entirely in fighting the English, would concentrate on a problem like that (which will take the co-operation of a number of officers in the Department of Agriculture and entail serious thought and work from himself) and try to find some way of levelling up the position of the dairy cow so as to give the dairy cow the same chance the beef animal is getting at the present, without at the same time reverting to the old system, he would be doing a good work for the agriculture of this country and a work which will yield big dividends later on when all this foolishness and lunacy is forgotten and we all get sane again.</P>

      <P>We heard a lot of illuminating statements from various Deputies, and I would suggest to them that they take Deputy Hogan's remedy and test it themselves.  We hear farmers getting up here and talking about agriculture and systems of pure strain barley and all the rest of it, and they do little of those things themselves. For instance, one Deputy was talking about a two-bull show&mdash;one for the milk and another for the beef.  Those arguments are rather comical when you hear them coming out here.  Then we had Deputy Gorey talking about foreign markets and our grip on the foreign market, and that we were losing our grip on the foreign market. What are we losing?  Here it is: &ldquo;At Maidstone last week sheep were sold for a shilling a head.&rdquo;  Deputy Gorey would sell them for that, and he would pay rates and annuities.  I think he is anxious for more land.  An English estate agent will give him six farms on a line, and he is prepared to let them rent free to anyone who is prepared to cultivate them.</P>

I sold it for it this week&mdash;16/- a barrel for barley.  Those are things that I would like you to consider when you talk of the mixing scheme.  We were told very solemnly from those benches last year and the year before: &ldquo;If you dare put a tariff on barley Guinness will go.&rdquo;  He is here yet. The brewery is here yet.  The tariff is on the barley and Guinness has not gone.  I did not hear that he was going.  I do not know whether Deputy Hogan has any information that he is going.  Beamish's brewery is still going full belt down in Cork, and the price of barley is now 16/- here and 10/6 in England.</P>

When we were here arguing with him from time to time about the bull ring that he had built up around the country, why!  who dared make any suggestion about such a policy, and here we have Deputy Hogan getting up now and telling us that milking cows are not of the best, &ldquo;owing to my policy for seven years&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;owing to my policy for seven years.&rdquo; We heard all those arguments.  He sneers at the dairy heifer scheme.  He sneers at that too.  Deputy Hogan's policy included a premium on dairy cattle&mdash;dairy bulls.  His Department spent a lot of money on dairy cattle during the last five or six years, and the best of those heifers each year were undoubtedly going to Britain.  We were subsidising Britain.  We were paying premiums here for dairy cattle &mdash;breeding heifers for the English market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Now the farmers will get an opportunity of stocking their land with those heifers.  I have not the opinion of my fellow farmers which Deputy Hogan displays when he says: &ldquo;Wipe out the sureties.  They will not pay.  You will never get them back anyway.&rdquo;  I wonder whether it was on those lines he brought in the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  If it was in that frame of mind, it was a very peculiar distribution of public money.  &ldquo;Give it out.  You will not get it back anyway.&rdquo;  If that was the idea behind the Agricultural Credit Corporation proposals and the distribution of money out of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, that was Deputy Hogan's idea when he brought in those things.  I would like to hear some account from him as to that distribution of public moneys.</P>
      <P>We have had a different experience, and I am proud to say it, in Cork, in regard to money that was loaned out. For instance, we lent several thousand pounds out under the housing schemes, and we cannot find anybody in arrears.  They are paying up their yearly contributions in that line.  The same thing applies in connection with other subsidies under which loans were given.  I think it is a rather peculiar thing for an ex-Minister for Agriculture to stand up here and give that opinion of his fellow farmers, that any loan they get will not be paid back anyway.  Is that co-operation?</P>
      <P>Deputy Gorey told us about a present we made to the Argentine.  I challenge Deputy Gorey or anybody else to stand up here in this House, and to state that at any time, during the last three years at any rate, a farmer could sell his cattle at the price that England could afford to pay for them, and could at the same time pay his rates and annuities.</P>

That is the policy that drove out of employment in my constituency, on tillage alone, something like 6,400 labourers&mdash;yes, and left them outside the ditch, looking in at the result of the grass Ministry.

      <P>Deputy Gorey is at present running a big drainage scheme. He was telling us so a few minutes ago.  I suggest that you collect all the apostles of farming&mdash;all those who are telling us about what farmers should do&mdash;and send them down to Deputy Gorey to give him a hand in the drain for a month.  I am sure he will make them work and I am sure they will not have so much talk about farming when <Col N="996" /> they come back.  I believe that our farming policy is the only policy that will pull the farmers out of the wood. Deputy Hogan realised that before he went.  A month before he went, or two months before he went, we had a tariff on foreign oats&mdash;put on by Deputy Hogan.  He cannot deny it.  Of course he waited first until all the grain merchants had the oats gathered into the loft, for fear the farmer would get any benefit, and then he came along and put a tariff on oats.  What is the position to-day?  The man who tills his land is going to get a price for what he grows on it, and the man who employs labour is going to get a price for what he grows, and I have no sympathy with the Hoganites in this country and the sooner we get rid of them the better.  Unfortunately, a lot of decent farmers have caught on to the Hogan policy and we have to try by subsidies to save them from the effects of the Hogan policy.  But what is the position to-day as compared with the position last harvest?  As far as the farmer is concerned you have good prices&mdash;£7 per ton for oats&mdash;and incidentally the price in England is 4/9 or £4 15s. a ton.</P>

Despite all the advice he got, despite all the warnings he got, he still ploughs his land and still grows his grain and he is rewarded with £4 10s. a ton for oats.  Yes, that was the opening price and that was the price until Deputy Hogan came along at the last minute to save his Party and save his Government, and put a tariff on oats.  He was compelled to do it, he had to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="997" /> He came along and said: &ldquo;I will save the Party; I will turn my back on the whole agricultural policy I preached for ten years and I will come along now and tariff.&rdquo;  And he did come along and put tariffs on the oats, and he came along and put tariffs on grain and tariffs on butter.  But, as I told him, &ldquo;Man,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I don't believe in it.&rdquo;  He states himself he does not believe in it and if he is elected again he would take off the tariff a week after getting in.  The people do not trust him, they threw him out.  The converted sinner at the eleventh hour never believed&mdash;that is what happened Deputy Hogan.  But this year the farmer is getting an increase of 50/- a ton on his oats above the price it was last year.</P>

      <P>Well, this is the position, and I can produce to any member of this House the offer of 16/- per barrel for barley.  The offer was made to a man in Midleton and, furthermore, the carriage was paid from Midleton to Cork on it, and the offer still stands. We will even take the Farmers' Union barley and we will get a price for it. That is the difference between the two policies, the policy that was depending on the English market (and where sheep have been sold to-day at a shilling a head, I am quite sure John Bull can knock 20 per cent. out of that) and the policy of preserving our home market for the Irish farmer.  Deputy Hogan sneers at wheat, he is very fond of sneering at the wheat policy, but down in Cork, and I am sure in other counties, we can grow wheat profitably, and when appeals were made here repeatedly to the last Executive Council that owing to the policy of the Department of Agriculture and of the Government, that the land should be revalued and that the wheat valuation should not hold, and that the farmers holding wheat land should not be compelled to pay rates on a grain valuation&mdash;all that was ignored.  The late Executive Council compelled farmers to pay rates on a grain valuation on their holdings for seven years after that grain valuation had ceased, but the average result of the wheat experiment last year was something like 21 cwts. per acre, and that at 25/-per barrel will, undoubtedly, be a paying proposition.  For fear there might be any argument as to what paper I was quoting from, I was quoting from the &ldquo;Sunday Express,&rdquo; October 9th, 1932, which gives the price of the English products I have named.</P>

      <P>As the items included in this Estimate have undergone so <Col N="999" /> many changes since it was originally prepared, there is no use in making any reference to them in the course of this discussion.  For that reason I think it was the duty of the Minister to make some statement at the beginning of this discussion to-day.  The Minister is the official head of the agricultural community in this country and by virtue of that position he must accept a certain share, a certain big share, of responsibility for the unfortunate position in which the farmers find themselves to-day.  It has been said by other speakers that there will be another opportunity for discussing this question on the two motions on the Order Paper in the name of Deputy Cosgrave, but I do not believe that in that discussion we shall have an opportunity of hearing from the President, who I presume will reply on behalf of the Government, or from the Minister for Agriculture, what is, at the present moment, the agricultural policy of the Government.  I submit, a Chinn Comhairle, that in this discussion we should be allowed to continue after the Minister has made his statement here to-day.  I think a statement of policy is due to the members of the House and is certainly due to the farmers of the country in consequence of the unfortunate position to which his policy has reduced them to-day.</P>

      <P>The farmers are told that they must produce in the interests of the nation and not in their own interests or for the purpose of making individual profits.  That is the new economy that the Government want the farmers of the country to adopt. On the one hand, as I say, you have the Government whilst not actually insisting on the farmers adopting this new policy, nevertheless threatening them that if they do not adopt the proposals they have recently introduced, there is a danger that the land will be confiscated and used for the general good according to the statement of the Minister for Defence, I think it was in Drogheda.  On the other hand, the farmer is satisfied that the economy he has followed for the last sixty or seventy years is still the right economy if he is to make any profit for himself, and that it represents the greatest profit and the greatest advantage to the nation.  By virtue of this conflict it is inevitable that a feeling of uncertainty should exist in the minds of the farmers.  It is inevitable that there is a certain amount of inactivity on their part.  It is inevitable also that deterioration, in consequence of the conflict of policy and of views, will set in amongst the farmers generally.  I say, in view of the uncertainty brought about by the policy of the Government, it is certainly due from the Minister to make a full and complete statement of his agricultural policy.  It is, as I say, due to the members of the Dáil and <Col N="1001" /> it is also due to the farmers of the country.  I do not propose to say anything more at this stage, but I hope to have something more to say on the subject after the Minister has made his statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHarris" hpid="Mr. Harris Mr. Harris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harris</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Roddy stated that the farmers of this country were satisfied with the economy that existed up to the time the present Government succeeded in getting office.  That economy depended upon the prosperity of Britain and the industrial depression in England and the industrial depression alone, for the past nine or ten years, has broken down that economy.  But the Irish people and the farmers of the country even when that economy was comparatively successful were not satisfied with it. The great majority of the Nationalist farmers of the country were not satisfied with that economy.  You might find some of the old landlord element or the very big graziers, who form a very small section of the community and who had the very best land in the country, satisfied with it, but they were the only people who were satisfied. The economy of which Deputy Roddy spoke meant that one farmer's son could hold the farm and there was no remedy for the rest of the family in the country.  They might clear out; they might go to America or anywhere they liked.  That left farmers' families throughout the country in the position from which they could not get away. They could not get into the professions. They lived to be old men and women all huddled together in the one house on the one farm.  In that way many families have died out. We see them throughout the country at the present time.  We see four or five brothers and sisters living together on the same farm and eventually dying out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHarris" hpid="Mr. Harris Mr. Harris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harris</NameTxt>
      <P>The breakdown of that economy is due to the depression on the far side.  The new economy to which the Government is looking forward, is the placing of the people back on the land, the tilling of the land, and the growing of food for the <Col N="1002" /> Irish people.  The Minister for Agriculture by his wheat scheme is making a big start in that direction.  The success of the new agricultural economy depends on the success of our industrial development also.  It is imperative that we should develop this country, that we should make it a self-contained country and not have it a depopulated straw farm for England as it was in the past.  It is imperative on us now to develop our industries and with the development of our industries our agriculture will develop.</P>
      <P>Of course, we realise that it is necessary to foster foreign trade, and the Minister is doing his part in trying to maintain our foreign trade.  We know what the present conditions of agriculture in England are, and the position in which the English farmer is. We know that the English market is not able to maintain the British farmer and we cannot expect it is going to do any good for us, and we should have very small hope if we were compelled to depend on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was greatly surprised that Deputy Roddy, who is a farmer, should give expression to the views that the farming community to-day should be satisfied with the economic position of fifty or sixty years ago. Deputy Roddy has some knowledge of the conditions prevailing in England for some years past.  These conditions have led to the serious state of unemployment in that country and to the consequent reduction of the purchasing power of a very large section of the British industrial population who, for many years, were the principal purchasers of Irish beef.  Anybody who followed the history of the past few years, and especially since the European War, knows perfectly well that in Lancashire and in Scotland and Wales, which largely purchased Irish beef, butter and eggs, unemployment has grown to a large extent.  There are not these orders for these commodities to-day, and are not likely to be in the next few years, because the same employment is not prevailing there now as in years gone by.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have, in previous debates on this matter, pointed out the danger to the <Col N="1003" /> Irish agriculturist of that position, and the necessity, as a result of that position, of the Irish Government taking such steps as would provide for the loss of our export market.  Deputy Roddy may conscientiously disagree with the whole policy of the present Ministry, but, surely, he does not disagree with that part of the policy of the present Minister for Agriculture, which saved the dairying industry in the past few months by adopting a policy which the Cumann na nGaedheal turned down before they were turned out at the last General Election.  The bounty policy of the Minister has saved that industry, at any rate, for the time being.  I know no alternative policy put up by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party which would have done better for the farmers of this country than the policy recently adopted by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Does Deputy Roddy deny the fact, that were it not for the grain policy of the Minister, many of the growers of the country would now have their corn in their barn instead of having sold it at a reasonable price or would have been only able to sell it at a small profit?  Does he agree with the policy, so far as it applies to the dairy farmers and the grain growers of this country? If he does not would he tell us what his policy is?  Neither he nor any of his colleagues who have spoken told us what they think would have been a better policy than the policy adopted by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I readily admit that the existing situation, so far as it affects the farmers, is far from healthy, and the Minister and his colleagues will have to sit down and consider where we are going in regard to the existing situation. I refer particularly to the bounty policy of the Minister for Agriculture.  When the bounty policy was put into operation, and when the Minister decided to provide a bounty for the pig producers the price of pigs was 34/- per cwt.  The price in my constituency in the last few weeks varied from 20/- to 25/- per live cwt. I understand, from people who know more about the practical side of <Col N="1004" /> farming than I do, that farmers engaged in pig production would have to get 35/- per cwt. in order to enable pig production to pay.  If the farmers, therefore, are to be forced to continue, as they are under the existing policy, to sell their pigs at prices varying from 20/- to 25/- and 28/- per live cwt., they will be compelled as long as they are obliged to do so to eat up their capital. And that will lead to a very serious position in the long run so far as it affects people engaged in pig production. A large number of the people engaged in pig production are the small farmers, and, in many cases, people living in labourers' cottages, throughout the country.  Many of the people living in labourers' cottages, who have been in the habit of getting employment from the local farmers and the local councils, for six or eight or nine months in the year have, for the remainder of the period, been compelled to eke out an existence as a result of the small profits they made in the past out of the pigs they reared and sold.  I readily admit, also, that were it not for the bounty policy of the Minister for Agriculture things would be worse than what they are.</P>
    <P>I would be satisfied with the extended policy in existing conditions if I could have an assurance from the Minister that he had satisfied himself that the bounty raised from the taxpayers, as a whole, was going back to the people for whom it was intended. I do not like to subscribe to a policy which compels the taxpayers of this country to continue indefinitely to raise large sums for the payment of this bounty while realising that these large sums are going to the middlemen and not to the producer.  I have seen some figures and I have been given a certain amount of information in regard to the matter, and I am satisfied that, in many cases, the benefit of the bounty is going to the middleman and not to the producer.  That being so, I appeal to the Minister and to his colleagues to sit down and consider whether some alternative method may not be found to enable the Minister, on behalf of the taxpayers, to see if it is possible that the large sums raised in bounties shall go to the producer, <Col N="1005" /> as intended by the Government and as intended by those who support the Government.</P>

In a short time unless some such methods are devised by the present Minister there will be a great falling off in pig production.</P>

      <P>I can understand the sensible and honest contribution of Deputy Harris in this debate, because Deputy Harris is consistent in his attitude in relation to the whole position of the Government's agricultural policy of this country.  But when we come to the position in relation to the agricultural policy of the Government as manifested by Deputy Davin, I feel constrained to ask one or two questions. Deputy Davin wants to play hot and cold.  He wants to give benediction to the agricultural policy of the Government and, at the same time, to square his conscience with his own constituents. But he cannot have it both ways.  He either agrees with the agricultural policy of the Minister or he does not.  If he does not agree with him, let him vote against the Estimates. If he does agree with it, he should never have made the speech he has just made.  He has told us that he is not satisfied that the pig producer <Col N="1006" /> is getting a proper or adequate price for his pigs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The bounty in the long run comes out of the farmers' pockets and the producer's pocket.  We have heard something about the development of foreign trade being coincident, or going hand in hand, with the development of the home market.  Are we sensible or sane people?  We have the dead walls of the country placarded with the legend, &ldquo;Boycott British Goods.&rdquo;  When we talk about foreign markets, what do we mean by foreign markets?  Our only foreign market, if we use the term for a market outside our own country, translated into common or garden English, is the British market.  If it means anything else, it means that we must find a market for our agricultural produce in Belgium, Sweden, Norway, America, and I might even mention Japan and Peru, After all, there is some dictionary meaning for the word &ldquo;foreign.&rdquo;  When we talk about foreign markets we must have regard to the conditions around us.  Does Denmark want our bacon or eggs or butter?  Does France or Belgium want our butter, bacon, beef, or any other agricultural product?  We are told, by no less an authority than the President of the State, himself, that after years of waiting and promises we have not yet found that alternative market.  Yet, to-day we have repeated in this House this rubbishy talk about foreign markets and an outlet for our produce. When it is all boiled down as a result of common experience what do we find?  That we are doing our best to get rid of the one and only market we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it would be of some interest to Deputy Davin to learn something about what is occurring amongst some of the very largest producers of pigs in this country, and, incidentally, to let him have some information as to the effect of the agricultural policy of this Government on the ordinary working-class people.  I am sure Deputy Davin has some latent feeling for the plight of the poor working <Col N="1007" /> classes in this country to-day.  We may be told that the price of beef and potatoes and of every agricultural product has gone down, and that the working classes in our cities and towns are enjoying all the benefits to be derived from the low prices of agricultural produce.  Beef and mutton are relatively cheap.  Why are they cheap? Because of the fact that the farmer, as evidenced even by the statement made by Deputy Davin, has to get rid of his live-stock at an uneconomic price, has to get rid of nearly everything he produces at an uneconomic price.  Potatoes in Dublin to-day are selling at 4/- per cwt. and at in or about that price in Cork City.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that pay the farmer? Is not the natural reaction to that kind of thing that the farmer, instead of producing for the home market, is going to go into production for himself and his family?  Why should the farmer be expected to produce his beef, mutton and pork at a price which does not pay him?  If you ask any practical farmer if his farm is paying, he will tell you it is not.  Is it not a fact that fairs recently have become a very tragic failure?  To come to a point which I know will interest Deputy Davin, I shall quote from a letter received from one of the most extensive farmers in the country, a man who employs a very large amount of labour. He says:</P>
      <P>I do not think my losses will be under £1,200 this year.  Unfortunately, the more intensively a man farms the more he loses.  I have lost 20/- each on some 500 heavy pigs and have still to market at further losses.</P>
      <P>That, of course, means that he began to fatten the pigs at a period when he did not anticipate he would have lost all this money.  He goes on to state:</P>
      <P>I have now decided to get out of them altogether, as well as change all my plans as regards hand-feeding cattle and sheep.</P>
      <P>That letter is indicative of others I have received.  It proceeds:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1008" /> You see, we are now faced with a situation by which one quarter of our pigs is taken away from us at the British port or, alternatively, we must feed for a limited home market which chokes up the first week an extra couple of thousand pigs are sent to our curers.  The week before last, as you probably know, every curer refused to take a pig for days.</P>
    <P>The excuse given on that occasion was that the pens were full, that they could not take delivery of any more pigs. The letter proceeds:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I very much regret I have to discharge good men who have been years with me.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin cannot have it both ways.  This is a case where a man has to discharge men off his farm who were in the enjoyment of relatively good wages and conditions, the best conditions, I submit, that operate in any part of agricultural Ireland.  The letter proceeds:&mdash;</P>
    <P>One had to go a few weeks back, and two to go at the end of the next week.</P>
    <P>That is very good news for Deputy Davin and those associated with him who are supporting the Minister's agricultural policy.  The letter goes on:</P>
    <P>We must now farm on negative principles, cutting everything down, unfortunately including labour, or be ruined.  With modern machinery, extra corn, if grown, will not employ half the labour needed for a full-stocked farm, where extensive stall-feeding, mixing, grinding, littering, mucking up, etc., has been part of the daily work, and all this work is being given up on all sides.  No farmer can now stand up.  Anyhow, my resources have been so cut down that I could not go on with it if I wished to do so, much as I hate to see my splendid buildings empty.</P>
    <P>In conclusion he asked me if I could suggest anything.  I have referred this gentleman for suggestions to the present Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I want to advert again to the position of the city worker and the town worker&mdash;the man who is lucky enough to be in some kind of permanent employment, and who, for <Col N="1009" /> a time, but for a very brief period, has enjoyed the advantage of lower prices of certain agricultural products. I am rather interested to know from the Minister how long in his view are these conditions going to operate, because I feel&mdash;and I am open to correction if my economic sense has gone awry&mdash;that this state of affairs cannot last all the time, notwithstanding all the bounties that we hear about, and that, some time or another, the farmer will say to himself that he will not continue to produce at the prices he is offered under present conditions.</P>
    <P>I do not want to comment at any great length on the present policy of the Minister for Agriculture but I certainly must have regard to what is occurring all round me.  In the City of Cork, which I represent, we find that depression is growing daily.  The unemployed are being continually added to and much of that is due to the agricultural policy of the present Government.  We cannot get away from the fact that there are certain reactions following on this policy&mdash;the policy, for instance, advocated by members of the present Government and by their followers in the country&mdash;the &ldquo;Boycott British Goods&rdquo; campaign.</P>
    <P>In my view, this is a negative policy. I would much prefer a good, strong, positive policy of &ldquo;support Irish industries.&rdquo;&ldquo;Support Irish&rdquo;&mdash;I do not subscribe to this policy of &ldquo;boycott British goods.&rdquo;  It has been said that this war has been thrust upon us.  The vast majority of the people in the country do not make themselves as vocal as the other side.  My experience, and the experience of many people in this country, goes to show that it is a noisy minority in this country that is behind this policy of &ldquo;boycott British goods&rdquo;&mdash;a noisy and disgruntled lot of persons, disgruntled because of the fact that they got neither pelf nor place in the last Government and because they have, perhaps, been denied pelf or place in this Government. They are dictating the policy of the present Government.  In their enmity, in their policy of hate, which can never do this country any good, they <Col N="1010" /> are prepared to stop at nothing, and I want to suggest to the Minister that he is translating, in his own agricultural policy, that policy of hate which is going to bring nothing to this country but misfortune and tragedy.  The  question that is asked of me when I  out to some of the agricultural portions of my own area is: &ldquo;What are you going to do with us or what are you going to do for us?&rdquo; My rejoinder to that query is always to this effect: &ldquo;Ask President de Valera, or ask the Minister for Agriculture, or ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce.&rdquo; I frequently hear that the fairs are bad and prices are bad, and I could give the Minister many instances of beasts bought for £10 apiece, fattened for at least four months, which had to be sold for £8 apiece.  If the Minister thinks that that is the policy that is going to bring this country out of the rut, his economics must be wrong.  We have heard from Deputy Davin that pigs were bought in his own area at 20/- a cwt. live weight, and in some cases he said 25/-.  Did Deputy Davin try to translate the meaning of cause and effect?  Did he ask himself the causes which contributed to compelling the farmer to sell at 20/- per cwt. live weight?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if he did, he would easily arrive at one conclusion, and only one conclusion&mdash;and he indicated even in his own speech the conclusion which I think he should arrive at&mdash;that the present agricultural policy as practised by the present Government is all wrong.  In my view, the speech made by Deputy Davin was a greater indictment of the policy of the present Minister than any speech delivered by Deputy Roddy or by any Deputy on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches.  It is time we took the wool from our eyes and admitted right away that the sooner we get rid of this war of attrition, this war of hate&mdash;and it is nothing else but a war of hate, inspired by hate and enmity and the most evil passions that were ever aroused in the Irish people&mdash;the better for ourselves, and the sooner our Executive Council agrees that a positive policy which <Col N="1011" /> finds expression in the words &ldquo;Support Irish Industry&rdquo; is better than a negative policy which suggests &ldquo;Boycott British Goods,&rdquo; the better it will be for every man, woman and child in this country, whether they be workers or farmers.</P>
      <P>I speak as a representative of a very important borough in this country&mdash; I know that I will be out of order if I refer to the full economic policy of this Government, but in so far as it relates to the policy of agriculture in this country&mdash;our experience in Cork City goes to show that never in the history of this country was there more poverty or more misery than there is at the present moment.  I am not unfair enough to suggest that it is all due to the present administration; I am aware that there were a whole lot of other factors which contributed to that economic depression, such as world war, etc., but most of the present depression has been brought about by the fiscal policy of the present Government, and, last but not least, by the policy of the Minister for Agriculture dictated by the &ldquo;Boycott British Goods&rdquo; cry.  Experience has shown that that does not tend to bring about any kind of prosperity, and if he persists in that policy he is going to bring us to the brink of the greatest tragedy that ever occurred in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is hardly worth while to speak on this Estimate in view of the abnormal conditions prevailing and also in view of the fact that it would be hardly fair to blame the Minister individually for the position of the agricultural industry, seeing that it is the result of the settled policy of the Executive Council, of which he is a member.  My only reason for interfering in this debate is to comment upon the tendency throughout the country at the present moment to minimise the importance of the cattle industry.  We heard speeches delivered by responsible people like Deputy Corry to the effect that the sooner the grazier goes the better it will be for this country.  I am not a farmer in <Col N="1012" /> the strict sense of the word, but I am possessed of a certain amount of common sense.  I know that the grazier is absolutely essential for the agricultural industry.  He serves as a sort of clearing house for the little man in the West and South of Ireland.  I do not think it is doing much good, so far as the agricultural industry is concerned, to endeavour, in speeches throughout the country, to make little of any section of the people.</P>
      <P>Men who own large grazing farms have performed for a long period of years very useful work in the agricultural economy of the country.  In addition, they keep going very many other sections of the people, notably cattle dealers, drovers, and last, but not least, the shipping industry.  We cannot divorce any section of the people engaged in any industrial pursuit without affecting all the other sections, and the sooner we recognise that fact the better.  Deputy Corry stated that the English market is of no use to this country.  I think the obvious answer is that if the English market is of no advantage it is rather extraordinary that at the present time we are paying 12½ per cent. of a bounty to induce our farmers to send cattle to that market. I think Deputy Corry must realise, as well as every other Deputy on the Fianna Fáil Benches and as well as everyone in the country, that the English market is the only market in which the Irish farmer can deal with advantage to himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe I have given a very definite answer to the case put up by Deputy Corry.  The Deputy also stated that because sheep were sold in England at a certain price the farmers in this country must sell their sheep at the same price.  Surely Deputy Corry must know that were it not for the 20 per cent. tariff imposed on Irish cattle when they are imported into England these cattle would have fetched a higher price, though it might not have been an economic price for the farmer?  The farmer would certainly get a higher price if the 20 per cent. tariff were not imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment in the county which I represent there is a considerable section of farmers engaged in raising potatoes.  I refer particularly to the Cooley district.  I will remind the Minister that owing to the uncertainty as to whether a tariff will be placed by the British Government on potatoes exported to Great Britain after 15th November the farmers in the Cooley area do not know where they are.  I am informed that they are inclined to sell their potatoes at prices ranging from 20/- to 25/- per ton, or 1/3 per cwt.  The Minister knows a great deal about this subject, and I would like him to deal with that aspect of the situation.  Let me point out that while the Government are giving bounties to the butter, cattle and pig industries very little regard <Col N="1014" /> is paid to agricultural products such as potatoes.  Here you have a very large section of the farming community in Co. Louth absolutely dependent on the potato industry and, owing to the uncertain conditions existing, the people there are apt to incur very serious losses because of low prices. I would like the Minister to give serious attention to that aspect of the situation.</P>
    <P>I wish to touch upon a very awkward situation which exists right along the Border.  I refer now to farmers living on the Free State side of the Border who have some land on the Northern side.  I am informed they are prevented from taking across the Border the produce of their farms in Northern Ireland.  At the moment that question is causing a certain amount of trouble, and a great deal of uneasiness and anxiety amongst a very large section of farmers living along the Border.  That state of affairs is not confined to the county I represent.  It applies to every county on the Border.  The Minister knows from experience in connection with agricultural produce, butter and eggs, that arrangements were made, whereby the least inconvenience possible would be caused to farmers in carrying on agricultural work.  I hope the Minister will see his way to get into communication with the Revenue Commissioners, and to formulate some scheme whereby these farmers will be able to get their agricultural produce across the Border from that portion of their land which lies in the territory known as Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>In County Waterford we find that farmers who should be assisting to carry through the policy of the Minister and of the Government are not doing so.  The large type of farmer who goes in for grazing is not giving that assistance, to put the Government's policy into operation, that should be given.  It is all very well for that class to be politically minded.  They have in mind the fact that there is to be a by-election in Waterford, and that it might serve their political purpose to try to sabotage the policy of the Government. That would not serve either <Col N="1015" /> Party interests or the country generally.  The country has already ratified and approved of the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Though many active farmers may honestly take a different point of view, still, if they had the interests of the country at heart, one would expect that they would do their best to forward, say, the Government's wheat scheme, seeing that Waterford is a county in which wheat is grown.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by Deputy Coburn with regard to Cooley illustrates what has arisen from the discussion.  Cooley has been agitating for the past six or seven years to be allowed to send potatoes to Dublin, Dundalk, and the home markets.  It was not allowed to do so on account of black-scab which raised a very difficult position.  Under present circumstances I would like to give Cooley the benefit of the home market rather than the poor English market, in which the people are selling potatoes at 25/- a ton and to get them the £4 a ton that Deputy Anthony spoke of in the Dublin and Cork markets.  I would like to give Cooley that benefit.  I consulted the officials in my Department but, in their opinion, it would be a dangerous thing to do.  I told the men from Cooley the last time I met them that I did not feel that I would be justified in going against the opinion of experts in the Department, and that therefore I could not allow them to sell potatoes in the home markets.  It is rather unfortunate for Cooley, and I am very sorry that we cannot relax the regulations. <Col N="1016" /> The situation more or less illustrates that there is, at least, one body of farmers in this country very anxious to make use of the home market.  They state that they are being made bankrupt because they have to sell their potatoes in the foreign market at 25/- a ton.  Potatoes may be ruled out as one of the products for which there is a good market.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coburn raised another question in regard to farmers living in the Free State, who have land in Northern Ireland, and who would not be allowed to get their produce in here.  We asked the Revenue Commissioners to allow these people the greatest latitude. It is in their discretion to do what they like.  They were allowing farmers who had places of residence in the Free State to bring oats across from the Northern side free of duty until the farmers on the Free State side of the Border&mdash;around Dundalk market and other places&mdash;said they were being swamped by the farmers in Northern Ireland who were bringing in oats, and they wished to keep the good Free State market to themselves.  That is a second case where the home market is better than the foreign market.  The point raised by Deputy Coburn illustrates it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I was not speaking about the question of bringing agricultural produce from Northern Ireland into the Free State on a wholesale scale.  I was referring to a farmer who is domiciled in the Free State, but portion of whose farm is in Northern Ireland, who, I understand, is prevented taking the produce of that portion of his farm which is in Northern Ireland into his haggard.  One man informed me that he has one or two acres of potatoes in Northern Ireland, that he wants to get across the Border to his own house. As he feeds a large number of pigs he disposes of no potatoes.  I appreciate the Minister's point of view, but I have mentioned the type of case I am referring to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand.  We have asked the Revenue Commissioners to be as lax as possible, and to give such farmers all the facilities they can.  If <Col N="1017" /> there are any particular points outstanding we will put them before the Revenue Commissioners.  When we did act we got complaints that certain farmers in Northern Ireland were taking advantage of that sort of laxity, in order to bring oats across the Border into the market in Dundalk and other places, because there was such a good market in the Free State as compared with Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>As to minor drainage schemes, I agree with Deputy Gorey that a good deal of useful work could be done on very small drainage schemes rather than on the Barrow and on bigger schemes.  I daresay what Deputy Gorey said is true, that so little drainage of that sort has been done by individual farmers for some years past, that there may be want of knowledge and experience of such work now, and that if expert advice were available it might be useful.  I admit that Deputy Gorey spoke to me about the matter before the summer holidays. I promised to do something about it, but there was so much to be done otherwise, that the matter was more or less postponed.  We may be able to do something in the near future.  I do not agree with Deputy Gorey that the diseases of fluke and T.B. are on the increase.  There is a certain amount of these diseases in the country, but I have not heard from the staffs we have that these diseases are on the increase.  The Deputy stated that these diseases were largely due to the want of drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I misunderstood the Deputy.  I thought he made that point.  However, the Deputy dealt with a point made by many Deputies with regard to the question of foreign trade.  He stated that when seeking election we said that we were going to increase the foreign markets and to hold our grip on them.  I daresay we said that we would hold our grip on the foreign markets and extend them.  Perhaps we went so far as saying that we would extend outside <Col N="1018" /> Great Britain or that we would have alternative markets, if necessary.  We expected when we came back as the Government of the country to have a little bit of latitude and to settle down to work on these schemes, but we were hit rather suddenly by Great Britain with tariffs, and we had to turn our attention to the situation that arose as a result of these tariffs.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gorey asked us was it on my advice that our stock ceased to go out of the country to the foreign market in July last.  A great deal of the advice on the agricultural policy that has been adopted by the Executive Council has been taken from me, possibly most of it.  In any case, nothing has been adopted by the Executive Council with which I have not agreed and I am prepared to take responsibility for it.  It is rather an unfortunate thing that at a time when we are asserting what we think is a national right against Great Britain, and when Great Britain attacks us and puts on tariffs against us, that we have people opposite who are prepared to make any capital they possibly can out of any failures we may have had in fighting against Great Britain, instead of trying to help us on this matter of securing foreign markets.</P>
      <P>In this matter of foreign markets we do follow the prices as well as the Deputies who are talking here and who are prepared to be glad over what they thought were reverses on our side, but which did not turn out to be reverses at all.  We had the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; saying that we were turned down on the Continental markets.  The fact was that we had not been turned down.  As it was the first time that we applied for a quota for butter, the German and French Governments had to publish a quota, and because they published that quota the whole Press here gave that as a reverse against us going into the foreign markets.  Now Deputy Gorey talks about old horses or knackers going into Belgium.  He said that was the full extent of our success in getting into the foreign markets.</P>

When Deputy Hogan asked me yesterday about cattle going into the Belgian markets I told him that he might be disappointed about the success of that.

      <P>As a result of the British putting on these tariffs against us we had to meet that situation.  We did not want to see the whole burden of this fight falling immediately on the farmers of the country and we said we must try to take off some of that burden and to break the fall.  That is why we brought along bounties.  Now Deputy Gorey says that he knows that no advantage from the bounties came to the farmers.  I know otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bennett will complain about the bounty on cattle and pigs, but when the bounty on butter was introduced here he was very glad to welcome it.  We will have other Deputies who will complain about the bounty on butter but not about the bounty on cattle.  Deputy Bennett wants a bounty on a particular commodity but on nothing else.  The Deputy was most enthusiastic when we brought in a Bill giving a bounty on butter.  As the Deputies here know we have asked the exporters of cattle to send full particulars to us of any particular consignment.  In some test cases we have taken the precaution of finding out the price at which they actually bought the cattle and what their usual expenses are.  It is easy to find that out.  We found out what they got <Col N="1020" /> for the cattle when they sold them in Birkenhead and we find taking a large number of cattle that the entire profit got by these buyers was under 5/-per head.  The average bounty was 30/-and how can anybody say that the bounty was not an advantage to the farmers?  Another thing, any Deputy here can go and look at the prices paid at the Dublin and Birkenhead markets and he will find this out for himself. Anybody who inquires will find out that up to the time the tariff went on the usual profit was about 5/-.  The buyer evidently who bought the cattle in Dublin wanted 5/- higher price in Birkenhead to make the thing pay.  From the time the tariff went on until the bounty went on the buyer wanted 10/-and now what the buyer is getting is 6/-, so that the Irish farmer is getting 4/- a cwt. more than before the bounty went on.</P>
      <P>Deputies speak about this economic war being responsible for the prices. Anybody on the Opposition side who takes any interest in this question knows very well what is really responsible for the bad prices.  They talk about Government policy, but they have only to look at prices in Birkenhead and they will find that last week the price there was 12/- a cwt. lower than in the corresponding week last year.  The difference between Dublin and Birkenhead prices last year was 5/- and this year it is 6/-, so that the whole economic war really is responsible for 1/- of a loss in price to the farmers.</P>

      <P>The fall in the prices in England is responsible for 12/- per cwt.  Nobody can deny that.  If anybody wants to look into the price he can have these figures, and let him stop talking about what this Government is responsible for.  Deputy Gorey says that there is a loss of 20 per cent. through the tariff and 20 per cent. through loss of goodwill.  The 20 per cent. is responsible for only 1/- a cwt. on our cattle.</P>

I say that 6/-a cwt. is the difference between Dublin and Birkenhead markets, and if we have destroyed the goodwill for Irish beef in the English market we have also destroyed it for English beef and Scotch beef, because they have also lost it.  Deputy Gorey says that the result of our endeavours is to get something like a few old horses into Belgium, and Deputy Hogan says that when the prices come to such a state that it will pay to export Irish cattle to Belgium Irish farmers will be in a bad way because the Irish cattle will be competing in Belgium with old horses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>And have come out. Deputy Dillon spoke about agricultural instructors.  Personally, I was not aware that the agricultural instructors were treated in any sort of a distant way by the farmers throughout the country.  I know that in my own native county the agricultural instructor was consulted to a great extent <Col N="1023" /> by the farmers, and I thought that perhaps they were looked upon in the same way all over the country. It is quite true, as Deputy Hogan said, that these men, in the course of their training, get special instruction for the congested districts' areas.  In fact they do know a lot about the conditions there.  We have also overseers who are specialists in the problems that arise in the congested districts.  I do not know that it would be very practical to have demonstration farms.  We have, as the Deputy knows, gone in a good deal for demonstration plots, and in the matter of potatoes I think the instructors give quite a lot of help in the County Donegal and in parts of the west.  I understand that the people have availed to a great extent of the instruction given.</P>
      <P>The diseases in cattle and sheep that the Deputy referred to are very difficult to deal with.  I have already referred to fluke and tuberculosis. Contagious abortion has been a great pest in this country as in many other countries lately.  There is, as the Deputy says, a belief that if the beast is turned out on the grass its condition may improve, but that, of course, is a very dangerous thing to do.  That is true.  There is a popular belief in the country that what is responsible for the spread of contagious abortion is the scarcity of bulls.  The work done by experts in my Department, so far as it has gone, proves that that is absolutely without foundation.  They say that is not the case at all, but that the disease is spread from cow to cow and never through the bull.  We do, perhaps, require some propaganda on this question.  There are leaflets on the question available for anybody who wishes to apply for them.  Personally I am of opinion that, from the veterinary point of view, there should be some more research in regard to this, to see if it is possible to get an effective cure, or at all events get nearer to some remedy for the disease. As to what the annual loss is we have never been able to make out what that might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1024" /> With regard to the premiums for bulls which was referred to by Deputy Dillon and also by Deputy Hogan, I am not in a position at the present time to express an opinion on it.  The question has not come before me yet. I know that in some counties there is a belief that the Department is too restrictive on the Herefords and Polled Angus.  There is no doubt, however, that if the number of Herefords and Polled Angus were increased the breeding of cattle would get so mixed that it would certainly be very difficult to get good dairy cows, whatever the beef qualities of the cattle might be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan started off in a very sensible mood by saying that it is better to give our schemes a chance as it is about the only way of seeing whether we are right or wrong. We have all sorts of prophecies as to what is going to happen if we try to grow wheat in this country.  It is difficult for me to argue against the prophets as it was difficult for Deputy Hogan, ten years ago, to argue against the prophets on his Live-Stock Breeding Acts.  I think the Deputy adopted a very sensible attitude when he said that we should get a chance to try the wheat scheme and see what is going to be the result.  I did think, however, that the question of wheat and the mixing of cereals and so on would not be discussed to any great length at this stage but rather on the Second Reading of the Bill which is to come before the Dáil in a week or two.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan said that the subsidising of heifers is a Fianna Fáil sort of scheme because, he said, we are giving out the heifers to people and asking them to get two solvent sureties to sign, knowing very well that we are never going to get the money back.  That is the sort of slander on the Irish people that is thrown at them by Deputies on the other side of the House: that an Irishman never pays his debts even though he signs an undertaking and gets two sureties who undertake to pay if he cannot.  The Deputy's point was that such people have no intention of paying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister missed my <Col N="1025" /> point.  What I said was that it was a pity that you had two solvent sureties: that that took the good out of it.</P>

      <P>But if we fall out with the Britisher, then we are told that we are falling out with the most honest man in commerce that has ever lived. We hear too from the Opposition about the way we are losing our best market, of how we are losing John Bull who has been a friend of this country for so long and all that sort of thing.  It is extraordinary the way that he can be held up as such a model of perfection in this House as compared with the ordinary Irishman.  Deputy Hogan says that we ought to get a chance to test it for two years.  The Deputy may rest assured that we will, and for a very much longer period than two years in spite of the Opposition Party and of Deputy MacDermot's new Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if there was anyone ever so foolish as to say that by putting a tariff, say, on butter you are going to raise the price of butter over the whole country and throughout the whole year.  The tariff on butter certainly had a good effect for a part of the year.  I do not know if anyone would say that a tariff on the surplus oats we had to export would raise the price over the whole country and throughout the year.  We feel, when it is so difficult now to get a foreign market in England or anywhere else, that it would be a rather foolish thing for us to be buying beef from the <Col N="1026" /> Argentine, mutton from Australia, butter from Denmark while we find it so hard to export something else in order to get the money to pay for these imports.  We think, as regards anything that we have enough of ourselves, that we ought to shut out the foreign imports and do with what we have.</P>
    <P>There was mention by Deputy Hogan also about beef &mdash; that although we put an embargo on beef coming in here, the price of beef was 22/- a cwt., and he asked had the tariffs increased prices&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan (Galway) Mr. Hogan (Galway)">

It is absolutely ridiculous to make such a statement.  Anyone who looks up the market prices, if both tariff and embargo were taken off the prices, would know what the prices are.</P>

      <P>You must be reading them upside down.  Then he came on to speak of cattle for the Belgian market.  He said that if there was a market for cattle in Belgium and that this thing were paying, you would have plenty of enterprising men in the Dublin Cattle Market ready to go into this business.  You would; but they would come in and go out again.  They would come in and go out according as it suited them.  Would it not be better if you had the position where you could go in and stay in all the time and make it pay?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I will make it pay.  Deputy Hogan also asks me am I going to let these first class schemes in the Department of Agriculture remain, and not upset the schemes of the Department by experimenting. There are good schemes in the Department of Agriculture &mdash; we all know that &mdash; and there is absolutely no danger that these schemes will be prevented <Col N="1027" /> from going on.  The Deputy also said that the Live Stock Breeding Act had improved our cattle to a great extent. There is a rather simple test of that. If you find out the average weight of one and two year olds in 1921 and the present year, and it works out at an improvement of 7 per cent, that would show a considerable improvement. That is not a very scientific test, however, because there may be many cattle passed between one and two years old one year, that might not do it again.  Whether this is due to the Live Stock Breeding Act is rather difficult to decide.  Part of it may be due to the changed system of feeding young cattle earlier now in an effort to get them out earlier and have them matured earlier.  Deputy Hogan more or less made a joke of my fight with the British all the time, but as long as I know the Deputy that has always been a joke with him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, let us say eleven years.  Deputy Roddy wants to know what is our agricultural policy.  I did not think it necessary to talk about the present prices in the country because it seems that there is to be a time set for that.  I did not think it was necessary either to talk about cereal production since that also will be coming on next week.  We were told that some Minister made a statement that the farmers' land may be confiscated if they do not conform with the Government policy.  I made a statement something like that myself. I said that if they did not pay their land annuities according to law, their land would be taken from them.  That is not Government policy, however. That is the law.  There is a lot of talk about the present Government policy, but suppose that by any chance the country had had the misfortune to return Cumann na nGaedheal at the last <Col N="1028" /> election, would the farmer be getting better prices for his produce?  He would be getting 106/- for his butter on the British market.  That is exactly what he would get if there were no tariff or bounty.  We are giving him 117/- at the creamery.  That is one thing better for the farmer at any rate, and that is because Fianna Fáil is here and Cumann na nGaedheal is not here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>You admitted that that policy did not improve on the policy of the late Government except in so far as it compelled the farmer to do what he could have done himself. The Minister admitted that to me in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  That is, if every farmer had taken advantage of the machinery; but if you ask Deputy MacDermot about it he will tell you that you will never get the farmers to combine in that way.  Because we are here, they are getting 11/- on their butter more than they would get if we were not here.  We will leave out oats, but take the question of cattle.  I say that if Cumann na nGaedheal were here instead of us, the farmer would be getting 1/- a cwt. more and only 1/-, but put that against 11/- more for his butter.  Pigs would work out at 2/-a cwt. more and sheep at a little more also.  I do not think there is a great deal of difference between us.  I think that the farmer is just as well off as if Cumann na nGaedheal were here and there were no such thing as an embargo or a boycott of British goods.</P>

      <P>Well, I think, £3,000,000. Somebody &mdash; Deputy Anthony I think &mdash; referred to a farmer whose losses would not be under £1,200 this year, and asked me how long that would last.  I know a lot of farmers in this country, but I am not speaking of anyone who can afford to lose £1,200 in one year.  I do not know one.  Perhaps I do not know the big ring that Deputy Anthony does.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>How long are those conditions going to last?  I say as long as we have to depend on the British market or any other market where the people cannot pay us for our stuff.  We cannot get over that difficulty, unless our bacon production goes down to the amount we can use in our own market, but as long as we have to export we will have to take the low prices, unless we give bounties, which are not in favour.  Deputy Anthony wound up with an oration which should have been addressed to the Disarmament Conference instead of to this House. Those are the only points I have a note of that were raised.</P>

      <P>On the question of the allocation of moneys set aside for afforestation work, I would like to draw the attention of the Minister, though I understand his attention has been already drawn to this matter in correspondence, to the fact that in several areas, at least three or four that I am aware of, at any rate, men have been engaged on this work and paid different rates of wages.  The question has been taken up with the Minister on the one hand, and the <Col N="1033" /> Department of Finance on the other, and the excuse given for paying wages at the rate of 23/- to one set of men and 28/- to another is that the money is money that comes out of different funds for this purpose.  On the one hand money is being spent out of funds for the relief of unemployment, and the other out of the Vote now before the House.  I cannot understand, and my colleagues cannot understand, why men engaged on the same class of work, working under the same ganger, in the same place, should be paid for the same kind of work at a different rate of wages, and I suggest to the Minister that he should get into early consultation with the Minister for Finance, because he appears to be the principal Minister to blame in the matter, and see that this matter is put right and that men engaged on the same class of work, working in the same place under the same ganger are paid the same wages. I hope in that matter also the usual rate of wages in future will be recognised that is, 25/- and not 23/- as is being paid in some cases.</P>

      <P>I want to make a serious complaint and a complaint which I have made for the past three or four years in connection with this Vote and that is the very small progress the Forestry Department is making.  If one judges by the time it takes to acquire land and the completion of all the formalities in connection with the acquisition of land there would be very little practical forestry done in our time, and another generation would have to complete the job.  I can see no excuse for the delay in the absence of any definite effort on behalf of the Forestry Department to acquire lands and to proceed with schemes of re-afforestation. It has been advocated as long as some of us can remember and while I appreciate the difficulties which must of necessity exist in the acquisition of lands, I feel that during the last six months a very definite scheme of re-afforestation ought to have been worked out, and the planting season, which will terminate about next March, ought to be fully utilised for the planting of suitable timber in <Col N="1034" /> various parts of the country.  This would seem a very useful opportunity for absorbing the unemployed labour in the country and for doing really practical work.  The money spent on bog roads and things of that kind gives in the end a comparatively small return, and the money spent in this way would in the end give a very good return and would be extremely useful. I hope before the Minister closes and before this Estimate is passed that he will give some indication as to the policy of his Department in this matter.  I have nothing but complaints of and dissatisfaction with this administration for the last three or four years, and I hope the Minister will give us some indication as to a change in policy and a very speedy change.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the district which I come from no man can be a ganger except a man nominated by the County Surveyor? Is he aware that Fianna Fáil have clubs there and meet there on Sundays to decide who should be the people who should work on these works during the week?  Is he aware that a number of outdoor relief cases have been deprived of work?  If there is an inquiry I can prove these things to the hilt, and I ask the Minister, perhaps he is not aware of it and I am sure he is too much of a gentleman to allow it, to look into these matters.  As I say, the thing is a gross injustice in a poor district.  In one case I had to turn round and get a Home Assistance Officer and Superintending Officer to get people on work where they were refused by the Chairman of the County Council.  Whether we call ourselves benefactors or something of that kind, I say we are not worthy of being on the Council if we permit the present state of affairs to continue.  At the present day, the Chairman of the County Council can say, &ldquo;We are the men who have to decide who will be ganger or who are the men who will work on the roads.&rdquo;  I can prove up to the hilt where men with £500 or £600 have worked on the roads, not as gangers either but as labourers.</P>

      <P>I briefly wish to direct the attention of the Minister to the delay in taking over certain lands in my constituency which have been given over for afforestation.  There is no better means of relieving unemployment at present than by taking over these lands and employing labourers in planting them.  They would be a big national asset and could quickly be converted into money in the course of time.  I would ask the Minister to expedite the taking over of these lands and also to utilise lands in the hands of the Land Commission where they are available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add a few words on the point raised by Deputy Davin.  I am sure that Deputy Davin is quite correct in the point he made in regard to differentiation in wages.  I do not want to blame the present Minister for that differentiation.  Even under his predecessor, we had as much as 30/- per week paid in one area and as low as 23/- or 20/- paid in other areas. When the matter was raised in former years on this Estimate we were told by the then Minister that the rate of wages was based on the agricultural wage in the district.  I want to know from the Minister if that policy is still being carried out and if he is going to carry that policy to its logical conclusion.  I hope he is not. I cannot see why, say in Tipperary, where I must say a good deal of work is being carried on by the Department under this Vote on hills which run into Waterford, the workers should <Col N="1036" /> get more or less than the workers in Waterford engaged on the same work. I certainly cannot see why men engaged on this particular scheme who have to travel five or six or, as far as eight miles, to and from their work, should in many cases get a lower wage than men who have to travel say only one mile.  I should like to hear the Minister on the point as regards differentiation, and also to hear from him whether he or his Department has any really national scheme of afforestation in hands.  From year to year, certainly for six or seven years on every Estimate we were told by the late Government that they had a scheme of afforestation, that they were considering it and that it was going to be put into operation.  Here we are now in 1932 just as far from dealing with afforestation in a proper manner as we were six or seven years ago.  I should also like the Minister to tell us, if he has the details at his disposal &mdash; it is probably hardly fair to ask him at the moment &mdash; of the work which has been done in County Tipperary during the last year and what work he proposes to do in the coming year.  If the Minister has not that information at hand I do not wish to press him, but I should like to emphasise the point that in my opinion there is no work which is more useful from the point of view of giving employment and certainly no work that is more useful from the point of view of the nation.  I should like if the Minister would give a good deal of attention to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say without commenting in any way on certain other schemes with which the Minister is dealing and to which perhaps he has given priority over this question of afforestation that, in my opinion, given for what it is worth &mdash; it may not be worth very much &mdash; a really national scheme of afforestation would be much more useful to the nation, and would give much more employment than many of the schemes he has in hands at the moment.  I suggest that he should consider the matter from that point of view.  In regard to the question of wages I would suggest to the Minister that whatever he or his Department <Col N="1037" /> may decide upon as a maximum or a minimum wage for this national work, we should not have district wages fixed for national work.  If it is national work there should be a national wage.  In view of the pro-nouncements of the Minister and his colleagues&mdash;I do not want to par-ticularise at the moment&mdash;I think he should fix the maximum wage established by the late Government as their minimum, not only as local wages but as a national scale.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to call the attention of the Minister to what I might describe as the unfair delay in taking over the lands for the purposes of afforestation.  There are lands at Glenville which have been considered by the Department for afforestation purposes for twelve months and there is not a move yet.  I refer to the lands of Mr. O'Driscoll.  I should like in particular to re-echo the statement made by Deputy Davin and by Deputy Morrissey in regard to wages. I do not know what drove the present system into the heads of this Department. I know a very bad example was shown by the last Executive Council in the matter of wages.  I do not think that statement made by the local Farmers' Union as to the wages they can afford to pay their farm labourers should be taken as a standard by any Department in the payment of wages. I think the very idea of asking men to work at 23/- a week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is scandalous.  I suggest to the Minister that he should fix a minimum wage of at least 30/-per week.  I will certainly say that the minimum wage should be higher than the maximum fixed by the late Minister for Local Government.  Farm labourers in my district are paid from 30/- to 35/- per week.  I would not accept the croaking of Farmers' Union men on this subject, men who hire one man for a fortnight in the harvest and talk about it for eleven and a half months afterwards.  I would not take their croaking as a guide in fixing a rate of wages, because that means a scandalous rate of wages in some cases.  I consider enough has <Col N="1038" /> been said upon this matter.  I know the mind of the Minister and I am sure he will rectify matters at once. I urge him to speed things up.  There seems to be some branch of his Department that has gone to sleep, and if he does not wake it up we will have to do so ourselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to endorse the complaint of the various Deputies who spoke in regard to the low rates of wages paid for forestry work.  I agree that a national wage should be fixed for work of this kind, because forestry is a national asset.  Work of this kind will bear fruit, in the near future, and one would expect that the Government of the country should set a headline for employers in the matter of wages.  But apart from wages, the conditions under which some people engaged in forestry are compelled to work are absolutely ridiculous.  I know places where men come on for their day's work at 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning, and just because the ganger does not happen to be there, and because it began to rain an hour or two afterwards, these men were told to go home and were not allowed any wages for that day.  Such things as that should not prevail, and where they do prevail they should be stopped.  The Forestry Department should investigate complaints of that kind, and if they do I am prepared to lay a case before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what is being done, so far, in regard to the planting of the Forth Mountain in Wexford.  For some years past this matter has been raised both by myself and the present Minister for Agriculture before he became Minister. Certain defects were always pointed out.  We were told that it was not possible to have this place cleared until the Forestry Act was passed.  We have had the Forestry Act now for the past two or three years and still very little has been done on the Forth Mountain.  The Minister knows the country, and the necessity there is for work, owing to the number of people unemployed.  I suggest that he should get something done with greater speed than has been shown in the past.  A little has been done in the way of <Col N="1039" /> fencing, and things of that kind, but unless some move is made in the future little planting will be done this year.</P>
    <P>There is another place in my constituency fit for afforestation to which I wish to call attention, and that is the Bunclody estate in the north part of Wexford.  Prior to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party going out of office attempts were made by the officials of the Department of Agriculture to acquire land there.  At that time it was impossible to get the owners to sell. Now I understand the land is available, and I urge upon the Minister the necessity of having inspectors sent down to have this land taken over.  There are large numbers of unemployed people in that district, and by setting work going there, he will do a great deal to relieve the situation.  I would urge the Minister to have an inquiry made into the conditions that prevail for forestry workers and, above everything else, to have a wage established that could be looked upon as a national wage for doing work which is going to prove a national asset.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKilroy" hpid="Mr. Kilroy Mr. Kilroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the Minister of something of which I am sure he is well aware, and that is, that for some years there has been an afforestation scheme in the country to which there is allocated a certain sum of money.  All during the years since I came into the Dáil I have been advocating the planting of waste land in West Mayo.  There are about a dozen areas in West Mayo that could be easily secured for afforestation purposes.  Every year they are becoming more easy to secure because of the falling off of the market for cattle. Some years ago there was an enhanced price for cattle raised on the mountains, as stores, for fattening on better land.  Now the markets have fallen to such an extent that it is not a profitable industry, and, therefore, the people owning those mountain lands have practically no use for them. I would remind the Minister that there is no difficulty in securing far more land than he can plant.  He could easily spend all the money voted on the mountain districts in Mayo, if he would cover the areas there procurable <Col N="1040" /> for afforestation.  There is scarcely any way, in the West, that he could more profitably expend money, because once the scheme is started there would be an outlet for the employment of thousands of unemployed men, most of whom are migratory labourers.  They went to England and Scotland in past years.  Those who have gone across this year are appealing to their friends to send them money to take them home from the potato and harvest fields of England and Scotland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Because these labourers cannot acquire work on the other side, I would remind the Minister of the extreme necessity of finding work for them here which would be of much more profit to the nation.  If afforestation is taken up, and work found for those men, tree-planting work can also be found for a great many others. There is the work of clearing and fencing, transplanting, and all that kind of thing.  Very few industries would give more employment than afforestation. Therefore, I would impress upon the Minister the need of taking up this particular industry and acquiring a portion of the waste lands in Mayo in order that we may secure some measure of employment at least for the people in those districts who have at present nothing to fall back upon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is going to continue to pay the wages in this industry that the previous Government did, it would be almost better to let the men die without work than having them die slowly at the present rate of wages they are paid.  It is all right for some Deputies to laugh at that statement, but I would like to see any Deputy here having to travel, every day, ten miles to his work and ten miles back, handed a pound at the end of the week.  Sometimes men who travel ten miles to and from their work, having worked for two or three hours, get nothing at all for it.  It would be better to have no work than that the Minister should stand for murder in the name of such work, for that was what the late Government did.  It was nothing but wholesale <Col N="1041" /> murder to ask men to travel twenty miles each day in the country and hand them a pound as wages at the end of the week.  It is the wage question I am speaking of now entirely.  I want to see industry established throughout the country, but if the Minister stands for the rate of wages paid to labourers during the last eight or nine years to men working in all classes of weather, he is not fit to be Minister for Agriculture. I say that without any hesitation, having regard to the wages paid during the last seven or eight years. Thirty shillings has been mentioned, but you would get that for walking the streets.  If a man is working, then pay him a decent wage.  I hope the wages will not be less than £2 per week at least.  If I am in the House when this Vote comes up again, and a fair and proper wage is not being paid, I shall oppose it for all I am worth.</P>

      <P>A suggestion has been made to me which I should like to pass on for what it is worth.  It is small in itself, but it may be useful.  There was a time here when an Arbor Day was held each year and, by voluntary co-operation on the part of the people, trees were planted all over the country. The suggestion is that the Forestry Department should encourage the holding of an Arbor Day again.  In a particular district the number of trees planted would be small, but scattered all over the country they would altogether come to quite a good number, by getting the people interested to co-operate and plant trees as has been done in other countries.  It does not mean a great deal, but it would be useful in some places and might help to create a new interest in the growing of trees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the question of afforestation in Kerry, particularly in the south and west.  The Kerry County Committee of Agriculture have put forward a scheme, but the principal matter that will operate against it is that unless there is an area of several hundred acres the Department will not consider a scheme.  In certain parts of Kerry that will operate against us, because at the outset from <Col N="1042" /> 100 to 150 acres of land would be the approximate area for which schemes could be put forward.  I would ask the Minister, when considering that scheme of afforestation for Kerry, to give attention to that point.  There is another important matter.  In certain parts of the county plots of land are in the hands of the Land Commission which are more or less commonages which are not being utilised.  If a scheme could be devised whereby the Department of Agriculture could get the title of these plots transferred we could carry out afforestation schemes and it would provide a workable solution of the problem.  I would impress on the Minister the necessity for giving this question consideration so far as Kerry is concerned.  As other Deputies have said, we have heard a great deal about afforestation schemes in the past, but nothing has been done. I can assure the Minister that as far as Kerry is concerned we will do everything possible to put schemes forward, and it will be up to the Department to see that they get the consideration they deserve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked certain questions by different Deputies.  With regard to our policy in connection with forestry, there is no limit to what we are prepared to plant provided we get the land on certain terms.  I do not know what the limit may be under our scheme until I find out how much land we can get.  We will take all the land offered to us for afforestation on certain conditions.  The first is that the land is suitable for planting.  That knocks out quite a lot of land.  Quite a lot of the land offered is not suitable for planting because it is either barren mountain or bog.  If it is suitable for planting we are prepared to take it. We must get it, however, at a fair price, which is usually not very difficult. Price is not the big difficulty as a rule.  The next condition is that we must get it in certain sized lots.  In starting a new forest it appears to be very uneconomic to start with less than 350 acres.  Deputy Flynn mentioned that the Kerry County Committee were anxious that we should take on 100 or 150 acres.  If there were <Col N="1043" /> three lots of 150 acres close together it might be possible to take them on, provided the boundaries were not too long, as fencing would be rather difficult. On the other hand, the supervision, of course, would be all right in that case if the three lots were close together and made up 350 acres between them, or if there was a lot of 100 or 150 acres close to an existing forest it could be taken over.  If we get suitable land for planting in suitable sized lots and at a price we can pay, we are quite prepared to take all the land offered to us.</P>
      <P>At the present time we are examining in the Department all the land that has been offered to us to see how much we can take over and how much is fit for planting.  After that we mean to make a sort of quick survey of the country to see how much we can expect to get in the years to come.  It is only after that that we will be in a position to say what our policy is going to be, whether we are going to plant in future 5,000, 10,000, 20,000 or 50,000 acres in the year.  We cannot make up our minds until we know what land we can get and at what price.  I do admit that it is one of the best means for giving employment in the way of relief.  It does give employment, particularly in the winter, and in the rural areas where it is badly wanted in many cases.  With regard to wages, when we took over office there was a complaint made to me from a few centres that some men were being paid 28/- per week and others 23/- and 24/-. When I inquired into that I found that the regular forestry workers were getting 28/- and those taken on for relief schemes 23/- or 24/-.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  That was when we came into office.  The Deputy will have to ask the Party opposite why that was done.  There is an interdepartmental committee which fixes those rates of wages and they do, as a matter of fact, I am told, fix different rates for different counties.  However, the particular complaint made to me at that time was that there were two lots of men, one lot working at <Col N="1044" /> 28/- and the other at 24/-.  I succeeded in getting that matter put right after some time.  That matter was made right probably about May last and up to the present I have not received any further complaints.  We usually do not interfere in these matters when there are no complaints.  As complaints have been made to-night, I must examine into the matter again and see what wages are being paid.  I do not agree with having two rates of wages, one for regular forestry workers and the other for relief workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked about the amount of planting in certain areas.  Deputy Morrissey asked about Tipperary. There would be about 735 acres planted in Tipperary and Waterford this season, and on the mountain of Forth 162 acres planted this year.  The mountain of Forth is a rather difficult place to get going, but we hope to succeed in getting 162 acres planted.  We shall at least be able to plant this year, as in former years, 3,500 acres.  I think we may exceed that, but if we do not exceed it in planting, we hope to exceed the amount of work done in the way of clearing and fencing.  As to the delay in taking over land, which was the only other point raised, I am told there was land offered in East Cork and that there was considerable delay about taking it over.  There are very often delays and very long delays.  Sometimes, there are, in some of these estates, a variety of claims such as commonages, easements and so on, and it takes a long time to get over the legal difficulties and to get the land taken over.  Sometimes, we may feel that if we do not bite too quickly, we will get the land much cheaper than if we appear to be anxious for it.  I think, perhaps, that that would be the experience of anybody who wants to buy land or anything else at the present time.  If you pretend that you do not want the land at all and let them come to you a second time, you will get it much cheaper than you would have got it if you had taken it the first time.  The delay is sometimes due to the price asked and sometimes to legal difficulties, and, where we have been able to get over legal difficulties, and where the price has been fair to <Col N="1045" /> us, I find that the land has, in some cases, been taken over very quickly, and practically as quickly as a private individual could take the land.  Since the Forestry Department came under my charge, I have seen certain lands taken over as quickly as any private individual would be able to take them over, where we felt that we were getting good value and where we felt there were no legal difficulties.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister think it advisable to take over, for forestry purposes, in or about 600 acres of land adjacent to the agricultural station at Athenry?  I believe it would be a great help, because there are a number of students there from year to year, and it would be an education for them and they could probably spread the knowledge they gained there throughout the country.  I know that the land was inspected some years ago, and as to the reasons why the land was not taken over, I believe there was a price set on the land, which lies a mile or a mile and a half from the agricultural station at Athenry and is about 600 acres in extent.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £32,904 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1933, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including the Rates Advisory Committee and Sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>As Deputies who have studied the Estimate will know, there is nothing unusual appearing on the face of it. Salaries and wages show a reduction of £5,091 due almost entirely to a reduction in the staff of the Statistics Branch.  Travelling expenses show a small reduction and incidental expenses a small increase.  One of the other items that deserves comment is sub-head H which shows an increase of £1,458.  That is a grant-in-aid to the expenses of the International Labour Organisation and the necessity for the increase there arises out of the depreciation of the currency.  The Official Handbook for Saorstát Eireann published last year was an unusual item, and the sub-head shows a reduction of £3,540.  There are also three other sub-heads for which no provision has been made this year, the total decrease for the year being £8,641.  I do not know if it is intended to discuss this Estimate or if it is necessary for me to make any further statement.  I did not receive any intimation from any section of the House that it was desired to raise any particular question on the Estimate, but, if any questions are raised, or if there is a desire on the part of any Deputy to discuss a particular matter, I am quite prepared to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest in the general approach of the Government to the position of unemployment there is a certain amount of callousness being introduced, and a certain amount of that is also creeping into some of the answers given by the Minister to questions in this House.  I would like to raise a word of protest against it and to ask the Minister as far as possible to endeavour to avoid getting into that frame of mind because of the difficulties that are growing quickly around him.  The Government Press, a couple of weeks ago, treated people to a big heading: &ldquo;Two hundred less unemployed weekly,&rdquo; at a time when the number of unemployed weekly was <Col N="1050" /> rising very rapidly.  The Minister has created a position with regard to figures for unemployment that makes it almost impossible to use any of these figures.  We can, however, see the position with regard to unemployment in the number of persons who are approaching local bodies.  Even to-day we are treated in the Government Press to a description of a quickly growing industry.  The propaganda runs: &ldquo;On page 5 will be found a representative list of firms who are extending their operations.&rdquo;  Instead of extending operations, one of the principal firms that the Minister refers to is a firm that has fourteen out of its twenty machines idle at the present moment because of the general industrial conditions that have been brought about here.</P>
      <P>That callous type of propaganda is being spread more and more over the Government approach to the question of the development of industry.  So far as the Minister is concerned, I will refer to the answers he has given recently with regard to the Gallaher Factory.  Last week he quoted certain figures&mdash;58 men, 17 boys, 100 women and 88 girls&mdash;as representing those discharged as a result of the firm closing down.  The Minister takes credit for this, that the people who do not come to him looking for work must be employed.  A question was asked bearing on the offer he had made to the firm, that if they restarted their manufacturing process and within a limited period of time transferred 51 per cent. of their capital to Saorstát nationals he would give them a rebate from the date upon which they restarted.  When he was asked the reasons for making that proposal to the company and why he did not accept the proposals that were made in July last, two months before his proposal, he simply adopted the callous attitude of saying there was no difference between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to emphasise that attitude. First and foremost, when the matter was raised in June the Labour Party were quite clear as to the great damage that was being done this factory. The Minister could not see his way to take the warning then given that the factory would close down.  On <Col N="1051" /> 13th July a proposal was made here in connection with the Finance Bill that would have secured that if, within twelve months after the passing of that Bill, the necessary transfer of capital was made, the rebate would then be payable to the company as from 12th May, the date on which the new tax came into operation.  That was turned down by the Minister for Finance who said it was illogical.  Here is what he said:</P>
    <P>Possibly in eleven months' time he converts himself into an Irish company</P>
    <P>that is, Gallaher's</P>
    <P>and he is entitled to reap, under this amendment, all the benefits and advantages which he would have had if he had been an Irish company during the preceding twelve months. I think the Deputy himself will see why no Government could accept a proposition like that.</P>
    <P>The proposal made before the factory had shut down, that if they did transform themselves into an Irish company by a reasonable date they would get a rebate, was definitely turned down by the Minister for Finance on 13th July and he was supported in turning that down by all the Labour Party members then in the House, six of them.  When I asked the Minister what was the difference between that and the proposal that he made two months later, after the factory had been shut down, he said there was a difference, but he would not explain.</P>
    <P>There is only one difference and that is that the proposal in July was a proposal to do a certain thing before the factory had shut down and the proposal in September was to do the very same thing after the factory had shut down.  That was the difference between them.  Realising the difficulties the Minister is facing, and knowing they are real difficulties, I do not think the Minister is doing justice either to himself or to the people with whom he is concerned, whether they be workers or Irish capitalists, by simply trying to stick his fingers into the eyes of this House in the way in which on a few occasions recently he has <Col N="1052" /> attempted to do.  I will ask the Minister to face up to the real situation. Do not declare that there are people employed when there are not; do not boost the development of firms where these firms are working at 25 per cent. of the capacity at which they were working some time ago.  If mistakes are made, face up to those mistakes and see whether by facing up to them they may not be avoided on similar occasions in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister whether he has come to any decision with regard to the representations made to him on the question of coal delivered at the smaller ports in the country.  Representations were made to him that it would never be possible to admit to these small ports the large boats that would be necessary to convey Continental coal to this country.  It would never be possible to get such boats to go into the smaller harbours throughout the Free State.  In that connection it was requested that the tariff on coal should be remitted so far as these small ports were concerned.  I suppose that is hardly practicable, but the fact is that there is a rather anomalous position existing.  In Dublin they can get coal free from tariffs, but numbers of places throughout the country cannot get such coal and the people are compelled to pay the tariff.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister should be satisfied with that situation.  Whatever chance there was formerly of getting boats of such capacity as could enter these small harbours to come from the Continent there will obviously be no chance between this and next summer.  Is the Minister content with that situation?  Does he regard it as satisfactory?  There are certain ports in the country where the people have no alternative to tariffed coal.  In Dublin, Cork and other places they have an opportunity of purchasing Continental coal which, I understand, is now being sold at a lower price than British.  The whole situation in this respect does not seem to me to be satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good deal of truth in what Deputy Moore stated, that the small ports are being badly <Col N="1053" /> hit so far as coal is concerned.  In a great many cases large steamers are unable to enter these ports.  I have in mind the position that prevails in Wexford, where the harbour is tidal, and where boats drawing eleven or twelve feet of water can come in only at high water.  The result is that any continental coal for Wexford town is brought via Rosslare Pier, and the dock labourers in Wexford are idle for a considerable time.  Something should be done by the Minister to deal with that situation.  I think it would be well if he considered the advisability of remitting tariffs on cargoes brought to small ports, provided they came in ships owned by Irish owners. I would like to make strong representations in that connection and to join with Deputy Moore in asking the Minister to consider them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy suggested that some callousness had been displayed by me, or by the Government generally, in relation to the unemployment problem.  I think that charge is without justification.  I do not think it is possible for anybody occupying the position I do, and receiving the representations that have come to me, to be callous in relation to unemployment.  It is undoubtedly the biggest problem we have, and it is the undoubted duty and the responsibility of the Government to secure that it is reduced in dimensions as speedily as possible, and that every measure possible, within the resources of the country, is taken to ease the hardship that exists consequent on unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Mulcahy mentioned what he expected the Government to try to do in relation to unemployment and certain propagandist statements.  He referred to statements that appeared in the Press and mentioned the &ldquo;Irish Press.&rdquo;  It is undoubtedly correct that the figures available in relation to the number of registered unemployed, and the number of vacancies filled through the Employment Exchanges, have been <Col N="1054" /> misunderstood in a number of quarters, and not merely in the &ldquo;Irish Press.&rdquo; I refer the Deputy to the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; of yesterday, and to a number of British papers that circulate in this country, which published side by side the number of registered unemployed at this time last year and the number of registered unemployed to-day.  They published these figures without the qualifying note accompanying them that was supplied by my Department.  That is something more than a misunderstanding; it is deliberate dishonesty.  The Deputy knows &mdash;and I am sure the leader-writers in the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; and other correspondents whose effusions appear in the &ldquo;Daily Mail&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Daily Express&rdquo; are quite well aware of it &mdash;that it is not possible to compare the figures for registered unemployed this year with those available for last year, because they are compiled on an entirely different system, and deal with an entirely different situation. It is impossible to say what the registered number of unemployed this time last year would have been, if the same conditions for registration, and for the recruitment of labour on relief schemes through the Labour Exchange, that exist now existed then.  I have never attempted to minimise in the slightest degree the gravity of our unemployment problem.  I pointed out before that it is probably correct to say that 50 per cent. of those registered at the Labour Exchange as available for work are small landholders or persons with other means of livelihood who, although available for work and anxious to get it, cannot be regarded as unemployed in the ordinary sense.  At the same time we have to face the fact that the situation is possibly growing in seriousness.  It is the usual course that the numbers unemployed increase over the winter months.  That is why the Government has taken special powers in the matter of relief funds in order to provide that direct expenditure on relief schemes in the winter months is at the maximum when the condition of the unemployed is worst.  I think it is an obvious fact in the circumstances in which this country is situate at present, with the dislocation of trade <Col N="1055" /> which has resulted from the imposition of tariffs upon certain exports to Great Britain, that the steps that have been taken by the Government in order to reorganise the economic life of the country in the new circumstances must have caused certain dislocation, and that it will be a very difficult task to put the economic system operating here on a basis by which it will of its own accord be capable of providing a livelihood for all our people.  In the interval we must take special measures, and that is our justification for the large grants made available on the relief votes and the additional sums we are going to make available.  We realise that the resources of this country, and the ability of our people, to provide the means are strictly limited. Within these limits we are going to ensure, as far as organisation and direction of the national forces provide, that the degree of hardship which exists among the unemployed will be reduced to the minimum and that work &mdash;wherever possible useful public work &mdash;will be available to occupy the labours of those now idle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I am entitled to ask that we should not have, from presumably responsible newspapers, the exaggerated and misleading statements which appeared during the last few days. Figures were published which are calculated to deceive, because the necessary qualifying remarks which should have accompanied them are not given. My remarks may apply in more directions than one.  The position is that we have roughly 90,000 registered as unemployed; that probably 50,000 of these are small landholders and the like seeking occasional work on the roads; and the relief funds are so administered that persons getting work under them must get it through the Exchanges.  The operation of that condition has increased very considerably the number of vacancies recorded as filled through the Exchanges every week.  As I said, the average is about 2,019 in the last week for which the figures are available.  That should not be taken as meaning that the number of unemployed is reduced by that amount every week.  That is not the <Col N="1056" /> case.  That figure was quoted by me in a recent debate merely to demonstrate the fact that much more use was being made of the Exchanges than heretofore, when the average number of vacancies filled throughout the year was only 16,000 or 17,000.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Deputy meant by attributing to me some statement that appeared in the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; this morning, in relation to trade and industry.  If my recollection serves me right, the industry dealt with in that particular article which the Deputy spoke of was the readymade clothing industry.  I do not know what firm he has in mind which is working only to 25 per cent. of its capacity.  But I do know that if any one of these firms is in that position it is possibly due to some defect in the management.  There is no reason why any firm engaged in that industry should not now be fully occupied.  I admit that this is not the busiest period of the year, but the fact that a number of additional firms have come into the industry would seem to indicate that there is sufficient scope for additional firms in it.  Additional readymade factories have been opened. The same page of the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; contains an announcement to which he refers announcing the pending opening of another factory.  There are at least two other firms with substantial capital coming into that industry on a large scale and there is still room for further development.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make any controversial statement concerning the position of Gallaher's factory.  As regards the persons who were formerly employed there, and who are not now registered as unemployed, it is assumed by my Department and as a result of definite inquiries made, that most, if not all, of them have found employment elsewhere.  When I gave an undertaking here that every effort would be made by me and by my Department to place in employment those formerly engaged in Gallaher's factory, I took immediate steps to implement that undertaking.  Instructions were given in the Department that the ordinary machinery of the Labour Exchanges should be utilised in every <Col N="1057" /> way to place the former workers in Gallaher's who were available for work and in addition special representations were made publicly and privately by me and by the Department to individual employers throughout the City. I have no doubt that as a result of these representations publicly and privately made a considerable number of Gallaher's former employees have secured employment without the Labour Exchange coming into the picture at all.  I know most of them have secured work.  There is still a balance of them unemployed, but we are continuing our efforts and will continue our efforts to secure work for these people.</P>
    <P>There are other victims of the new conditions who have just as much claim upon the consideration of the Government as Gallaher's employees have.  I should like to refer, particularly, to those who were employed formerly upon occupations in the docks.  The volume of external trade has diminished and will diminish more if our protective tariffs secure increased production within the country. We are particularly anxious to ensure that those engaged in that work will get special consideration because, unlike the vast majority of Gallaher's employees, they are adults and heads of families and disemployment of these is much more harmful than the disemployment of a number of girls 16 or 17 years of age.  I do not want to enter into what must be an academic discussion as to the difference between the proposal by the Trades Union Congress and the amendment moved by Deputy Mulcahy in July.  In July on the day he moved the amendment there were available persons in this country who were prepared to invest substantial sums of money in the Gallaher industry.</P>

      <P>The question of coal was raised by Deputy Moore and Deputy Corish.  This question is, undoubtedly, a serious and difficult one. It is true that into a number of small ports small cargoes of coal were imported in the past from Great Britain &mdash;possibly one or two cargoes in the year.  It is not possible to bring German coal or Continental coal into these ports because the coal from Germany is conveyed in ships of a size too large to enter them.  We have been considering that question carefully and trying to devise some means by which the people there who were depending upon that coal for their fuel supplies might be helped.  At the same time even a cursory examination of the problem shows that it bristles with difficulties.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish referred to Wexford and to the position in Wexford.  The position in Wexford is that large quantities of Continental and also British coal have been delivered there. The price at which British coal has come and been delivered in Wexford is very slightly, if at all, higher than the price last year.  In fact the British coal exporter has met the duty either by cutting the price or by reducing the freight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite possible for the importer to buy British coal, pay the duty and sell the coal at the same price at which he sold it last year, and at a reasonable profit too.  I am aware that some of the coal importers are doing that, but some of them are taking advantage <Col N="1059" /> of the tariffs.  I hope to be able to deal with them.  There is a special problem of the small port as well as the problem of the small ships conveying these coals.  Both these problems are being considered at the moment. These are I think the only points raised in the debate on this Vote.</P>

When this tribunal was set up, the main and important function that it had to discharge was to fix the question of rates. The rates that it has fixed cannot now be obtained.

      <P>Apart from any other question, the tribunal, of course, is a statutory body and has to be maintained. The tribunal was established for the protection of the public.

At the present time the Railway Tribunal is occupied in considering an application by the railway company for permission to charge exceptional rates such as the Deputy referred to. The Railway Tribunal was set up by an Act of the Oireachtas, and until the law is changed it must be maintained. The tribunal fixed the standard revenue for the railway company and the charges to yield that revenue. <Col N="1061" /> Matters arising out of that will come up for consideration on the transport legislation to be introduced.</P>

      <P>The railway companies are satisfied that this tribunal is a hindrance rather than an assistance to them.  They have, as the Minister knows, to compete against road traffic. The rates for road traffic are not fixed by any tribunal.  I hold it is unfair to ask the railways to be handicapped in that competition by rates fixed by any tribunal, so that I say this tribunal is a definite hindrance to the success of our railways, as they have to compete for traffic under the circumstances I have stated.  Therefore, I think that under existing circumstances the tribunal should not be continued. Another function of the tribunal, as the Minister knows, is to see that the railways get a standard income.  Since this tribunal was set up the railways have never had a standard income.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this item of the Insurance Fund, I should like to raise the general question of the insurability of unemployed workers or employed workers.  First, I should like to refer to the position of seamen and of workers in the Border towns.  In both cases, as the Minister knows, efforts have been made over a long period of years to endeavour to secure reciprocity as between the Irish Free State and Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The late Minister for Industry and Commerce made efforts in that direction, and I understand that the present Minister has done likewise.  I should like to know whether there is any prospect at this stage that there will be any satisfactory outcome of these negotiations.  The position of the workers in Border towns, where affected by the fact that reciprocity is not available, is something that requires attention.  It may be that the British and Northern Governments will decline to arrive at any satisfactory scheme of reciprocity, but a time limit will obviously have to be put to the question of how long the State here is going to carry on its efforts to secure reciprocity as between the three Governments. If it is not possible, then I think that there is some obligation on the Minister's Department to devise some kind of scheme which will give to Saorstát nationals the benefits which they would get if there were reciprocity.  It seems to me that it is obviously unfair that people contributing to the Unemployment Insurance Fund, and placed in that position, should be compelled, when they are unemployed, to depend on home assistance or on the charity of their friends and relations.  I suggest that at an early date some effort ought to be made to get a reciprocal agreement between Great Britain and Northern Ireland or, if not, that the Minister <Col N="1067" /> should endeavour to devise, in the special circumstances of the case, some kind of machinery which will give some benefit to those unemployed workers.</P>
      <P>The other point I should like to raise is the question of the position of persons under the present Unemployment Insurance Act.  I understand that the Minister has discussed, with the representatives of the Irish Trades Union Congress, the question of amending the Act and removing from it certain very definite defects and blemishes which have been shown up in the administration of the Act over a number of years. Can the Minister give us any indication that an amended Unemployment Insurance Act will be introduced so as to remove some of the blemishes and make the administration of the Act much more convenient for unemployed or even employed persons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that I should like to raise, although I do not want to go into it in any great detail, and that is the question of the instructions issued by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in connection with preference for workers in works carried out by local authorities.  I can appreciate the Minister's anxiety to give work to the most needy persons.  If there is to be a famine for work&mdash;although why there should be such a famine if we have a decent social system I cannot see, but apparently we are going to have it for some time&mdash;but while, as I said before, I understand that he desires to give preference to those who are most needy, and I think that most Deputies would stand by that principle, still I am greatly afraid that the administration of his instructions is not working out as he anticipates.  For example, take the matter of registration at local employment exchanges. You can register by post, you can register at the Civic Guards barracks, or you can register at the Post Office You can write in to the local post office or the local Civic Guards barracks or wherever the employment exchange is, and, although you may have a pension of £4 per week, you can tell the local manager that you are to be registered for employment.  The manager has <Col N="1068" /> often never seen the writer&mdash;he may live ten or twelve miles away.  The local authority requires, say, 20, 30 or 40 men.  The manager sends a list of unemployed people to the local authority, and included in the list may be this person who perhaps is very well off in the circumstances, and who ought not in a work famine to get preference over other people; or you may have cases of people with very large holdings, who feel that they have some time on their hands, and that they would like to be registered for road work. They make application in precisely the same way.  The employment manager knows nothing whatever about them, and he sends them to the county surveyor, who probably knows less about them, with a view to employing them on the roads.  I would suggest to the Minister that this is not a case where the issue of a circular is sufficient.  I think that the Minister should amplify his intentions, and I think some effort, in the present unemployment crisis, ought to be made to give preference to the most needy persons.</P>
    <P>Certain difficulties have also arisen in connection with whether there is greater hardship in the unemployment of a married man, as compared with a single man who has, perhaps, a greater number of dependants.  That classification in practice is found to be very irksome.  I know cases myself where it has been interpreted, not in a commonsense way but in a very rigid way, and I think that this is a case also where the Minister might amplify his intentions and try to prevent local authorities from reading into that instruction things which I believe are not intended to be read into it.  There is certainly need for amplification of the instruction, and there is certainly need for ensuring, if we have a work famine, that the most needy person gets the work.  Of course, everybody would wish that we had arrived at a condition where there would be work for all, but since we have not yet arrived at that stage I think most people will agree that the work ought to go to the most needy persons.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I think, might reconsider that instruction which he sent <Col N="1069" /> out.  While the principles underlying the instruction are probably quite satisfactory if one hears a declaration of the Minister's intentions, still the interpretation of the instruction is far from satisfactory in many areas.  I think the Minister might look into that matter further with a view to issuing amplified instructions which can be interpreted in a commonsense way, and in the way which I think the Minister intends them to be interpreted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  I want to say, sir, that I wish to keep myself absolutely in order&mdash;even to bring myself within the Minister's idea of order. At a time when there is a greater demand upon this particular Vote than ever before, and when there are regulations issued under this particular Vote which were never issued before, I want again to congratulate the Leader of the Labour Party upon delivering the most moderate speech that was ever delivered in this House, when we have a greater volume of unemployment in the country than ever we had since this House was set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I hear, sir, an echo, not from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but from a member of the Labour Bench, that this Vote has nothing to do with unemployment. <Col N="1070" /> Well, there may be members of this House who can divorce unemployment from unemployment insurance.  I certainly cannot.  I was a member of the Labour Party from the foundation of this House until last year.  I had the pleasure of listening over a period of ten years to debates on this particular Vote, and I want to suggest that the Leader of the Labour Party, which represents the workers and the unemployed and those who are affected by this particular Vote, might have, and to my own knowledge could have, made a much better case.  There are many points which I could go into to-night upon this particular Vote, which I do not intend to go into for the moment, but I want to endorse the statements which have been made by Deputy Norton regarding the regulations made by the present Minister, and the instructions issued by the present Minister to the managers of the exchanges, with regard to the employment of men registered.</P>
    <P>I think we can take it that it is agreed, however unfortunate it may be, that there are more people to-day seeking work than ever before since this State was founded.  I, for one, am not going to say that the figures which have been compiled and have been issued are genuine figures.  The figure of 91,000 is not a genuine figure.  It does not show a genuine number of unemployed workers any more than the figure of 30,000 issued by the late Government, and we know that is a result of the present Minister's enthusiasm to get every unemployed person in the country registered.  I am personally prepared to admit, and to admit publicly, that the Minister's intentions were of the best, but he has succeeded in getting on the register of unemployed to-day persons who should never have been there. Deputy Norton talked about persons being registered as unemployed who were occupying decent holdings.  I think if the Minister were to get his figures analysed to-morrow, he would probably find that there are farmers holding anything from 20 to 80 acres of ground, and their sons, who are registered as unemployed.</P>
    <P>Let us take one district.  I do not <Col N="1071" /> want to take a town.  I will take the registration area of Ballina in Co. Mayo. It is returned as &ldquo;Ballina.&rdquo;  Some people, for purposes of their own, have taken Ballina as a town, and pointed out that the population is about 4,500. The number of unemployed on the register is 5,600 or something like that &mdash;I do not know what the exact figures are. In any case the numbers of unemployed returned for Ballina are about 30 per cent. more than the total population.  We know&mdash;those of us who have made any study at all of the matter&mdash;that when &ldquo;Ballina&rdquo; is returned it does not mean the town of Ballina.  It might mean a radius of anything from ten to fifteen miles of Ballina, but assuming that it meant the registration area of Ballina, from ten to fifteen miles, we still know that notwithstanding how bad things are there could not be as many as 6,000 people within that area who are genuinely unemployed.</P>
    <P>Now let us take the instructions issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  What are they?  They are much worse even than Deputy Norton says.  First and foremost, priority must in all cases, without exception, be given to married men. Now up to a point, and I think every member of the Labour Party will agree with me in this, that principle is perfectly sound, but I do not think you can lay it down as an absolutely hard and fast rule.  I should go further. We have a point laid down that those who are longest unemployed and whose names are longest on the register must get first preference.  Now, I think I can say&mdash;I want to put this forward so that I will not be misunderstood&mdash;that while we have a great number, and perhaps 99 per cent. of those who are unemployed are genuinely unemployed, we have also in this country, as well as every other country in the world, a certain number of people who are unemployable. That will be admitted from all sides of the House.  But under the Minister's present scheme the man who is longest unemployed, even though he is a man who does not want to get work, who perhaps is living on the earnings <Col N="1072" /> of his son or of his wife and who has been holding up the street corners for five or six years, must get preference over the man who has been genuinely employed and working for the last eight or nine years and, through no fault of his, has lost his employment during the last three or four months&mdash;that is one aspect of the case.  The other aspect is this, and I am sure it will be present to the mind of every member in the House, that you cannot lay down any hard and fast rule.  In some cases you have single men who have very many more people dependent on them, and who are much more entitled to get preference of employment than even married men.  We have, for instance, married men without any families who have pensions of anything from 5/- to 50/- per week.  We have single men who are perhaps keeping an invalid mother and three or four brothers and sisters.  I do not say that is very general, and I do not put it forward.  I say, generally speaking, the married man is entitled to first preference but we then come to a point: if the chief executive officer of a local authority wants to employ a number of men upon relief work on grants supplied by the Government, the old scheme meant, as Deputy Norton pointed out, applying to the exchange officer and stating that he wanted a number of working men and he would be supplied by the officer in the local exchange with the names of all the unemployed persons who are signing, and the county surveyors, or town surveyor, or borough surveyor, or private employer, would select from that list the men who he thought were most suitable to carry out the work which had to be carried out. That was the old system.</P>

      <P>I do not know, but if Deputy Norton wants to make my case <Col N="1073" /> difficult he can do so.  The Minister need not smile.  I am putting the case to the Minister, and I am submitting this point not altogether from the point of view of the unemployed, but from the point of view of getting some return for the money which is spent by way of grants, that if the county surveyor, or town surveyor, or borough surveyor wants 10, 20, 30, 40 or 100 men, the names are not supplied to him, but the men are selected by the branch exchange manager, and must be accepted, suitable or unsuitable, by the borough or county surveyor.  That, as far as I know, is the position at the moment.  Now, as far as I am personally concerned, and speaking for myself, personally, I do not care very much how the men or women get employment so long as they get it, but the last Government and the present Government for every grant they gave wanted to get, as far as possible, value for their money, and the great argument put up in giving grants by the last Government was that it could never get value for the money.  I want to suggest with all respect&mdash;there may be certain objections to it, there are objections to every scheme, nothing is perfect, I suppose&mdash;that if a local authority gets a grant for any amount you like, and if the engineer to that local authority wants 50 men, the reasonable and the proper way of doing business is to apply to the manager of the local Labour Exchange for a list of those who are registered and let him pick from that list the men who, in his opinion, are suitable men for carrying out that work.  Now, of course, if this be purely a relief grant you have no regard whatever to any return on the money you are spending, and it does not matter by whom they are selected. I should like the Minister to make this point clear: when the Government are giving grants, and if they want to get some reasonable return, I suggest the present system is wrong; and if the Ministry want to give relief without any regard to return it does not matter by whom the men are selected&mdash;I want to have that point cleared.  Unfortunately I have been unable to get in touch with the Minister's Department, <Col N="1074" /> and have not got the exact facts, but I am putting before the Minister and before the House the position as it has been put to me by deputations of unemployed in my own constitutency and I think it is fairly correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many other points I should go into, but I do not want to confuse the issue.  I do say, however, to the Minister, and I want to give the Minister full credit for trying to do his best to obtain the real figure in so far as he can, that the figure he has now got is almost as false as the figure that the late Government had.  I want to submit to the Minister that it is false in this way: he has not got very many of the genuine unemployed and he has got people registered who are not and would never be considered as unemployed under any scheme whatever. I want to submit and emphasise the point made by Deputy Norton, and I have personal experience of it, that so long as the Minister continues the present scheme, that is where people can register by post or can register in the local or sub-post office, or in any local Gárda station for employment, and couple that with the present system where the men who are required are supplied by the branch manager, the branch manager not knowing whether the men whose names are on the list are ordinary agricultural labourers, town labourers or road labourers or farmers with 40, 60 or 80 acres of ground, you will have undesirable results.  In many cases a man who is what we would call in my county a fairly substantial farmer gets a preference over a man who is depending absolutely on this work for his living.  If the Minister likes I can give him concrete cases.  I should like the Minister to take a note of that.  I think he has gone far to put men who were never in a position to claim employment under the old system into claiming it now as against genuine unemployed labourers.  So far as I am concerned, I do not accept as a genuine figure in regard to the number of unemployed in the country, the figure published on the 24th October any more than I accepted the figure published last March.  I do not accept the figure of either 30,000 or 91,000 as <Col N="1075" /> compiled.  So far as I know it may be 91,000, but I am satisfied from my own experience, and speaking only for myself, that there are many more unemployed now than there were six months ago.</P>

      <P>I intervene very briefly in this debate, not with the idea of criticising the work of the Minister or the particular Department before us.  I agree straight away, quite aside from political divisions or Party labels, that anyone dealing with a subject like this is entitled to get the assistance and the support of every representative of the people.  I merely intervene in order to make one or two suggestions, or, rather, to support suggestions to which I have already listened. As far as I understand the regulations issued in regard to these works, there is a rigid preference in the first place for married men and there is a direction that those longest out of work should then be considered. In theory I do not think anybody could object to that, but regulations, like many things that are reasonable and good in theory, in practice very often work out very harmful in their results. If cases are to be quoted, take the case of the man who does not happen to be married, perhaps for the reason that he has a mother and a number of younger brothers and sisters depending on him. He may have actually more dependants than a great number of married men who would get a preference under this rigid rule or the married man who gets a preference by virtue of the fact that he is married and not by virtue of the fact that he is in need of assistance. The married man perhaps may have a wife with an income of her own.  He may have a wife who is earning for herself and he may have no children.  I think the rigidity of that particular rule is doing an immense amount of harm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin is probably familiar with conditions in Portlaoighise.  I got a letter within the last week sent to me by some nineteen single men from Portlaoighise.  As far as I know, and as far as the statement went, each of these nineteen men had three or more dependants but they were all single. <Col N="1076" /> Every one of the nineteen men by that particular condition were in fact ruled out, even from the very hopes of getting work.  I think that it would be advisable to reconsider that particularly rigid rule and reconsider it along the lines of giving preference according to the number of dependants, irrespective of wedlock and irrespective of relationship. I think that is really what the Minister had in his mind when he made the regulation with regard to married men.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other condition, that those longest out of work must receive first preference, I think that is very discouraging to a man who has got periodic work year after year.  I think some particular preference should be given to a good worker, to a man who has done his job well year after year.  There should be some State recognition for work well done. The fact of a man having been employed last year and the year before and having done his work well, to the satisfaction of those paying him or to the satisfaction of those supervising him, should be recognised, but under this particular heading he is absolutely ruled out of work and the man who has not worked for ten years, perhaps, because he is a blackguard, perhaps because he is not wanted because nobody would employ him, that man actually gets a preference over the good workman who has given complete satisfaction year after year.  I could supply to the Minister the case of a man who has done periodic work, public work, for something like twentyone years under the same county council.  He has a sister and her three children depending on him.  That man has never drawn a halfpenny out of public funds except what he earned and he has been a worker for thirty-three years.  He has been a worker for thirty-three years that any public board or council would be proud to employ.  This year he finds himself in the miserable position of being confronted with the fact that because he did work for some years back he must take his place behind those who did not work.  Because he has four dependants depending on him who do not happen to be his own wife and children, <Col N="1077" /> he cannot get the same consideration as is given to his neighbour who has a wife but no children.</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey made a very strong case in favour of giving complete control to the county surveyor in selecting men for work for which grants have been provided by the State.  I am certainly not prepared to go all the way with Deputy Morrissey in supporting that claim. I believe, however, from what I know in my own constituency that this rigid regulation is being in some cases misinterpreted by some of the county council officials.  The reason I say that is that it is being interpreted by one council in my constituency in a different way to that in which it is being interpreted by the other council. I do not think that it was ever intended by the Minister to displace very good workmen who had been previously employed and who had given satisfactory service on county council work.  I should like to hear from the Minister&mdash;I feel it was the Minister's intention&mdash;whether it is right or not that this regulation was intended only to apply to employment on any grant that might be required in the carrying out of any additional works by county councils. It certainly seems strange to me, and I think it would be a very bad policy for any Government, to remove from employment on county council work, men who had been employed for ten or fifteen years and who, during their period of employment had given satisfactory service in favour of men who never had been employed on such work. Before, however, the Minister issues any new regulations in connection with the matter, I think he would be well advised to consult the Local Government Department or the officials of that Department.  I have reason to believe that they had been receiving a good many complaints in connection with the operation of the regulation. Speaking from the point of view of the ratepayers and the taxpayers generally, if a preference has to be given for employment on county council work or other public works, one can easily justify a preference <Col N="1078" /> being given to married men who have dependants provided they are suitable for that class of work.  It is certainly in the public interest and the interest of the ratepayers that employment on public works should be given to men with dependants rather than that we should have these men out of work and drawing home help.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into the matter any further only to say, that I believe Deputy Norton has rightly raised this question.  I hope the Minister with any information he may be able to secure as a result of his observation of the regulations, and consulting people in the Local Government Department, will find out where, and in what way, that regulation has been carried out in accordance with his intentions.</P>
      <P>One other matter I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that, so far as cases that have come under my notice are concerned, unemployment insurance benefit has not been fairly administered.  I have come across cases, in the last eight or nine years of my experience in this House, where workmen employed by county councils, for six or seven or eight or nine months, have been deprived of unemployment insurance benefit when displaced from their positions or employment under the county council.  If it is right and proper for the State, and this House, to insist upon the payment of unemployment contributions while citizens are employed in a particular kind of work, I think it is only fair that people who contribute to a particular kind of unemployment benefit should get that benefit when they become unemployed, and by that I mean displaced from their normal employment.  I have come across cases where some people in mixed employment have been refused when they made application in the first instance and where on appeal to the Umpire their cases were admitted, and in other cases disallowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only appeal I make to the Minister is to look into the administration of the Act from that point of view and to try and stabilise conditions under which payments can be made to those people.  My complaint <Col N="1079" /> applies particularly to part time workers employed by county councils, and to people, in some cases, who have small holdings, and who when they become disemployed are refused unemployment benefit although in a minority of cases the payment is made.  These are the only questions I wish to raise on this Vote.  I hope the Minister will look into them and have them considered very carefully and especially in the cases of preference for employment he will indicate in a clear manner to the local authorities the order of preference on these works.  I would strongly object to full freedom being given to county surveyors in the selection of people for any work.  I think it would be far better for the Minister to declare, in unmistakable language, the order of preference that he would like those officials should carry out in the employment of workers in the country.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to find that the complaint about the small landholder, who gets insurable occupation for some portion of the year, and afterwards reverts to his farm, has not stopped.  But I am amazed to find that after all the instruction Deputy Davin has received in the last nine years he has still the audacity to say that no unemployed in this class of persons get insurance.

      <P>We are told here of the small landholder, and Deputy Davin's complaint is that they must pay.  Why should they not if, when they come to what he calls their normal occupation, get insurance paid to them.  I put it to him it should be they must pay because, if they were the only class that need not pay, clearly it would be a stimulus to any local authority to employ such landholders to the exclusion of everyone else because they would not have to pay contributions for such people. The second arm of his argument is, <Col N="1080" /> if they are to pay; and I hope he will never ask that they should be exempt if they are to get insurance when they go out of ordinary employment.  We had it here that was in fact done.</P>

      <P>I should like them to be produced because they would be found to be misleading.  There is this system and a good system it is.  You have mixed employment.  There are certain people who do farm work and have farms but they do not give sufficient occupation and they work as county council workers when the work is given to them.  When they leave that occupation there is no rule forbidding any man to get insurance paid to him because he owned land; but there was a case to be decided.  If he came to look for insurance benefit, and the land which was his primary occupation gave him sustenance for that time, you would take into consideration the man's industrial history, the state of his work, the type of the land, what it would produce and so on.  And as I say in nine years I find one case brought to my notice amongst the many brought up, where there had been hardship to the smallholder and that case was remedied on the spot. If we are to have mixed employment in this country you must have this peculiar case occurring from time to time.  But such cases are open to argument here.  They can be brought up on motions for the Adjournment or they can be brought up by questions to the Minister.  It is open to have the facts investigated here in the House.  Mixed employment is not confined merely to farmers who can go out and work on the roads.  There are shopkeepers who come into insurable occupations for certain times of the year.  There are people who go <Col N="1081" /> fishing for certain times of the year and go into insurable occupations afterwards.  The whole has to be considered, in all the circumstances of the time, when a man makes a claim for insurance.  That is one point.  The biggest is how are we to get in the numbers of unemployed, and what is the result of the attempts made to get at these numbers.  Deputy Corish compared two figures to-night.  I think he should have compared three, and should have gone more into detail as to the three parties to be represented. There is the live register figure; it varies.  Deputy Corish gave 30,000. We will take that as correct for a certain period of a certain year.  What does that represent?  People on the register looking for work, available for work, or suitable for work and dependent on the work that they can get for their sustenance and that had to be tested according to all those provisions.  At least in the main they were tested out because there was a waiting process that went on.  In the census of population the figure 78,000 made its appearance.  That did not represent the figure everybody in this country should desire to give.  It did not represent the unemployed, dependent upon work for wages, who are able to work, who are suitable for work and who are available for work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That figure was totted up in answer to a question put in the census of population to state whether or not the person was at that date working or not working.  It included the Meath man in possession of 200 acres who had left his land. It included the contractor.  It included the small farmer who went on to the roads and was off the roads when the question was asked him. He said he was not working, meaning not working on the roads any longer, but having his farm to fall back upon for whatever it was worth.  You got that figure of 78,000 people who, at a particular date, thought they were entitled to answer the question: &ldquo;Are you or are you not working?&rdquo;  by saying, &ldquo;Not working.&rdquo; Whether it was from choice they were not working or from necessity or sickness, or because they were not at some one work, but <Col N="1082" /> had other work to do, the full tot was 78,000, and that was the biggest could be got.  If people believe that there was a sincere attempt made by a series of deductions and analyses over nearly two years to get from that 78,000 the proper figure&mdash;namely, the number of people who are not able to get work, although they are looking for it and need it and are suitable for it&mdash;then that 78,000 figure was brought down to the region of 50,000 by a very expert calculation which is there to be discussed and criticised, if it has not been correctly carried out.</P>
    <P>Recently we have got a new figure. What it is supposed to represent I do not know.  How it was called for, what the person was supposed to sign himself as, I do not know.  It would help to clarify our minds on the most important matter we have to discuss if we could get details of what was requested from these people.  The 30,000 live register figure used to be queried.  It was said that it did not represent the number of unemployed, and over and over again I said it did not.  I said it did represent the number of insurable persons who had become unemployed, and represented that with fairly good accuracy.  There was some number to be added for the purely agricultural labourer, the man who never engaged in any insurable occupation, and never got on the register.  I was told that even within the limits I had pointed out that figure was not correct.  I wonder why it was not.  We are told now that a new figure has emerged by reason of two matters: (1), it is easier to register; (2), registering now brings a better chance of employment.  I want to consider these two items.  Is it easier to register now?  The system at present, I understand, is that a man may go to a post office and register. What was the system before?  It entailed exactly the same thing: either going to a post office one's self or getting a friend to drop into a letter-box a particular communication.  All that a man had to do in the old days to register was to sign his name on a piece of paper and state he was unemployed. He might or he might not, as he liked, state what he had been <Col N="1083" /> occupied at previously.  He could fill that up and without a stamp put it in a letter-box, or get a friend to put it in a letter-box.  That was the system by which the register could have been built up and was to some extent built up previously.  Nowadays we are told of the great facility by which a man may register at a post office.  There is no difference.  We are told that there was no incentive to register before. I have repeated, and I am going to repeat every time that statement is made, this countering statement: year after year there was an average of 15,000 to 17,000 vacancies filled through the medium of the Exchanges and that that fact had got known through the country.  I have often said that if it was not a stimulus to a man to write his name on a sheet of paper and post it without any expense to himself to the head office in Dublin, knowing that 17,000 vacancies were filled annually through the Exchanges, then I feel that the unemployment he was suffering from was not worth considering.</P>

At any rate, was it a stimulus to a man to make him do what I have described that he might rank as the man who filled one of the 17,000 vacancies filled in any year?</P>

      <P>Two matters must be considered and were considered in relation to the live register figure I had.  I presume they are being considered <Col N="1084" /> in relation to the figures now being collected.  Some of these days we ought to be able to get either or both of these two checks on the figures. We carried out over a series of years two tests in the office.  One was in order to meet a Labour point of view that was constantly being expressed in the House that once a man went out of employment he never got into it again; that there was a limited pool of work; a certain number of people in occupation of whatever work was going; and if a man was unfortunate enough to get thrown out, his chances of getting into anything else were very remote.  The investigation we carried out disproved that.  We found there was what we might describe as a turnover in the list of those registered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing like getting concrete.  The Deputy did. We found there was a turnover in the number of unemployed on the register to an extent of as much as 80 per cent. in the year; that you had men coming on, going off, and coming back again. For anybody to say that there was a fixed unemployment of 30,000, on the old basis, with all the limitations that can be put upon it, is to argue something not in accordance with fact. There was that 80 per cent. turnover. We had even a further test.  There is a system in the Exchanges known as re-registration.  A man registers for employment and after a certain period he is struck off the list, or he might get his card and disappear from the list.  When he is off the list for a certain time, or when he has got his card and has ceased calling at the office, his name is wiped off.  When he reappears he is counted as a fresh registration or re-registration.  On one occasion I asked the officers of the Department to put this simple question to those who came to re-register in any year: &ldquo;Did you cease registering because <Col N="1085" /> you got work?&rdquo; I did not ask any other question, such as whether sickness came into it.  I wanted a positive answer.  The Minister has the record of that investigation.  He referred to it here.  It showed that an amazing percentage of the whole had, even in the bad season, even in the winter season, left off registering as unemployed because they got work, and the percentage that stopped registering because they got work is a very definite answer to the statement that this country had at any time as many as 30,000 people suitable and able to take employment and not able to get it.  I hope the Minister will continue both those tests. They were to have been done about the month of June, and, again, in the period between autumn and winter so that we might have again a test on the new figures as to how many of the people who fell out of registration this year did so because they went into work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another item that has got to be considered in thinking of unemployment in this country.  This country did not, as many other countries did, or, at least, to the same extent as other countries did, find women coming into occupations that previously had been reserved for men.  That happened in nearly all the countries which were in the big war, because, when the men had left, it was necessary that women should be brought into certain occupations that previously had been entirely occupied by and reserved for men.  It did happen in this country to some extent, and, in the 1926 census report, I tried to get an estimate without any great success; at least, I did not get one so accurate that it could be published and that the Department could stand over it, but there certainly is a very big number, a considerable number of the unemployed in the country at this moment who must be counted not as new unemployed if one looks at it from a particular angle.  If one takes as the test the amount of money that goes into a house, into a family per week or per month, we have got to conclude that, nowadays, what is happening is that certain men are now hanging around the street corners, obviously unemployed, and obtruding <Col N="1086" /> themselves on the public notice as unemployed, where, previously, it was the women folk of the family who were unemployed, but they did not obtrude themselves on the public notice because they stayed at home, and some percentage of what we call the unemployment problem at this moment is due to that, and that ought to be taken into consideration by those who want to get at the real figure of the amount of money now circulating among families in the country through work. And if they want to take the other side of it&mdash;what number of people who depend on wages of that type must get it through work and cannot get it, although they are suitable for employment and available for it, but find themselves stopped because there is not enough work to go around.  There are three tests, I think, for one side of the unemployment problem&mdash;the good side.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three points that arise on this Unemployment Insurance Vote&mdash;the debt of the Unemployment Insurance Fund, the contribution income and, arising out of both of those, the stamps that have been bought or the stamps that have been sold to workers who come under this Vote.  I asked a question to-day as to the total income of the Unemployment Fund for certain years, in order to get figures comparable, and I asked those who were replying to bear in mind that the rates had been lowered in 1931 and to estimate for 1931 and for the portion of 1932 in respect of which we could get any figures, what these actual figures might have been if the old rates had been adhered to, and I got a statement&mdash;I have not yet had time to analyse it accurately but, at any rate, this does come out of it that, as between 1929 and 1930, the contribution income of the Unemployment Insurance Fund showed a fairly big increase, an increase that probably was carried over beyond 1931 to 1932.  I find that the income for 1932, if one takes the percentage of the first nine months as equal to the percentage in any other year and multiplies it out to <Col N="1087" /> get the true total for the year, is likely to show also an increase over 1931&mdash; about the same increase as 1931 showed over 1930, and we had a Eucharistic Congress this year which put some people into insurable occupations other than those who were in in 1931.</P>
      <P>We certainly do not see in that table reflected in the income of the fund, the huge number of the employed about whom the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been so constantly boasting in recent weeks, and, when I take the other table, which gives me the indebtedness of the fund, I find that the fund in September in this year is in debt to the extent of £329,000 whereas on the corresponding date in 1931 the debt was only £297,000.  Now, we have got to consider what that means.  Deputies will know that there was very big debt on this fund, that it was being paid off very rapidly, and that, in the end of 1930, I came to this House with a Bill which, to a certain extent, funded the debt that remained to be paid, and established the contribution income on a lower basis but such as seemed to me likely to meet all the calls on the fund and to liquidate that debt over a period of about seven years.  That calculation may have been too finely made.  It may have been that, even in normal times, without the abnormal unemployment that is taking place at this moment, and the abnormal calls on the fund, we had cut that too fine and I would like to hear from the Minister on that point.  But, at any rate, instead of there being a reduction&mdash;and we allowed for a reduction, something, at least, about one-sixth of the entire amount&mdash;as between 1931 and 1932, we find that the debt is up by about £32,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, some part of that may be due to miscalculation at the time when we reduced the contributions, but I doubt if it is all due to that, and, if it is not all due to that, the only reason why the debt of the fund has increased in this year is because there are more calls being made on the fund.  If that is not the explanation, some other must be given.  The sale of stamps I know nothing of yet&mdash;we will get that some of these days, but those are really <Col N="1088" /> the only tests with regard to employment in the country.  The sale of stamps is an absolute test.  So many stamps sold mean, in any particular year, so many weeks or hours of employment, and, if more stamps are sold, it means more weeks of employment in the country.  There are the two factors I have referred to&mdash;does the income of the fund increase or does the debt of the fund increase?  We certainly have not, in those two tables, any reflection of the £32,000 odd that the Minister was boasting of having put into employment a few weeks ago. We have something to explain on these two tables about increased unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been asked, as a third item, about reciprocity.  That is only the harder road that he has to travel than the small landholder who is going to be brought to the fore again by Deputy Murphy and Deputy Davin, but the Minister held out hopes, when an early question was put to him in this House, that there could be a solution got to that problem.  He is asked about it and his first reply was that many claims had been considered but none had been found feasible&mdash;at least, none had been accepted, as such, and, then, he added that he was however, considering further alternatives to see whether progress could be made along those lines.  I asked the other day for information as to what progress had been made and I was told that there was none, and when I referred the Minister to the previous question I was told that the answer was comprehensive enough.  I take it to mean that the Minister has failed in these other alternatives&mdash;whether he has given up considering alternatives or whether he considered any I do not know, but I do know that none of them has borne any fruit.</P>
    <P>We are as far off getting any reciprocal scheme either with Great Britain or with Northern Ireland as we were before.  Except there is going to be a considerable money sacrifice on the part of the people of this country, I do not see how we are going to get very much in the way of reciprocity. Deputy Norton said that our <Col N="1089" /> people pay into another fund.  Of course they do.  Speaking quite frankly, I say our people draw out of a pool of work that surely, in the first place, belongs to other people.  These are the things that have to be balanced and, when he comes to balance them, the Minister will find that it is not as easy to get this scheme of reciprocal insurance worked out as he thought when he was in Opposition.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable need in this country to get a proper figure in relation to the unemployed.  But that figure should represent the unemployed under a particular definition. It should not represent people who are not working; it should not represent people who are employed for a time on some piece of work and consider themselves unemployed because they have to leave that, although they have something else to fall back on.  There should be some definite unemployment definition, such as people suitable for work or available for work but unable to get work.  I would add that they must be people who depend on work for their wages and sustenance.  It is only when we get a figure like that&mdash; and it is hard to get it&mdash;that we will know anything at all of the problem that faces the Government of the country.</P>
    <P>We have not helped towards an appreciation of the correct figure by having all this nonsense talked about an easier scheme of registration and the bigger stimulus there is to people to work.  All that is mere nonsense. There was a stimulus before.  All that was required was that a man should get registered in order to get employment. The stimulus, in my opinion, was sufficient.  Now we have this huge number to explain away.  There is the test that I have spoken of&mdash;how many of them are, in fact, dependent on new work, work other than what they have been engaged at and out of which they are earning wages.  There could be a further investigation into the unemployment lists for the year and into the number of people who have to re-register or who are discovered to have failed to register because they went into employment.  I suggest we should have some investigations along these <Col N="1090" /> lines and the Minister should stop talking about the big numbers he is getting into employment or is going to get into employment.  Heretofore he has talked in a fantastic way on this very serious subject and he should endeavour to drop that attitude and get down to practical work.</P>
    <P>I came upon another Fianna Fáil advertisement yesterday, one I had not known of.  It is probably one of those that are driving the Minister to distraction at the moment.  It certainly is not a kindly thing to remind him of, but I am going to do so.  This deals with employment:</P>
    <P>The protection of industries means more money in Ireland.  Money in Ireland means more employment. More employment means more buyers.</P>
    <P>There is a logical mind behind all this:</P>
    <P>Buyers mean more buying of Irish goods.</P>
    <P>And then there is the grand finale:</P>
    <P>More buying of Irish goods means more and more and more and more money in Ireland and why should it ever stop?</P>
    <P>That is what we have to consider&mdash;why should it ever stop?</P>

      <P>With a good deal of what Deputy Morrissey said, and what was said subsequently by Deputy O'Higgins, I am in agreement.  I am in agreement even with some of the things that Deputy McGilligan said. There is no doubt about it, the present system by which men are recruited for <Col N="1091" /> employment on the road and other relief work is creating very strange anomalies and considerable difficulties. There were more than a few cases of undoubted hardship created because of the manner in which the rule has been interpreted.  I think it was inevitable that that should be so.  It was also inevitable that the manner in which registration was made possible would lead to certain difficulties.  I am not advocating a complete change in the present system and a reversion to the methods by which the officer in charge of the road engineering department of the county council would have the sole voice in the matter.  I think the Minister should examine the possibility of having some kind of consultation or arrangement between the Labour Exchange offices and the County Surveyor.</P>
      <P>There have come under our notice in Cork cases of people with dependants. These people are unmarried and they are unable to get work.  The Chairman of the Cork County Council, a colleague of mine in this House, mentioned another type of case to me. That is the case of a married man getting on in years and not quite fitted for work.  This man is compelled to travel to work while two able-bodied sons have to remain at home because they are denied the right to work. That sort of thing could be ended by a fuller consideration of this matter and by the introduction of some regulation whereby an understanding could be come to between the Labour Exchange authorities and the county council officials.  Some of the Labour Exchange officers interpret the position clearly and wisely on the whole, but in other cases there is a rigid adherence to the regulation that creates hardships of the kind I have referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry to see that Deputy McGilligan, although free from departmental responsibility, is still unrepentant in regard to the manner in which the Unemployment Insurance Act should be administered.  I would like to inform him that there are still quite a number of cases of people who are regarded as not being employed and who are denied benefit.  In my <Col N="1092" /> own constituency numbers of such cases have come under my notice from time to time.  It is true there are not quite so many as there used to be. The fact is that Deputy McGilligan may rid himself completely of the illusion that all people who are entitled to receive benefit, receive it, irrespective of the fact that they hold small bits of land.  The bulk of the people on Bere Island have been from time to time employed by the British authorities. These are people who, in addition to getting employment at the military headquarters, have small parcels of land.</P>
    <P>I know of not one, but of numbers of cases of people who have been unable to obtain benefit, after completing periods of employment with the British authorities.  That was brought to my notice in a striking manner as a result of the closing down of the copper mines at Allihies.  A good many of those employed were the sons of small farmers and some of them were small farmers themselves, whose average poor law valuation would be £2 or £3.  They would rank in the same position as people in labourers' cottages and might have one or two cows.  People of that type are at a great disadvantage when endeavouring to prove their claims.  In Allihies and Bere Island people are seventy or eighty miles from the city of Cork and it is impossible to contemplate claimants, situated as they are, appearing before a court of referees and stating their case in an intelligent manner.  Much more consideration and sympathy should be given to such cases which are still occurring. It is time the definition of genuine unemployment was more generously interpreted than was the case in the past.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to another matter. The administration of the Unemployment Insurance Act could be very greatly improved if the Minister took into consideration, in the making of regulations, the question of making it possible for people who are in insurable occupations, and who through no fault of their own find themselves without employment, to draw more benefit than they are at present entitled to.  They are entitled to receive a certain number of days' benefit <Col N="1093" /> in the twelve months, but are debarred, in the absence of further insurable employment from drawing benefit for a considerable time afterwards. That matter should be remedied.  It is clear that where people have been in insurable employment for ten or twelve years, if they lose it, it is not through any fault of their own, as they are desirous of resuming work. They find that they are in receipt of 156 days' benefit and, at the end of that period, they have to wait for twelve months, if they cannot induce the local authorities to give them outdoor relief.  I hope the Minister will give an immediate decision on that question and see how far it can be remedied.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which the Minister might give consideration is the waiting period that people are compelled to endure before they receive benefit.  Take the case of a man who has been employed for a certain time and who loses that employment.  He has to wait six days before receiving benefit and, at the end of the week, if he finds employment for one week and again loses it, he is compelled to go through another week's penalisation in anticipation of receiving benefit.  Without contemplating any wide changes I think there is a case for an overhauling of that portion of the Insurance Act.  I suggest that minor changes might be made which would alleviate very considerably the hardships that exist, and I commend the matter to the Minister.  I think the Minister will agree with me when I say that Deputy McGilligan was not in possession of the facts when he said that people with a small amount of land and who eked out an existence on it when insurable work failed disappeared from the register.  They do not.  They remain still, and I consider that that is a distinct reproach on the administration of the Department and that it involves considerable hardship on deserving workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I have to say concerning persons in insurable employment, and any small owners of land, is that they are by law entitled to draw unemployment benefit when they are unemployed, and when they <Col N="1094" /> have the statutory number of stamps to their credit.  If they are in employment, and if that employment terminates, they are entitled to benefit for unemployment.  The only ground on which they can be refused benefit is on the ground that they are employed. That is a question of fact to be determined.  There is machinery by which an insured person can, if he wishes, appeal from the decision of the insurance officer to the Board of Referees. He can appeal further on the question of law to the Umpire.  If that machinery is wrong we can remedy it. If some more effective method is necessary it can be provided.  I am sure the Deputy recognises that it is a question of fact whether the person is unemployed. If unemployed he is entitled by law to benefit.  I still say that he is not deprived of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very important and I am very glad to get such a pronouncement from the Minister.  May I assure the Minister that it has not been the practice and never has been. It has been absolutely the other way about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The only ground upon which that person can be deprived of benefit is that he is not unemployed. If the insurance officer can establish the fact that the holding of land or other occupation which he enjoys employs him for the period that he is not working on a relief scheme, or something of that kind, he can be deprived of the benefit.  But, if genuinely unemployed, without work but seeking it, he is entitled to benefit and it cannot be kept from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put a case which has been raised very often which I think Deputy Murphy will bear out. Take the case of a man who possesses five acres of land, who has been at work on the roads for the months of January, February, March and April, and who may have four or five sons also employed.  If that man becomes unemployed in May and applies for benefit, it may be taken that in ninety-nine cases to one he will be refused unemployment benefit, on the ground that he has employment on the five acres of land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said that is a question of fact to be determined by the court established under the Act if the unemployed worker disputes the decision of the insurance officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nearly always decided as I say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no other possible machinery except the tribunal to decide the question.  The two main matters that arise out of the discussion are the regulations issued by the Department prescribing the order of preference when placing workers in employment, and the less important, but nevertheless interesting question raised by Deputy McGilligan, in relation to the figures now available concerning the number of persons unemployed. On the question of regulations I want to put this to the House. I came into office and I found that the employment exchanges were being administered for the purpose of confining employment to a small section of the community.  They were being administered for the purpose of giving employment to those who could be regarded as likely to be supporters of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  The order of preference laid down was that the first offer of public work was to be given to married ex-soldiers of the National Army; the second offer to single ex-soldiers of the National Army; and the rest of the population came after that.  That was the system in operation, and when we have Deputy McGilligan talking about the inducements there were to register, and the facilities provided, it should be borne in mind that no amount of registration could get over the order of preference that operated for ten years, and which found employment on public works effectively for a small section of the community.  That was the system in operation.  I came into office determined to end that system and determined to see that the only question that was going to arise in the selection of men for employment was their need of it and that no political considerations whatever were going to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I came in determined that by every means in my power I was going to eliminate the chance of political bias or <Col N="1096" /> favour coming into operation and I laid down a new order of preference. The intention behind the regulation was to secure that so long as there was not sufficient work for all, the work available would be given to those relatively in greatest need of it.  Our aim was to secure, when making a selection, that we dealt with the cases of the greatest hardship.  I want the defect in these regulations pointed out to me.  My intention was to secure that the work would go to those who needed it most, and if there is any regulation possible which will secure that in a better manner I am prepared to change the present regulations.  These are (1) that preference be given to married men with families; (2) to married men without families, and (3) to single men with dependants, and after that to single men without dependants. In setting up that order of preference there was to be taken into account the period during which the man had been unemployed.  Now we are told by Deputy O'Higgins that that was operating unfairly; that persons who got employment in the past few years are now put second to those who got no employment at all.  Well, I am prepared to stand for that.</P>
    <P>Those regulations only operate in cases where the State provides the funds, and we are giving to those people who are longest unemployed priority over those a shorter time unemployed. Deputy O'Higgins mentioned the case of a man who does not want work securing it.  If a man does not want work he does not register. The third consideration comes into action, and I hope Deputy McGilligan will bear this in mind.  The Deputy did not, however, wait to hear the fallacy of his argument.  The third factor taken into account is that work is given to those who are not entitled to unemployment insurance benefit&mdash; that it is given to them in preference to those who are so entitled.</P>
    <P>This is relief work designed to deal with cases of hardship amongst the unemployed. In the first category are married men with dependants; single men with dependants and married men without families; and those who are not entitled to unemployment benefit against those who are.  If there is <Col N="1097" /> another order of preference which any Deputy can draw up, and which will ensure as effectively that the work available will be given to those relatively in greatest need of it, I would like to hear it.  We insist in every case in which work has been given, that is, work provided out of State funds, that the workers would be selected through the Employment Exchanges, that the manager of the Employment Exchanges is to select the people who are to do that work and the manager does select these people.</P>

If the county surveyor or the borough surveyor were the officer to make the selection he would be bound by the same regulations as those which bind the branch manager.  He would be bound in selecting the men to follow the order of preference I have stated.  I have no objection at all to the county surveyor selecting the men, if the selection were left to the county surveyor.  The county surveyor could select any man he liked, if the selection were left to him, but <Col N="1098" /> there is no use in telling me that the county surveyor will not be influenced in this selection by political bias.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the branch manager departs from his instructions he loses his job.  If there are cases where these instructions were departed from I would be glad to hear about them. Complaints are made to me that the branch managers are not administering these instructions in the spirit in which they were drawn up.  One of the difficulties which the branch managers come up against in this new order was that they had no information in their possession as to the means at a man's disposal, unless they knew the man personally.  That applied particularly where the man was registered through a post office at a distance from the exchange.</P>
      <P>It may have happened that persons registered at the exchange owned land, sometimes quantities of land, whose wives had means or employment or shops or something of that kind, and these people were in error given employment instead of those requiring it most.  These things may happen without the knowledge of the branch manager.  I have no doubt whatever that such things did happen and that nobody was to blame for them except the fact that the information which would enable the branch manager to make a better selection was not there for him.  We have new registration forms.  We now require the people to give particulars concerning their means of livelihood and other sources at their disposal, and the period of unemployment.  It is on the information contained in that form that the selection will be made and also on the information given in that form that we will be able to make an analysis of the total figure which will be of considerable interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is, however, that while it is undoubtedly the case that if any general rule we apply is going to operate contrary to the intention behind it in any individual cases we have not yet been able to devise a better <Col N="1099" /> general rule than the one we have, or to get to a position where we could do without a general rule altogether.  If there can be any question of rules, if we should have such information at the disposal of the branch manager and he could be allowed to exercise discretion in the selection of the men for relief work, trusting him to select those who are in the greatest need of work, then we have an easier situation to deal with.  But that is not the position. <Col N="1100" /> That is why we have got to lay down this order of preference and these regulations to insure that the work will go to those who most require it, until the &ldquo;work famine&rdquo; as Deputy Norton calls it has ceased.  I move to report progress.</P>
