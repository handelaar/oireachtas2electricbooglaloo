      <P>It is proposed to take Item No. 2 on the Order Paper&mdash; the resumed debate on the Financial Motion by the Minister for Finance. Next week we propose to sit on Tuesday and Wednesday only, instead of Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.  We also propose to appropriate Private Deputies' time to-day for Government business.</P>
      <P>Ordered: That Government business be not interrupted at 12 o'clock to-day for the taking of Private Deputies' business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  The purpose of the Bill is to include the Newcastle Sanatorium amongst the hospitals benefiting by the Sweepstakes, in order to enable the governors to provide extra accommodation for the treatment of tubercular cases. Last year some 300 patients were treated in the Sanatorium.  It has now been decided not alone to treat pulmonary cases, but also surgical cases, and to extend the X-ray apparatus. Some thousands of cases from all over the Saorstát are treated in this institution.  It is necessary now to have extra accommodation for the nursing staff and also for the treatment of surgical cases.  The Sanatorium has at present an overdraft in the bank, and, unless some further assistance is given to it, this institution will be unable to carry on <Col N="2144" /> the good work which it has been carrying on for so many years.</P>

      <P>I should like to add a few words in support of Deputy Everett's motion.  Every Deputy must realise the terrible scourge that this disease, which this hospital is trying to fight, is in this country.  I am sure every Deputy has seen many cases of terrible suffering and deplorable loss to this country through this disease. Every Deputy, I am sure, will be only too glad to try and do something to fight this terrible scourge.  I have, therefore, great pleasure in supporting the Bill.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Ordered: That the Public Charitable Hospitals (Amendment) Bill, 1932, be referred to a Special Committee consisting of eleven Deputies to be nominated by the Committee of Selection; that the first meeting of the Special Committee be held on Wednesday, 25th May; and that the quorum of the Committee be five.</P>

    <Title>Financial Resolution No. 26.</Title>
    <P>The Dáil, according to Order, went into Committee on Finance and resumed the Debate on Financial Motion Number 26:</P>
    <P>That it is expedient to amend the law relating to customs and inland revenue (including excise) and to make further provision in connection with finance.&mdash;(Minister for Finance.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking the last time this Resolution was before the House, I commented upon the fact that the present Party in power had gone to the country with a manifesto framed to meet the different objectives they had before them.  The political one we had discussed yesterday; the economic ones are those to which I was attempting to turn the attention of the House the other day, and to which again I want to turn its attention this morning.  In a series of advertisements, Fianna Fáil had placarded through the country its belief in its own powers.  It added to a mere statement of these beliefs further statements to the effect that certain details had been scrutinised, <Col N="2145" /> and that therefore it was to be assumed that what was being put forward was not the ordinary rosy promise made on the eve of an election, but something founded upon facts discovered after serious and complete examination.  We were told that Fianna Fáil had a plan, and that that plan meant security for the worker, the farmer, the shopkeeper, and the manufacturer; that this plan, when divided out into details through these categories of the population, meant continuous, well-paid employment for an additional 80,000, and the ending of the downward pressure of wage rates produced by the huge volume of unemployment; a better standard of living; better houses, better food and clothes.  The elements of security for the farmer were: &ldquo;A guaranteed market and guaranteed profitable prices for a larger part of his marketable produce, increased competitive power resulting in increased exports.  It means giving Irish agriculture the chance it has not had since 1922.&rdquo; Meantime the shopkeeper was not forgotten.  The shopkeeper had his security divided out in this way:&mdash;&ldquo;Better trade, a larger number of customers able to buy the goods he has to sell; the end of the period of stagnation and depression which has ruined business for the past years.&rdquo;  For the manufacturer there was to be &ldquo;Freedom from unfair competition, a reserved market from which he cannot be driven, except through his own fault, a demand for his products that will enable him to work to the full capacity of his factory and thus reduce his costs.&rdquo; The summing up was: &ldquo;For all&mdash;it means less taxation, lower rates, better times&mdash;it means security.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wonder is it embarrassing to the Minister for Finance to have his attention called to what presumably he agreed to when the advertisement was put in?  It was stated that the Fianna Fáil plan meant, for all, less taxation. Have we got less taxation? It meant lower rates.  Have we, and are we going to have, lower rates? It meant better times.  Are they present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2146" /> I shall refer to another advertisement in which the slogan previously quoted was given with more detail. The item of economy was stressed particularly. &ldquo;Economy,&rdquo; we were told, &ldquo;means the elimination of waste&mdash;the getting of 20/- value for every £ of the taxpayers' money spent on the public service.  Fianna Fáil is satisfied that substantial economies are feasible&mdash;&rdquo; I want noted the conditions under which they were feasible&mdash;&ldquo;substantial economies are feasible without reducing social services, inflicting hardship on any class of Government servants, or impairing in the slightest degree the efficiency of the administrative machine.&rdquo;  Further we were told:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Fianna Fáil has examined with minute care the estimates of supply services for the current year, and is convinced that a saving of many hundred thousand pounds can be made, not including such items as the sum of £1,152,500 paid to the British Government in respect of R.I.C. pensions, and other similar payments not required by the Treaty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was summed up in this way:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The burden of taxation can be lightened by not less than £2,000,000 per year; better times for everybody; less taxation; less rates; better times all round.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us take it in a different way:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;More employment; more factories; more tillage; more houses; less extravagance; end of destitution; stop to emigration,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and all that was founded upon the special and the particular promise that, after a minute examination of the Estimates, Fianna Fáil was convinced there could be a decrease in taxation of £2,000,000 per annum. That was not sufficient for some of them.  Deputy Lemass went to the country, and in January, speaking in Ballyhaunis, he said it was possible to reduce taxation by £3,000,000. What is a million extra to Deputy Lemass?  And then from him we get the usual conditions: taxation can be reduced without impairing the Government machinery&mdash;and we get something special, as usual, from <Col N="2147" /> him&mdash;&ldquo;but on the whole with every prospect of improving it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The original pledge was to reduce extravagance without cutting Government services, without impairing social services, and without impairing the machinery of government. The present Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, adds on £1,000,000 to what the advertisement claimed would be saved, and adds further that not merely is that not going to impair the machinery of government, but it is going to have every prospect of improving it.</P>
    <P>Last November we as a Government came to this House with the proposal for a Supplementary Budget.  It included two items as then presented: an additional sixpence on the income tax and an additional tax on petrol, and we held out the hope of economies up to a certain amount of money.  How were these proposals received?  The Deputy, who is now President, said that &ldquo;extra taxation, at the present time, is not justifiable, until it is clearly shown that there is no direction in which retrenchment can be effected.&rdquo;  The President has now agreed to extra taxation.  Are we to assume that he has made up his mind that there is no direction in which retrenchment can be effected, and if he has, what becomes of the £2,000,000 savings according to his advertisement, or the £3,000,000 savings of the Ballyhaunis speech which were to be effected on the Estimates for the ordinary supply services?  The present Minister for Finance on that occasion committed himself to this sapience: &ldquo;I think that if the departments of the Government were carefully combed out there would be no difficulty in making retrenchments amounting to well over £1,000,000.&rdquo;  What has happened the comb?  Where is the million pounds retrenchment?  Where is the care? What has become of the Minister's case since the 6th November when the Minister for Finance was satisfied that &ldquo;if the departments of the Government were carefully combed out there would be no difficulty in making retrenchments amounting to well over £1,000,000&rdquo;?  The present Minister for <Col N="2148" /> Industry and Commerce, who proposed to get £1,000,000 more than the optimistic Minister for Finance could get, went one less than the Minister for Finance in November.  His view was that £900,000 could be got from economy if the Government were prepared to be ruthless enough&mdash;that money could be got, every penny of it, through economies.  He bids lower than the Minister for Finance by £100,000, and whereas the Minister for Finance was convinced it could be done by careful combing, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce felt it would require ruthlessness.  But both the careful combing and the ruthlessness have disappeared.  We are not getting the retrenchment, either the nine hundred thousand or the one or two millions; or the three millions promised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce at Ballyhaunis in the middle of January.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The present Minister for Finance had another comment to make upon the Supplementary Budget of that time.  Although this is not relevant to what I am examining at the moment, it is relevant to what I am coming to later on.  He was horrified at the proposal to put 6d. on the income tax at that stage for this reason. He said: &ldquo;Now, when income is contracting, the Minister proposes to take a larger part of the contracted income, and he is going to leave very much less, after these proposals have been adopted, of the reduced means of the people, a very much smaller share for them to meet the ordinary expenses of everyday life, than he proposed to leave when their income was larger at the beginning of the year.  Surely no Government is justified in doing that.&rdquo; He continued with regard to the 6d. on the income tax: &ldquo;In relation to the income tax proposals may I say this: that because the Minister proposes to increase the income tax without making any compensating increase in the allowances, I think this 6d. in the £ is going to fall most heavily on the one section of the community which I think has a lower margin over the level of sustenance than any other class.  That <Col N="2149" /> section is the poorly paid clerical worker, the lower middle class, as it is called.&rdquo;  I want that kept in mind when I come to speak of the Civil Service later on.</P>
      <P>A variety of orators of the Fianna Fáil persuasion preached the guarantee of these economies and reduced taxation through the country during the pre-election period.  Deputy Briscoe gave it as his opinion that it was owing to the stand made by Fianna Fáil that the proposed cut in the pay of the Civic Guards had not been enforced. I hope Deputy Briscoe will stand to his post at the moment.  The present Minister for Justice decided that the country was over-policed, and Deputy Briscoe feels certain that Fianna Fáil prevented any cut being made in the pay of the Civic Guards. Deputy Geoghegan got into more general economics.  He said if anybody thought the country could possibly get on its feet and progress with its present enormous overhead charges and expenses, then they were living in a fool's paradise.  The overhead charges have been increased. What about the fool's paradise that the Minister for Justice now finds himself in?  Has he been able, at any rate, to show that there can be a paradise even though there be the folly of increasing the present overhead charges and expenses and is there any hope of getting the country on its feet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It took the President, of course, to trump everybody's cards.  &ldquo;The first step towards prosperity,&rdquo; said the President, &ldquo;was to give up buying the foreigners' produce.&rdquo;  A simple proposal, simply stated and the conclusion equally simple and equally simply stated.  &ldquo;Ireland could support a population of 17,000,000.&rdquo;  We are going to have seventeen million in the country, although the present Minister for Justice asserted much about the same time that people were living in a fool's paradise if they thought the country could be got on its feet with the present enormous overhead charges, which the present Government has added to.  I see no signs of there being any drive towards getting <Col N="2150" /> back those who will be required to make up the seventeen million population that the country apparently can support.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Industry and Commerce was spurred on to greater efforts than he had made in the election campaign by that statement of the President.  He is not the man to be outdone by anybody, even in statement.  He said if they set out to do what they obviously could do, produce their own food, make their own clothes and build their own houses, instead of letting the foreigner do it for them, there would not be enough idle men in the country to do all the work, that they would have to call back some of the quarter of a million of people who had emigrated during the past nine years.  Has the present Minister for Industry and Commerce issued any invitations to those people to come back?</P>

      <P>And we are going to have them in greater numbers in the future.  The President attacked this later from a different angle.  He was very grieved over a Cumann na nGaedheal advertisement in which <Col N="2151" /> the question was asked that if Hoover could not cure unemployment in America and Hindenburg in Germany, how could he do it?  This was the simple answer: &ldquo;The problem that faced Hoover, MacDonald, and Hindenburg was not the problem facing us.  If these statesmen had the cure staring them in the face as we have here they would have unemployment ended long ago.&rdquo;  So the cure stares us in the face.  There was unemployment in those countries, but &ldquo;they were over-industrialised and could produce under protection in half the time at their disposal all the manufactured articles they wanted.  They wanted to find a foreign market for their surplus and could not find it.  We are unemployed because we are not sufficiently industrialised or equipped to meet our own needs.&rdquo;  He summed up by reiterating that they had available a permanent cure for unemployment that the United States or Great Britain had not got.  You have got to compare that with the sorry picture of the Minister for Agriculture going around here with a terrible burden of 320,000 cwts. of exportable butter on his shoulders, and having to tax the people of this country in order to get that exportable surplus marketed on the market nearest to us.  But these other people had not the cure for unemployment that we had, because they had to export.  Apparently, we have nothing to export.  Nothing, of course, if you close one eye to the agricultural side of the economy of this country and fasten your open one only on the industrial side.  Hindenburg and Hoover turned up again with the President, and his new comment this time was that he knows that France was not mentioned, because, to a large extent, France is self-supporting, both industrially and agriculturally, and is the type of country that they wanted here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was hoping that somewhere as the election had gone on, the President would have told us what did he think was the state of unemployment in France, the country which our advertisements had not mentioned, a country which he felt had been left <Col N="2152" /> out because it was the exemplar for him, for his policy and for his unemployment remedies.  And we never heard it from him.  The French deputy who is likely soon to become Premier did state his view in recent months of what the French unemployment was.  He divided it into the absolutely destitute, the transitionally unemployed and the abnormally unemployed, and he had no such satisfying calculation with regard to France as I was able to make here and as the Minister for Industry and Commerce made here a few days ago, that a very big percentage of the people who are now on our live register are only out of employment for less than two to four months. No such element entered into Herriot's calculation about the unemployed in France.  The French unemployment, he told us, was 2¾ millions.  President de Valera thinks France is a country that we should emulate.  Apparently he thinks that France has no unemployment problem.  This country can support seventeen million of a population!  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is going to bring back the quarter of a million who recently emigrated.  The Minister for Justice thinks we are in a fool's paradise if we think that this country can get on its feet under the crushing overhead expenses it has to bear.  The Fianna Fáil Party promised us reduction in taxation and economies to the extent of £2,000,000, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce added that we could go one million better.  We have all these promises now checked up by performance, and we do not see any great chance of the country getting on its feet with the present huge overhead charges.  We do not see any possibility of getting the emigrants brought back.  We do not see such a reduction in taxation as was promised, and we see nowhere the economies in the public services that were promised and so far from there being economies under the conditions that were talked of, we see that one at any rate of the conditions is going definitely and clearly to be broken. There is going to be an attempt to cut the salaries of the servants of <Col N="2153" /> the Government.  But this Budget puts us in the position of being at least one election, if not one decade, behind every country in the world. We, because of the coming into power of a particular Party, are going to go through the period that certainly every European country has gone through since the War, but with this difference, that we are going into it; they have been through it and have come out.</P>
    <P>What has been the situation in Europe if not in the world since the War?  It came to this, that political parties set out with programmes of social services and of aids for the lower classes.  They promised the millennium but each Party outdid the other in promising, and although no Party attempted to put all its promises into force, some of them tried them in a half-hearted way, and it took ten, twelve or fifteen harried years to get most of the countries in Europe to realise that that situation in which one element of the community was elevated as a voting factor above every other element of the community, did not in the end even pay that element and economics had to get back to some more stable basis than what they had been on.  That tendency has been summed up by many writers in recent years.  One well-known economist, writing about it, said that the difficulties of the world for the last fifteen years revolved on this, that politicians always thought in terms of power, whereas economists presumably thought in terms of possibility.  He pointed out that politicians always had this view that, granted sufficient power, they could do anything, even to this point that they felt they could avoid the logical consequences of their own acts.  He went on to say that that type of theory was very well in a world in which nothing was fixed, and in which there were no necessary economic connections between facts, but that is not the world we are living in, and the fact that it is not the world we are living in has been found out by hard experience by many European nations.  There are certain fixed items, certain necessary economic <Col N="2154" /> connections, and no matter what power a party has, it can never get away from the logical consequences economically of its own acts.  This same economist remarks further on this idea that once you have got sufficient political power you can do anything, and on the allied idea that the evils, or as he puts it, the inconveniences of modern society must be due to defects in the organisation of society.  Those two, what he calls naïve ideas, lie at the roots of every modern Utopia, every modern revolutionary aim. What have we except that same naïve idea informing the mind of the Fianna Fáil Government at the moment.  You can put on tariffs they imagine and raise overhead expenses, and yet you are not going to defeat or destroy your present system.  You can raise overhead expenses for the community and yet try to get that struggling community on its feet.  You can get a few people into employment at the cost of others you put out, and yet, by substituting two new men in employment for a half-a-dozen that will leave employment, you are going to get things better.  That is the calculation. That was one of the naïve ideas worked out in this Budget. With even less weight than he had referred to the bachelors, the Minister for Finance chuckled with glee, a glee which only he could understand, over the proposals that he had with regard to income tax.</P>
    <P>I want to quote from a person who now has naïve ideas, but who had not always got them.  I quote from the debates of the 11th November, 1931. A Fianna Fáil Deputy said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the same way, if you take income tax, the idea of income tax is that that portion of it which is got from investment is got by people who do not work, and the second part is money which is got by people who get it easily and who use it for luxurious expenditure.  Anyone who knows anything about ordinary business knows perfectly well that these are absolutely ludicrous ideas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What are the ludicrous ideas?  If you tax the income tax payer heavily you are getting first of all one portion from <Col N="2155" /> the investments of people who do not work, and secondly you get it from people who get that money easily and use it for luxurious expenditure.  That speaker continued:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Anyone who wants to see productive industry flourishing in the country, who wants to see employment in the country, must get out of his head at once that he can afford to take out of industry in the form of taxation, in the form of income tax, or anything else, that amount of added capital which is required for its development.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He attacks income tax as a tax on industry&mdash;that is his argument in summary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy concerned a member of the present Cabinet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>One on the edge of the present Cabinet.  But there you are.  Income tax is a tax on industry, and yet you can put three sixpences more on industry and have more industry. There are the naïve ideas from which the modern Utopia that this Free State is going to become starts.  There was a famous stunt some years ago about no income tax.  At that time certain budding economists came before the public, and certain professional economists threw themselves into the fray.  A professor in University College, Cork, wrote in favour of the abolition of income tax.  He stated:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Floating capital will remain in Ireland only as long as it can get the same reward (apart from income tax) as it can get in England.  Fixed capital must in the long run behave similarly.  In other words, capital will emigrate if it cannot pass its tax burden on to the consumers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That same professor said, and I can suggest this for the guidance of the Minister for Finance, &ldquo;to decide to meet all current capital expenditure by immediate taxation, even if it involved exceeding the taxable limit, is not financial conservatism or rectitude; it is financial lunacy.&rdquo;  He summed up his previous statement with regard to income tax this way:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2156" />&ldquo;The incidence of income tax is mainly on three classes.  First, on wage-earners and salary-earners; the real burden of their tax is greater than that of the rich man's tax.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;I want that remembered when we come to deal with the civil servants&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Secondly, on the businesses which give them employment; if a business decides to use £10,000 of its profits in extending its factory, the tax collector says: &lsquo;You must not use that £10,000 in building up industry; I want £3,000 of it.&rsquo; Thirdly, on those people who derive income from the distributive profits of joint stock enterprise; that is, if they do not emigrate to a more favourable clime.  A business man who wishes to organise his undertaking on joint stock lines realises that this will compel him to keep accurate accounts, and the temptation is to keep it in the less organised form, retaining the valuable power of tax evasion.  Income tax is in this way definitely hindering development of Irish business.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And he sums up this way:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Anything which is penalising industry is penalising the workingman.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Professor Busteed in a letter to the &ldquo;Irish Statesman,&rdquo; March 7th, 1925.  The other quotation was April 18th of the same year.  The Deputy whose speech I have quoted had introduced a no-income-tax campaign. The person who was then Deputy Johnson, leader of the Labour Party in this House, controverted some of the income tax proposals, and the originator of the no-income-tax stunt replied:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Johnson will find himself ploughing a lonely furrow through responsible economic opinion when he suggests that the burden of income tax is not passed on to the consumer.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>About that same period the same person said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;There were certain points upon <Col N="2157" /> which he thought they had agreed. One was that the pressure of existing taxation in 1925 prohibited the development of industry; and, secondly, that the reduction of direct taxation would give the most immediate and definite impetus to industry, and would reduce unemployment and the cost of living.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance chortles with glee on the fact that he is going to put three extra sixpences on income tax, and add increases in every other way his imagination suggested to the profits derived from industry, he should have consulted his Parliamentary Secretary and learned from him that any tax on industry is a tax on the working man.  But there is, apparently, this naïve idea floating around that you can have industry and can crush it at the same time; that you can come down on industry with a heavy hand and hope to get industry extended; that you can raise the cost of living for the working man by tariffs and raise all his burdens, because they will be passed on to him in some form owing to the pressure of income tax on industry; that you are going to erect a modern Utopia by putting three extra sixpences on industry, by putting what the Professor calls &ldquo;an extra tax on the working man,&rdquo; through industry, and by crushing the only thing that is going to get industry going and get employment for the working man.</P>

      <P>The slavish mind of the Minister for Finance ran the whole time through his Budget statement to British comparisons.  The British comparison in respect of industry in this country is a poor and ineffectual one.  British industry can bear imposts that this country, with its undeveloped industry, cannot bear. Has the Minister any calculation as to the number of income tax and super-tax payers in this country?  The best calculation I ever saw made was that under the old system there were not more than 90,000 people who actually paid income tax, and not more than 1,500 who paid super-tax.  I saw the calculation made as low as 70,000 people who paid income tax, <Col N="2158" /> and I saw the highest limit put at about 80,000.</P>
      <P>Supposing we take it that this new Budget, which brings a certain number of people under the harrow of income tax, is going to enlarge the field, will it run to 100,000 people between income tax and super-tax payers?  Dividing 100,000 into the three classes that Professor Busteed spoke of, those with a fixed income&mdash;civil servants in the main&mdash;those who derive money from industry which should be allowed to be put back into it, and those living in luxury, how many of the 100,000 are people living in luxury, keeping capital stagnant, instead of having it flowing productively through the country? What burden has been placed already on that 100,000 people?  They were to bring in according to the old estimate about three and a half millions in the year. To that there is going to be added now at least one million.  What is going to be the sustaining power of that 100,000 people when you add to the three and a half million pounds already derived from them, another million, in circumstances in which business is decaying and trade is at a standstill?  Yet you hope to have a Utopia of more employment through more industry when you are going to bend low that 100,000 people upon whom you are depending for something now in the neighbourhood of four and a half millions of your entire taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second side of this naïve Budget is the tariff side.  We have tariffs tacked on morning after morning.  We have some 43 imposed by the Budget. We have no evidence that they were considered carefully.  We have no evidence that there was any scheme, system, or plan in the way in which these tariffs were imposed.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce tells us at times that a lot of them, although they will all have a protective effect, are required for revenue purposes only.  The Minister for Finance tosses back that ball to him and says: &ldquo;Remember although some of these will bring in money, they are mainly intended to carry out the Government's industrial policy.&rdquo;  There is no evidence whatever that these tariffs were <Col N="2159" /> put on according to any plan.  As I say, we are starting a decade behind the rest of Europe, perhaps a decade behind the rest of the world, getting into the mire they are all now struggling to get out of, and not even going in with any plan, but in a reckless and haphazard way.</P>
    <P>Tariffs undoubtedly have their part to play in a country like this, which was never properly developed industrially. But I would like the Cabinet to take some note of the phrase used by the poor Minister for Agriculture when he came here with his 320,000 cwts. of exportable butter and told us to remember that there was always a danger that, in trying to increase industry, or start new industries, industries that were already in existence might be crushed out.  What better way is there of crushing out industries that are in existence than by choosing the time when they are at their lowest point to increase their overhead and ordinary charges, and by deciding to do that by the imposition of tariffs on goods, the manufacture of which can never take root here, but which are going to remain an intolerable burden on the backs of the main producer?  Tariffs which are in some way scientifically adjusted&mdash;if that term can be used at any time about any tariff&mdash;have some chance but was there any plan followed with regard to these tariffs?  Was there any attempt made to find out what industry there was which had as its economic unit of consumption a certain number which this community could supply?  Was there any discrimination made to see that there were industries, the consuming unit for which must be such a vast number of the people that it was clear this country could never give them that consumption unit?  Was there any attempt made to see that even when you did get an industry that seemed to have a future in this country, you could introduce it gradually, was there any realisation that merely putting on numerous taxes at one moment would not help the speedy growth of industry in the country, that it had to be built up by slow degrees, <Col N="2160" /> and that remissions had to be made here and there?  Was there any attention paid to the time that must elapse before skilled workers in the different businesses could be brought together? Was any allowance made for remission of the imposts while untrained workers were becoming skilled? Is there any evidence before us of any plan whatsoever with regard to these tariffs excepting this&mdash;that the Minister for Finance, in his reckless finance, wanted roughly £1,000,000 and saw he could get them by what really amounted to revenue taxes.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil had its plan for unemployment. They even detailed that plan down to individual workers in certain industries.  The boot industry, under their protection, was to give additional employment to 8,501 workers.  Eight thousand five hundred and one!  The thing was adjusted so scientifically as that.  It is the greatest nonsense.  The only way in which there was any adjustment was the method of doing sums which the Minister for Industry and Commerce explained to us one evening during an unemployment debate. According to him, you take two sets of figures.  What is the average wealth produced by the worker in industry, as revealed by the census-of-production report?  The answer to that, I think, was £200 or £220.  Good. You take the amount of the imports which the Minister believes can be made at home.  £30,000,000.  Divide 220 into £30,000,000 and you get the number of men you are going to have employed.  It is all sums.  As I said before, you could almost see the chalk floating around in the air and settling on the Minister's shoulders while he was working on the blackboard. Sums&mdash;but that is not the way to get industry going in the country. Deputy Norton was anguished to think that possibly the Government could be depending on a plan of tariffs.  Clearly, they are depending on a plan of tariffs and on nothing else.  That is the scheme; that is the plan.  But they have not yet shown us how tariffs are going to do in this country what tariffs have not been able to do in any other country.  Deputy Norton put the matter <Col N="2161" /> in a series of phrases.  If tariffs could make a country prosperous, he asked, why is not America prosperous? You can also run that question through all the countries of Europe, simply changing &ldquo;America&rdquo; for the proper geographical description.  If tariffs are such an obvious remedy, we must have some answer to the question that falls to be answered&mdash;why has not the obvious remedy worked in these other countries?</P>
    <P>We import too much&mdash;that must be accepted as a starting point. There are certain things that after some period we could substitute by home manufactures.  But it is dishonest to pretend that there is no difference between importing and buying cheaply and making at home and selling dear to the same consumer. It is dishonest to pretend that it is going to make no difference to the consumer whether he gets goods manufactured abroad and sold here cheaply or whether he has got to pay very dear for the substituted article made at home.  What about our main industry while all that is going on?  It does get the benefit of cheap importation at the moment. Supposing this country put up a plan to get rid of a certain percentage of cheap imports, it should be a plan that would extend over a period of years and certainly it should not be a plan that would be rushed at one swoop and with full force upon the primary producer here struggling, as he now is, with almost insuperable difficulties.</P>
    <P>Take the single fact that you are going to substitute dear production at home for cheap importation from abroad.  Where is the farmer going to get the money to pay for these dearer things that he buys.  What will happen?  He will not buy.  He will reduce his standard of life.  He must reduce his standard of life unless he can get higher prices for his own products. Can he get higher prices for his own products at the moment?  If he cannot and if he has to buy dearer, it is surely inevitable that he is going to buy less.  If he buys less, one little miscalculation occurs in the sums which <Col N="2162" /> the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been doing.  There will not be the same amount of purchasing power in the country.  It will not be distributed in the same way.  There will not be the same amount of goods bought from factories which we were told were to spring up and give employment to so many men, on the basis that so much production was going to be transferred from another country to this country in the twinkling of an eye.  That calculation is clearly fallacious. When these sums were being done, the President mentioned eight industries and said those alone would give employment to 56,000 people.  He said that these people could at once be employed.  Let me assume, omitting everything else except the time factor, that it is possible, although barely possible, that that number could at once be employed.  At what cost can they be employed and who is going to pay the cost?  These are the economic realities that have to be faced.  Consideration of cost in relation to the men employed and the goods produced is a thing that even political power will not enable a political party to get away from.  At the time the President was speaking, he estimated the number of unemployed at 60,000.  He mentioned eight industries and he did this sum in division.  He said: There are eight industries; divide 220 into the particular number and you get 56,000&mdash; the number, more or less, unemployed at the time.  The number of unemployed has now, according to the figure we heard recently, increased to 80,000.  We simply go on with more sums, more division, add in more industries and get more people employed. The Minister for Industry and Commerce wants to call back the emigrants and all it means, according to him, is a further period of meditation in his study with a blackboard, more division and more people employed.</P>
    <P>Take one item which I have not yet stressed.  The President mentioned, at the time I have referred to, boots and shoes, woollens, clothing, quarries and mining as industries which could employ the 56,000 people unemployed <Col N="2163" /> at that date, on the calculation that each man engaged in industry was producing £220 worth of wealth.</P>
    <P>Does that mean that you can take your untrained man, the man who has never been in any industry before, and put him into a boot and shoe factory in the hope that he will turn out goods which will be sold, even with a tariff, in competition with goods manufactured under a system of highly efficient production and imported into and sold in this country?  Surely that assumption deserves also to be ranked amongst those that are absurd?</P>
    <P>I have said there was a process of tariff-making which might have worked.  That was the process of selective tariffs.  If necessary, that process could be deliberately slowed down or speeded up at will&mdash;speeded up when your primary producers were selling well and when they could bear burdens and altered when they were selling badly and could not afford extra expense.  At this moment, with the primary producer at the last ebb, we have landed on us, through the Budget, 43 tariffs.  We have added to that from outside 11, 12 or 13 more tariffs.  There is a traditional economy in this country.  It is built mainly upon agriculture and it has a small super-structure of industry. It supports in the main three millions of a population, less whatever the unemployed amount to; let us say the unemployed amount to 80,000, although I do not believe that figure.  That traditional economy is supporting people, perhaps not in luxury, to the number of three million, less 80,000 unemployed. It requires a very considerable period of time to get that traditional economy slowly to adapt itself to new situations and new circumstances. We have 43 tariffs thrown in on us. Is it not the most foolish procedure that, on the chance of getting 60,000 people employed in wasteful means of production at the beginning, you risk a breakdown of that traditional economy which gives a living to three millions?  There are clearly certain Utopian ideas abroad.  It appears to be believed that you can get away from the economic consequences <Col N="2164" /> of your own acts.  You can put on tariffs and increase overhead expenses and still keep the country going, and even make it progress better and better.  We are told you can put a burden on industry through the income tax and the super tax, and yet it is held that we are going to get more industry and a better development under better circumstances.  We have had an example in Europe of this policy of rushing into tariffs. If there were no examples from outside, the most superficial glance at the country's resources and economy would show that that policy is madness; it would show the great danger there is that that type of policy, if pursued, would speedily beggar the country.</P>
    <P>It would look as if the Executive Council were anxious to run steadily along with blinkers fixed rigidly to the sides of their heads, not allowing their eyes to wander towards the conditions that obtain in other countries.  Surely there are abundant examples from other countries as to the dangers of the policy that we are now embarking on?  Is there not a cry right around Europe to get rid of tariffs&mdash;to get rid of excessive tariffs&mdash;and to get international trade flowing freely once more?  We should join in that cry, even though we have to make the case that this country cannot be regarded as having reached its final stage of development.  Since 1927 there has been a cry that tariffs should be reduced, and yet there has been no action taken.  Why?  Because most countries have got themselves into the position that, so far, we have escaped.  They have industries developed, industries not normally suited to them.  What is the position facing statesmen who come to an international gathering from a country industrially developed in that fashion?  If a statesman so circumstanced were asked to agree to anything that might mean the closing down of a factory, then realising the consequences that would ensue, his thoughts must turn to some sort of a lethal chamber into which the workers, as they came out of the factory, could be put.  That is what disappearing <Col N="2165" /> business would be tantamount to.  We have been saved from that to-day.</P>

      <P>I thought the Deputy mentioned a miracle.  At any rate, we have been saved from that. We had not to keep on wasteful and really unproductive industries because we had workpeople entangled in them and certain people's capital entangled in them.  But now we are plunging into this policy a decade after everybody else has found out the truth and when they all see that what happens in the long run from excessive tariffs is the keeping of workers in unproductive employment at a staggering cost.  We are going in with our eyes open.  We are going to run counter to the experience of all Europe and, I think, of America too, in the last ten years.  I suppose this is part of the old time idea of keeping one's eyes fixed steadily at home; one should not look abroad in a slavish way.  There is no reason to close one's eyes to the lessons that can be learned from foreign countries. There is only one lesson to be learned from Europe and that is to stop and ponder well before engineering any tariff policy in this country.</P>
      <P>I have referred to one Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party.  There is one other to whom I would like to refer. I previously quoted a letter put in evidence before the Tariff Commission when an application for a tariff was being considered.  I believe the person who wrote that letter is now a Deputy in this House.  He wrote:</P>
      <P>Personally I am a free trader and against tariffs because the inhabitants of the country levying the tariff will pay the tariff in the cost of the goods which they purchase both so far as the amount of the tariff is concerned and also in the extra profit obtained by the home manufacturers whom the tariff protects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>From a statement I <Col N="2166" /> previously made in this House.  I have not the date of it, but it is a quotation from a letter written in connection with an application for a tariff on margarine.  The letter was written to the then Minister for Finance and it was stated to be from a Mr. Dowdall.  The statement that it was Senator Dowdall who wrote it has been denied and I am driven now to the assumption that it was Deputy Dowdall.  He is a business man engaged in a tariffed industry, but when he was applying for a tariff the statement I have quoted was put in as part of the case for a tariff.  I said to the Minister for Industry and Commerce some days ago that tariffs were going to increase the cost to the home consumer; that goods were going to increase in the main by the amount of the tariff. When tariffs are scientifically adjusted, and you keep them at a low level, there is always the fear that when prices rise the importations may again start, and in that way prices may to some extent be controlled. But when tariffs are recklessly imposed at seventy-five per cent. and fifty per cent. as they are now there is no impediment to the home manufacturer charging what he pleases.  Until we get to the point when the home manufacturers have got into competition one with the other the price cannot be kept down.  We have these Utopian ideas right through this Budget, that you can raise the income tax and pass it on to the consumer; that you can add still further to the burden of the consumer by putting tariffs on goods not likely to be manufactured here. We are told that you can have more industry in the country and more people able to bear these burdens if they are scattered in such a lavish way as the Minister for Finance is scattering them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The civil servant is coming under the inquisition of the Minister for Finance.  I take the civil servant because he is one of the classes of people into whom Professor Busteed divided the income tax-payers of the community.  I take him also because he shows in rather a glaring way the cumulative effects of the present Budget. Fianna Fáil promised two <Col N="2167" /> million pounds economies from the services without touching the civil servant.</P>

      <P>I am sorry; without inflicting hardship on the civil servant; without impairing the efficiency of the Government machine and without reducing social services.  That was their promise.  The performance is that if new minds or fresh minds&mdash;that is the phrase used&mdash;are brought in, if the whole machinery of Government is examined by outside people; if the system of purchasing is examined, and so on, the Minister for Finance hopes that in the present year there will be a saving of £100,000; and, in addition, he hopes to get from the Civil Service £250,000.  Deputy Norton is in some way attached to the Civil Service Federation, and speaking here he advanced a peculiar theory that we had got to remember certain matters only about the lower-paid civil servants.  Apparently he threw overboard the higher civil servants. The Minister for Education ponderously warned us to remember that the civil servant had security and that he ought to be made accept something less than the emoluments that he might receive outside for that security.  Up to date the civil servant has had security, and it was for that reason that some of them did accept posts the maximum salary of which was clearly lower than what they could get in other professions.  That was simply because there was security. Security was the bait that drew many good men into the Civil Service and away from the rough and tumble of business life.  Where is the security now?  Where is the faith in contracts, for contracts have been made with the civil servants?  The civil servant, when he is an income tax payer, is going to be hit by the increased imposition. Part of his emolument depends on the cost-of-living bonus.  The cost-of-living bonus is going to be hit because the cost of living is going to go up.  It is well known that the cost-of-living bonus was never intended to go to the full extent of what cost of living amounts to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2168" /> In addition, the civil servant is going to be asked to submit to a cut.  As was asked by a previous speaker&mdash;Why choose the civil servant?  Why did not the Minister for Finance choose, say, the butchers in the community? Why did not the Minister say that the butchers as a whole are getting too much money and that we were to have an extra 1/- or 1/6 in the £ off them?  Why civil servants?  The only reason, apparently, is that the civil servants are close to hand, but perhaps the real reason is that the Minister for Finance led in the chorus that started years ago about the grossly overpaid civil servants in this State. The Minister for Education the other day said that as the Ministers had cut themselves to a certain degree they expected that the civil servants would submit to the same treatment.  It can be pertinently asked are the Ministers going to pay income tax?  It can be asked equally pertinently are the Ministers going to be clearly and without any doubt full-time in their posts? And if not, are civil servants going to be given the same opportunities for part-time work that Ministers themselves apparently are going to take to themselves?</P>

      <P>Are there any Ministers or any members attached to the Government who carry on any profession of a private type and use the Government offices for their private work?  If so, will civil servants be allowed to engage in other work of a professional occupation and to use their offices and even their staffs in the same way?  The civil servant wants his security.  The civil servant ought to be quite secure in his job because it is on that security that most of them banked.  That is the bait that drew them into that particular walk in life, and it was for that very reason that I permitted myself to advise certain civil servants who came to see me when I was a member of the Government on the question of the bonus, and to tell them it was the worst possible time for them to inaugurate any campaign which had for its aim the changing of the contract <Col N="2169" /> under which they came into the civil service of this State.  I told them that with times as hard as they were the changing of their contract in a way favourable to themselves should not be pressed at that particular moment. I advised them that they should found themselves clearly and directly on their contractual rights and should remain securely based on those rights. They have contract rights and they are being attacked in three ways, as I have said.</P>
      <P>The analogy of what the Ministers may do to themselves&mdash;and we have not heard precisely what it is&mdash;is not an analogy that can be pressed, because no Minister ever comes into his work feeling that he is attracted there by the bait of security.  That has been what drew the civil servant in.  The Minister for Education can have no appreciation of what the standard of a civil servant is or the conditions of his employment.  He said: &ldquo;Remember these people have not to go through the slumps that occur in business.&rdquo; Equally they are not allowed to share in the booms that occur in business, they are not allowed to enjoy the good times that occur in business.  Their salaries are fixed in a particular way with regular periods in which increments accrue.  That was decided on the basis that they were to be saved from the severity of slumps and not allowed to take advantage of the increased benefits that come in business from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made out for my own satisfaction a certain calculation with regard to civil servants of different types.  I took a person upon whose head I suppose will fall the greatest amount of odium when salaries come to be considered&mdash;a person at the head of a Department of the Civil Service, and I imagined him to be a married man with three children.  He is in receipt of a salary at this moment of something less than £1,400, a salary of £1,370.  Take a man with an equal income, a man who has not an earned income; a man who has invested money in the National Loan and is deriving, say, £1,370 a year from that investment.  At the moment the civil servant pays £194 a year in income <Col N="2170" /> tax.  The man who has his money invested in the National Loan and derives his income from that pays £236.  Supposing that the civil servant is now to suffer a ten per cent. cut on his salary of £1,370, he is going to pay £331 a year, or almost £100 a year more than the man who derives his emoluments entirely from invested money.  And the man who has invested in National Loan also derives his income from the State.  He has as much security for his income as the civil servant has, because the civil servant should only lose his employment when the State goes down just as the man deriving his income from the National Loan should only lose his income when the national investment goes down.  That man has as much security for his capital as the other has for his livelihood.</P>
    <P>Take another man, one in a lower grade of the Civil Service, also married with three children, in receipt of £600, and compare with him the private individual, married with three children, receiving £600 from National Loan.  At the moment, the one will pay under the new taxation £21, and the other&mdash;the private citizen&mdash;will pay nearly double.  Supposing that £600 civil servant is to be cut.  What amount is the cut to be on the £600 a year man?  Would £50 be considered a small amount?  Suppose £50 is the cut, then that civil servant will pay over £70 under the new system, and the private citizen will still continue to have his £43 taken from him. Which of these people has the more security?  Deputy Norton and the Minister for Education talked of security.  Which of these people has the more security?  Are they not both based on the same thing&mdash;on the State lasting?  And while the holder of National Loan can pass on his capital to his survivors, the other man is dependent on his earnings and cannot pass on his emoluments to his survivors.</P>
    <P>When you consider these things you have also to take into consideration what the present civil servants do.  It seems to me that in present circumstances, with the imposts that have <Col N="2171" /> been put on, no case can be made for any cut in the Civil Service.  There might be a case for an appeal that the Service should voluntarily contribute something if circumstances were shown to be very bad, but what appeal can the present Minister for Finance make to any body of men who are working hard and not earning over much in relation to the work they do? What appeal can he make when he has to go to them and say: At this moment when I find the resources of the State heavily taxed and the finances of the State an overwhelming burden, I propose to add to the burdens of the community an extra quarter of a million, at any rate, for new wound pensions, etc., an extra sum of money for old age pensioners&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to refer briefly to one very small matter.  An increased tax has been put on amusements and out-of-door sports.  Dances are taxed, racing comes under a bigger ban.  Out-of-door amusements of all types are to be harried.  Dances will be a peculiar performance next year.  People will be going to them in their hair-shirts.</P>

When the President spoke on this matter of taxes on outdoor sports on 2nd July of last year he said: My view in this matter is a very simple one.  If I had my way I would not tax any game.  He continued: &ldquo;I must say that I dislike very much taxing outdoor sports, as we have not enough of them, and I should like to see them free from taxes.  If the amendment were to get rid of all taxes on outdoor games such as football, and it were possible at the same time to give positive encouragement to hurling and Gaelic football by a definite grant, that particular way would be the way that would please me best.&rdquo;  Why has the President not got his way this time?  Why are games being taxed?  Why are these outdoor amusements, of which we have not got enough, brought under the eye of the Minister for Finance?</P>

      <Col N="2173" /> There is one other minor matter&mdash; the question of the Sweepstakes&mdash;that I want to deal with.  The Sweepstakes are going to be mulcted.  We are told that the Sweepstakes are being mulcted&mdash;at least, we have it insinuated that they are being mulcted almost at their own request.  &ldquo;The plan that was most attractive in its simplicity was the one which was put up by the Emergency Committee of the Hospitals.&rdquo;  What was the emergency that caused that Committee to be appointed?  Was not the emergency this: That a pistol had been held at the head of the Hospitals Trust by the Minister for Finance? Was that the reason for the Emergency Committee being appointed?  At any rate, we have it from a person who said it was galling to him to have to describe himself as a friend of the Minister for Finance, or rather, I think, he said, galling for him who had been a friend of the Minister for Finance to describe the Minister's proposals in a particular way.  This person tells the public that there was no offer by the Hospitals Trust.  We were told in the Budget speech that this charge was going to be an impost by way of income tax, but when we got the Resolution we found that it was to be taken by way of stamp duty and the two are the same thing according to the Minister for Finance. They are not the same thing.  It would not do to have a charity's income taxed, and so we get it the other way.  We get this peculiar thing.  We get money which was collected outside this financial year brought in for the purpose of this particular tax.</P>

      <P>The fact is that the Minister goes outside this financial year in order to get certain moneys brought in for his purposes, and he is going to take it from those people not at the old rate of income tax but at the present rate of income tax.  In that way he is going to get his £63,000 from the hospitals by retrospective action of a particularly dubious type.</P>
      <P>On another occasion, I propose to quote the words spoken by the Minister for Finance in relation to sweepstakes as a whole.  The Minister is very keen on not doing abnormal things out of ordinary revenue, and not considering as abnormal what ought to be looked on as normal, but he did give us his profound opinion, on one occasion, that these Hospitals Sweeps could not last. According to him, any one would be a fool who would imagine that there could be as many as nine sweeps, or that they would last for two years.  He gave us, as his view, at that time, that there were going to be diplomatic difficulties over these Sweeps, and that if we wanted to live on good terms with friendly States near us we would have to close down on these Sweeps, because, he said, it amounted to nothing more than bootlegging in gambling, and this purist, this most honest Minister for Finance, is going to take this vast amount of money from this bootlegging business, even though it may land us in difficulties with friendly States.</P>

      <P>Another occasion will arise for discussing such things as the so-called unbalanced Budget of previous years.  I am not going into it at the moment but I do want on that point to advert to this mumbo-jumbo of gold ounces, in which the Minister indulged.  I saw, some time ago, that a gentleman, who is known familiarly as Charlie Chaplin had sent for books upon gold and the debts of the world and there is no doubt that after studying these he will produce a deliberately comic picture about gold and world debts, but it will be something that will be well thought out even in its comicalities. It will not be the ludicrous gyrations of a man who pretends to be serious, dealing with a serious subject with this sort of mumbo-jumbo the Minister indulged in about gold ounces.  I would like him to do a few more calculations.  Let him reduce the cost of the civil war to gold ounces and tell us what it would be.  Let him reduce the saving in his own salary to gold ounces and let us know what it is. He could reduce these things to anything. The Minister for Finance proceeded to reduce the whole Budget to absurdity and will probably have reduced this whole country to bankruptcy when this Budget has run its course.  It is a sad thing and a hard thing, that this country should have to suffer because of the irresponsibility that at present is located in a serious Ministry.  The Minister has for years past wandered in &ldquo;a far countree,&rdquo; and indulged in very riotous living.  Nobody here will have any objection to his bringing home a few husks to munch as he sits on those benches, but it is a desperate thing that this country should have these served out as their main fodder <Col N="2176" /> because he indulged in riotous living at a certain period of his life, and even after the country had been brought back from all the ravages of that particular war period, that he should be setting out now to do economically the damage he could not do when he was under arms.  The Minister described himself, on previous occasions, as undying in regard to a certain brand of political persuasion. Will he let me apply to him the phrase that he is at this moment a dyed-in-the-wool Republican protectionist, and allow me to add this explanation, that most of the dye is in the Republicanism and most of the woolliness on the protectionist side?  Where does the Minister think he is going to get this year these moneys he is looking for? Is it by any possibility of inflation? Is that what the point about the tax on the un-issued amount of notes comes to?  Is that the first little breath of inflation that is going to blow in upon us?  Why also does he Budget for moneys that I cannot see are in any way required&mdash;the £550,000 from the Local Loans fund, which is to be met out of ordinary taxation, in a year in which we are told we are crippled, and that we have to give industry a great chance to get the country going.  Why throw that in amongst all the other nonsense in this Budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This purist Minister for Finance objects to his predecessor in office calling certain things abnormal.  He is going to have a hard year, a year with a forbidding aspect, but it is going to be an honest year.  Where is the honesty?  He gets honest to the point of not having abnormal items in a normal Budget, but he separates the Budget into two parts, the normal Budget and the emergency Budget.  What is the difference between calling these abnormal items but putting them all in one Budget, and separating certain parts, and saying: &ldquo;That is normal in an emergency Budget and other things are normal in a normal Budget.&rdquo;  The Minister for Finance has got to sit down and deliberate on this, that there was a civil war in this country, and, in ordinary terms that people can understand and not in this nonsense <Col N="2177" /> of gold ounces, it cost at least £30,000,000, and the National Debt at this moment is not £30,000,000.  The dead weight debt is not £30,000,000. The expenses of the civil war up to somewhere near 50 per cent. of the total were paid out of ordinary taxation in the first seven or eight years of this State's history. But the Minister objects to that being done, and his programme is, that you take certain items and you call these abnormal or emergency, and you have an emergency Budget.  Where is the honesty in that sort of tactics? A Budget is a serious matter and should have been treated seriously, but this Budget was introduced with the facetiousness to which I previously referred, with all the gaucherie that has marked the Minister in many of his activities in life, with all this nonsense about gold-tipped arrows in Cupid's quiver.</P>

It is not going to be an honest year.  Does the Minister expect that he is going to carry through as he is at the moment?  Does he think that he is going to get the yield from the taxation he is imposing?  Does he found his anticipation of the yield on a continuation of trade, as it runs at the moment?  Does he feel that Ottawa is going to be of any advantage to us in retaining certain preferences which we have at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been anxiously awaiting news for weeks past about a certain suggestion made before I left office, and which was agreed to, namely, that there should be meetings between our High Commissioner in London and British officials to discuss trade matters, <Col N="2178" /> and that there should be, at the same time, meetings between the British Trade Commissioner in this country and high officers of State to discuss the same trade matters.  That was the preamble to a good Ottawa Conference, and without such a preamble and without discussion of economic matters no good will come out of the Ottawa Conference, even if there were no political clouds in the background. Have these meetings taken place? Have preparations been inaugurated with the British?  Have the British been asked to have that preparation, have they refused to meet us?  Remember it was their suggestion at the beginning, a suggestion that we accepted, and that the present Government should have adopted and carried out. I should like to have that question seriously answered.  Have these meeting taken place, and if not, why not? If they do not take place, what are the prospects for Ottawa, and if Ottawa offers no prospects, what are the Minister's prospects in getting in the yield of taxation he hopes for, and what hope is there in this year of getting his Budget balanced?</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn) Hugo Victor Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>For the first time in my experience of listening to the ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce I have to confess that he has wearied me.  I certainly do not say that in any terms of prejudice, because he knows, and this House knows, that I have on many occasions paid very willing tribute to the ability and interest of his debating. But it must have been entirely obvious to the House that long before the ex-Minister did stop, he had completely exhausted himself and was merely engaged in some sort of time wasting, which, frankly, I do not understand, having regard to the period of time which he would have had to occupy if he were to do any good in that process from a merely Party point of view.  It has been stated, and I agree with it, that consistency is the virtue of little minds.  Looking back myself, as most of us do, upon the things that we have done and said in relation to Irish economics and Irish political and economic development for the last <Col N="2179" /> seven years, I have had to recognise with considerable trepidation that not merely have I said things that were very hard and very controversial, but that now, looking back on them, I am not able to alter, as far as I know, by a syllable or by an intonation, what I have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ex-Minister has been good enough and foolish enough to quote certain passages in relation to taxation which I, as an ordinary Deputy in this House, and outside this House as a mere person interested in the economic development of the country, have used. I have nothing to withdraw, nothing to extenuate, nothing to apologise for. Every word that I have said, I have said when it was unpopular.  I repeat it now when it may not seem, to certain standards of intelligence, good tactics.  The ex-Minister has put up to-day, in quoting from us, in quoting from the Dean of the Faculty of Commerce in Cork, who most certainly knows more about economics than he does, a case against income tax. According to him, income tax is one of these things which are a burden upon industry.  It is.  According to him, quoting with appreciation, money which is taken out of an industry in the form of taxation, which could have been used in the development of that industry, is a tax not upon the proprietor of that industry, but upon the future of those who work in it.  If the Deputy so believes, if he is not merely using those phrases for the purpose of Party attack, if he is not merely using this great occasion of the Budget debate of this State for narrow little debating points, why did he not say it when we were fighting the no income tax campaign? Why, if he believed that in relation to income tax, did his Government extract from industry in the last ten years forty or fifty millions of that kind of money?  If he believed that, why did he turn on his torturers to extract from Irish businesses in the form of back taxation those reserves upon which those businesses were existing, and with the withdrawal of which every Deputy knows that business after business has crumbled.  I am prepared to give it to him as a debating matter <Col N="2180" /> against me if he likes.  That does not matter.  But, if he believed what he said, how can he reconcile his conduct in the matter?  Forty or fifty million pounds of income taxation has, by that Government, been taken from the people, and they have so defined with approval the incidence of that tax.  The Deputy is perfectly right.  That tax is a burden upon industry, and in the attack which the Deputy has made he has indicted the whole policy of his own Government in relation to the methods by which they have extracted the tax.</P>
    <P>Let us take the second point. These are the only two points in the whole of the wordy one-and-three-quarter hours address which we listened to.  The second point he puts up is that on Fianna Fáil platforms it was declared that a saving of two million pounds could be made in the cost of the public services of this country without interfering with their efficiency or creating hardship.  That is his statement.  If that is put forward merely as a debating point against Fianna Fáil let them have it. If we are here to score debating points, let him say that on certain platforms such-and-such things were said.  But how far does that carry him?  Not an inch.  Here is the debating point put in the only form in which it can fairly be put&mdash;and I am anxious to give the Deputy every possible credit and value that he can get from it as a debating point&mdash;here is the debating point expanded: That Fianna Fáil having declared that the services of this country could be dealt with by an expenditure of two million pounds less, have inside three or four months of their coming into office, not produced the actual plan by which they promised to reduce expenses by that amount.  That is the whole basis of the thing, that we who are dealing with Estimates which have been framed by the late Government, that we who are dealing with machinery which we took over from them, that we who have to get down to the ordinary functions of Government, have not instantly provided in the form of a promise in this Budget, the economy of two million pounds which in fact we did state could be obtained, which in fact we do believe <Col N="2181" /> can be obtained, which in fact we do intend to obtain by proper organisation as and when the opportunity and the time can be given to it.</P>
    <P>Now the debating point being removed what is the position of the Deputy in relation to these two millions?  Is it suggested that because upon a political platform it was stated that this thing could be reduced by two millions, for that reason in this year we should reduce the actual amount of tax revenue by that amount?  Is that the suggestion he is making?  Let us see what that means as far as the Deputy is concerned. That is said on behalf of the ex-Ministry who have stated that the services could not be reduced by two millions, by one million or by any other such sum.  They who would say it would be wrong so to reduce the total expenditure, are blaming us because we do not say in this Budget that we will do it. If it is a serious matter, if this is not merely a debating society, and if the effort is not to secure a debating point, are they going to take up the position of saying that they who believe that the taxed revenue cannot be reduced, say it is our obligation to do what they say it is wrong to attempt to do?</P>
    <P>When you have dealt with these two points you have dealt with the whole of what the Deputy said.  We had repetition, time after time, of the two million pounds.  Time after time we had the story of the burden of income tax.  He has been responsible for extracting income tax to the extent that I have stated, and he was responsible when a Minister for saying it would be wrong to do the thing which to-day he demands we shall do, and attempts to blame us for not doing.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in income tax as a good thing, <i>per se</i>; I do not believe in taxation upon the necessaries of life as a good thing, <i>per se</i>; I do not believe in tariffs as a good thing, <i>per se</i>; I do not believe in policemen as a good thing, <i>per se</i>; I do not believe in armies as a good thing, <i>per se</i>; I do not believe in the compulsory notification of contagious diseases as a good <Col N="2182" /> thing, <i>per se</i>; because I do not believe in contagious diseases as a good thing, <i>per se.</i>  All these things are part of the necessary evils of human life.  All these are things which, in one degree or another, we have to face up to, and the consequence of which, in one degree or another, we have to mitigate in making the whole of the system of the enforcement services under which a community can live together. Tariffs, broadly speaking, ought to be the policeman, the national policeman, which will safeguard individual communities against the conscienceless exploitation of international trade.  To the extent to which they are used for that purpose, they are necessary and right in themselves in so far that they so perform a proper function.  There is no question at all about it, but tariffs, all over the world to-day, are being used for an entirely different purpose. They are being used for the purpose of smashing up, in organised Europe, and in the inter-relationship between two worlds, the whole of the channels of transport and inter-communication on which those highly organised communities live.  They are being used, not as protection, not as a medicine, not as food; but they are being used as weapons; they are being used for the purpose of challenge.  They are being used absolutely unintelligently for the purpose of driving the selfish interests of individual people.</P>
    <P>In our country we have to use them for an entirely different purpose, and so far as we do use them for that entirely different purpose of self-protection they are right.  The Deputy said we started a decade after other people.  We start 700 years after other people.  We start after 700 years of artificial interruption of the national development of our life.  We start nearly 70 years after the industrial revolution which reorganised the face of Europe.  We start from not merely scratch but a long way behind scratch. And no protection or instrument of protection which is in the possession or capacity of this or any other Government, whether it be that of fiscal protection in the form of tariffs, whether it be the protection of discriminatory <Col N="2183" /> taxation, or whether, above all, it is the protection of conscious national purpose permeating through the people, and energising and operating in every act of their practical economic life, there is no single weapon of that kind which in the actual emergency in which we stand in relation to our development and the development of other countries of the world, we are entitled to neglect.</P>
    <P>And it is because in this Budget there is an attempt to use, to the extent to which they can use, at the present moment, these particular resources which they have at their disposal, that I commend this Budget.  I speak as probably the most conservatively-minded man in this country in his outlook upon economics and it is as one so conservatively-minded, that I defend it.  It is said we are taking from the community an immense amount of money.  We are. We could pretend we were not.  We could have borrowed.  We could have put off to next year, or the year after, the burdens that we ought to bear this year.  We could have done as the previous administration did, sell something that was loose and not tied down. I remember the first Budget speech of Deputy Blythe which I had the experience of hearing here.  I described it as the Budget of a dishonest holder of an entailed estate.  It was the Budget of a man who cut down the growing timber and sold it for firewood.  It was the Budget of a man who had eaten somebody else's seed potatoes.  It was the Budget of a man who had sold everything that he could lay his hands upon that belonged to his heirs, and sold it for his own interest.  That has not been done here.  The complaint is that it has not been done here.</P>
    <P>The complaint is, to take a specific case, that the Minister for Finance, in a case where he could have got away with it&mdash;the £550,000 provided for local loans in which the House probably would have accorded him at least acquiescence in doing it&mdash;even to that degree, he would not default on his Budget.  That is the complaint.  The complaint is that he has been honest. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;the £550,000 on local loans, you are getting it back.&rdquo;<Col N="2184" /> Here is the legitimate case that can be put for the Minister for Finance not doing the honest thing he has done. The £550,000 for local loans, why charge that up to taxation?  Are you not getting it back?  Are you not getting interest and sinking fund on it? Why cannot you charge that back to local loans?  For the simple reason that every year we are pouring into local loans more than is coming back. The Local Loans Fund is rising far more quickly than it is being repaid. In addition to that, from the Central Fund into which is fed only taxation, there is being paid out every year more and more money to local authorities for the purpose of enabling them to pay us the interest on the money which we lent to them. That is the reason, and it is because the Minister for Finance has had the honesty to face up to that fact, which he might very easily have ignored, that he is accused of being harsh, hard and doctrinaire.</P>
    <P>We have heard the story of the money which is going to be raised from outdoor sports and the money that is merely substitution money which is being taken out of the tea tax, of the hardship and all the rest of it, and of the three extra sixpences on income tax.  Let us agree to everything that has been said here about those things. Do they alter the fact that of normal expenditure on the estimates provided by the outgoing Government, on the estimates of the yield of the taxes imposed by the outgoing Government made by the officials who dealt with them and worked for it, that he was £3,700,000 in arrears?  Let me accept all over again every word he says. Income tax is an outrage on industry. It is an outrage to tax outside sports.  It is a dreadful thing to send people with or without hair shirts to dances.  I say again, accept every word of it, add to it, multiply it, exaggerate it, make platform speeches of it, do what you like with it, but will you get over the fact that there is still £3,750,000 approximately to be found on your normal Budgets?  When they have not got over it, and when they have thrown away, as they have in every debating speech, the merit and the legitimacy <Col N="2185" /> of every tax that is here imposed, tell us the other taxes.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan will not stand for income tax.  He will not stand either for hair shirts at dances.  He will not stand for a tea tax.  He will not stand for a reduction of the Civil Service.  Will he stand for a deficit of £3,750,000?  That is the issue.  He will not.  Then what are his other taxes?  Where is he going to get the £3,750,000 which he will not give to us under the scheme in which we are asking for it?  He has gone out. That is what he always does, gets out. He ought to be here.  This is the time for him to deliver the goods.  An hour and a half of words!  We want ten minutes of sound work, telling us about the £3,750,000's worth of taxation to balance the normal Budget which he is prepared to substitute for ours. Will he put in sugar instead of tea? What is he going to tax?  One million pounds on income tax?  He will not have it.  What is he going to put a tax of £1,000,000 on, or is he going to leave it as a deficit?  Adjustments in tea, sugar, beer, tobacco, buses and entertainments, £595,250?  What is he going to give us for that £595,000? Just going to sit by, just going to complain of everything, just going to be a critic, produce nothing.  I put it to this House, I put it to the conscience of every individual Cumann na nGaedheal member that if they object to these taxes they must formulate an alternative or they must openly come out with the resolution that this Budget be allowed to be unbalanced to the extent of £3,750,000, because this Dáil has not got the courage to face the country and tell it the truth about the position, one or the other.</P>
    <P>It may be said, it has been said by insinuation, that this £27,064,000 which we say we have to budget for as the normal Budget is unduly expanded.  Of that £27,000,000, £26,794,000 is on their own estimates, the estimates which they say could not be reduced.  The onus is on them, having regard to what they know of the decrease in the yield of the <Col N="2186" /> existing taxation, either to take the responsibility of saying they will not pay their debts, they will not meet their obligations, they will not pay their outgoings out of income or to find for us alternative taxation over which they will stand in providing that deficit.  I am perfectly sure that they have not left the ex-Minister for Justice here to tell us how you are going to do that.</P>
    <P>Now, turn to the second portion of the Budget, the emergency Budget&mdash; income tax on hospitals' receipts from sweepstakes, £650,000.  What did we hear from the ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce?  Did we hear any complaint about that except that it should not be called income tax?  Is there anyone here who is going to say that in this particular emergency, faced by the unemployment condition we have, faced by the collapse of the whole international structure of exchange and commodities, that we are to turn our back on the £650,000 which we have here from the Sweeps.  What is the alternative?  Come on, Cumann na nGaedheal!  Give me a tax out of which you are going to find £650,000, or do you prefer &mdash;&mdash;</P>

He was never there before and never required there. How long is it going to take me to go through the place to find out where all these bunny rabbits have been put away?  How much of the total revenue of the country is a patronage fund? How much of the £26,000,000 which is brought into the Central Fund?  I know the pressure that is already upon me, the pressure that is upon us, to use it as a patronage fund because it has been used as a patronage fund.  I do not know how much this thing can be pulled down, but my experience of what I have actually seen up to the present is such that I have no hesitation in saying that without interfering in any way with the efficiency of the service, without putting any illegitimate or improper hardship on anybody, that money can be found out of the existing revenue and leave us a better machine, a more effective machine, a machine not clogged as it is now by all sorts of supernumeraries, all sorts of the relics of prejudice, victimisation and patronage.</P>
      <P>Special collection of income tax arrears, £350,000&mdash;anybody objecting to that?  Come on, Cumann na nGaedheal again.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>An inducement to be honest; and I will say that human nature being what it is, most of us require a lot of inducement to be honest.  Provided in normal Budget for Local Loans Fund, £550,000&mdash;£550,000, which though it is <Col N="2188" /> put in the emergency Budget, is going to be paid for out of taxation.  What is the complaint?  Again, I say to you, you must face up to the issue.  I accept every word that was said of an attack on every single tax that is made without any hesitation.  They are all evil, and to the extent to which they are unnecessary they are all wrong.  Prove them wrong.  Find us a substitute for the tax which you refuse to impose.</P>
      <P>I remember another Budget of Mr. Blythe's.  I remember the last word which I, unfortunately, had to say in relation to it.  That was, that it was a Budget which was more honest than his previous Budgets, in the sense that there was less to steal&mdash;but it was no better than his previous Budgets in that there was absolutely nothing in it of a recognition of the active possibilities of the dynamic function of taxation as distinct from purely passive.  In other words, the defect in the Budgets which we have had up to the present was that they have been merely an attempt to find money.  There has been no attempt whatever in those Budgets to use the instrument of taxation for the purpose of actually developing and helping production.  This Budget does not suffer from that.  You may call this Budget reckless.  You may call it foolish.  You may call it mad.  You may call it anything you like, but you cannot call it passive.  No one can deny that this Budget is a Budget of courage, that it is a Budget of faith, that it is a Budget of intention to produce production.  That is the radical difference, the generic difference between it and the Budgets of the last eight or nine years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basis of all the previous Budgets has been that after all this is a poor little country, surrounded by highly organised communities, and that it is very risky and very dangerous to come out from under the shelter of our poverty and inactivity into a world in which we may get rich but we might get wiped out.  The thing is to lie close.  This Budget does not.  This Budget deliberately comes out in the open with the intention of using all the resources <Col N="2189" /> of this country, all its land, all its geographical position, all its man power and above all all its love of Ireland itself for the purpose of organising the community as one in which a considerable population of Irish people will live upon a higher standard of comfort.  It is a first step towards using direct and indirect taxation for the precise purpose which John Punch had in view when he led us out in what was called a no-income-tax campaign.  The no-income-tax campaign was begun when there was a 6/- income tax.  It was begun on a recognition of the truth of every statement that has been made on these benches in relation to income tax and knowledge of the fact that you cannot take out of industry more than that industry produces.  You cannot take out of that industry in any form an amount which will not leave in it the seed potato, which will not leave in it the means of its own repair, its own development.  With 1/- income tax or 2/- income tax you could ignore that factor.  It can be hidden. People can be deceived into closing their eyes to facts of that sort but not when you are dealing with 5/- income tax.  It is a very different thing when in a Budget of this kind you have got to meet the obvious intensity of the impact of that particular tax upon industry.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister for Finance is under no more illusions upon that subject than anybody else.  Income tax is justifiable as an emergency tax. A high income tax is justified as an emergency tax.  All sorts of things are justified as emergency taxes, just in the same way as the captain of a ship may be justified in burning his own bulwarks, his own furniture and his own cargo if necessary, to bring his ship into port.  High taxation of any kind, the withdrawal of that portion of the products of industry which are necessary for its maintenance as a permanent proposition, is not a sound proposition, and I sincerely hope that we in this particular case are starting out upon a road in which there will be less and less of that necessary money which ought to be left in Irish industry taken out of it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2190" /> The Minister for Finance has started out upon that road in this Budget.  For the first time you find enshrined&mdash;I use the word deliberately&mdash;because this will be a memorable Budget from that point of view&mdash;the machinery by which there is protection afforded Irish capital invested in Irish business.  For the first time you find in a Budget an attempt made to build up a system under which the primary industries will belong to the people inside this country, in which, instead of being hewers of wood and drawers of water for outsiders to the extent to which any industry is permitted, our industry will be an industry which belongs to ourselves, which functions for ourselves, and whose development is controlled in the interest of ourselves.  I am prepared to give full weight to every argument which has been put up against the Budget.  It is not the faintest use to close our eyes to them.  all I can say is, if your criticism holds, you must take the responsibility of an alternative.  It has been said in relation to this particular activity of the Minister in subsidising under relief of income tax money which is put into new Irish industries, that he is doing something which is quite illogical.  I agree.  We were right up against that from the first day of the Internal Income Tax Exemption Committee, to give it its right name.  That was the first proposition made.  The obvious answer is that in so doing you are undoubtedly helping those who come newly into industry as against those who have been previously there.  If a good policy is to be thrown down because it is not perfect, throw this down. The best is always the enemy of the good.  The Minister has made the first step forward, and it is a sound step in itself.  It is the one which will produce the most immediate effect in the direction he wants.  The expedient of discriminative taxation in the interests of development of home industry is distinctly wide, and there is no difficulty in further Budgets, as and when the money is available, in increasing that discrimination in a direction which will tend to equalise the benefit as between those who have previously engaged in Irish industry and those about to engage in it now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2191" /> In a second case, the Minister has used the power of taxation from a discriminative and Irish development point of view.  In relation to the tobacco industry he has given us a lead which, if effectively and logically followed, will enable us to get possession, if we choose to do so, of the whole of the industries of this country in our own hands, and for the benefit of our own nationals.  It is principally because the Budget faces up to that fact that I am in favour of it.  In another way the Minister has shown the courage of stepping outside the line of conventional Budgets. Those whose memories can go back a considerable distance will remember that the ex-Minister for Finance told us that he had a shot left in the locker for the banks.  That was his idea of conservative finance.  His idea of conservative finance was to attack without any knowledge whatever of the relative strength of himself and those he was attacking.  We are not doing anything of the kind.  Our outlook upon finance is a conservative one.  Our intention is to use to the fullest possibility the existing machinery before we attempt to alter it.  In this Budget the Minister for Finance, instead of having shots in the locker for the banks, instead of threatening a finance system or anything of that kind, instead of trailing his coat, has done a perfectly conservative and perfectly orderly thing in resuming, for the benefit of the State, part of the property of the State.</P>
    <P>There is mention of hidden assets still in Ireland, most of which I must presume the previous Government did not know of, or they would have stolen them, as they did the money for education, as they did the money belonging to the Congested Districts Board, as they did the interest on savings certificates, and everything else they could lay their hands upon.  There was a loan of £6,000,000 by the Irish people, without interest, to certain people.  The Minister is taking one and a half per cent. interest upon that loan.  Will anybody objecting to that in Cumann na nGaedheal offer us any alternative tax which they prefer?  I <Col N="2192" /> deliberately put it to the honesty of those who sit on the back benches of Cumann na nGaedheal, who, though we may differ from them, we know in their individual relations with their families, with tradesmen, and with their friends are as honest and as decent men as we are&mdash;I put it to them that it is a simple problem: a deficit of £3,750,000; you object to our method of raising it; what is yours? I put it to them as honest men that if they cannot find the alternative then the place for honest men is in our lobby, voting with us to find it by our means.  There is no escape from that. You have got to find the money or you have got to let us find it.  It has got to be found.</P>
    <P>We are told that we have made extravagant provision for unemployment, and that in the form of tariffs and all the rest we have put on the farmer an intolerable burden which he cannot bear.  We have done nothing of the sort.  There is not one single penny in this Budget for unemployment which is being taken from farmers.  What we have done in this Budget is to tell you what would have been taken from you if it was not introduced.  Do you think the 80,000 people who are unemployed are being kept for nothing?  Unless somebody is paying for them and keeping them they ought to be lying dead upon the road.  They are not.  Who is keeping them?  On whose shoulders lies the intolerable burden of maintaining in idleness 80,000 people who might be at work?  It lies upon the shoulders of the people upon whom the Opposition say we are putting an intolerable burden, when we take from the community money they would have otherwise to pay to maintain these people in idleness.  You say that there is an intolerable burden of £910,000, however calculated, in this Budget. What about the intolerable burden of 30,000 more unemigratable people next year, the year after, and every year <i>in sxcula sxculorum,</i> if the world remains as mad and as foolish as it is now?  Who is going to bear that burden?  Who is going to maintain 30,000 young men and young women every year?  Unless you shut down <Col N="2193" /> the production of human beings you will have to maintain them.  That is the intolerable burden which lies upon this people; the necessity of throwing out of this country in the last ten years 250,000 of its best, the intolerable burden of maintaining to-day 80,000 people, and of having added to that 80,000, 30,000 every year until the burden upon the producers becomes so great that they will break down completely and openly under it.  We are telling you the truth.</P>
    <P>How are we spending that money?  I have spoken to you as a man conservative in outlook in these matters.  Unemployment relief is a thing I have no use for; poor relief is a thing I have no use for; all that kind of thing I have no use for, if I can avoid it.</P>
    <P>I do not avoid it by sticking my head in the sand and pretending it is not there.  Every man whom we are going to employ will have to be kept. His wife and children will have to be kept, if we do not employ him, through the medium of home assistance, the St. Vincent de Paul Society, charity, or the hospital.  There will have to be added to the cost of his maintenance the high cost of insuring this country, by the enforcement service of the police, against the consequences of the causes of discontent born in people who live in poverty, humiliation, sorrow and privation&mdash;they and their children&mdash;which they know they have not deserved.  Add those charges together and put them against this provision. We have tried to get an economic value in relation to the money we have provided.  There are two ways of looking at the money from the point of view of money which you borrow.  (1) There is money which you know you would spend, which you would give in charity to someone who is down and out.  That is money which you spend, where you must spend it, on purely humanitarian grounds, caring nothing whether you get value or not so long as somebody has food and lodgings for the night.  (2) There is money for which you get an immediate, obvious, commercial return.  The one is hopelessly <Col N="2194" /> uneconomic.  The other is obviously economic.  Between the two, there is money which is just economic. I define &ldquo;just economic&rdquo; from the point of view of the State in relation to unemployment, in this way&mdash;it is a definition which is open to examination, and I think it is in the frank examination of things of this kind in a non-controversial way we can get good results rather than in merely sparring for points&mdash;I define money which is &ldquo;just economic&rdquo; as money which a State, reasonably prosperous, would willingly borrow for a purpose, believing it got value for the money&mdash; which it would take without being either pressed or without being particularly avaricious.  We have taken that standard in relation to the works which we propose to do for the sum of about two million pounds which is going to be used for the purpose of unemployment relief.  I have calculated that if men were employed under this scheme and merely paid 3/- a week or between 3/- and 3/6 over the period of their employment, this scheme would be soundly economic. Can you maintain them in idleness, hunger and discontent for that amount of money.  You have got to maintain them.</P>
    <P>I have gone to the trouble of having estimates made by various people with different outlooks as to the cost of maintaining one of our unemployed population.  The estimate varies from 15/- to 23/-.  I am inclined to take a figure of about 18/- or 19/- as being a reasonable average.  If you employ the men whom we are going to employ and if you charge up or credit this fund with anything like 18/- or 19/- a man for the people whom we would otherwise have to maintain in idleness. This is an enterprise which the Minister for Finance can not only stand over but stand over boastfully.</P>
    <P>It is because the Budget faces with courage facts which it might evade, it is because it attempts to use the Budgetary powers of the State for the purpose of production, it is because it recognises the responsibility of the State to use its emergency powers for the purpose of dealing openly instead <Col N="2195" /> of secretly with the sore and sorrow and shame of unmerited unemployment and poverty, it is because it is a Budget of courage, a Budget of hope, a Budget of production that I commend it to the House.  I ask for it the votes of Irishmen, the votes of those who want to see this country come out of the Slough of Despond in which it is and occupy the position not of a great, rich and powerful country, which it never will be, but come out, at any rate, into the comparative sunlight, as a country sustaining a considerable population on a widely distributed standard of frugal comfort&mdash; a country in which the people can look forward not merely to being able to live in it themselves but to their children being able to remain and live in it also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The pre-election programme of the Fianna Fáil Party was, in my opinion, and in the opinion of my colleagues, heavily overloaded. Even the most enthusiastic followers of the Fianna Fáil Party could not expect that that programme would be completely fulfilled during the life of this Parliament.  Coming into office as the Fianna Fáil Goverment has come into office after the estimates had been prepared by their predecessors and with a very limited period within which to prepare a Budget, I think, on the whole the Budget of the Minister for Finance is one which we would expect from a Minister with a truly Christian outlook.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can say, as Deputy Norton has already said, that, taking all the circumstances into consideration, and bearing in mind the capacity of the people to pay, the Minister has made reasonable provision during the coming financial year for social services.  Could Deputy McGilligan, the ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce, judging this Budget on its merits, produce any evidence to show that the reduction in income tax which took place while his Party was in office helped to any considerable extent to provide employment <Col N="2196" /> for our people?  I would like Deputy Good, speaking on behalf of industrialists and capitalists, to give the House some information on that very important aspect of the Budget. On previous occasions, particularly during the period of office of the Government that he helped to keep in office, Deputy Good demanded and received reductions in income tax, stating it was his belief that such a policy would help to provide more employment.  I have searched in vain the statements of the ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce in an effort to find evidence in support of that contention.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned to find out from the Minister for Finance to what extent the money provided in the Budget for the relief of unemployment, roughly £1,000,000, and the sum of £5,000,000 that will be provided for a national housing scheme, will be expended during the current financial year.  Will the £5,000,000 to be provided for national housing be spent under the supervision of a national housing board, such as was promised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or are we to understand that none of the money will be available until that board is actually functioning?</P>
    <P>Many people talk about the worries and troubles of the income tax payer. In this pauperised world I think people should regard it as an honour to be in a position to pay income tax.  I have no sympathy for the people about whom speakers on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches have been complaining because of the increase in income tax.  The least they may do out of their incomes&mdash;and they can be regarded as wealthy&mdash;is contribute something towards the people who are unable to find work and who are not in a position to provide a decent standard of maintenance for their dependents.  It is true the increase in income tax may affect some sections of the community.  I have been told that some people whose spiritual home is outside this country and who have remained here for the last few years because the income tax rate was lower than in England, may now be <Col N="2197" /> forced to go out of this country and live for the future in their real, spiritual surroundings.  That may, to a certain extent, affect employment, but that will be nothing to the extent to which employment will be found as a result of the provisions made by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am not by any means as enthusiastic as the Minister or his supporters regarding the possibilities of providing additional employment as a result of the imposition of tariffs.  I have always held the view that tariffs cannot help to any great extent to provide employment without a very definite guarantee from capitalists or the banks that they will do their part to help to build industry.  I believe that without that assistance tariffs will not help to provide employment.  What is the use of imposing tariffs and hoping that capitalists will provide the money for the development of industries?  The provision of minimum amount of capital is very necessary for the setting up of industries.  What is the position in regard to our capitalists?  They are responsible for sending out £195,000,000, money which has been accumulated by the sweat of Irish labour.  That is invested in speculative investments on the British Stock Exchange. Can the Ministry hold out any hope that the individuals who do that will be made bring their money back to this country and put it into the development of Irish industry?</P>
    <P>I was present with a deputation which met the Minister for Industry and Commerce concerning the possibility of reviving the furniture-making industry that was recently closed down in Edenderry.  The last Government provided a guaranteed loan at the expense of the taxpayers to the extent of £28,000.  The provision of that money since 1924 until the closing down of the factory put into circulation in Edenderry and district, in wages, a sum of £184,000.  Most of that money found its way into the pockets of the local merchants.  The four principal merchants who accompanied me on that deputation would not put up one penny for the re-establishment of that industry in their own native town.</P>

      <P>Is that to be taken as an example of the mentality of our Irish capitalists?  If it is, I warn the Minister for Industry and Commerce that there is very little hope of establishing industry if we have to find the necessary capital from private sources.</P>
      <P>If that is the position which confronts the Minister, and if there is any intention on the part of the Government to set up new industries, they will have to fall back upon State capital.  I notice in a Press report that the Minister for Finance had an interview recently with representatives of the Joint Stock Banks. I wonder did he discuss with them what assistance they are prepared to give to help him and the Government to build up industries?</P>
      <P>From information I have at my disposal I understand the banks are putting on the screw much more stiffly to-day than during the period of office of the last Government.  I know some banks are responsible for closing down certain business concerns which previously employed a great number of men and which, without some pressure from the Minister, will never be reopened. There are many Deputies who know that the banks are by no means friendly to industrial or agricultural development.  Does the Minister believe that the policy of the banking institutions is likely to conform to the national needs so far as agriculture or industry is concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While you may take the Oath out of the Constitution, while you may change the colour of the flag that floats over Leinster House, while you may call this Parliament anything you like, I hold that the real rulers of the country are the people who sit in banking institutions in College Green behind closed doors.  Unless and until the Minister and the Government make up their minds that they will compel these people to conform to national <Col N="2199" /> needs, unless they bring about a reorganisation of our existing banking institutions and nationalise them if necessary, there is no use in wasting our time here talking about industrial or agricultural development.  Is there any farm, large or small, free from mortgage which is worth a penny for security purposes to any of our banks? So far as I know there is not, and until the Minister deals with the question from the point of view of national need we will be merely wasting our time imposing tariffs in the hope that their imposition will bring about increased employment.</P>

      <P>I believe some of the tariffs have been, perhaps, unnecessarily imposed and without the slightest consideration for the consequences so far as disemployment of people is concerned.  I have been given many glaring examples of where the imposition of certain tariffs is likely to disemploy a considerable number.  Can the Minister tell us, even approximately, the number likely to be disemployed during this financial year as a result of the imposition of tariffs, and can he give also the number likely to find employment because of the tariffs?  I am greatly afraid if the Minister insists on some tariffs being maintained there is likely to be a larger number disemployed by the end of the financial year than there are people likely to find new means of employment.  I hope I am wrong, but the Minister, who has much more material at his disposal, may perhaps be able to give <Col N="2200" /> a more accurate estimate from that aspect of the situation.</P>
      <P>A packet tax of 2d. has been imposed. I believe the Minister had certain things in mind when imposing it. A typical case was brought to my notice regarding the possible effects of that tariff upon certain employed people.  The British Legion in Dublin have been spending, roughly, £3,000 a year for the last few years in providing periodical or casual employment for a number of their people.  They employ their members for two weeks out of twenty-six and provide them with a fairly decent rate of wages. Some years ago the responsible people associated with the British Legion set up a sort of fish sales department; as a result of which they are employing 41 persons.</P>
      <P>I am told that the imposition of the package tax of 2d. per package upon imported fish which is being distributed largely over provincial Ireland is likely to destroy that small industry and throw these 41 persons immediately out of employment.  I am not sure whether the Minister has been furnished with the actual details of these cases.  I can, if he wishes, furnish him with the full details now.  I hope the Minister may reconsider the effect of that tax upon the industry, and that if he is satisfied he will remove the tax and allow the industry to be carried on until such time as some other body or association may be able to undertake the same class of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have intervened in this debate for the purpose of taking very strong exception to the proposal of the Minister for Finance to reduce the seating tax on buses.  I will repeat for the House a paragraph in the report upon which the Minister justified his action in that matter: &ldquo;The particularly difficult position in which many small passenger-carrying concerns have been placed by the imposition and increase of the petrol tax and by the seating tax on omnibuses has been brought under my notice.  I have had the situation carefully <Col N="2201" /> investigated and I am satisfied that, unless some relief be afforded many of these concerns will be driven out of business and many people thrown out of employment.  The Government could not permit such a position to arise and accordingly have decided to reduce the seating tax in the case of buses by 33? per cent. as from the end of the current quarter. This concession will cost about £23,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister for Finance whether he, at any time, had talked that matter over with the Minister for Industry and Commerce before he decided to alter that tax or whether he had any information from the people who made representations to him as to the rates of wages, the conditions generally, of the workers employed by these small bus companies, and whether he has any idea whatsoever of the effect of that reduction in taxes upon people engaged in other sections of the transport industry?  Surely the Minister for Finance or his colleagues in the Ministry will not tell us that there is a shortage of buses upon the roads in this country.  Surely the Minister for Industry and Commerce will tell him the reason for introducing and passing certain legislation in this House, and he will be able to tell him that certain roads in this country, particularly the roads around our cities are overloaded with buses carrying on a cut-throat competition. That is making the bus business in this State uneconomic.  The Minister knows that that competition is severe, and that many of the small bus companies have been driven out of competition on the roads by the more wealthy companies.  That is because the small companies have not the capital to carry on long enough.</P>
    <P>Naturally I have read and read very carefully, particularly during the election period, the promises made on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party in reference to the transport industry. During the general election period special appeals were issued to railway men, and specially written appeals were actually sent around to their private houses by the candidates <Col N="2202" /> of the Fianna Fáil Party seeking election. The Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking at a specially convened meeting of railwaymen at Inchicore on 1st February, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil may be described as a pro-railway Party.</P>
    <P>I am sure that was loudly applauded by the railway men listening to him.</P>
    <P>We realise that a revival of the industry cannot be brought about unless the railways are preserved. That can only be done if the cream of the traffic now being taken from them by the road services is returned to them.</P>
    <P>In Athlone a few days afterwards the same Minister, answering a question put by the stationmaster in Athlone, who was speaking for a large number in that area said:</P>
    <P>The preservation of the railways was necessary and if Fianna Fáil got into power they would see that at least the railways would get sufficient traffic as would make revenue cover expenditure.  To get that traffic some proper control would have to be exercised over road transport services.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister for Finance, although I cannot produce any Press report to support it, addressed a meeting of railwaymen at Broadstone, a populous railway centre, and not alone did he promise the railwaymen the same terms as the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but he actually promised the men who were dismissed that they would be reinstated if his Party were returned to power.</P>

      <P>I do not want to claim any special privileges for the railway undertaking through the agency of this Parliament.  I do not directly represent railway interests in this House. but I do think that if Deputies stand for fair competition within this industry they should consider the circumstances under which the State is giving assistance to one or other section of it.  What is the position from the workers point of view?  The small bus companies, for which the Minister for Finance has now such concern are people who are employing their workers for 16, 18 and 20 hours a day at anything from 10/- to 30/- per week. They are doing that in and around this City as well as in Cork, Limerick, Waterford and other centres, whereas the railways, bad and all as they may be, stupid and all as their directors may be from the point of view of transport policy, are employing their workers under recognised trade union conditions.  From the latest returns available, I find that the number of people engaged in the bus services operating in this State in August last was 2,150, the highest point, as far as I can find out, employment has ever reached.  The railways at the same time were employing 16,483.  Taking the weekly wage paid by the small and the large bus companies to the men employed on the road services it averaged £2 7s. 6d. a week, compared with £2 16s. 6d. a week which was the average paid to those employed by the railways.  I am in a position to produce evidence to the Minister for Finance that bus services operating in his own constituency are paying the conductors as low a wage as 10/- a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are these the people for whom the Minister has concern in his Budget, for whom he is going to provide at the taxpayer's expense remission in taxation to the tune of £23,000?  If so I want to know what he is going to do <Col N="2204" /> for the railways?  Is he going to go on the same lines and give the same fair treatment, or at all events something like equal treatment to the railways, which are employing people under recognised trade union conditions?</P>
    <P>I was amazed, aye, and many railway men who were gulled into voting for Fianna Fáil candidates at the last general election, are amazed and flabbergasted, that the Minister should now come along and make provision of this kind in his Budget.  I have read extracts from speeches delivered by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on this aspect of Fianna Fáil policy during the general election.  I hope I will be able to get some assurance from the Minister for the Finance that some attempt will be made by him to carry out the promises made during the general election during the period he is in office.  I hope the Minister for Industry and Commerce will not go to Ottawa until we have heard from him in this House what steps he intends to take to give effect to the promises he made during the general election period.</P>
    <P>I gave my vote for the election of a Fianna Fáil Government in the hope that that Government, when it came into office, would carry out its promises on these and other matters.  I want to tell the Minister for Finance here and now that I will not help&mdash;in fact, that I will do everything I possibly can to see that that portion of his Budget statement is cut out of the Finance Bill should such a provision be in it when it comes to the House.  In doing that, I will simply be reminding him of the promises his colleagues and himself made and helping him to carry out in a fair and straightforward way these promises.  I do not believe this State should give any assistance, by way of the remission of taxation or by the imposition of tariffs, to any set of industrialists in this country who will not recognise and pay a decent rate of wages to the workers engaged in the industries helped.  The small bus companies I have referred to are blacklegs in the industrial world so far as we are concerned.</P>
    <P>There are other matters which one <Col N="2205" /> might deal with on a Budget statement of this kind.  I do not intend to take up the time of the House any longer. Were it not for the fact that I was specially requested to do so, I would not have intervened in the debate at this time.  But I have been specially requested by the railwaymen, to whom pledges were given, to ask the Minister for Finance to withdraw the provision I have been referring to from his Budget, not to proceed with the carrying out of it until he finds out more about the conditions of the people who persuaded him to give this remission in taxation.</P>
    <P>I invite him, if necessary, to recall the deputation to his office to whom the Government made this promise, the deputation from whom they heard these representations and allow me to bring a deputation representing the trade unionists of this country to meet them face to face. If he does that then we can have this argued out on its merits from the taxpayers' and the workers' point of view.  If the Minister thinks it right to receive a deputation representing the small or the large bus companies, then I think before proceeding to give effect to the proposal outlined in his Budget he should also hear the case to be made by those representing the other point of view.  I think it is only fair that he should hear the workers' as well as the employers' point of view before remitting the taxation that is proposed here in this particular case.</P>
    <P>I hold the view that there is no future for the railways of this country, that there is no hope for the continued employment of the 16,483 men presently engaged on the railways in that great national service in which £26,000,000 of the Irish people's money is invested, unless something is done by this legislature within the next six months.  I have no hope, I admit, of bringing back prosperity to our railways through the agency of the stupid board of directors that is responsible for the present policy of the railways. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has stated that his Party is <Col N="2206" /> a pro-railway party.  Therefore, when we have a pro-railway Government I think the request I am making is a fair one; it is that within a reasonable period, before he goes to Ottawa, the Minister for Industry and Commerce would tell the House what plans he proposes to put into operation to save the railways.  In the meantime I am going to insist that the small bus owners who are getting this concession by way of a reduction in taxation shall not be given any further assistance by the taxpayers until some opportunity has been given to the Minister to look into the matter on its merits.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister concludes there is just one point that I would like to have cleared up.  I gave him notice yesterday about it. Under Resolution 7, paragraph 15, a tax is imposed on books, and there is considerable uncertainty as to what precisely that means.  For example, it would appear that a book coming in singly to an individual is not taxed. I was told this morning&mdash;the Minister can confirm it perhaps&mdash;that books coming to circulating libraries are not taxed, but about that I am not sure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Carnegie Central Students' Library is of invaluable assistance to University professors, students, teachers, and people interested in learning generally and it has had tax stopped from it.  Its position is that it sends books to England and gets them back from England.  If the tax is imposed as it stands at present this library may be in the position of having to pay tax on books coming in in bulk, and, when it sends them to England, of having to pay again when they come back.  We do not know what the word &ldquo;bulk&rdquo; means, whether it has application to books, and, if it has, what the application is.  For example, is it intended to tax educational books?  Taking the <Col N="2207" /> higher reaches of secondary schools, you could not possibly get the books in use printed in Ireland.  Is it intended to tax, when coming in in bulk, say, a number of French or German books?  Is it intended to tax, say, ten books of educational value, and all by different authors, coming to the librarian of University College?  Is that &ldquo;books in bulk&rdquo; or does books in bulk mean simply ten copies of the same book?  We do not know that, and I would like the Minister to make it clear, because if the position is, that books coming in in that way are to be taxed, you are simply adding to the cost of education, to the cost to institutions, and the cost to individual parents.</P>
      <P>There is one other point in paragraph 34 of the same Resolution, relating to manufactured articles of brass and tin.  It has been put to me that, if very strictly interpreted, that would include balances used in laboratories, both in secondary schools and universities, which are not made here.  This would impose a tax on education, and perhaps the Minister would deal with it before the Report Stage.  I know that we will have an opportunity of dealing with it on the Report Stage, but it would be reassuring, particularly in the case of books, if the Minister would tell us something definite.</P>

      <P>I came here at the request of the people of my constituency. I did not look for the position, but I came here because I hoped to give a helping hand in building up the country. It does not matter to me, or to the people I represent, what Party sits on the Government Benches, so long as it makes for prosperity.  No amount of oratory on the part of Deputy Flinn will exonerate the Fianna Fáil Party from the pledges they made to the electorate during the election.  They promised them definitely, at the expense of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, that they would reduce taxation by two million pounds.  But what is the position to-day?  I am not going to devote very much time to it, because it has been already spoken of by several Deputies.  They have increased taxation by £3,500,000.  Deputy Flinn made a statement which I never heard, that it was circulated that the farmers of the country were paying £2,000,000, which they were giving in relief works. The farmers of this country claim they pay 70 to 75 per cent. of the taxation directly or indirectly, and I put it to the Minister for Finance that if that statement is true, is it not also quite true that they are paying 70 or 75 per cent. of this £2,000,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I am entitled to bring in the <Col N="2209" /> butter bounty.  This is a tax which is going to hit the unfortunate poor people very hard.  Two years ago, when there was an agitation for de-rating, the farmers then said that they were not in favour of de-rating if the money was to come from the poor, and recently you had a similar expression of opinion from the farmers of West Cork and West Limerick, that they were not in favour of the 4d. bounty, if it was to come from the poor.  The Minister, in introducing his Budget, talked of the limited resources of the State.  There are £250,000 to be given for the relief of rates on agricultural land.  I do not know how this is to be allocated, and it does not matter to me, but what I would suggest is that that £250,000 should be put as part payment of the butter bounty while our resources are so limited.  There is also an Estimate for £270,000 for pensions, including £20,000 in respect of military service pensions, and I suggest that this proposal should be allowed to stand over until our financial resources are not as limited as they are to-day, the money being also used for the payment of the butter bounty.</P>
    <P>I come from probably one of the poorest constituencies in the Free State, where there are a very industrious people, and I say this, that as the Old Age Pensions Act is being administered, I can see no hardship inflicted on anybody in my constituency. I stand over that, and I take responsibility for it.  I think it is most unfair to tax the poor people for the benefit of others who are better off.  I know one woman who was in receipt of 10/- a week, of which she paid 4/- for a room, leaving 6/- for maintenance, and is it fair to make that unfortunate woman pay 4d. a lb. extra on butter?  Is it fair to tax the people in receipt of home assistance and old age pensions for the benefit of others?  This is an important matter, and I ask the House to consider it carefully, without prejudice. I do not say that I would not be willing to give old age pensions where they are wanted, but I think that the Department of Finance should inquire and find out the full particulars before taxing these poor people.</P>

      <P>I do not think that, rising at this stage, I would be right in concluding this debate, without adverting to the shocking waste of Parliamentary time which has been indulged in by the Opposition.  We have had, on this Budget resolution, a much more protracted debate than we had on any previous occasion, within my experience. Yet, this morning, we had Deputy McGilligan getting up and repeating, ad nauseam, even to the absurdities, the speech which was made on the previous day by Deputy Cosgrave.  We have had this Budget criticised, because it put, as somebody said, a tax on cosmetics, and because it reduced the allowance to unmarried persons, but we have not had, as Deputy Flinn said this morning, one expression of opinion from any member of the Opposition, condemning the social programme outlined in that Budget, and even if they were not prepared, as we are prepared to do, to discharge our duty to the citizens who have put us here; even if they were not prepared to make any provision for the relief of unemployment, even if they were not prepared to make any contribution to a solution of the housing problem or to do something more for the old age pensioners, the Opposition did not indicate how they were going, this year, to balance the Budget.  There has been nothing but barren criticism, and not one single constructive idea, not one single helpful suggestion during the three days this Budget has been discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I leave that for one moment, because I would like to deal at this stage with the specific point raised by Deputy Michael Hayes as to the definition of books in bulk.  The intention of this particular duty on printed matter is that it shall apply only to books imported in bulk for sale.  One single book, or copies of two or more books, coming to a private individual are not regarded as a bulk quantity for the purposes of the Resolution.  The Revenue Commissioners will not allow the entry, free of duty, of two copies of the same book to a trader, nor will <Col N="2211" /> they allow the entry, duty free, of three books in all, to any kind of trader.</P>
    <P>The general principle underlying the instruction which has been issued to the revenue officers is this: In the case of goods which are consigned to private individuals, officers may exercise their discretion in interpreting the term &ldquo;imported in bulk.&rdquo;  Thus, a few copies of an extract from the proceedings of a scientific society will be regarded as for the personal use of an addressee.  But, in any case where books are so imported in considerable quantities, or where there is reason to suspect that goods are for commercial distribution even though not consigned in considerable quantities, duty is to be charged.  Consignments of books imported by circulating libraries may be regarded as not being in bulk, notwithstanding that amongst the contents of such a consignment there may be three or four copies of the same book.  With regard to other libraries, we hope with their co-operation, if they can satisfy the Revenue Commissioners that books imported through a bookseller are solely for the use of the libraries, we shall be able to meet their position very shortly.</P>

      <P>I was going to deal with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Pending the possibility of finding out whether such journals as that alluded to by Deputy Norton could be printed here&mdash;and I agree they should, if they could, and if the circulation justifies it&mdash;would he reconsider the question of withdrawing the prohibitive tax imposed on them for the present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall reconsider it. I am not giving any pledge at present. I have to consult the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is primarily concerned with the protective aspects of these duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I see that the Minister for Finance proposes to relieve English daily newspapers from the tax.  I should like to enquire why. If there is to be any taxation of periodicals, the last ones I would excuse would be the English dailies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that is not a question which should be put at this stage.  It should have been raised in a speech and I would have dealt with it.  I do not propose to answer it now, because it re-opens the debate.  We were concerned mainly with one particular aspect of the matter.  I am anxious that so far as books are concerned the position will be clarified, so far as I can clarify <Col N="2214" /> it now by question and answer.  With regard to what Deputy Alton said, we are giving that matter sympathetic consideration and I hope we shall be able to meet it.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister undertake before Tuesday to look into the case mentioned by Deputy Davin with regard to the British Legion's little industry which has been a very good attempt?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is opening another question.  I should like to say for the general information of the House, and it may save a good deal of Parliamentary time, that so far as the package tax is concerned I am quite prepared to listen to any representations made to me, and I shall be very grateful if any Deputy will send to my Department or the Department of the Revenue Commissioners, any particulars of anomalies or inconveniences which he thinks we can meet by mere administrative action.  I am not, however, prepared to give way the principle of the tax, which is, that work which is very largely manual work should be done here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered in the case of the package tax that the poor, who buy in very small quantities, will pay a great deal more to the Revenue than the reasonably well-off, who buy in large quantities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a fair question in all the circumstances, and nobody knows it better than the Deputy. With regard to the question the Deputy raised regarding scientific balances and instruments, that matter is being sympathetically considered. I do not think there will be any difficulty with regard to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of cartridges of which there are twenty-five in each package, will the package be taken as one, or will each one of the twenty-five be taken as a package?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>The Deputy had better address that to the Revenue Commissioners, who can deal with it more satisfactorily.</P>
