      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries whether any steps have been taken to acquire the demesne lands of Drumboe for division amongst the small farmers of the district, or to comply with other requests contained in the petition forwarded to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries on April 26th, 1931.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are going to have a repetition by each member of the Opposition of the arguments of those preceding him, we will not be able to do the work.  We shall have to get some agreement about ending this at some particular time.  If not, we shall have to use the usual methods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two parties to most of these things now.  This is a serious measure.  There is no doubt about that.  The sole desire of the Party opposite is to wrap the green flag round them in connection with this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been torn from them and they have been exhibited in various colours.  We are not to be entitled to do that&mdash;to put before the people what are the issues in connection with the Bill.  Each member of the Opposition took up the discussion of this measure in a sensible way and, as some Minister said in a moment of lucidity, each from a different angle.  What happened on the other side?  We had two or three speakers and, after a very long while, the rear-guard was brought up.  Most of the time on the last occasion on which this Bill did take some time was taken up by Deputies opposite or Ministers&mdash;I do not know which, because there is a limit to human endurance and I was not here for it. <Col N="1291" /> The fact is that this Bill could have been disposed of if the President or the Ministers had the persuasive power which they ought to have to prevent those on the opposite side from speaking who ought not to speak. After being told that we would not sit on Friday this week, we are now told that there is a question of coming back on Friday.  There is a usual method of dealing with business in this House on elsewhere.  On this side of the House we have a body of reasonable Irishmen, and there is no reason why they should not be consulted in that respect.  What reason is there why the Chief Whip, or anybody representing the Government, could not get into communication with some person qualified to speak for the Opposition to ask for accommodation in respect of the business of the House?  There is only one answer to that, and that is that there is an inferiority complex on the part of the Ministry or the Chief Whip.  I shall be as easy as possible with them and am prepared to come down to their level, if they like, in order to meet them in every way that is reasonable. The President is asking for all Stages of the Constitution (Removal of Oath) Bill.  We do not expect a General Election within three or four weeks, and I want to know what case there is for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to see some of the fruits of the work which we are told is being done.  Yesterday we had five important motions on the Paper.  Were there any facilities granted in respect of them?  Two of them were not discussed at all.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is usually entered in the long distance races of the Party, was asked to limit himself for once and to give us the important factors of it.  Is it because we were accommodating yesterday that we are asked to be accommodating to-day and on Friday?</P>

No information in the Ceann Comhairle's Office about business!  Who will Ministers take into their confidence?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>At present the business proposition is &ldquo;That the Dáil sit later than 10.30 p.m. to-night, and that the Order for Adjournment be taken not later than 12 p.m.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an hour and a half extra.  We can dispute that for an hour before the closure is put.  I put it as a sensible business proposition to anybody here, is not that what we are invited to do?  It is absolutely unnecessary.  If that is the line of <Col N="1293" /> action that is going to be taken then the consequences are upon the Ministry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>No information was given to the House as to the desire to rush through Item 2.  We are not obstructing Item 2.  Let it be put down in the usual manner and there will be no obstruction in respect of it next week.  It will get through, but not at lightning speed.  If every Minister makes the same sort of contribution towards expediting the work that the Minister for Finance makes, I think I need say no more on that. What other business is required?  Is the Dairy Produce Stabilisation Bill required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we would like to have that Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if we can get it to-day, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit there is no great necessity for a Bill of that sort to be rushed through all stages.  There is no harm in keeping it over for next week, and then we promise facilities in connection with any of the measures, but I do say, in all seriousness, that unless a very special cause occurs for it a measure ought not to go through all its stages so rapidly as that in this House.  May I point out that five Orders were discussed here yesterday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Only four.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was five, but, at any rate, in respect of two of them amendments had to be made in the Orders.  That had to be done with the members of the Executive sitting down&mdash;everyone of them with a wet towel around his head, with no noise or criticism; everyone agreed; and the various staffs at their disposal, and yet they had to bring in alterations of the Orders here.  Is not that so?  (Laughter.)  I did not <Col N="1294" /> invite Ministers to laugh at their own stupidity or their own speed.  The fact is that the horse that falls in the race does not usually win.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The former Minister for Local Government is not in fault now.  When he was the Minister you were very easy about it.  I am prepared to go on with the Committee Stage of this Bill.  I am not responsible for the Independent Deputies in the House, but I am prepared to use any influence I have with them to get it through the Committee Stage.  I am prepared to allow the Dairy Produce Bill to-day, but I am not committed to all the Stages of the Dublin and Blessington Steam Tramway Bill to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It ought to.  I take it that for the purpose of expediting business Item 4 would come after No. 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Removal of the Oath Bill.  We want to get rid of that Bill and to get on with the other parts of the work.  It is obvious from the debate we had on the first <Col N="1295" /> amendment that we will have a repetition of arguments one after another that have been used on both sides of the House and no progress will be made.  It is absolute waste of time to continue on the lines we are going.  We see no reason why that could not be disposed of to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee Stage, yes, and the Second Stage of the Dublin and Blessington Steam Tramway Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not quite clear that as far as this is concerned when the Oath Bill passes Committee Stage it is finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, that is another question.  Let us start with Item 4, the Dublin and Blessington Steam Tramway Bill, then take Item 3, the Dairy Produce Bill, and then I guarantee the Committee Stage of the Removal of the Oath Bill to conclude before nine o'clock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Then if we will take up to the Fifth Stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  That is not fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that if the argument put forward by the President were to hold, then after the Committee Stage of every Bill the remaining Stages would be taken the same day.  The President told us he is in a hurry to get the Oath Bill out of the way in order to get on with the work.  It is a pity that he did not get on with the work before getting on with the Oath Bill.  The President said that on the Third and Fourth and Fifth Stages we would only have a repetition of the arguments on both sides.  Must not that happen with every Bill introduced into the House? I did not hear the President advancing any argument whatever as to the urgency of having the Bill completed to-day.  If he gets the Second Reading of the Dairy Produce Bill, the Committee Stage of the Oath Bill, the Second Stage of the Dublin and Blessington Bill, I think he will have done a good day's work.  I remember on former occasions listening to the <Col N="1296" /> President and to the present Minister for Industry and Commerce and other members of the present Government denouncing the late Government, and quite properly denouncing them for what they themselves are now attempting to do.  I have heard the Minister for Industry and Commerce get up and denounce Deputy Cosgrave for trying to stifle the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard the President when in Opposition on more than one occasion say it was outrageous that Deputies did not get an opportunity of considering Bills after Committee Stage in order to see if there were any amendments to be introduced on Report Stage.  Now the President, to use a phrase we heard from him the other day, is not too long in office and certainly not long enough to have forgotten what his own views and opinions were in Opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  This Bill was introduced in the last Dáil, but owing to the Dissolution of the Dáil it has to be introduced again.  The Bill was prepared by the late Government, and its purpose is to provide for the abandonment of the Dublin and Blessington Steam Tramway and to make provision for matters consequential.</P>
      <P>I will just briefly outline the circumstances under which the Bill comes to be introduced.  The Dublin and Blessington Steam Tramway was constructed under the terms of the Public Companies (Ireland) Act, 1883, with a capital of £97,070.  Of this capital an amount of £40,000, bearing interest at 5 per cent. per annum, is guaranteed in perpetuity by certain baronies in County Dublin and County Wicklow under the provisions of the Act, the balance ranking as ordinary shares upon which no dividend has been paid since the construction of the line.  These unguaranteed shares are valueless.  The baronies, in addition to the liability for the guaranteed dividend, are also required to make good any losses in working. The guaranteeing baronies are recouped by the Government a sum amounting to one-half of the sums paid by them in respect of the guaranteed dividend up to a maximum of 2 per cent. per annum on the guaranteed capital.  The maximum liability of the Government amounts to £800 per annum, and has been required to be paid in full for many years.  This liability continues only so long as the Tramway is maintained in working order and carries traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The guaranteeing areas are also entitled under Section 58 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, to a repayment from the Local Taxation Account of one-half of the amount by which the rate struck in respect of the guarantee (for dividend and losses in working) exceeds 6d. in the £ in any year.  The loss on the working and the <Col N="1298" /> guaranteed dividend for the past three years has amounted approximately to £7,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>Under Section 40 of the Order in Council the line was taken over by the Country Councils of Dublin and Wicklow in the year 1916, and was first managed by the County Surveyor of County Dublin and latterly by a Committee of Management.  The line has long since outlived its usefulness.  Some time ago the Committee of Management were interviewed, when it was pointed out that the question of the closing down of the tramway was a matter for urgent consideration.  The Committee of Management expressed the opinion that the service and facilities which the line affords are not sufficient to justify the charge which their continuance now imposes on the ratepayers and on the State.</P>
    <P>As a result of negotiations conducted between the Committee of Management and the directors of the Tramway Company, an offer was made to redeem the £10 guaranteed shares for a payment of £5 10s. per share.  As already stated, there are 4,000 guaranteed shares of £10 each.  The directors circularised the shareholders, with the following result: There were proxies and acceptances received agreeing to the offer of £5 10s. per share in the case of 3,417 shares; the directors were unable to trace the owners in the case of 17 shares; in the case of seven shares the owners were dead and the estates were not yet administered.  In the case of 353 shares the four owners dissented from the arrangement, and in the case of 206 shares the owners did not reply.</P>
    <P>I am advised that in the special circumstances of this case the Government are justified in promoting legislation implementing the redemption of the guaranteed shares at the price of £5 10s. and enforcing this settlement on the few dissenting shareholders.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that a loan of £22,000 shall be made by the Commissioners of Public Works for a period of 20 years bearing interest at the rate of 5¾ per cent. per annum for the redemption of the guaranteed shares.  As the Local Taxation Account has contributed in the past an average of £1,900 per annum, and as this amount is <Col N="1299" /> likely to be increased if the line is kept open, it has been further agreed that that account shall contribute yearly this sum as maxima and that the remainder shall be borne by the guaranteeing areas.  The Government contribution of £800 per annum towards the guaranteed dividend will cease on the closing of the line.</P>
    <P>The repayment of the loan, minus the contribution from the Local Taxation Account, works out that, so far as County Wicklow is concerned the contribution from the latter will meet the instalments of principal and interest due by the guaranteeing areas in that County and they will therefore have to pay nothing.</P>
    <P>In the case of Dublin, up to the eighth year from the closing of the line they will bear an amount decreasing from £465 in the first year to £72 5s. 0d. in the eighth year.  Thereafter the payment from the Local Taxation Account will decrease until in the twentieth year the total amount paid by that account will be £1,163 5s. 0d. after which no further payment will be made.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Management have agreed to compensate the officers and servants of the Company who shall lose their position on similar terms to those granted to redundant employees of the railway companies amalgamated under the Railways Act, 1924, and this liability is to be met by a rate on the counties-at-large, excluding the urban areas.</P>
    <P>The payments to the guaranteed shareholders will be made by the Committee of Management, who will also be empowered to realise the assets of the undertaking and distribute it in the ratio of two-thirds to County Dublin and one-third to County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>Owing to the extension of the City of Dublin, part of the guaranteeing area formerly entirely in the County of Dublin is now within the City boundary, and the Bill deals with the necessary allocation of the assets and liabilities between the two areas.  It is proposed that for the purpose of disposing of the assets and the settlement of the compensation to the employees of the Tramway, the Committee <Col N="1300" /> of Management shall be increased by three additional members representative of the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>These are the main points arising out of the Bill except that it is proposed that the &ldquo;appointed day&rdquo; on which the guarantee shall cease and the line be closed shall be the 1st July, 1932.  Consequently, it is necessary that the Bill should be law before that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has made provision in the Bill for compensating the employees who will lose their employment through the closing of the line.  I would like to ask the Minister that when considering the basis of compensation for the employees he will see that they are treated on the basis of whole-time employment.  The reason why I make that appeal is that for some time past the employees have been on short-time.  That is no fault of theirs.  I would ask the Minister to consider that point sympathetically and arrange that the employees' compensation would be taken as on a whole-time basis.</P>

      <P>It is a consequence of the change of Government.  One of the provisions of the Second Schedule was that if the service of an employee had been interrupted in consequence of service in any of the military forces of the First of Second Dáil or in the British Army or Navy, or in the National Army, that interruption of the service would not count against him.  The Bill is designed also to include service in either of the forces engaged in the Civil War, or interned <Col N="1301" /> during that period.  In other words, every person whose service was interrupted because of service with the British, with the military forces in the First or Second Dáil, or on both sides during the Civil War, that that interruption will not count against him when compensation is being allocated.</P>

      <P>This is what is termed a matter of convenience. There is a State established here, and certain people go out in arms against it in circumstances which led the President to describe it as a forlorn hope. What was called commandeering, but what would ordinarily be called looting, and matters of that sort, characterised that forlorn hope.  The people who fought against the State on that occasion are now going to be put on an equality, so far as nomenclature is concerned, with the people who fought on behalf of the country, and we are told that is only a matter of convenience. How far is this principle going to extend?  Is there notice going to be given through this measure that this must be taken as a precedent?  If, for instance, there is a section of the community that does not like what the present Minister for Industry and Commerce is now doing in his capacity as a Minister, and that section rises against him, is he in advance guaranteeing the payment of any debts that they may incur in their fight against the State that is under his control? Where is the line to be drawn?  What is to count as an opposing force?  Were the people who were fighting as an opposing force, the people who opposed the National Army, under control?</P>

It was very far from frank on the part of the Minister to ask yesterday if he could get this Bill through to-day.  He has now made an announcement of the greatest importance.  Speaking with regard to compensation provisions, he said that the provisions outlined in this Bill were similar to those which were in the Railways Act.</P>

      <P>That may be something to be applauded, but the lack of frankness in the Minister's statement is what I am criticising at the moment. The Minister now tells us that this proposal may go into any future Act. He said, first of all, that he was putting in provisions similar to what were in the Railways Act.  They are not similar.  We want to know where we are going.  This is the first occasion on which this principle has shown itself. We have to know where it leads. What is the discrimination in the case of forces that are just barely restrained from being in arms against <Col N="1303" /> the present Government and those who were actually in arms against the people who carried on the first Government of the country after the Treaty?</P>

There was a vast amount of money taken from banks by people who were acting under the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because they came under the law.  After the Treaty was signed there was a vast amount of money taken from banks.  Has there been any audit in connection with that money?  Is there any definite <Col N="1304" /> statement in relation to it going to be submitted to this House?  If we are going to regard people's temporary disappearance on such service as ranking as employment for the purpose of compensation, we have to know what they were doing in that period of absence.  We have to have the whole thing opened up.  There has to be an audit.  What has happened to the various items of property seized&mdash;the money as well as the goods seized?  All that has to be brought under some sort of control.</P>
      <P>Do not let it be sufficient to say to those people &ldquo;you were away on something.  What it was we do not know, but you are going to have your period of absence counted for the purposes of compensation as if you had been serving in the forces of the State.&rdquo;  We have to know where the analogy begins and ends.  Let us say that people go out in arms against the present Government.  We have the precedent now established that the new Government has to pay those who were out in rebellion against it.

We are not going to accept the description of one of the forces on the civil war side&mdash;the description given by Deputy McGilligan.  I am in agreement with Deputy Minch that it is of no value to us to be going back over the things of that period.  It is the policy of this Government to prevent such discrimination arising now, and to give to one side exactly the same facilities as are given to the other; to take the line that it is not for us to judge, and to put one section in an exalted position as against the other section.  We all have different views as to which section should be exalted.

The Minister may discuss whether an army such as that was in the right or in the wrong from its own particular standpoint.

I had not intended even to go into these matters much less to exhaust them on the specific amendment.  I confined myself to the amendment, and the debate was conducted on that understanding, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle assuring me that I was accurate in the assumption to which I have referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  It will be necessary to explain some of the objects and provisions of the Bill in detail although much of the discussion which would have taken place on the Second Reading has already taken place on the Financial Resolution.</P>
      <P>The object of the Bill is to try, as far as possible, to give the producer the cost of his production, and also to give butter and milk products to the consumer at the lowest possible price.  As the House is aware, a tariff on imported butter was passed by the Oireachtas over two years ago, and if the producers of butter had been absolutely united in their efforts in marketing, if they had only allowed the requisite amount of butter to go on to the home market and put their prices up to the world price plus the tariff, they could, if they were sufficiently well combined, have got the same benefits under that tariff as we propose to give them under this Bill.  But they had not the organisation or the combination required to do that.  There was the possibility however that such a thing would be done when a tariff was introduced here in November, 1930. Though that possibility was there: that the producers of butter might combine to keep the price of butter both winter and summer at the world price, plus 4d. per pound, there was no far-seeing Minister and no far-seeing Deputy in the House at the time to point out that possibility and there was no objection made on that score to the tariff then.</P>
      <P>Now, however, when we bring in this Bill to give the producers the benefit that they might have had under that tariff there is great concern shown for the poor man.  We mean, while endeavouring to give the producer as fair a price as possible towards the cost of his production, also to protect in every way that we possibly can the consumers of butter in this country.  In the first place, I might mention that while the consumer gets butter comparatively cheap during the summer months under the present system, he has to pay much more for butter during the winter months.  We intend under this Bill to make the price of butter level the whole year round.  Whereas for the last two years the consumer got butter as low as 1s. 3d. per lb. during certain months in the summer and had to pay as high as 1s 7d. a lb. during certain months in the winter, we mean under this Bill to have butter sold at 1s. 5d. per pound maximum the whole year round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is admitted, I believe, by every Party in this House that the industry must be saved.  We could, as is suggested in some quarters, save the industry by giving a direct subsidy out of taxation or we could save it as is proposed in this Bill by asking the consumer to pay what is a reasonable price, taking account of production costs and so on, or we could do so by a combination of both methods. Now, as I pointed out on the occasion of the introduction of the Financial Resolution neither I nor any member <Col N="1313" /> of the Executive Council can see any hope of raising money by direct taxation to finance this scheme, and I think every member of the House will see that as clearly as we see it on this day week when the Budget comes to be made known.  We therefore had to fall back on the only other alternative, and that was the alternative of asking the consumer to pay what was a fair price for butter.</P>
    <P>We are told, of course, by many sympathetic Deputies that the poor man will have to pay.  Now, if we take the example that was given by Deputy Alfred Byrne, the Lord Mayor, of people who are getting 10/- a week out of which they have to pay anything from 2s. 6d. to 3s. 6d. in rent, leaving a sum of 6s 6d. or 7s. 6d. per week to buy food for the father, mother and seven or eight children that the Deputy spoke of, I think that whether butter is 1s. 1d. per lb. or 1s. 5d. per lb. it will not concern the very poor spoken of in this House who are living on home assistance.  If, however, we consider amongst the poor the ordinary working man&mdash;the man who is at work&mdash; then I say that it is a case for serious consideration.  We believe that when a person is earning wages in this country that the wage should be, whether it is or not, of a sufficient level to enable him to buy the necessaries of life, those necessaries being produced at the ordinary cost of production. If we have to subsidise butter producers in order that the working man may get butter at a price that he can afford, we may also have to subsidise the production of boots, clothing and everything else in order that he may also be able to get these at a cost that he can afford.</P>
    <P>We think that the only safe test to apply is that if we have goods to sell, they should be sold at least at the ordinary cost of production.  We hear serious complaints now that we are going to mulct the consumer by putting a price of 1s. 5d. per lb. on butter.  That is a rather extraordinary line for people to take.  Deputies whose memories must at least go back to 1929 and from 1929 back to 1915&mdash;<Col N="1314" /> that is, over a period of fourteen years&mdash;must be well aware that over that period butter was never sold under 1s. 8d. per lb.  We never had a complaint I believe that the price of that butter should have been reduced somewhere below 1s. 5d. per lb. or a proposal in this House or elsewhere that butter producers should be subsidised in such a way that they would be enabled to sell butter at that time at anything under 1s. 5d. per lb. to the working man.  Somebody also I think raised a question that under this scheme we are going to supply food to the consumers in Great Britain at a cheap rate.</P>
    <P>Now, whether we bring in this scheme or not, the price that we can get for our butter on the British market will have relation to the world price, and it does not matter whether we make it possible for the producer to charge 1s. 1d. or 1s. 3d. or 1s. 5d. per lb. to the home consumer, the butter will be sold in Great Britain, or to any other foreign buyer, at the price that we can get on the world market.  We cannot influence that in any way by anything that we may do here.</P>
    <P>The price is usually in or about the price of other Colonial butter, such as New Zealand and Australian, although we would perhaps be nearer the New Zealand price than the Australian price.  The latest quotation for New Zealand butter on the British market is 102/-.  If our creameries were asked to take a price of 102/- on the British market, and if freight and selling costs were deducted, Deputies will see that the future for our dairying industry would show very poor prospects.</P>
    <P>With regard to some of the special features of the Bill, we find that the production of creamery butter in the country is somewhere about 640,000 cwts. per year, and that about half that amount is exported and the other half consumed at home, so that the creamery butter pool will enable us to work it, as outlined in the Bill, for some time, at least, by putting a levy of 2d. per lb. on creamery butter and by paying 4d. per lb. bounty on exports. If we export exactly half our production, the 2d. and 4d. will work out <Col N="1315" /> correctly.  We may find, however, that our production has gone down this year, and that our exports will be less than 50 per cent. of the production.  In that case, the levy can be decreased after some time, the bounty remaining as it is, because it cannot exceed the tariff.</P>
    <P>There are, however, other considerations that must be taken into account. For instance, there is the question of cream and other milk products, and there is the question of butter being produced during the winter, on which no levy is paid.  Roughly speaking, however, if the exports are half the total production, the levy will remain at half the bounty.  In the case of factory butter, we have no very reliable figures of production since 1929. In that year, according to the census of production, the output of factory butter was about 167,000 cwts. and we only exported somewhere between 10 and 15 per cent. of that.  The factory pool will, therefore, be in a different position. In the factory pool under the Bill we propose to start with a levy of 2d. and a bounty of 2½d., and it will remain to be seen whether after some time this proportion can be maintained or whether it must be altered and the bounty perhaps changed to 2¼d. or 2¾d., as the case may be.</P>
    <P>It will be seen also from the Bill that there are certain safeguards for the consumer.  Amongst them I might mention that the bounty cannot exceed the tariff.  The Minister is given certain powers under the Bill, but he has no power to exceed the tariff by the bounty, so that if there was any desire on the part of the Minister, or the Executive Council, to increase the bounty under the Bill, the matter could necessarily be raised in the Dáil, because, first of all, an increase in the tariff rate would have to be sought.  There is also a provision in the Bill enabling the Minister to fix the maximum price at which butter can be sold from the creameries. That, of course, does not go to the retailer or to the consumer, but it is hoped that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be able to deal with the retail price, so long as we keep the wholesale price below a certain <Col N="1316" /> figure.  We are convinced and we have been assured by certain traders, and by certain people in the creamery business, but especially by the wholesalers and the retailers, who are more concerned with this question than the creameries, that if the f.o.b. price of creamery butter does not exceed 142/- there is no necessity for the retail price to exceed 1/5 per lb.</P>
    <P>There is another thing to be learned from the Bill, and that is that the f.o.b. price from the creamery can only reach 142/- so long as the export price is at 105/-.  If the export price exceeds 105/- or goes below 105/-, the f.o.b. price, internally, will go below 142/-.  If the export price goes below 105/-, we cannot give a greater bounty than 37/4, so that if the export price goes down to, say, 100/-, the internal price will be 137/4.  We must follow the price internally if it goes below 105/-, and if it goes above 105/-, we regulate the bounty in such a way that the internal price means the external price.  There was a fear expressed here by some Deputy on the occasion of the discussion on the financial resolution that if the export price were to go up, say, to 115/- we would still keep adding the 37/4 to the internal price, making it 152/-.  That is not the case.  As a matter of fact, if the export price went up to 115/-, the internal price would come from 142/- down to 132/-.  If the export price goes up 10/-, the internal price comes down 10/- to meet it, to 132/-, so that the mean price will remain the same to the creameries.  It is, therefore, fairly obvious that an internal price of 142/- f.o.b. at the creamery is only possible when the export price is exactly 105/-.  If it goes above, or below, 105/-, the internal price comes down.</P>
    <P>It will also be observed that we have to deal with the milk products. Naturally, of course, if we are to give a bounty on butter, and if we were not to deal with bulk cream, tinned cream, tinned whole milk, dried milk, and so on, the inducement would be held out to the present producers of these milk products to go into butter, in order to get a better price.  So that we considered that the trade in tinned <Col N="1317" /> cream, tinned milk and bulk cream was one not to be neglected and we, therefore, extended the bounty to those products also.</P>
    <P>Another provision of this Bill is one that schedules certain creameries from which we are empowered to get a smaller levy than the ordinary levy, and the reason for that was that there are certain creameries which are not in a position to withstand the ordinary competition.  The number scheduled is very small.  As a matter of fact out of the registered creameries there are only seven scheduled out of a total of 200, and in the case of the separating stations, there are only seven scheduled out of a total of 356, so that as far as the finances of the scheme go the number scheduled will have very little influence.  Those scheduled premises must fulfil certain conditions.  They do fulfil certain conditions, such as that the premises were erected and equipped during recent years when the cost of construction and equipment was abnormally high, and they had not a sufficient time, while good prices ruled, to pay off some of that large debt which was contracted in the building and equipment.  All those creameries are also in districts where the competition from home butter making is very marked and the benefits to be derived by farmers making their own butter under this Bill would have a serious effect on those creameries if we compelled them to pay a 2d. levy and get a 4d. bounty, thereby giving them a net 2d. per pound, whereas farmers making their own butter in the district might have a greater advantage in competition with them. They also fulfil the condition that they are not in competition with other creameries.  They are isolated creameries, every one of them.</P>
    <P>There are also provisions in this Bill with regard to the restriction of imports and exports.  A restriction of imports will be necessary under certain circumstances.  For instance, we might use a certain amount of pressure on butter producers to store that butter for winter consumption, and it would be very unfair if, having stored the butter for the winter time, we found that during the winter, owing to a <Col N="1318" /> collapse, say, in world prices, butter could come in here having paid the tariff and be sold at an abnormally low price.  In that way the power to restrict imports is necessary for the smooth working of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is also power to restrict exports. That is necessary in order to ensure that we have sufficient supplies of our own butter kept here for winter use.  There are certain creameries, dealing with the creameries in this instance especially, who do a home trade and keep that connection the whole year round.  They store sufficient butter to supply their own customers in the winter as well as in the summer.  There are other creameries, however, who do not make the same provision for a winter supply.  They are quite prepared to supply the home needs during the summer months, but they make no provision for the winter, and we mean to take power to use pressure on some of the creameries who may not be doing their part in storing butter for the winter time.  There are certain financial provisions which make it easy for these creameries to keep butter over much later, also included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>On a Second Reading Stage such as this, I do not think that it is necessary to go any more into detail.  I think the big principle underlying the Bill is to help the producer to try to get as far as possible the cost of production for his article.  Certain other principles which may arise will come up for discussion during this stage rather than the details that are embodied in the Bill.  I move the Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like if the Minister would explain to me a matter that arises under Section 25, Part V, of the Bill.  Under that section he has power to prohibit the export of butter. Is it proposed by the Minister to apply that prohibition to a case where a man may be exporting butter under contract? Say, for example, that I have a contract to supply butter in England and that the Minister is of opinion that there is not sufficient butter in this country.  Yet, I have a contract to fulfil during the whole year.  This means, if it means what it says in Section 25, Part V of the Bill, that my <Col N="1319" /> contract will be broken as a result of the Order.  Do I understand the section in that way correctly?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will understand, of course, that the prohibition of export will not be made a general Order unless under some unforeseen circumstances.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is, as Deputy Hogan said, probably necessary, or something like it, but there is no use in minimising the seriousness of the Bill.  We have to confess that it does involve the addition of some three quarters of a million pounds in taxation on the consumers of the country.  It is of course taxation that may disappear when the world price of butter varies sufficiently.  But assuming that the world price of butter remains as it is or round about where it is, then the consumers of the country have to pay three-quarters of a million pounds to assist the dairying industry in the difficulties in which it is.  They have to pay just as much as if it were levied by way of taxation on tea or sugar or on any other of the necessities of life.  And I think it is rather fallacious for the Minister to suggest that it does not involve a serious burden artificially to maintain the price of butter at 1s. 5d. for a long period when, for a long period before the present slump became a fact it had been at top price or higher, because the whole community, one way or another is interdependent.  When the world price was higher then our export trade was bringing a greater revenue into the country, greater sums were available for expenditure, and the hardships that are felt as a result of the shortage of money now were not as keenly felt.  When the world price is 1s. 1d. it is a hardship on anybody to have to pay 1s 5d. to an extent that it was not a hardship or would not have been a hardship when the world price was 1s. 5d. There is no use at all in the Minister minimising this burden in any way. It is just as much a burden to put a tax like this on as it would be if the price had not been higher in times past.  The fact that the world price of this commodity is down has lowered the economic vitality of the whole community and makes it much harder to bear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> It seems to me that the main defect in this Bill is that it does not go further and make sure that the creamery supplier and, in fact, the butter producer generally, will get the full benefit of this burden which is being laid on the consumer.  The Bill is the expression of a scheme which was prepared Departmentally before the change of Government, and the previous Government did not adopt the scheme largely because they felt that it was not certain that in the circumstances and as the scheme stood, the person whom it was designed to benefit would get a benefit corresponding to the cost.  The Minister is not adding to it, and he has not done what I think, unless arguments that I have not yet heard are adduced, ought to be done.  This scheme which, as the Minister has explained, might have been unnecessary if there had been a strong butter marketing organisation, is not complete without that butter marketing organisation.</P>
    <P>I feel little doubt that with our unco-ordinated marketing system, or rather the lack of marketing system, when exporters get the bounty of 4d. in the pound there will be an irresistible tendency to go further with the cut-throat competition which very often in the past has lowered the price of Irish butter in the English market, below what it ought to have been.  I think that along with this scheme there ought to go some system of centralised marketing that would prevent the occurrence of what I believe is certain to happen&mdash;a reduction in the price of Irish butter below what it would be if there was no bounty.  Logically, of course, the fact that a creamery manager gets 4d. a lb. ought not to make him willing to take less than he would otherwise take, because the most that he can get in the British market with this 4d. added is not going to be too much for his suppliers or too much to meet the case.  But everywhere throughout the world the inevitable effect of bounties has been to cause people to sell somewhat more cheaply than they otherwise would have sold.  There are many people who have some experience of this particular <Col N="1322" /> difficulty of inter-competition amongst Irish creamery managers who believe that, although the consumer will pay enough to give the creameries a net increase of 2d., it is quite likely that the net increase that the creamery will get as the result of this burden on the consumer will not be much more than 1d.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is too late &mdash;I suppose it is too late now&mdash;to incorporate in the scheme, provisions enabling the Minister to have a centralised marketing organisation set up, but I do submit that it is very doubtful whether it is wise to go on with this scheme without that.  It certainly will be a terrible thing if the consumer is forced to pay three-quarters of a million pounds to assist the creamery industry, and that the creamery industry will only get something a little over half of that.  I do not know whether the Minister thinks that the difficulties of setting up this centralised organisation are so great as to make it impossible.  But, at any rate, now that the State has come in, the State has grounds for making everybody concerned in the matter toe the line.  If the State were not forcing the consumer to contribute then the difficulties that might have to be met, the jealousies and personal interests that might have to be overcome, might be so great that it would be a thankless, useless, and almost impossible task for the State to deal with this question of centralising the marketing of Irish butter.  When the Minister is replying I should like if he would deal with that and tell us whether he has been assured by people who are reliable and who have experience of the butter market, that there is no danger of this competition. And if he is so assured, will he indicate the reason why, in this particular case, the giving of a bounty is not likely to have the effects that we all know the giving of bounties generally has.</P>
    <P>I do not want, on this Bill, to touch on matters that we are discussing under other headings these days in the Dáil.  The Minister, I hope, realises that prejudice and private action can <Col N="1323" /> very well affect the price of a commodity such as this, and that if he is being careful in one respect about the price that our butter will obtain and, if he is willing to tax the community to the extent of three-quarters of a million, he ought to be careful in other respects.  It will be very easily possible to make this entire burden absolutely useless to the people whom it is supposed to benefit.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made already to the powers to prohibit the export of butter.  I think these powers must be exercised very lightly.  I do not see why, in the ordinary way, there should be any prohibition of imports.  The imports, after all, will have to pay the Customs duty and can only be sold here at 4d. per lb. over the world price, and I do not think they can do any harm.  Therefore, in the ordinary way, I do not see why any special steps should be taken to interfere with the normal course of selling and to cause butter to be retained here. I do not see any particular virtue or advantage to anybody in eating cold-stored butter in preference to any other butter, if there is not going to be some gain either to the industry or to the nation.  I should like the Minister to tell us something further as to why he thinks it might be necessary in certain circumstances to prohibit either imports or exports.  Once we are stabilising the summer and winter price, I cannot see why we should interfere further with the trade in that respect.</P>

      <P>Deputy Blythe says that it will be very easy, if we are not careful, to make this proposal quite useless from the point of view of the Irish producer. That may be the Deputy's opinion, but it is not ours.  We have stated our position quite clearly, that we are anxious to have the fullest co-operation in all trade matters or matters of mutual interest between Great Britain and ourselves.  I cannot see what the Deputy's object is, unless he has some information up his sleeve that he does not wish to give to the House, in telling the country that when the Minister for Agriculture produces a <Col N="1324" /> scheme of this kind the whole thing may be useless.  Perhaps some of his colleagues, some of the international experts on the opposite side, can tell us what information exactly they have at their disposal which enables them to tell the country that the proposal may be quite useless.  I assume that the Irish producer is going to produce for the English market and compete there in exactly the same fashion as in the past.  We know that he has been almost driven out of that market, and that the tariff put on by the late Government was not sufficient to keep him in production.  We know that, not alone were our dairy farmers going out of production, but that in fact they were selling off cows, and that a very serious position affecting the whole cattle trade would shortly develop if strong steps were not taken to deal with it.</P>
      <P>One would imagine from Deputy Blythe's speech that the new Minister for Agriculture is to some extent responsible for this situation.  I would remind the Deputy that the Minister for Agriculture and the Government have had a legacy in this, as in other matters, from those on the opposite benches.  We know that at considerable cost to the State certain financial commitments were entered into in regard to this industry. We know that a marketing organisation was set up and that it did not prove satisfactory.  When the Deputy asks what steps the Minister proposes to take to deal with marketing, I would ask how it was that the late Minister for Agriculture did not deal with the matter?  We must remember that it was he was responsible for getting the central marketing organisation going first.  If that organisation proved ineffective, as many people think it did, it is Deputy Hogan who should be blamed, if anybody in this House can rightly be blamed, and I do not think anyone can.</P>

      <P>When we urged that the <Col N="1325" /> Minister of that time should have taken steps to have a system of marketing, we were told that it was not his business to organise the marketing side of the dairying industry; that the dairying people themselves could come together and establish a marketing organisation&mdash;a perfectly intelligible point of view.  I wonder is Deputy Blythe forgetting that.  I am sure the Minister for Agriculture is quite anxious to co-operate with the industry in setting up a proper organisation. We are doing our share if we put this scheme through, and we would naturally expect the industry to take steps to improve its efficiency and organisation, if that is possible.  My own belief, however, is that the industry has reached such a serious state that it may not be possible until this scheme is in operation and until we see whether it is going to confer the benefits that we expect on the industry, to suggest to the industry that it should set up an organisation.  I do not intend to go into that matter.  I take it that it has not escaped the attention of the Minister for Agriculture.  I simply state that if we are to have proper organisation we must first put the industry on its feet.  That is what we are trying to do; to keep the producers in production; to give them some security in the future, and, if we hold out a promise of that to them, we can afterwards, if we see fit, approach them with regard to the question of their organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy emphasised the fact that under the scheme there is an irresistible inducement to cut-throat competition between the different creameries.  If creameries have learned the moral of recent events, as I think they have, if they understand, as the Minister for Agriculture mentioned in his opening statement, that owing to this competition they have not got the advantages they should have got from the tariffs, perhaps they will be wiser in future.  Perhaps they themselves will come together and take the necessary steps.  I certainly deprecate putting on the shoulders of the Minister for Agriculture the responsibility here and now of setting up this machinery.  The creamery <Col N="1326" /> industry ought to be well aware of the position, and while it is up to them to take all reasonable steps, that initiative does not lie with the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I think that two great matters of importance that the Minister referred to in his statement have been passed over and no reference made to them. It is an extraordinary thing that Deputy Blythe should pass over these two important matters, namely, the question of giving the producer something that will recoup him, that will at least give him back his cost of production, while at the same time guaranteeing, as far as we can, that the consumer will only have to pay a fair price.  I have no great fear of the fixing of a certain price at the creamery.  I do not think that the Minister for Agriculture need even interfere to the extent of fixing a price, but whatever the price is at the creamery that price will more or less represent the price to the consumer.</P>
    <P>The fluctuations of the wholesale price at the creamery, I maintain, will represent fairly the fluctuations in the retail prices.  We cannot go further until we have produced to this House the legislation that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is contemplating in the fixing of retail prices. We cannot go further than to say that we believe that with the wholesale price known, and fixed, we ought to be able to go a good way to judge what the fair retail price should be. One cannot disagree with those who lay great stress upon the additional costs that may be brought in respect to the necessaries of poor people, but we cannot separate, in my opinion, one incident in the economic structure of the country from the other and view the particular increase apart from everything else.  It is just precisely because we cannot take one single aspect of the matter aside that I think the Deputy who has just spoken is quite wrong when he speaks of lowering the economic vitality of the community.</P>
    <P>If the economies preached by the late Government were right then this country should be very happy and prosperous and every other country as <Col N="1327" /> well because prices are quite low. Prices, at least as far as I know, of primary products and manufactured articles have reached a very low level, but on the supposition that low prices are an important thing, and are the foundation of economic well-being everyone in the world ought to be very prosperous at present.  But the trouble is they are not and these doctrinaire economists who so long filled the seats of power in this country should at least realise the situation which I think is realised in every other country, that unless the agricultural community have money in their pockets to buy the stuff the manufacturer is making, and the townspeople are selling, low prices are unless and economic machinery comes to a standstill.  So I say, if we want to attempt to begin wisely we will put money into the farmers' pockets, and that money will come into circulation. In the same way we will be putting money into the pockets of the other producers.  In that way we will be doing something.  I do not say it will bring about an immediate result, but we will be bringing about a situation as quickly as we can that will enable the poor man to get employment.</P>
    <P>I can see no other way in which the poor people and the working-class people will be able to buy anything whether there be low prices under free trade or higher prices under protection if they have no employment. Such a scheme as this is either to keep people in employment who otherwise would have to go out of employment, or to ensure that new avenues of employment will be opened up to them.  Therefore, I think there is a perfectly reasonable reply to the arguments that you are putting some dreadful impost upon poor people and having no return given.  Something in return is being given so long as the farmers are getting something like a fair price for their commodities. They are enabled to keep their homesteads going and country towns and cities like Dublin going.  We all know what a serious effect it has upon the whole trade and industry of the country, with its repercussions on employment, <Col N="1328" /> if the farming community are not able to make ends meet.</P>
    <P>When the Deputy referred to the fact that this would cost three-quarters of a million I would like to know how he makes up that figure. In my opinion it would cost nothing like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a prophet, but I am informed that the Department of Agriculture considers that a figure of £400,000 is approximately what the cost may be, but when the Deputy mentioned that this will have precisely the same effect as if it were a tax levied on tea or sugar or some other commodity like that, I suggest that there is this important difference: we cut out administration and the appointment of officials, and we are doing something else.  We are setting up a certain scheme which in the future may be handed over to the industry itself to work, or, at any rate, the industry could largely administer under the supervising control of the Minister for Agriculture.  I think a scheme of the kind, in which the industry itself takes a hand, is far more valuable than a scheme which depends solely upon State finance and regulations.  I hope the time will come when the whole scheme may be administered by the dairying industry itself.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture referred to a number of people in poor circumstances who may not be affected by this Bill by reason of the fact that butter was always out of their reach, and whose weekly income did not bring in that amount which, after paying rent and providing for the necessaries of life, left enough to buy butter even at the low rate at which it stands to-day.  I would like the Minister to realise to that extent that in every single town of the Free State, and also to a considerable extent in <Col N="1329" /> cities, there is hinging upon this another commodity which the Minister for Industry and Commerce ought to take serious notice of, and that is dripping. I know a lot of poor people fry their bread in substitutes for butter and in dripping, and for that reason I hope the Minister will see that the price of these is not necessarily raised owing to the increased price of butter.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education objects to what he called doctrinaire economists upon other benches in this House.  I think we ought to get a clear view of what exactly we are dealing with in this measure.  We have been told that the industry must be saved.  Both the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Education have spoken about the industry.  But no attempt has been made to give us a picture of that industry. We are left to imagine that the industry is the creamery industry. Then we are told in general terms that the dairy industry is involved, and we were told by the Minister himself, when dealing with the financial resolution dealing with this matter, that the industry, whatever it is, is the foundation of our agricultural industry, and, with the branches of agriculture allied to it, responsible for at any rate 50 per cent. of production in the country.  So that when we talk of industry like that and feed it with a bit of its own tail and a lot taken from the general consumer, it would be most desirable that we should see to some extent what we are doing.  It may be true, as the Minister suggests, that you cannot see what is going to happen exactly under this measure until it is in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we take it for a moment that it is the creamery industry that is concerned, we are dealing with an industry that is organised in only ten of the Twenty-Six Counties.  The creamery industry exists in Limerick, Tipperary, Waterford, Cork, Kerry and Kilkenny on the one hand, and in Monaghan, Cavan, Leitrim and Sligo on the other hand.  We take a particular industry whose organisation is particularly represented in these ten counties but which is practically unrepresented <Col N="1330" /> in the other sixteen; and by means of a levy on the production of this creamery and other butter and a bounty on exports we are raising the general prices of butter throughout the country as a whole.  The Minister for Agriculture suggests that this is going to cost the consumer and the country generally approximately £400,000.</P>
    <P>I would like him to say exactly in respect of what does he figure out that cost.  Take the figures already given for the purpose of sticking to some figures.  The annual production of creamery butter is 690,000 cwts.  The Minister spoke of 640,000 cwts. this afternoon, but let us take it at 690,000 cwts.; that the home consumption is 320,000 cwts., and that the other butter produced in the country, what is called farm butter, is 835,000 cwts.  The price of farm butter sold throughout the country, not only in the ten counties where creameries are, but throughout the other sixteen counties that are more or less dependent on farmers' butter is going to be affected too. When we come to what it is going to cost the consumer, I am suggesting that the full cost of the levy, that is, 4d. per lb., is going to be added to the price of butter throughout the country and that the home consumption of 320,000 cwts. of creamery butter is going to involve an increased cost of £600,000. The home consumption of 360,000 cwts. of butter, factory butter, is going to involve an additional cost of £670,000, and approximately the 440,000 cwts. of farmers' butter is going to mean an additional cost of £820,000.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the measure itself, and so that we may know what is likely to happen under this measure, we ought to have the Minister's arguments against these figures, because that is a very considerable sum, involving £1,487,000 additional cost to the consumer. We are dealing with a measure that I suggest may involve that sum, and as well as that we are raising from the creamery industry this levy of approximately £842,000.</P>
    <P>The theory is that this £842,000 is going to find its way back to the industry. By the industry we mean the farmers here who are producing the <Col N="1331" /> milk&mdash;that the money is to find its way back without getting lost in the way.  I take it that increased production in agriculture is wanted, and if we are going to have increased production in agriculture until our population increases here, we must find an outside market for our butter.  If we are to find an outside market for our butter, it is, I take it, through the creamery industry that we must find this market.  Yet it is pretty clearly suggested that the operation of this measure is going to confine the creamery industry at any rate to these areas where it exists at present, and that it may injure the creamery industry even in some of those areas.  The Minister had admitted that particularly in some areas it is necessary to protect the creamery industry against the tendency of the farmers to withhold their milk from the creameries and to make their own butter at home where they can get the full advantage of the increase in price without any levy.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that in certain parts of the country where creameries exist that milk has for some time past been withheld from these creameries, and there may be a tendency in that particular direction again.  I take it that the powers taken to impose a levy on certain manufactured non-creamery butter are taken for the purpose of protecting the creamery industry against a move in that direction. If that is so, it leaves a large part of the country producing butter and producing milk&mdash;not producing it in such a way that it can be of any great advantage in increasing our export trade, and it is asking the consumers of butter in the country to pay an increased price of 4d. per lb. for butter raised in these areas.</P>
    <P>Not only are we subsidising the creamery industry in about ten counties, but we are also subsidising to practically the same extent, perhaps to a greater extent, the home producers of butter in the sixteen other counties.  If we mean to assist the creamery industry we are up against the question, why, in doing it, should we put ourselves into the position that <Col N="1332" /> we will have to help the farmer who is producing butter in his own home, considering as I say that operations of that particular kind cannot be really effective in increasing our agricultural exports?  The position is that we are taking about £840,000 from one end of the creamery industry and hoping to put it all back, and we are taxing additionally the consumer in respect of creamery butter.  Between factory and farmers' butter we are putting nearly £870,000 additional taxation on the people.</P>
    <P>I suggest that that is not really justified. The Minister speaks of that and says that there are other industries that may have to be subsidised too, but if we are in the position, as is often argued, that all other producers in the country are really living on the farmers, and if the farmer has to be subsidised from the pockets of these other producers living on him, I do not know which is the hen or which is the egg in the business at all.</P>
    <P>We have seen in Great Britain the tremendous amount of political use that was made of the unemployment insurance money.  Millions of pounds were distributed through unemployment insurance in a rather unquestioning kind of way in the form of the dole, perhaps bringing about even additional unemployment throughout Great Britain; at any rate, creating a very confused position there in the matter of employment and bringing about very serious financial conditions.  I suggest that there is a danger, speaking in a general kind of way about the farmer, that the farmer is to be put into the position, in this country, that the unemployed person was in England.  He is a big, widespread and easy target for political palaver from all Parties, and he is being subsidised and assisted in all kinds of different ways with no clear idea as to what his responsibilities are in the matter, or as to what is the organisation of his industry.  We may find ourselves slipping along in the same way, reducing ourselves to a very serious financial position because of the amount of money in a dull kind of way we are taking from the people as a whole, in order to subsidise the farmer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1333" /> No reasonable person in the farming industry wants to have that particular position, and it is for that reason that I think we want to have very much more clearly put before us the position of the creamery industry, that we want to have more clearly answered whether it is the creamery industry we want to assist by this particular measure, and what the creamery industry is going to do for itself, more satisfactorily to organise itself. If, as the Minister says, this is a scheme which may later be handed to the industry, to run itself, then it is very important for us to be assured that the industry is properly and efficiently organised.  It has been pointed out to us in all kinds of different publications that not only is there very great obscurity as to the cost of producing milk in different parts of this country, and very great differences in the cost of producing milk, but even in the case of turning milk into butter in the various creameries there are very considerable differences too.</P>
    <P>The possibilities of economies and efficiencies under central marketing have been touched upon.  I do not know that any political party need have anything thrown against it to the effect that they have not brought about a more satisfactory position there.  But where the Government is, under this measure, taking a very considerable amount of money to protect the industry, I think they should see that no organisation that may improve the industry will be left unattempted and that no improvement in the matter of handling the inside of the creameries will be left unattended.  In some sections it is suggested that this Bill is going to last for five years.  I do not know if that is so.  I think the period of the Bill, if the Bill is acceptable to the House, ought to be limited so that it will be brought home to the creamery industry&mdash;if that is the industry that is concerned here&mdash;that this implies that the industry will have to be improved and better organised.</P>
    <P>How we are going to have the country as a whole financing the basis of the greater part of our industry here is a thing I do not understand.  There <Col N="1334" /> is a section that implies that the cost of administering this measure is going to be borne by the Exchequer.  That implication is contained in Section 41. I submit expenditure of that kind ought to be taken from the funds that are being put together by this Bill. The expense of administering the Road Fund is borne by the Road Fund itself, and the expense of administering this particular measure, considering the amount of money that is being taken from the general consumer of butter, ought to be borne by the funds put together under this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle underlying this Bill is not so much to assist the creameries but to assist the dairying industry in general.  The Bill was not brought in for the purpose of assisting creameries; it was brought in in order to give the producers of butter an economic price, to give them the cost of production, and to see that the consumers of butter in this country pay the cost of production to the producers. That is a principle that every Party in this House will agree upon.  Producers producing under the best possible conditions are entitled to their cost of production, and consumers are not entitled to purchase goods under the cost at which they can be produced in their own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not had from the far side of the House the big noises that we had on the last day.  On the last occasion Deputy Cosgrave told the Minister for Agriculture that he was ignorant of the principles underlying the measure to be introduced.  We have, apparently, a new outlook to-day.  There is no opposition to the Bill in the same way as we had on the last occasion.  Deputies know quite well that this is a legacy handed over from the last Government.  Deputy Blythe wanted to know why it was the Minister did not take powers to set up a compulsory selling organisation. The former Minister for Agriculture knew quite well the condition in which the butter industry was, and he did not take these powers. On several occasions in this House he said it was not his duty and he did not intend taking powers to set up a compulsory selling organisation <Col N="1335" /> in order to organise the butter industry. No one knew better than the former Minister for Agriculture the condition of the butter industry.</P>
    <P>I think the present Minister and his Department are to be commended for setting out to do something which the last Government absolutely neglected to do although they were aware of the condition of the industry. The present Government have set out to see that the producer gets at least the cost of production.  Perhaps it is unfortunate, but I believe it is fortunate, that we are not able to produce butter at world prices.  I look upon it as fortunate for this country.  The conditions existing in other countries if they existed here might not be for the benefit of the country.  In Denmark something like £100,000,000 have been lent by different organisations for the production of butter and other agricultural products within the last few years in order that the people could put cheap produce on the world market.  We see these and other industries in Denmark in an unhealthy condition. It would be a bad thing for this country if the farmers were subsidised so that it would enable them to sell butter on the world market under the cost of production.  While there may be a difference of opinion as to the price at which butter can be sold, there can be no difference on one thing, and that is that the agricultural community, the producers under the best conditions, are entitled to the cost of production.</P>
    <P>That is what the consumers are asked to pay.  The producers in any other industry, building or boot making, get their costs of production. They set out to do so, or otherwise they would not be long in production. The farmer must continue in production while other industries can close down or go bankrupt in twenty-four hours.  Farmers cannot do that but, according to Deputy Mulcahy, Deputy Blythe and other Deputies, must continue to produce whether it pays them or not.  Farmers have no alternative. Deputies suggest that the consumers should get butter at world prices, whatever they may be, even if they <Col N="1336" /> are below the cost of production here. The same thing applies to any other industry.  In my opinion, any industry that cannot produce at world prices is entitled to protection or to a bounty to enable it to produce.  This country was brought to its present condition because we were not able, owing to certain conditions that existed here, and that did not exist elsewhere, to produce goods at the same cost at which they were produced in other countries.  That was the outlook of the Government that the people put out of office.  It is not the policy of the present Government.  It has a different outlook as far as industry is concerned, and that is to enable the producers to get the cost of production here.  Deputy Mulcahy stated that the farmers had been helped and subsidised by every section of the community.  They are not being helped or subsidised by any section. They are quite capable of producing but they must get the cost of production. Deputy Mulcahy will not deny that they are entitled to that.  If the Deputy was engaged in an industry, furniture, boot making, or building, he would not get up in this House and say that those engaged in it should not get the cost of production.  No section of the community gets a smaller percentage of return on the amount of capital involved than the farmer.  If a man is a builder or the owner of a boot factory, every single item of his costs is taken into consideration and he takes a certain profit, even to the nail in the shovel, which is written down as capital.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows very well that every industry except farming gets cost of production.  A row is kicked up when some proposal is made to give farmers their cost of production.

If this Bill does no good, then, if farmers are to produce butter, someone must pay them if the industry is to be kept going.  I am giving my own opinion.  The same applies to every other section of the community. If this Bill does not help farmers sufficiently, so that they will be kept in production, some other measure will have to be brought in to do so.</P>

      <P>One would imagine from the speech to which we have just listened that this Bill was introduced to confer a benefit on the consumers. Deputy Allen told us that the object of the Bill was to enable the consumer to get butter at an economic price, whatever that may mean. I confess I do not know.  He went further and informed the House that consumers in this country had no right to get butter under the cost of production. What does the Bill itself mean?  That the people in this country have no right to get Irish butter <Col N="1338" /> under the cost of production, and that they must pay 4d. per lb. extra so that the people of England may get butter under the cost of production.</P>

      <P>The question I am interested in at the moment, as a representative of the workers, is not what is going to be paid for butter in England but what is going to be paid for it in Ireland.  That is all I am interested in.  I put it to the Dáil that what the Bill means, as Deputy Allen told us, is that the people of this country have no right to get Irish butter under the cost of production.  The effect of the Bill, however, will be to make Irish consumers pay 4d. per lb. more so that English consumers can purchase Irish butter under the cost of production.  That is the position as I see it.  I am opposed to this Bill, although I come from one of the principal dairying counties&mdash;if not the chief one, certainly the second best.  I am opposed to it because I do not believe it is going to do anything like what is claimed for it for the farmers and, secondly, because it places an intolerable burden on the consumers, and particularly the working classes. As I said on the original Resolution, I would be inclined to say that this Bill could be more fittingly called the Margarine Bounty Bill than the Butter Bounty Bill, because many people, <Col N="1339" /> particularly the working classes and the poor in the cities and towns, will be forced to buy margarine instead of butter.  I want to deal with the point made by the Minister in his opening speech.  He said that many voices were now raised on behalf of the consumers and on behalf of the poor, but that when a tariff of 4d. was introduced by the last Government there was no objection taken.  I want to tell the Minister, as far as I am concerned, and I think every other member of the Labour Party, that we voted against the 4d. tariff.  We voted for the original prohibitive tariff, which was to meet an emergency and was just a temporary measure.  We argued against and voted against the 4d. tariff which was introduced by the last Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not pretend to know very much about the dairying industry.  I am not a farmer, but I am in close touch with the industry, and I am in close touch with many of those engaged in it.  I have tried to get information from those who are in a position to give it on this matter.  It is suggested to me that the farmers&mdash;particularly the dairy farmers&mdash;are not doing anything like what they should do, and could do, to improve their own business.  I am giving the information as I got it.  I am told that the percentage of dairy farmers who are members of cow testing associations is very small.  I am told that there are tens of thousands of cows which are not paying for their feeding and which are not worth keeping. I am told that there are farmers, supposed to be dairy farmers, who do not know what return in milk they are getting from any particular cow on their farm.  That information may be wrong, but it has been given to me by men in the dairying industry.  Two of them, at least, were responsible for starting creameries, as well as cow-testing associations, in their own districts, and they are responsible for keeping those cow-testing associations going.  One man feeds 45 cows and sells the milk to the creameries.  A man in that position ought to know something about his business.  I give the information <Col N="1340" /> for what it is worth.  If action is to be taken by the Government to &ldquo;save the dairying industry,&rdquo; which is the phrase used, the action should take another form.  This particular method is not, in my opinion, going to help the farmers very much.  It will place a very heavy burden on the consumer, and, particularly, upon that section of the community least able to bear such a burden.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture stated that it was the intention of the Government that this scheme should be taken over and worked by the industry itself.  I think the Minister would be the first to agree that a scheme of this kind could not be worked very well by the industry as constituted at present.  The scheme would have to be overhauled before it could be worked by the industry as it is at present.  I am not sure, indeed, that it would not be necessary to devise a new scheme.  I hope this Bill will be agreed to, but only as a temporary measure&mdash;to last a year, or two years at the very outside.  The Bill was quite obviously drawn up in haste.  The machinery outlined in the Bill is disjointed in many respects.  I am quite sure that if the Minister had had more time to consider the draft of the Bill he would have improved the machinery which he proposes to operate for the purpose of giving effect to his bounty proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the dairying industry is in a very bad position.  It must be assisted if it is to survive.  I do not think that this Bill will lead to an increase in milk or butter production but it will certainly preserve the status quo until such time as business improves.  Judging by the present trend of butter prices, it is very difficult to say when there will be an improvement in butter or milk prices.  This Bill will mean an increase in the price of butter to the consumers but, after all, the farmers themselves are very large consumers. It is quite obviously the policy of the present Government to increase enormously, by means of high tariffs, the overhead charges of farmers and it is only right that they should try to <Col N="1341" /> assist them by proposals of this kind which will help to increase the price of one of their main products.  Deputy Allen said that one object of the Bill was to guarantee or ensure to the farmer a price for his milk corresponding to the cost of production. I wonder if this Bill will guarantee to the farmer a price corresponding to the cost of production.  The increased price to the farmer will not represent the cost of production. Judging by the figures the Minister gave when we were discussing the financial motion, the price will still be, at least, a half penny or three-farthings under the cost of production. This Bill does not guarantee to the farmer a price approaching the cost of production.  Expressing my own personal opinion, I do not like the giving of bounties on exports.  I think some Deputy pointed out in the debate on the financial motion that such artificial methods of maintaining production inevitably led to inefficiency. That is the experience of most countries where methods of this kind have been resorted to for the purpose of bolstering up production.  One valid argument could very well be used in support of this Bill, although it was not used by the Minister&mdash;that is, that while guaranteeing bounties on exports is objectionable, the question arises whether we are not forced to give bounties to counteract the effects of the bounties on the export to Great Britain from countries like Latvia, Finland, Russia, and, I might almost say, Denmark.  That is an argument which the Minister could very well have used in support of this Bill.  In my opinion, it is the only valid argument that could be used in support of it.  Butter has, undoubtedly, suffered more than any other commodity as a consequence of over-production in New Zealand, Australia and European countries. It has been affected very severely, as well, by world depression. I fear that for some years to come certain artificial means&mdash;drastic artificial means, perhaps&mdash;will have to be resorted to in order that our dairy stocks may be preserved and butter production continued.</P>
    <P>I imagine that one effect of the Bill <Col N="1342" /> will be that we will export too great a part of our produce to Great Britain, leaving too little butter for our own people.  This tendency will have the effect of reducing the market price of butter in England, and, to a corresponding extent, neutralising the effect of the bounty.  That will be the almost inevitable tendency, and the machinery the Minister has introduced will not obviate that tendency.  Deputy McMenamin mentioned that steps can be taken to prohibit the export of butter when there is a lack of butter for home requirements.  The idea is, undoubtedly, good, but there is an element of uncertainty about it which cannot but be bad in effect.  The chance of a prohibition of exports will make it impossible for our creameries to contract for regular delivery, and if our creameries are not in a position to contract for regular supplies for a period of twelve months or two years&mdash;in some cases, I understand, creameries enter into contracts for periods of three or four years&mdash;it will operate against them.</P>
    <P>If the Minister should, as a consequence of the powers that he is taking to himself in this Bill, take steps to give effect to the sections relating to control of imports, they would have a serious effect, not alone on the creameries themselves, but on the people to whom they sell this butter on the other side.  Furthermore, such action would have the effect certainly of producing a very great risk of not being able to obtain definite quantities, or at least not having a guarantee of being able to obtain definite quantities of butter according to contract.  Such a situation would be likely to induce buyers in England to offer a lower price than they otherwise would offer for our butter.</P>
    <P>There is only one other point that I want to deal with.  I think the effect of this Bill, in certain areas at all events, will be to induce farmers to keep their milk at home and sell the butter made from it in the neighbouring towns and villages.  That will happen almost inevitably in those areas where creameries were established during recent years, because there is no provision <Col N="1343" /> in the Bill for the imposition of a levy on farmers' butter, and rightly so.  Because of that, many farmers, in order to gain the maximum advantage out of this Bill, will keep their milk at home, particularly in those areas where they have a certain market for the butter made from it in the nearest towns and villages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I think no one will dispute the necessity of giving relief to the dairying industry in this country, but the pity of it is that those engaged in almost every other walk of life here are similarly circumstanced. The difficulty the Minister has to contend with in farming the measure, which, undoubtedly, is ingenious, is that he will have to place a levy on a minority in this country, and that at a time when it is least likely to be effective, because with an increase in the price of butter there is no doubt there will be decreased consumption. Those who are not able to afford butter in winter do not buy it when the price of it exceeds their capacity to buy.  Therefore, you have to take into consideration that there is likely to be a dislocation in the calculations of the Minister as to how far the levy is going to provide an adequate sum for the bounty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has also to be taken into consideration that this is a scheme that could be adopted by other countries exporting butter to the English or any other market if they found it a feasible proposition to do so.  A scheme of this kind was ushered in in Australia with considerable acclamation, and there is no doubt but that it was effective at a time when that country was in a prosperous condition. But the present position there is that the levy has had to be increased, while the bounty has had to be reduced owing to a decrease in consumption in the country and also to the fact that there has been an increase in production.  I will give the House some figures dealing with the position in Australia.  In 1925, when a scheme like this was introduced in Australia, two-thirds of the butter produced there was consumed at home and one-third <Col N="1344" /> exported.  There was a levy of three-halfpence on the home consumption and a bounty was given on the one-third that was exported.  The price jumped from 1/3½ to 1/6½.  But as from 14th April, 1931, the levy has been increased by 1¾d. and the bounty has been reduced by 2½d.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to 1st January, 1931, the bounty on butter was 4½d. and the levy was 1¾d.  Between that and 14th April, the bounty was reduced by three successive steps to 2½d., while the levy remained at the same figure.  The decrease was brought about by greatly increased production, and, to a lesser extent, by a falling off in local consumption owing to industrial conditions. I think these are factors that should be taken into consideration by the Minister in considering this scheme. I am certainly exercised as to the effect this will have on the cost of living, and on people who are perhaps least able to bear it.  I would welcome a scheme like this if some other means for financing it could be found, but under this scheme you will be simply increasing costs in other directions, and those mostly concerned will be unable to bear the increased cost.  I would ask the Minister to consider if it is not possible to devise some other means of financing the scheme, at least in part, rather than placing the whole levy on a small section of the community.  I take it that the agricultural section will not be asked to bear any portion of the cost of this.</P>

      <P>I take it from the speeches that have been delivered that there is fairly unanimous agreement in the House as to the necessity for this Bill.  Any criticism that has been levelled against it is really nothing more than criticism, because nothing in the way of alternative suggestions to meet the situation with which the Bill deals has been put forward.  Deputy Morrissey and other members of the House, in speaking of the bounty, said that it would lean very heavily on the section of the community least able to bear it&mdash;the poor.  That may be true, <Col N="1345" /> and it is an unfortunate fact if it is true.  But what is the alternative to that?  Is it not also an unfortunate thing that we have a section of the community whose existence is so near the bread line that a possible increase of a few pence per lb. in the price of the butter may render them unable to buy any further supplies of butter?  Is there any Deputy who will suggest that that state of affairs should be allowed to continue?  Do Deputies think that the remedy lies in leaving the dairying industry in the condition in which it is at present?  It is admitted that those engaged in the dairying industry must of necessity go out of production if some aid on the lines of this Bill is not provided for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night, the House discussed a tariff on woollens.  Deputy Morrissey, if I remember rightly, was one of the Deputies who took extreme care to bring to the notice of the Minister that in any development of the existing industry brought about as a result of the tariff the condition of the workers would be safeguarded to the extent that trade union conditions would apply, and that at least a decent standard of living would be made available for those engaged in the industry. I take it Deputy Morrissey is wide enough in his vision to realise that decent standards of living are necessary for the workman, whether he is engaged as a worker in a city, town or on a farm.  Fortunately for Deputy Morrissey, he added that he had little knowledge of the conditions in the dairying industry, but before any man makes a definite statement about any industry he should at least make sure that he knows sufficient about it to justify any statement he does make.  I assert that the conditions under which dairy farming is carried on in this country entail for those engaged in it, for their children and other workers nothing better than slave conditions.  These are the conditions that some of the Deputies in this House object to having altered, because of the possibility of inflicting on a poor section the hardship of not being able to buy butter to the extent they require it.  But there is no suggestion made as to a better remedy, <Col N="1346" /> to ensure that these poor people will have an opportunity of buying butter supplies.  There is no alternative suggestion made, and it all boils down to this: things are bad, we admit, but it probably may be safer to let things remain as they are, with the assurance that they will end up in bankruptcy, so far as the dairying industry is concerned. That is a poor policy and a poor outlook.  I believe, and I am confident of this, that the time has come when this country must make up its mind on the fact, that the great market that we have heard so much about, this great market at our doors, the market we should safeguard, at any cost, has failed to give a living wage to the producer in this country, who is depending for the sale of his products on that market.  We are up against the fact that the farmers must make alternative provision, if they are to exist, and that alternative provision is here embodied in this Bill, and in every tariff proposed to apply to industries in this country, which go to make this country more self-supporting and less dependent on that great market, that wonderful boon at our doors that has left our farmers in bankruptcy to-day.</P>
    <P>I have nothing more to say on the matter except that there may be difficulties ahead in administering this bounty.  It may not be sufficient, or large enough, and I say further that this principle of a bounty for the farmer's products in this country must be extended to many other parts of his production before he is left in a position equal to that of any other workers in the country.  Why should the principle of a living wage be applied to one section of the community and denied to another?  Why should workers have that protection of a decent wage for a week's work under decent conditions?  Why should traders be practically assured of a decent return for their labour and the money they have invested in their business?  Why should every class of workers, civil servants and everybody in this country, be guaranteed, and safeguarded by the State, and assured a decent standard of living while working and&mdash;many of them&mdash;a premium at the <Col N="1347" /> end of that in the form of a pension, while for another class working, again, I say, under slave conditions, under sweated labour conditions, no provision is made?  This is only the right step, but it is not extended far enough, and I will advocate that further bounties be given to the farmer who produces finished products in this country, and to such a degree as will enable him to produce under a decent standard of living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>When introducing this Bill, the Minister for Agriculture said that he had two objects in mind, first, to give the producer his cost of production and, second, to give the consumer his commodities at the lowest possible price.  I do not think that the Bill will produce either of those results.  In the first place, it will not go anywhere near giving the farmer his cost of production of butter.  Even assuming&mdash;and I think it is only an assumption&mdash;that the farmer gets the full benefit of the Bill, that is, that he gets, as a result of this legislation, 2d. per lb. on his butter, or its equivalent of about three farthings a gallon for milk, it will not bring him anywhere near the point where his production costs are satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister quoted the price of butter on the British market as about 105/-, and I think it is somewhere near that price, but it is likely to fall further. The price of milk, roughly speaking, would be somewhere about 3¾d. or 4d. a gallon, and even if we were to get the full results of this Bill, which could only produce ¾d. a gallon, we would only have arrived at the position when the farmers would be getting for their milk anything from 4½d. to 4¾d. a gallon.  That is a price at which I hope every Deputy in this House realises milk cannot be produced.  The Minister for Education, a moment ago, challenged the late Minister for Local Government, Deputy Mulcahy, that he had not faced up to the position as outlined by the Minister for Agriculture as to the production costs of milk.  I do not think anyone desires a discussion <Col N="1348" /> on that point at the moment, but if there is any such desire, I would not mind going into the whole matter. We have not got it from the Minister, or from any of the Government Deputies, but we will take one item alone in production costs&mdash;the cost of milking. The cost of milking a cow runs anywhere from £6 to £8 a cow.  The Minister looks at me in doubt.  The Minister for Defence once suggested in this House that a labourer might milk, I think he said, 25 cows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>If we could arrive at that state of affairs, when a labourer would, of his own desire, or through compulsion, milk 20 to 25 cows, we might have arrived at a stage when production costs would be reduced, but unfortunately we have not arrived at that position yet.  In my county, which is the principal dairy county in the Saorstát, they milk from 8 to 10 or an average of 9, but we will allow 10.  Even though all our costs have increased considerably from one cause or another, and our profits have not only diminished, but disappeared, and we have arrived at the position when not alone is it impossible to make ends meet, but we cannot keep the ends in sight of each other, we have not yet resorted to the extreme step of cutting off our labourers' wages to any great extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Milkers are still receiving, in my county, anywhere from £30 to £35 for milking for nine or ten months of the year, and if we add to that, what any Labour Deputy would reasonably assume would be proper provision for those milkers, in the way of food and lodging&mdash;even Deputy Davin would not suggest that I should provide for my labourer in such a manner that costs would be lower than, say, £40&mdash; and you arrive at the position when the milker gets £75, that is, £40 and £35 for milking, say, 9 cows, you have then arrived at an average of £8 per cow, the figure I gave a moment ago.  The average milk yield of a cow is somewhere about 500 gallons, and even making it 600 gallons, at 4d. <Col N="1349" /> a gallon, you will reach a figure of 200/- or £10, and the cost of milking alone is from £7 to £8, and perhaps more, off that amount.</P>
    <P>The cost of delivery of milk to the creamery, in addition, would certainly take over £2, and it would not do it. The incidental costs, machinery and cans, buckets and tankards, and everything else, would come to a considerable bit more.  There would be also, which is a very small item&mdash;I am glad the Opposition Party are going to get rid of it shortly&mdash;the question of rent.  That would have to be put down as bearing some relation to the cost of production. We may be relieved of that.  There is also the question of taxation.  We are relieved of some of that, and they might relieve us of the rest of it, but, unfortunately, up to the present I have got to take some account of that. These add more than a little to the cost of production of milk.  At any rate I have given you figures enough to prove that the milk of a cow which would average at present perhaps something about £10, would only go a very small way to meet the production costs which would run with rent, taxes, rates, labour, incidentals to, roughly speaking, £12 or £13 per cow.  I do not intend to say any more on that part of the question.</P>
    <P>I am glad that a few Deputies on the Government Benches have at last come to realise&mdash;and I think the Ministers are realising it too&mdash;that anything we can do here will not increase prices on the outside markets.  We have been preaching that for five or six years to deaf ears, and it was not listened to. As I said when I spoke last week, the Ministry are coming to realise their responsibilities and the difficulties of satisfying by legislation every demand of the people.  There are in this Bill several sections, and one does not know what the probable result of many of them will be.  I might say they are almost paradoxical.  One section would lead you to believe that the export of butter might be increased and another leads you to believe that the export of butter might be diminished, or perhaps disappear.  Take, for instance, the section which proposes to give the Minister <Col N="1350" /> power to stop the export of butter. That in itself will have, I fear, a disastrous effect on the whole creamery industry.  A great number of creameries, creamery managers and other people who desire to sell butter across Channel make yearly contracts.  They sell butter by contract, contracting to sell it for the year.  How is the seller to proceed to make a contract if there is provision in the Bill which permits the Minister to issue an order stopping the exports?  The Minister will answer me, probably, that in a sub-section of the section there is a provision that he might withdraw the order and issue a special licence, but there is another sub-section which says that the Minister, even when he issues a licence, might withdraw it in regard to any butter for which it had been granted. I think these are the words, and I do not want to misquote the Bill.  That is as far as I could read them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 27, sub-section (3), which provides that if a special export licence is granted the Minister may at any time before a consignment of butter is actually exported revoke the licence relating to such consignment. So that even after having made his contract, with all the extraordinary possibilities facing him, the possibility of the Minister stopping the export by an order and the possibility that he might or might not issue a special licence and that having issued the special licence he might withdraw it before it could be used, where is the feasibility of anybody entering into a business contract to sell butter under these conditions?  There is, however, a graver danger possibly that this Part V of the Bill may possibly lead to a dislocation of our whole butter trade with England, because our difficulty in the past has been in competing with foreign countries, the Danes and others, that while they were able to provide for a butter supply the whole year round there was a stoppage of all supplies from this country for a part of the year.  The Minister now proposes as a safeguard, though it is dangerous otherwise to take power at any <Col N="1351" /> time to stop the export of butter, to stop the continuity of supplies in a market in which we find it very hard to keep our feet.  Part V of the Bill, to my mind, if it does not require to be deleted, requires particular attention. It was necessary, I suppose, for the Minister to make some provision that all the butter would not be exported. I pointed out that difficulty in my speech on the motion originally, and I also said, I think, that the Minister would find very much difficulty in putting any such proposal as that into effect.  He has attempted to put it into effect by giving himself this power.  I am very much afraid that in removing one evil he will create another evil that will be disastrous to the whole dairying industry.</P>
      <P>I said in the beginning that I did not think we would reap the full advantage proposed in this bounty, that is, 2d. for the farmer.  I believe that possibly nobody can forecast what the eventual benefit to the farmer will be. Certainly it will not be 2d.  The utmost it could be would be 2d., but in practice it will be found that it certainly will not be 2d., possibly only half of it.  If they get a penny advantage out of this they will be very lucky.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Who will get the other penny?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain that in a minute if the Minister will give me an opportunity.  They will certainly gain a possible advantage.  The Minister says it will be 2d.  I say half of it.  The tendency will be, as Deputy Roddy stated a few moments ago, with a fourpenny bounty, for farmers to export not half, which the Minister assumes they will, but the greater portion.  Why?  Because they will have received the direct benefit of 4d. a pound bounty that they would receive by keeping butter for the winter and incurring storage costs and other costs.  It is to get rid of that tendency that the Minister has brought in Part V of the Bill.  There would be that tendency, so that when they exported more than half their butter the levy provided could not <Col N="1352" /> possibly provide a bounty of 4d.  In that event they could not receive the 2d. per pound which it is proposed to give them.  Take another event, that they do not export half and that all the consequences I am prophesying do not happen.  What is going to happen in the home market?  Does the Minister really tell us that because there are certain sections in this Bill the farmers must receive that 2d. on the portion consumed at home? There will be a tendency particularly as butter soars in price for people who usually eat creamery butter to purchase substitutes.  I am not saying that they will go in for margarine.  The very poor probably will be driven to margarine but the ordinary consumer will be driven to the purchase of butter such as farmer's butter. And the farmers selling butter directly to the consumer or to the small retailers will have the benefit arising as the result of this bounty without having to contribute anything to it. So that when the creamery producer says that his butter must go up 4d. the home producer says: &ldquo;I do not want 4d.  I only want 2d.&rdquo;  And he will be glad to get 2d. so that he will be a competitor with the creamery in the home market and will almost inevitably reduce the price in the home market.  There is no possibility of the farmer getting 2d. out of this Bill.  The factory butter people who, if their pamphlet which I have seen is correct, at the present moment export nearly all their butter will also be anxious to cater for the home market and undersell the creameries.  They will have the levy, I admit, of 2d. They will have that advantage over the farmer selling his own butter.  They will be in this favourable position as regards the seller of creamery butter, that while the creamery manager or the committee whose object must be that the farmer must get the benefit of whatever butter he sells&mdash;the seller of the factory butter will be in this position that he is paid his 2d., and he is paid for his butter as well.  He has paid the farmer for his butter and he has no more to pay.  He can stick to whatever he gets beyond the 2d..  He might possibly get 3d. reducing by a <Col N="1353" /> penny the utmost possible advantage which the Minister says the farmer might get out of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I said at the beginning that I am going to support the Bill, not because I think this is the best method of helping the farmer.  I can conceive other ways of helping him which would be better.  I may say that what this Bill proposes to do, with all its manipulations and all its sections, could have been done and the same effects could have been brought about without this Bill if the farmers and the creameries and the sellers of butter had combined.  They could have brought about, without legislation, the full results that the Minister hopes to get from this Bill.  I think the Minister himself admitted that in his opening remark.</P>

      <P>I have not been a great believer in the efficacy of tariffs or bounties as a help for agriculture. But in these days of mounting tariffs, when everything that the farmer buys or needs is rising in price, we, as representing the farmer, will not be blamed if we grasp at any straw that helps him over the difficulty.  And it is because this measure proposes, in some small way, to help the farmer that I am supporting it, but I do so much in the same spirit that I supported the tariff on butter&mdash;rather in hope than in expectation.</P>

      <P>The proposals contained in this Bill aim at giving a minimum of 4½d. per gallon to the suppliers; and in so far as the Government are proposing to give what we look upon as a guaranteed minimum price to the producer, we certainly support that policy.  They also hope&mdash;and I am not quite sure whether it is a pious hope&mdash; to fix or in some way regulate the price of butter so that the minimum average price will not exceed 1/5 per lb.  I am not by any means satisfied that the proposals contained in this Bill will secure the object which the Government Party are out to achieve. I am not satisfied that, through the machinery provided in the Bill as it now stands, production will be maintained at the existing level, and that the dairying industry in its present disorganised state will be able to hold its own in the export market.  It is laughable to hear Deputy Blythe, as an ex-Minister, making a case for the establishment of an organised marketing machine, especially as he, as an ex-Minister, is mainly responsible. <Col N="1355" /> with his colleagues in the last Government, for the collapse of the Associated Creameries, which was the marketing system in operation at the particular period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it is wrong for the Government to raise, through taxation, or by the imposition of additional taxation on the butter consumers of this country&mdash;to raise from them by way of increased prices taxation of this kind and to set it aside for this purpose. I do not believe that the position of the butter export industry can possibly be maintained even at its present decreasing level unless we have some central marketing machine for that purpose.  The people who look for Irish butter and Danish butter in Britain to-day are huge buying concerns like the Co-operative Wholesale Society, whose turnover is something like four hundred millions a year, or like Lyons, the great catering firm, who cannot afford to send travellers over to this country in sufficient numbers, and send lorries around to each individual creamery to collect butter and other commodities in small quantities. They are buying in increasing quantities from Denmark, Australia and New Zealand to-day at the expense of this country, because this country cannot supply large quantities of the quality required.  There is no future for the butter industry in the British market <Col N="1356" /> unless we adopt the methods adopted by Denmark, Australia and New Zealand. Why should the ordinary butter consumer be asked, as he is being asked in this Bill, to subsidise people who will not do business in a proper way?  Why should the State come to their assistance?  That is what is being done in this Bill.  I think we are entitled, speaking for some section of the consumers who are likely to suffer as a result of the Bill, to an assurance that some steps will be taken by the Government either to induce or compel the people in the dairying industry to regulate their business in a proper way. It is very little use for Deputy Blythe, after being only six weeks an ex-Minister, to criticise the present Minister from the point of view of his failure to set up a central marketing organisation. He and his colleagues who were in office for ten years failed to appreciate the circumstances, with the result that the dairying industry is in a dying condition to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed by this Bill to subsidise the industry at the expense of the consumer.  The members of the Labour Party do not like this scheme. Deputy Maguire suggested that no alternative proposals had been put forward.  We say that if this industry is to be maintained out of taxation, direct or indirect, the proper way to raise the money is by taxing luxuries and amusements and looking in some other direction for the money that must be found to keep that valuable industry on its feet, even for a limited period.  We are, I admit, at a disadvantage in discussing the measure, so far as we have not before us the Budget proposals.  I should like to know whether luxuries and other amusements are likely to be taxed, whether, for instance, there is likely to be a tax on betting or picture houses, and any other form of amusement or luxury before we are asked to tax the consumer in the way proposed. We are at that disadvantage, but we have this advantage, that the remaining stages of the Bill will not be discussed in the House until we have heard from the Minister for Finance what is contained in the Budget. To that extent there is an advantage, <Col N="1357" /> and for that reason the members of the Labour Party will give a conditional Second Reading to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech indicated, and, of course, I can appreciate the circumstances, that almost everything else is likely to be taxed, and that there is no hope, or very little hope, at any rate, of raising the sum necessary to help this industry in the way he is anxious to do it through the Budget.  I put this to him however: is there no possibility of even finding part of the money required by direct taxation either now or at a later period in the present financial year? What is the purpose of imposing an additional price on the consumers of butter and leaving the £60,000 odd received by the revenue from imported butter to go to relief of taxation?  I say that the £40,000 or £60,000 derived from the tax on butter should be put into a pool for the purpose of reducing the amount raised by the levy.  In the ordinary course of events we do not expect a revenue from the tax on imported butter.  If a revenue is accidentally received, it should be set aside under existing circumstances for the creation of a pool to reduce the amount raised by levy.  If conditions improve during the present financial year, I suggest to the Minister and the Cabinet that it might be possible to raise other moneys to be set aside in the same way for the reduction of the amount raised by the levy.</P>
    <P>I want to make another suggestion on behalf of the Labour Party.  This proposal of propping up this industry by way of bounty so that it will be able to send out of this country certain quantities of butter with £800,000 of the Irish people's money is a dangerous and risky experiment, and that experiment should be limited to the shortest possible period.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I suggest that the life of this Bill should be limited to a period of one year, at the end of the year we should be in a position to review the conditions prevailing.  In the meantime, I suggest to the Minister and his colleagues that they should use all the influence which they can bring to bear for the purpose of inducing the creameries to go into one central <Col N="1358" /> marketing organisation, and failing their willingness to do so of their own accord, I personally am in favour of compelling them to go into that central marketing organisation, believing as I do, after carefully considering the situation, that there is no hope for the industry maintaining exports at the existing level unless there is some machinery for the purpose of marketing the butter on the British market.</P>
    <P>I am informed that with the existing disorganised state of the industry, if we go on as we are going to-day, the creameries are competing against one another for the sale of their butter on the British market.  That is a disastrous state of affairs in itself and reacts to the disadvantage of the whole industry in the country and should not be allowed to continue.  The members of the Labour Party appreciate the fact that the Minister has not been very long in office, that he has not had time at his disposal to consider all these questions with a full realisation of their consequences.  I am, however, firmly convinced that this is a dangerous, risky, and very doubtful experiment, and should be limited to the shortest possible period.  I appeal to the Minister to put a clause into the Bill limiting its operations to one year at the very most, and give whatever Government is in existence an opportunity of reviewing the position at the end of that period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. Shaw Mr. Shaw">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill demands the united opposition of Longford and Westmeath Deputies, regardless of Party, owing to the fact that there being no creameries in these counties, and therefore no export of butter, the people there are going to be heavily penalised without any corresponding advantage.  The purpose of the Bill is to benefit creameries in Limerick, Cork, and other counties, and, incidentally, to supply cheap butter to John Bull, whom the Party opposite profess to despise so much.  I am sure the Minister for Agriculture is genuinely interested in the farmers, and I want to put it to him that at the present time there is a growing hostility to Irish produce in the British market.  At the Spring Show <Col N="1359" /> to-day I was speaking to several people who had come over from England and they told me that in many shops in England at present there are placards displayed, &ldquo;No Irish produce stocked here.&rdquo;  I suggest to the Minister that he should draw the President's attention to the effect that the policy which is being adopted by him is going to have on this country in connection with the only market that we have to sell our products.  Even if there were creameries in the counties I represent I would oppose this Bill, because to tax a food that is of the first importance to every household is a wrong policy.  I have had some hard things to say of the Labour Party.  I was going to say that I believed they would vote for the Bill when I saw them coming out of the Lobby.  I am not going to say that now on account of Deputy Davin's remarks.  It is perfectly evident from his remarks that the Bill will have to be withdrawn, because Deputy Davin represents here a Party who can dictate policy.  I have sufficient confidence in the Labour Party to believe that they will not allow the Party opposite, who think that the people of this country can live on politics, to drive the people into bankruptcy and starvation, because that is their present policy.  I am persuaded that if the Irish farmers are deprived of the British market we would not be able to exist, and then unemployment and all the other troubles due to scarcity of money will be brought about.  I have a sensible suggestion to make with regard to that matter, and I want an answer to it.  The Party opposite state that they are going to retain the Land Annuities.</P>

Yet you put 4d. per lb. tariff between you on butter.  I do not know which of you did that.  Now you are going to put another additional levy on butter, and the net result is that whereas butter would have cost the poor in Dublin and other parts of Ireland 1/- per lb., they are being asked to pay 1/5.  That is the net result of your tariffs.  Who is responsible I do not know.  All I know is that this Executive Council is going to put another tax on.  I was glad to hear Deputy Davin's emphatic protest, and I join with the Labour Party most cordially and say there is an emergency. It is admitted we must raise money to subsidise this industry, if it is to survive.  This is an emergency, and we accept this as an emergency measure.  But the sooner it is considered calmly in the light of Budget resources, and alternative sources sought for, such as taxation of amusements and luxuries, or even other forms of food, such as tea, the better it will be for the country.  No one knows better than the Minister for Agriculture how vitally necessary butter is, particularly for the children of the poor. No one knows better how valuable an article in their diet it is, and I depend upon him and the members of the Executive Council to address themselves to the task of finding revenue to finance this business somewhere else <Col N="1362" /> than on butter, which is practically a vital necessity for the people of this country.</P>

      <P>While I do not presume to say that I know every phase of the dairy industry, I would like to say that from my experience and what has come to my knowledge of the manner in which that industry is carried on at present, it is only an incentive to indolence and idleness.  I might remind the House that when 4d. a pound of a tariff was given as an advantage to the dairy farmers of the country one would think that such advantages might be sufficient to enable them to carry on their industry successfully if they were endeavouring to do so efficiently.  The county from which I come is not one where there are many dairies.  I am glad of it from what I have seen of the dairy industry elsewhere.  I wonder where we are going to stop?  Where does the agriculture farmer come in? Is the poor farmer in Mayo to have any consideration?  Why not try and find something to subsidise the production of potatoes, oats, mangolds, etc.? Why should they not get some consideration? We have the sugar beet subsidised at considerable expense, and, while I do not complain, I think it is time that a note of warning should be sounded with regard to what the consequences may be to people situated <Col N="1363" /> such as those are in Mayo and Galway. There is no prospect or likelihood of dairying being carried on there.  I may add it is not so long since I was speaking to a parish priest in the constituency I represent.  It was suggested to me by some people previously that it might be advisable to start dairying in the locality.</P>
      <P>His words to me were: &ldquo;If you take my advice, Mr. Davis, and I have some experience, for I came from a district where dairying was carried on, you will not touch this thing.  I would advise the people to have nothing to do with it.  It will be quite all right as long as it can be carried on on successful lines, but it carries in its train a great danger.  There are poor people, and at the time when milk is plentiful they are not going to do anything but what is all right, but when milk becomes dear and when it becomes more profitable to them to dispose of the milk they may dispose of the milk at the risk of neglecting their own children.&rdquo;  These are the words he used, and I certainly consider that these words came from somebody&mdash;from a parish priest who had considerable experience in a matter like that.  If you see a creamery in the neighbourhood of a town you see men from four or five miles outside the town coming in there who will, possibly, spend the greater part of the day in the town, and I do not know that they would spend it well.  I do not know that it would be any advantage to these men or to their homes that that creamery was there to tempt them along that road to waste their time instead of carrying on their work at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if some of those who carry on the dairy industry produce on their farms the necessary supply of food to feed their dairy stock?  It does not surprise me to see the representatives from various constituencies, from counties where the dairying industry is carried on, and where the people live almost exclusively from the dairy industry, speaking in support of this Bill.  I wonder what do these people do really in the way of agriculture, what employment do they give except <Col N="1364" /> the employment given to a few men to milk their cows?  What is it they do? Many of them, certainly in some districts in the neighbourhood of the town, have to purchase the potatoes they require for their own homes, and possibly they have to purchase other things as well that they should grow on their farms.  And we are told that we must all stand up and prop up the dairy industry, and that the poor man in the congested districts in the West of Ireland, who can ill afford to make any contribution to a thing like this, must have a levy placed on him or a tax placed on him for this Bill.  That man will, unfortunately, be hurt very much by the Bill.  He will be under duress, to use a much quoted word.  I did not object to the tariff of 4d. per lb. given to butter some time ago. That ought to be quite sufficient to indemnify the dairy farmer against any risks with regard to the success of his industry, and now we see the Minister for Agriculture introducing this measure.  I dare say he is doing so in order to meet the wishes of the many deputations of people who are pressing this matter, and perhaps he thinks it may be to his advantage to meet them.  But when it comes to a bounty of 4d. per lb. to enable the sellers of butter to sell butter cheaper in England than in Ireland I do not stand for it and I do not think that eventually any body of people in Ireland will look upon it as an advantage.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any man who has a sense of fair play will not realise that in passing this Bill he is inflicting on the poor the greatest injustice and hardship that it is possible to inflict. Any fair-minded man who considers this will say that the Bill is one that should not be passed.  Personally I consider the Bill is more than absurd. It is the very limit in injustice. I think it is an injustice to the poor. Any industry that requires to be propped up in that manner is an industry that will be proved by time to be very rotten indeed.  The result of such a measure as this will be of no advantage to the people of this country and no advantage even to those whom it is supposed to <Col N="1365" /> benefit, because they will cease to be self-reliant.  They will in future depend all the time on these subsidies.  No matter what Government is in office they will look to that Government to do something for them in their business, when all the time they should be doing better by relying on themselves.</P>
    <P>Is it not quite reasonable that the dairy industry like the general agricultural industry of the country should stand on its own feet?  The dairy industry should at all events endeavour to do so as far as possible.  But we are told now that that is out of the question. Naturally the support for this Bill is very strong from the representatives of constituencies where the creamery industry is mainly carried on; but people representing counties such as I do, must find it their bounden duty in the interests of the general public, and most particularly in the interests of the poor people, to oppose a Bill like this.  I ask Deputies to say that there should not be inflicted on the mass of the poor people a burden like this.  The people of the country should not be burdened with this heavy tax on the butter they have to purchase.  This is a tax that is bound to be very injurious to themselves, their children and their homes.  These are matters that Deputies should take into consideration.  I have no great prejudice at all in this matter.  I want to do what is best for the country. I supported the tariff of 4d. per lb. last year on butter, but beyond that I cannot see my way to go.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to take up much time.  I have listened with some amazement and a great deal of amusement to the statement made by Deputy Davis.  He said that County Mayo is not a dairying county.  I wonder is Deputy Davis aware of the fact <Col N="1367" /> that for 20 or 25 years a very successful co-operative creamery has been working in the Ballaghaderreen district and it embraces a large number of suppliers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moane</NameTxt>
      <P>That creamery has a large number of suppliers and quite a large number come from County Mayo.  In addition to that we have creameries set up in South Mayo and they have been working for the last three years.  I think the Minister deserves to be congratulated on the action he has taken.  He is making an honest and practical effort to keep the dairying industry alive.  As a representative of the farmers in my area who are suppliers to creameries, I heartily welcome this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephOShaughnes" hpid="Mr. O'Shaughnessy Mr. O'Shaughnessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shaughnessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I represent one of the greatest dairying counties in the Free State.  I would be very much surprised to hear a dissatisfied or a discordant note over the introduction of this Bill.  In County Limerick, the dairying cattle are passing out and the industry is not progressing.  This Bill will give much-needed assistance. Deputy Morrissey told us of an interview he had with two farmers in County Tipperary.  Their opinion was that the present condition of the industry is due to inactivity on the part of the farmers.  I say that the opinions of the two farmers to whom Deputy Morrissey was speaking do not represent the opinions of the big bulk of the farmers in the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey is very concerned about labour.  If the dairying industry goes down labour will be the first to suffer.  This Bill, in my opinion, will go farther to solve the unemployment problem than any measure that has yet been brought before the House.  The Opposition have told us that similar schemes have been before them at other times and they would not consider them.  I say that if they did not consider them they gravely neglected an important branch of agriculture and that is why they are now on that side of the <Col N="1368" /> House.  This Bill may not completely solve the problem of the dairy farmer, but it will be a very helpful instalment and it will enable the farmers to go a long way towards making their position economic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to follow the example of the last two speakers and I will be as brief as I possibly can.  I opposed this measure when it was introduced and I have not heard anything since that would tend to alter my attitude in relation to it. I deprecate the tone that has run right through this debate.  One conjures up the Irish farmer as being some miserable, anaemic creature who has no initiative and is a mere sapling who has to be spoon-fed by tariffs and bounties.  The Deputy who spoke last is not a great example of the starving farmer we have heard about. I entirely deprecate that tone.</P>
      <P>One's eyesight must be deceiving when one is peregrinating through the country seeing evidence, not of great prosperity, but certainly not of much poverty amongst the farming classes. Acute poverty there is in the cities and towns.  The passage of this Bill, in my opinion, will intensify and make more acute that poverty.  In the worst state a farmer can ever reach in this country he is always assured of two things, a roof over his head and enough to eat. The workers in the cities and towns, if they fall into arrears of rent, have no sympathetic Land Commission to go to.  They have, instead, an unsympathetic rack-renting landlord who throws them on the street if they fail to pay their rent.  If the town dweller meets with a long period of unemployment, what is the position?  He has to throw himself on the tender mercies of the home assistance officers.  It would be most interesting to know how many farmers, small or big, tillage or dairying, are drawing home assistance in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many farmers whom I know.  They are hardworking, industrious men who want to be let alone, and who want to keep <Col N="1369" /> their business out of the maelstrom of Party politics.  I know creameries in my own area and I know the farmers supplying those creameries.  They have not got what you might describe as a bed of roses.  They have been up against bad times during the last couple of years; but there were many years when they had prosperous times, many years when they experienced all the luxuries of prosperity.  Undoubtedly, they have fallen on evil times.  Once you begin to educate the farmer into the principle enunciated here to-day by speaker after speaker, that he must make the least possible effort to earn a livelihood so long as he can be spoon-fed by the State, you are not going to build up a prosperous State.  You will have instead a race of anæmic people who will not make an effort on their own behalf without some assistance from the State.</P>
      <P>Did the farmers receive the benefit of the last tariff?  Did the milk suppliers receive any benefit?  They did not.  A number of cute persons in this country did.  They were able to buy the butter from the creameries at 110/- and 120/- per cwt., and they put it into cold storage and sold it later at 150/- and 165/-.  These are the facts.  I received a telegram from a body of persons engaged in the manufacture of butter, and I would like Deputies to hear the contents of it.  There is another side to this butter question.  There is the factory end.  The factory gives a good deal of employment.  The factory end will be affected by this tariff.  In the telegram I received there are some names that have for me a very familiar ring.  The telegram reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At fully representative meeting of the Home Dairy Butter Exporters held this day&mdash;</P>
      <P>that would be over a week ago</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;the Dairy Produce (Price Regulations) proposals have been fully discussed. The exporters, after mature consideration, decided that proposals are unworkable and are of no advantage to the farmers making home-made dairy butter.  Irish Butter and Exporters Association, Ltd.; C. Murphy &amp; Co., Ltd.; Central Packing Company, Ltd.; O'Mullane Brothers; John Reidy &amp; Co., <Col N="1370" /> Ltd.; Dowdall, O'Mahoney &amp; Co., Ltd.; Charles Daly; Charles Nolan and Sons, Ltd.; Henry Paul &amp; Co.; D. Cleary &amp; Son; James Daly and Sons, Ltd.; William Warner, Ltd.; C. O'Leary; J.M. Slattery &amp; Sons, Ltd.; T.S. Prendiville; Paxman and Co., Ltd.; E.E. Whitaker and Co., Ltd.</P>
    <P>All these people are engaged in the manufacture of butter.  I know some of the signatories to this document.  They are strong supporters of the Party opposite and, as I said, some of the names have rather a familiar ring.  I am sure Deputies will agree with me that the name of Mr. Dowdall is one.

      <P>&ldquo;The empty laugh betokens the vacant mind.&rdquo;  These are all men of standing in the country who are associated with the industry and give a good deal of employment. That is another side of the question that I respectfully submit to the consideration of the Minister.  A Deputy for Mayo told us that a creamery is working in his area and that it gets supplies from, amongst other places, Roscommon.  That is to be used as an argument for the imposition of this tariff.  Because in a scattered area a creamery has a turnover of a couple of thousand pounds yearly, the poor of this country are to be called upon to pay 4d. extra per pound for butter.  You are going to inflict on the infant life and on the adolescents of this country, to whom butter is a necessity, a further injury.  I opposed this Bill in the opening stages, and I will continue to oppose it, because I have heard no argument adduced to show why there should be any change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are beginning to see the conflict of interests over this proposal. Deputies who, yesterday, were in full support of a tariff on the machinery which meant a big impost on the overheads of the agricultural community, now see things from another angle.  The men who were enthusiastic about tariffs on agricultural implements, tariffs on woollens, on boots, in fact on everything <Col N="1371" /> that the agricultural community used and did not produce, and which raised the cost of living considerably, are now up in arms against this proposal. There you have the conflict of interests.  It will begin to dawn on Deputy Allen and farming Deputies, I think, what tariffs will mean to the farmer.  The very few industries that could be helped in which the farming community are interested are so small and there is so much opposition that they are represented by what I said here a few years ago.  Take, for instance, a 4d. loaf as representing a tariff policy.  The most the farmer could expect out of that from tariffs, even if he got his full share, would be a crumb of the crust, and a good many Deputies stand up here and deny him that crumb.  I am surprised at some of the remarks that were made even from this side of the House.  We heard the words &ldquo;indolence&rdquo; and &ldquo;idleness&rdquo; used.  There is no foundation for the use of such words in regard to farming.  I have spoken to men in business at the other side of the water and they admitted that Irish butter is as good as any butter in the market, that it is as good as New Zealand or Danish butter.  There is no evidence of idleness or indolence.  I suppose the remarks were made by those who do not know the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin, in his speech, said that he wished to oppose this Bill but did not like to do it.  He gave as his reason that he would like to get at it from another angle, that farmers have not regulated their business in a proper way.  It was not the fault of the farmers or the creamery committees if the selling organisation that was established a few years ago went to the wall.  The farmers and the farmers' committees had nothing to do with that organisation, and they certainly had nothing to do with the break up of it.  There was another organisation, some of whose members did break it up&mdash;the Creamery Managers' Association.  There were at least enough of them there to wreck the whole scheme.  I suppose if a vote of the Creamery Managers' <Col N="1372" /> Association was taken, a majority would be in favour of the Associated Creameries.  They made the position impossible.</P>
    <P>I paid some attention to the matter and I am convinced that nothing short of State control and law will compel all the creameries to come in.  Even if the industry is controlled by the State it would be no gold mine.  Very little, if anything, more than is being got now could be got, but there would be more co-ordination.  The price per cwt. will not be improved more than a shilling or two per cwt.  As a matter of fact, some of the people who remained outside the organisation a few years ago claimed that they got more money than the Associated Creameries got.  If there is State control it is not going to give them much more than they are getting.</P>
    <P>This is called a bounty.  It is not a bounty at all.  The State is going to contribute nothing except whatever costs will be incurred by the Department. The fund is being made up by a levy on creameries and factories. They have to pay 2d. for every pound produced during eight months of the year.  That 2d. will go to create a fund that will pay the bounty, and the rest will be taken from the consumers in this country.  The State is contributing nothing, and in no sense is it a bounty.  It is part-feeding the milk suppliers on their own tail and getting the balance from the consumers. There is no use in calling it something that it is not.  There is no levy whatever on the other big class of producer who, even though not organised, produce their own butter and sell in the local markets.  There is no means of supervising them.  They are going to get whatever benefits will be conferred, but they are going to contribute nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>The people who are going to bear the brunt want them also. The machinery in the Bill is faulty in that connection, as that class will get the same benefit and contribute nothing to the cost.  To that extent the Bill is faulty.  Creameries are both manufacturers and sellers, and it is <Col N="1373" /> easy to deal with them.  There will be considerable difficulty in dealing with merchants and factors who buy butter in the country and sell it.  I can see by the telegram that has been sent to Deputy Anthony that they are going to have more difficulties than the creameries.  It is only a question of addition and subtraction for creameries, as they will have to pay their 2d. per lb.  That matter is easily dealt with.  I agree with Deputy Davin that a year should be the limit of this Bill. At the end of that time the difficulties that will have arisen will be seen.  I think it would be better to review the Bill at the end of a year rather than at the end of two or three years.  I am certain the Minister for Agriculture will be the first to see the necessity for doing so.</P>
      <P>We are going to get 4d. more than the English market can give us in the ordinary way in regard to 50 per cent. of our production.  For the other 50 per cent., sold here, the market will be forced up so as to give us the 4d. Of that 4d. the creamery supplier will contribute 2d., leaving 2d. to come to the supplier, minus the enhanced price he will have to pay for his own home supplies and minus some other costs. I think the most he can expect is about 1d. or 1¼d. per lb.  I do not think it will be 1½d.  That would mean something over ¼d. or ½d. a gallon for his milk.  It is an effort, and I welcome it as an effort, but it will go a very short way to deal with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we might discount some of the speeches made, especially that of the Minister for Education.  He spoke for some time and said nothing of any use so far as the Bill is concerned. We are supposed to get 18/4 of profit on the money we pay.  I put it that my figure will be nearer the mark&mdash; that the most it will be will be about 10/- or 10/6 per cwt.  Even that, bad as it is, I am prepared to accept.  If the method suggested, I think, by Deputy Davin were adopted and the money were provided by a tax on luxuries or amusements, there would be no danger of profiteering or of the other evils which are possible under this Bill.  In my opinion, that would <Col N="1374" /> be a much better way of dealing with the problem than the way suggested. However, we have no objection to the Bill going on for twelve months, at the end of which time there can be a review of the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>Everything I had to say on the general provisions of this Bill I said on the financial resolution. I objected to the Bill then on account of the fact that it promised to be very expensive to work, that it cast on the people least able to bear it a further burden, and that it would not have the effect of helping the ordinary farmer as distinct from the farmer-supplier to the creameries.  I come from a county where creameries are of small importance, where we have mixed tillage farming.  I agree with the proposal to put our products in a better position to meet competition on the foreign market.  We are told that these foreign markets are subsidised and loaded against us, and that something must be done to enable our produce to compete and maintain its position on those markets.  We should, however, take care that we do not, in another way, militate against our own interests with regard to these foreign markets.</P>
      <P>I direct the attention of the House to a question asked in the British House of Commons on Monday by Lord Scone.  He asked the President of the Board of Trade if he would invite representatives of the Danish Government to a conference, with a view to arranging a commercial treaty whereby Denmark, in return for importing an increased quantity of British materials and manufactures, would become entitled to some of the fiscal advantages enjoyed by British Dominions and Colonies.  He said: &ldquo;It will be a considerable time before this country can produce bacon and other products to satisfy our needs, and Denmark is much more worthy of our custom than the Irish Free State.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My objections to the Bill, generally, are on account of the effect on home-produced butter and the incidence of the cost in respect of poor persons, combined with the small advantage which will eventually result to the <Col N="1375" /> farmers.  Section 2 provides that the levy is to be made from April to November.  I should like to know if the bounty will be paid in respect of exported butter only in the same period. If a merchant had made a contract to export butter for a long period, how would he be affected with regard to the bounty?  There is power taken to alter the levy.  How are merchants who have butter on hands on which the full levy has been paid going to be recouped if the levy is lowered?</P>

      <P>It was suggested that we should have done something to help the creameries to help themselves and reference was made to central marketing. I am anxious to do everything I can to help central marketing by the creameries, so that they will not be cutting prices on the foreign market, but I do not feel that any intervention at this time would be of any use, because there is a sort of prejudice against central marketing.  There was an attempt made at central marketing a year ago and there is a very strong prejudice against it on the part of certain creameries since then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Except we had the goodwill of the creamery managers, it <Col N="1376" /> would be very hard to organise for central marketing.  The Department of Agriculture is anxious that such a thing should be done, but we do not feel that it can be done at the moment.  I was asked by Deputy Mulcahy what industry we are trying to help.  We are trying to help the whole industry of the production of milk, creameries in particular.  The Bill is based on the assumption that we want to help the dairy industry generally.</P>
      <P>The question of the cost to the consumer has been raised and various figures have been given.  I stated on the last day that our figures worked out at about £400,000.  Deputy Mulcahy produced figures which built the cost up to nearly a million.  Some of his figures are wrong.  We consume about 300,000 cwts. of creamery butter. We consume only a small amount of factory butter.  Only about 40,000 cwts. of farmers' butter, so far as we know, are sold by farmers for consumption in the Free State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is consumed by the producers themselves on their own farms, so that it does not really make any difference to the farmer producing his own butter whether the price is to be 1/1 or 1/5d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>600,000 cwts. of butter consumed by the people who make it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  About 40,000 cwts. of that are sold.  According to the statistics, the remainder of that is supposed to be consumed by the farmers and the members of their own families.  That cuts down the Bill, of course considerably again. We in our calculations gave the figure of £415,000 as the cost.  Supposing the price were to go up by 4d. per lb. over the cost of the last two years&mdash;the cost of the last two years, of course, included three or four months in the winter when the cost was high following the tariff so that those three or four months would be taken off&mdash;but taking these two things into consideration the figure would <Col N="1377" /> work down to about £415,000.  If, however, you were to take the cost of the tariff and this thing combined &mdash;to take the two together which would perhaps be the fairer way to look at it&mdash;the cost would be about £610,000.  That is how we make out the figures.  We have gone to all the trouble possible to get the figures: the amount of production and the amount of consumption and so on within the country of the different classes of butter.</P>
      <P>To go to the other side of this and get the cost of the production of milk is very difficult.  I certainly do not agree with Deputy Bennett that the whole price of the milk goes to the milkers and to meet the cost of delivery at the creameries because it is practically inconceivable how, if that were so, farmers could live at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If they pay everything they get to the workmen they hire and to the men they get to bring the milk to the creameries, then of course there is nothing left for themselves at all.  I do not believe that Deputy Bennett would hire a man and give him nothing to do for the whole day except to milk eight cows in the morning and eight cows in the evening, leaving him idle for the rest of the day.  Surely the man would get something else to do for the remainder of the day if there was anything else to be done.  The whole cost, I suggest, cannot be put against the milking of the cows.  But, as near as we can go to the costings which were accepted by the Commission on Agriculture that sat in 1923, these would be about 5½d. per gallon, and I agree with Deputy Bennett that we are not giving the farmer under this scheme the cost of production. We are only going part of the way and are not giving him the full cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, but we cannot do it.  God knows we have met with criticism enough in the distance that we have gone.  Deputy Bennett went to great trouble about a penny.  There was a penny, he said, lost under the scheme, but he was not able to tell us <Col N="1378" /> where it went.  He said they paid 2d. of a levy and 4d. bounty, and then said &ldquo;they only get a penny of the 2d. back.&rdquo;  He started off like Deputy Cosgrave who on the last day that we discussed this said that we would be inclined to export more than half the butter.  When Deputy Cosgrave was explaining it he put two-thirds of the butter in front of Deputy O'Sullivan and one-third in front of Deputy Gorey, and he gradually transferred all the butter in front of Deputy Gorey to Deputy O'Sullivan until he had exported it all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bennett did the same to-day.  He said the inducement would be to export all the butter, and if we did of course the bounty would go down from 4d. to 2d.  But the whole scheme is that the home consumer will buy butter at the price at which butter is exported, plus the bounty so that we will not export it all.  The people at home will buy butter, and the whole scheme of the Bill is that the home consumer will have to buy butter at the price of the exported butter plus the bounty and he will buy.  But suppose the home consumer does not and suppose that the creameries export the whole lot, will they not get back their twopence anyway?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. I do not think I suggested that a penny would be lost.  I suggested that a penny of the 4d. would be lost; that they will get a penny benefit instead of 2d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They will get it all back anyway.  That brings me to another point.  We were told by Deputy Davin and Deputy Shaw that under this scheme we were giving butter cheaper to John Bull than he should get it.  I must say that I feel in a very humiliating position to be put in the dock in defence of John Bull against Deputy Shaw and Deputy Davin.  However, I suppose that cannot be helped.  All I can say is that we are not going to give butter to John Bull any cheaper than New Zealand is giving it to him or Australia or any of the other people <Col N="1379" /> that are selling butter at world prices. We are going to give it to him at the very same price.</P>
      <P>What we are doing really in the Bill is this&mdash;Deputy Bennett drew attention to this in the course of his speech&mdash;we are going to make the tariff effective, a thing that the farmers could have done for themselves.  In this Bill we are doing it for them.  We are making the tariff effective, a thing they did not do themselves but which they could have done if they had been properly organised.  That brings me to another point.  We were reminded that no matter what we do here we cannot raise the price of anything on the foreign market.  Now we see that, but we also see another thing.  We have demonstrated a thing that the ex-Minister for Agriculture told us, over and over again, could not be done.  He said that you cannot raise the price of any commodity, within the country, where you have a surplus for export. We have demonstrated that, in this country, you can do it, and that is what we are doing.  We are raising the price of an article of which we have a surplus for export within the country by a tariff.  We are showing that we can do that, at any rate, but we cannot, we admit &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Shaw told us the same old tale, that over in England he had seen hung up in the shops notices &ldquo;No Irish produce sold here.&rdquo; Three or four years ago, he told us that he saw that in 1920, but he was the only one here who had seen it, and he was the first man to refer to it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one other point with regard to financing the Bill, which was raised by Deputy Davin.  We do intend to put into the Central Fund whatever may accrue from the tariff, <Col N="1380" /> but we hope, on the other hand, to make that nil under this Bill, that there will be no proceeds from the tariff.  There probably will, however, during the first month of the working of the Bill, and whatever it may be it will go into the pool.  It is not necessary to take any notice of that under this Bill.  A Supplementary Estimate will have to be introduced at some period, because the pool will be overdrawn, and very much overdrawn, at certain periods of the year.  In fact, by the time we reach September, the pool might possibly be overdrawn to the extent of £50,000 or £100,000, so that it will be necessary to bring in a Supplementary Estimate to make provision for the paying out of bounties on exported butter, and when that Supplementary Estimate is introduced, the Minister for Finance will have power to pay money into the pool if he wishes.  I have no doubt whatever that, if times were to improve as much as was suggested by Deputy Davin, and we could afford to put money into this pool instead of putting the whole thing on to the consumer, we would certainly do so, and if, as Deputy Shaw said, we succeeded in keeping the Land Annuities, of which, he said, we have promised a certain amount to agriculture, it would be, perhaps, one of the best methods in which agriculture could be helped.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister again to say if the position he puts before us is this: that the consumption of creamery butter is <Col N="1381" /> 320,000 cwts. in this country, and that, approximately, a small amount, say 30,000 cwts., is exported, and that the rest of the butter is consumed in the country by the farmers who make it. The last figures we have for farmers' butter are that in 1929, 835,000 cwts. were produced, of which 167,000 cwts. went as factory butter, about 37,000 cwts. being eaten in the country, leaving 657,000 cwts of farmers' butter as the amount consumed in the country. Does the Minister say that the whole <Col N="1382" /> of that is consumed by the farmers who make it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I said that between 40,000 and 60,000 cwts. were sold.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the section is put, I would like to draw the attention of the President to a statement which he made last Friday night in concluding the debate on the Second Stage and when arguing for the deletion of Article 17 from the Constitution.  I am quoting from the Official Report of the 29th April, column 1102, at the foot of the page:</P>
      <P>I was told&mdash;perhaps this is only second-hand and I cannot vouch for it&mdash;that Deputies on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches were so disgusted with the whole performance that they used to walk into the room and say &ldquo;Sign that for me.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, sir, it is quite clear that that statement with all its implications was not made by the President on his own authority.  He gave it, in his own words, as second-hand.  I should like also to make the point that the statement might be regarded as a joke, but for the context and the atmosphere in which it was made. It was made when the President was arguing that a certain procedure was so humiliating that nobody should subject himself to it.  I want to suggest that that statement clearly implies an accusation against certain <Col N="1385" /> members of the House that they got somebody else to sign their names to the Oath required by Article 17 of the Constitution.  They can answer for themselves, but it seems to me, and it has been suggested to me by many people, that there is in that statement of the President, as conveyed to the House from another source, the clear implication that the officer who was empowered to administer the Oath that the officer who did administer the Oath, actually connived at that and did more &mdash;that he signed the document himself for those Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies.  That meaning appears to me sir, quite plain and the accusation is made against a person who is of necessity dumb and cannot defend himself.</P>
    <P>I was not myself concerned because, as you are aware, the Ceann Comhairle has no responsibility for the administration of the Oath to Deputies.  It is done by an officer appointed by the Governor-General, but I have no hesitation in saying that the author of that statement, the person who made that statement to the President, intended to deceive him or else made the statement with a reckless disregard for the truth. There is no truth in it.  It is to be noted that the President cannot vouch for it, but when the Leader of this House, the President of the Executive Council, speaking from his place in the House gives publicity&mdash; that is what happened&mdash;to a statement of that kind, the statement assumes a very considerable importance indeed.  A great many people have attached importance to it, and the words get a meaning owing to the position of the member of the House who uttered them.  I should like, sir, to invite the President to join with me in saying, now that the atmosphere which we had on Friday night has completely gone and we are much calmer, that it is beyond the bounds of possibility that the particular officer in question or any other officer signed for a Deputy in that particular way, in other words, actively assisted in a fraud upon the Constitution and upon the revenue.  I should like the President now to withdraw the <Col N="1386" /> authority of his name and his office from that particular statement.</P>

I do not mind how members on the opposite side reconcile their consciences with the description of removing the Testament and calling the attention of the Chief Clerk to the fact that they were merely recording in the book.  That reminds me of certain people down the country who believe that they never take an oath in ordinary evidence if they put their thumbs between their lips and the Testament and that they are free to swear what they like.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should refer to the nonsense that has been spoken by the last Deputy.  The attitude of Fianna Fáil Deputies is very different from that of the person who pretended he was taking an oath, who went through the formality of taking the oath, and who interposed his thumb between his lips and the Testament when taking it.  There is no analogy between the attitude of Fianna Fáil in regard to the signing of that document and the attitude of a person who gives his evidence in the way described by Deputy Hennessy.</P>

      <P>He can see the difference between the moon and green cheese.  There is all the difference in the world between the two cases.  With regard to the statement of Deputy Hayes, I am not sorry that he brought this matter up because I want to say that I am not suggesting or did not suggest that the officer in charge was in any way doing other than he was instructed to do.  I am perfectly certain that whatever the officer did or whatever duty was assigned to him, he did that interpreting it, as possibly he was entitled, in the least obnoxious way to the people who had to undergo the test.  I would say furthermore that Deputies on the opposite benches, Deputy Cosgrave for instance, although he boasted that he had made us take two oaths and regarded it as one of the greatest accomplishments of his life, in practice he did not act up to that, that he was better in fact than he said, that he knew&mdash; I suggest that he must have known on account of our public statements &mdash;exactly what we were doing and he allowed that particular interpretation of complying with Article 17 to be taken.  First of all I accept the statement of Deputy Hayes that so far as he knew&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not saying that the thing is beyond the bounds of possibility, as he wishes me to concur in saying.  I am not talking about things beyond the bounds of possibility, because we know what is possible. But I do not suggest that the officer in charge did anything except interpret as liberally as he could the instructions that were given to him; and I take it that his instructions were to see that a certain book was signed.  This is the way in which I myself regarded it having gone through the performance after the statements I made publicly.  I said to myself &ldquo;The instruction that has <Col N="1388" /> been given to the officer is to see that the signatures are put in a certain place.&rdquo;  And that was the beginning and the end of his responsibility.</P>
      <P>I confessed here on the last day that if I were expressly given, without any precedent having been established in the matter, charge of the enforcing for the first time of that Constitution, I would have taken out of these Articles the meaning that I took out of them when I opposed them outside, at a time when I was not aware of my own knowledge of what actually was done. I cannot concur in saying that it is outside the range of possibility.  I do believe that the instructions probably given to the officer in charge were that a certain thing should be signed, and that, knowing how obnoxious the whole proceeding was, he interpreted it liberally in that sense, and that he did his duty.  I want that to be clear.</P>
      <P>As regards the statement I made that members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party actually said that, I was prepared to believe it, and I believed it at the time.  I did not ask who the officers were or anything else, but I was prepared to believe that, when this Dáil first met here, there were so many members on the opposite benches who so detested the doing of that thing that they would have been quite capable of saying: &ldquo;Sign that for me.&rdquo;  I do not say that it was actually done at all.  I do not know if I actually said in my statement that it was actually done.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, before Deputy Wolfe intervenes, there is a particular question at issue here <Col N="1389" /> which has been somewhat widened by the intervention of my friend Dr. Hennessy.  The narrow question is whether particular words used by the President on second-hand information did, in fact, apart from his intention, convey an imputation upon a particular officer of State.  The question as to how members of the Fianna Fáil Party took the Oath is another question. I did not go into that.  But I feel that that imputation should be withdrawn.  And I suggest to you, sir&mdash;I know that it is not a question of order&mdash;that the statement has not been withdrawn by what the President has said, namely, that the officer carried out his duty.</P>
      <P>What I want to put is this: That the words used by the President in the context and in the atmosphere in which he used them amounted not only to the charge that members of the House said to the officer in question: &ldquo;Sign that for me,&rdquo; but that the officer signed for them and then witnessed that false and fraudulent signature of his own. That is what he had to do if he did the first thing.  I should like the President to make it clear that that imputation is, in his judgment, wholly unfounded, because I am certain that there could not be any truth in it.  The clear imputation is there that the officer in question perpetrated a particular fraud.  I should like the President to agree with me that that is untrue and that the officer did not do any such thing.</P>

      <P>This question, in my opinion, is much more important than you would judge from what Deputy Hayes has said, from what the President has said, from what Deputy Hennessy has said, and from what Deputy Cosgrave has said.  It has a far more important aspect than that, because, admittedly and unquestionably, the President has told us that, in effect, £7,100 of public money has been embezzled. I am not raising any question for the moment as to whether the <Col N="1392" /> Oath was properly taken or improperly taken.  But I am accepting the President's statement that he and seventy others returned as members of Dáil Eireann, and now acting as such, have not yet taken the Oath prescribed by Article 4 of the Treaty and Article 17 of the Constitution.  I want to go further and say that the President has made another charge against these 71 members in which he himself is included. He has suggested to the House that these 71 members have obtained from the Treasury of this country, which is badly in need of money, a repayment of £7,100 which has been got by them on the false pretence that they had taken that Oath. They have one and all produced certificates stating that they have taken the Oath.  If what the President has told us is true, they have obtained by means of false pretences a repayment of £7,100.  I also ask the President this in all honesty and conscience&mdash; there may be some difficulty in sending the papers to the Attorney-General, because I am afraid that he himself is involved, from what the President has told us of this stupendous fraud committed upon the revenue of the country&mdash;will he send the papers at all events to an Attorney-General ad hoc, so that this series of 71 frauds committed by this Government may be reversed?  If he will do that, he will get back for the Treasury of the country a very much-needed sum of £7,100 wrongfully obtained by 71 people, each of whom has obtained £100 by false pretences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 2, I know it is useless appealing to the Dáil to reject this Article, but one must point out the situation to them.  This section in effect is a section to deprive the Treaty of the force of law.  The purpose of it is fundamentally to get rid of the Oath.  The President yesterday said his action was not breaking the Treaty.  I do not think he meant that to be taken very seriously.  It was possibly said as the result of the pact with Labour, whereby he would put up some bogus case to enable them to save their faces.  I call attention to the type of argument put up by the President.  He explains that this controversy and this discussion we have <Col N="1398" /> flow through Articles I an II of the Treaty; and when one asks how is it that Article IV lays down that the Oath is to be taken, he explains that Article IV was put into the Treaty solely because there was a variation in the form of the Oath from the form of the Oath that was taken in Canada.  He considers that that is a good argument to put up, for instance, in any discussion with the British Government.  When the British Government say: &ldquo;Here is an Article referring definitely to one positive thing&rdquo; he says &ldquo;yes, but that is not binding, because it was only consequential upon a certain situation that existed under Articles I and II,&rdquo; and that it had been put down specifically for the reason that there was a variation in the Oath as compared with Canada.  When we go back reminiscing up to the time the Treaty was signed I may mention that among the people who know me I am regarded as having a memory that is notoriously exact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is according to yourself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want no interruptions from the Deputy.  Anybody who knows me knows when I refer back to the situation at the time of the Treaty that I am giving the facts.  But I do not need to go back further than to the President's statement on Friday night last.  I refer to column 1091 of the Official Report where the President said: &ldquo;On December 3rd, 1921, when the Irish delegates who were sent to London came back to report and when they brought the latest British proposals to us, I remember there were three or four Articles before they came to the Oath.  Then there was the Oath.  It was not this form of Oath at all; it was the direct form of Oath that you have in Canada and Australia.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the President says that Article IV only exists in the Treaty because there is a variation in the form of the Oath.  On that last week-end that I remember so well the British Government presented us with what was called a final draft.  That final draft is almost identical with the Treaty as we have it. It contained an article setting forth <Col N="1399" /> the form of the Oath and that Oath was identical with the Oath in Canada. Imagine now the President, if you can imagine him, going over to negotiate with the British.  The British will say &ldquo;You are breaking the Treaty&rdquo; and he says &ldquo;I am not&rdquo; and they say &ldquo;Here is Article IV setting down most specifically the Oath to be taken&rdquo;; and he says &ldquo;yes, but it is not mandatory.&rdquo; And they ask him to explain that and he says &ldquo;The Oath is in Article II, though it is not mentioned there and consequently it is not in Article IV.&rdquo; He will say that the Oath was put in there because we were taking a different form of Oath from the Oath taken in Canada.  Now the British can turn about and bring out that document; they know that that document was the real document over which the fighting arose in the negotiations; that document contained an Oath identical with the Oath to be taken by Canada.  The British put up the ultimatum that we must decide without any further hugger-mugger.  The Plenipotentiaries brought it to Dublin.  Then this variation in the Oath was made to meet President de Valera's wishes.  The Plenipotentiaries went back to London, making the variation in Article IV of the Treaty.  The President's argument that Article IV would not need to be in there at all is completely negatived by the fact that the real big discussion on the Treaty was on Article IV during the time that Article IV which the British insisted on being inserted, was identical with the Oath in Canada. That just shows the appalling situation this country is liable to be put in.  It is not as if the President has forgotten these circumstances.  He assures us that the British would not have bothered about this because they got all they wanted in Article II and we would still have to take the Oath.  He said they never would put it in because they had agreed to a variation.  The British know that is not true and President de Valera if he were in London negotiating with them would have to admit it is not true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is remarkable if the Oath was never put in because there was a variation; it was put in, according to the President, with no variation whatever.  They were breaking on exactly that point.  Finally, the British yielded to the extent of permitting a variation in Article IV. They did not say, prior to that, that the Oath was contained in Article II, and was it not in the final discussion with President de Valera that Article IV was imported into the Treaty?  It merely changed it, and the President's argument of yesterday might be all right here to save the faces of the Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope they do not. As far as this is a matter that has to be discussed with England, it will mean putting up such bogus arguments that they can be proved false.  It is not a matter of construing anything; it is merely a matter of known fact. With regard to the President's argument about the weaker nation, he accused me of attempting to misrepresent him.  He said: &ldquo;We are entitled, being the weaker nation upon whom this Treaty was imposed, to get the last letter out of our legal rights and we propose to get the very last letter.&rdquo;  Unfortunately, the Attorney-General tended to confuse this matter.  When you talk about legal rights, if you take a thing to a municipal court they will construe legal right and legal power in terms solely of municipal law.  The arbitrament of this international document is not a matter for a domestic court and should not be, as the President said. It should, if it goes to any court, be a matter for an international court, and the international court would necessarily completely disregard municipal law.  They would consider the international contract, and would decide what the law was in terms of international law in that international court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the President says we must get the last letter out of our legal <Col N="1401" /> rights, he was referring in terms of our municipal law.  Legally here we can break any treaty we like.  In discussing this matter, the word &ldquo;legal&rdquo; should apply to international law and not to domestic law.  The President implied clearly that when some other country makes a contract with us, when a strong country makes a contract with a weak country, the whole thing must be weighted on the side of the weaker country.  I declared that a damnable doctrine for the reason that the making of treaties between a strong country and a weak country was always a great gain to the weak country.  The strong country has the means of enforcing its will on the weak, but it yields to a sense of honour and to its desire to appear well in the eyes of its neighbours. These things are extremely important and absolutely vital to small countries.</P>
    <P>If it is to be established that when a small country makes a treaty with a big country, the small country can say afterwards that it is going to interpret that treaty&mdash;in the words of our Attorney-General&mdash;in the Irish sense and not in the English sense, instead of in the sense of the Treaty and its intentions, then that will mean that every big country, when there is a matter to be negotiated with a small country, will have only one means of settling it, and will be justified in using only that means and that will be force.  If that doctrine were to be promulgated, and if we were to adopt that method any time we make a treaty with some stronger power, then it would mean putting this country into a position that it would invite every country stronger than it is to assert its will by power, force of arms, rather than by friendly negotiation. It was for that reason that I called that a damnable doctrine.</P>
    <P>As regards the Treaty, on this side it has been assumed that everybody is agreed the Treaty ought not to be broken.  There was one good reason why we should have protested against the British insisting on the Oath being taken.  The British always said of us that we were unfit for self-government. <Col N="1402" /> Here was a situation in which we made an agreement with them, and it was contingent upon the Irish people accepting that arrangement that there was to be an election. The insertion of the Oath implied that when the Irish people had agreed that a certain form of Government should prevail here, that Government which is so necessary in order that our social life may be ordered and that we may fulfil our destiny, it was necessary to see that the men called upon to legislate would give the minimum loyalty that the law of all time insists from its citizens.  There was a question as to whether our people would give that.  That was an occasion when we might have very readily said to the British that it was an insult to have that Oath there.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, I think it was Deputy Dillon who said a most outrageous thing.  He said that when the sovereign Irish people had decided upon certain forms he, in his idiosyncratic manner, was going to refuse honour to the flag symbol of the State and to refuse honour to the National Anthem.  I would have thought that that would be a thing that we all would have condemned.  At a time when we have a State functioning and existing for the purpose of fulfilling the necessary condition of promoting the social order, and at a time when certain forms connected with that State demand our loyalty and our service, a Bill is brought forward which admits that not merely is that loyalty not to be demanded from the ordinary citizen, but that it is not even to be demanded from the people who come here to legislate.  In other words, people may come to legislate, make laws, and at the same time these very legislators must be free to plot against the State.  That is what we are actually doing.  It is for that reason that I feel some of us are prevented from saying what we think of the statement made yesterday by Deputy Dillon.</P>
    <P>I want to make my own position clear.  I do not share in this general agreement that the Oath is actually a statement of existing fact.  This seems to me to be a perfectly hypocritical <Col N="1403" /> proposal.  We leave the existing State there and we say it will be all right and no one will have a right to complain so long as we keep our mouths shut about what the existing conditions are.  This clause aims at completely eliminating the Treaty.  It really aims at refusing to accept any of the obligations we accepted by the Treaty.  We did accept obligations.  This proposal is disgraceful to national honour. National honour and national interests are completely united, completely equal, because we have only the appeal to honour in the world and not the appeal to force.</P>

      <P>May I ask if the President has anything to say regarding the motion? As far as I remember he did not refer to it in his speech on Friday.  My motion asks that the Executive Council should find work or maintenance to meet the immediate needs of the unemployed.  As far as I can remember the President, in the course of his speech on Friday, made no reference whatever to the question of maintenance which is in the motion. Am I to understand that the President is leaving that to some other member of the Executive Council to deal with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think our attitude has been explained.  Our hope is that almost forthwith&mdash;certainly in a very short time&mdash;we will be able to get work going, and I do not want to see any incentives not to get going. I want to see first of all that maintenance will be provided if we fail to get the work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may say so, I understood on Wednesday last from the President and from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the definite statement was made in the House that the Executive Council were accepting my motion.  My motion reads:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that steps should be taken forthwith by the Executive Council to provide work or maintenance to meet the immediate needs of the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest there is very little use in the President saying that he is accepting the motion unless he can state to the House what steps he proposes to take to provide maintenance for the <Col N="1410" /> unemployed, pending the provision of work for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy Morrissey is able to express himself in words.  The terms of the motion, I take it, express what he meant: that steps would be taken, and steps are being taken.</P>

If he has any point to put, either expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the statements which have been made from the Government Benches, is he not entitled to put that when replying, but I suggest he is not entitled on this stage to cross-examine any person? There is nobody in the dock except Deputy Morrissey himself.</P>

      <P>I want to ask a question, sir, with your permission.  I want to ask the President whether, in view of the fact that he has made no reference whatever to that portion of my motion which asks for maintenance pending the provision of work for the unemployed, <Col N="1411" /> we are to take it that any other member of the Ministry is going to deal with that part of the motion?  I think I am entitled to put that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion that Deputy Morrissey put down was, I stated, accepted by the Ministry and it is quite clear.  I do not need to refer to the terms of it.  The meaning of it is quite clear, that steps should be taken to provide (a) or (b).  Now we are going to provide (a)&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On Friday last, when speaking on the motion now before the House, I made a statement which Deputy Mulcahy said was either inaccurate or incorrect.  The words he used were to the effect that I was misquoting for the purpose of misrepresenting. I hope now that, when I quote verbatim from the Dáil official debates, Deputy Mulcahy will have the decency to withdraw the suggestion he made that I was misquoting for the purpose of misrepresenting.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy likes I will read my whole speech, his interjections and my answers.  Speaking on Friday last I said: &ldquo;Deputy McGilligan, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, set us a headline in every debate on this matter of unemployment, when he said that people would have to starve and that it was not the duty of the Government to intervene.&rdquo;  Deputy Mulcahy then <Col N="1412" /> said: &ldquo;Will you quote the Deputy?&rdquo; The quotations that I want to give are as follows.  They are from Volume IX of the Official Debates, column 551. Deputy McGilligan, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce, is there reported to have said:</P>
      <P>The Government or this Dáil should not be held responsible for the provision of work in the country. It is not its business.</P>
      <P>Later in the same column he said:</P>
      <P>To state broadly and definitely that this Dáil ought to be able to provide work for the country is giving this Dáil functions which it has no right to take upon itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy read what is in between the two quotations he has given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will read the whole lot if the Deputy likes.  Following the first quotation I have given, Deputy Morrissey intervened in the debate and asked: &ldquo;Does the Minister say it is not the business of this Dáil to see that people do not die of hunger in the country?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>After that interjection by Deputy Morrissey, Deputy McGilligan said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1413" /> That is a totally different thing. The Government has, in so far as the Unemployment Insurance Act is concerned, seen that hunger will be stopped.  I do not say it goes far enough.  They have started certain relief schemes to keep off hunger from other people in the country.  To state broadly and definitely that this Dáil ought to be able to provide work for the country is giving this Dáil functions which it has no right to take upon itself.</P>
    <P>I can give further quotations if the Deputy wishes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated on the last occasion that the difference between this Party and the Opposition was that we took the responsibility upon our shoulders of providing work for people who are able and willing to work, and that the previous Government stated that that was not one of its functions.  Now, in column 562, Deputy Johnson, who was in the House then, intervened in the course of Deputy McGilligan's speech and said, &ldquo;But if they die this year?&rdquo; To that Deputy McGilligan replied, &ldquo;There are certain limited funds at our disposal.  People may have to die in this country and may have to die through starvation.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>And Deputy McGilligan said, &ldquo;It might solve the problem.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must get the rest of that quotation read&mdash;&ldquo;It might solve the problem, but not in the way that I desire, or the Deputy desires.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat that the common understanding of what was in Deputy McGilligan's mind then was to the effect that it was not the function of the State to provide work for men who were unemployed, but willing to work, and unable to find work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not; it is in clear language.  Deputy McGilligan stated: &ldquo;To state broadly and definitely that this Dáil ought to be able to provide work for the country, is giving this Dáil functions which it has no right to take upon itself.&rdquo;  Previous to that, he says: &ldquo;That is actually taking place, and there will be some approach to it, but the Government, or this Dáil, should not be held responsible for the provision of work in the country.  It is not its business.&rdquo;  That is clear and distinct and explicit and not implicit.  Again, the Deputy stated that people might have to die of starvation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I will go on further, and if the Deputy can put any other construction on it, he can do so. &ldquo;It might solve the problem, but not in the way that I desire, or that the Deputy desires.  To say that would solve the problem is no answer, is not facing the fact that there are limited resources in this country.  It is better to husband these than to spend any money you have and see that people are fed this year, even though they go hungry next year.  That is not good policy.&rdquo;  We had the policy of the Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>And my only purpose here to-day was to show Deputy Mulcahy that these words were on record. His insinuations were that they were not on record, and that they were not correct.  I hope he is now satisfied that they are on record.  Does Deputy McGilligan want to make out that it was not part of the policy of the last Government to take that attitude?  I would like him to explain why they allowed the cancer of unemployment to grow up, as it has grown up, and why they permitted people to die of starvation.</P>

Deputy McGilligan will inform Deputy Mulcahy that the publication of the figures of registered unemployed was discontinued by him, because of the fact that they were misleading, and calculations based on them were likely to be deceptive.</P>

      <P>I am quite prepared to publish the reports that come into me from the labour exchanges explaining the increase in registration of the Dublin branches.  These reports state that the increase in registration arose out of the fact that there will be a considerable amount of work of a certain class during the Eucharistic Congress period, and we are endeavouring to secure that employers will recruit their labour through the exchanges.  To enable us to supply their needs we have asked them to keep registered the class of people they require.  The principal class is waiters, waitresses, and hotel workers.  A number of people not ordinarily seeking employment <Col N="1419" /> have come on the register so as to be available for that particular class of work for that period.  That explains to a great extent the increase.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to intervene in the Debate were it not for a statement made by the President in the course of his speech last Friday and because a number of people have spoken about it since. They have even expressed grave uneasiness as to the purport of that particular statement, taken in conjunction with the statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce at Longford to the effect that &ldquo;It is proposed to ask the Dáil for powers to control the number of foreign companies which might operate in particular industries.&rdquo; This is what I want to emphasise: &ldquo;The Government was determined that our industrial efficiency would be made good and he would not hesitate if they found themselves driven into that position to mobilise the nation's resources in its own hands to achieve its ends.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I can understand that that might appeal to Deputy Davin, but I can assure him it has caused, as I said, a great deal of uneasiness among the ordinary people of this country, taken in conjunction with the statement of the President on the last occasion, namely the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that under the present system we cannot do the full work we would like to do but we are going to try.  I am going to say this, that if I try within the system as it stands and fail then I will try to go outside <Col N="1420" /> the system and I will go to the country and ask them to support me to go outside the system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I see that is accepted by the combined Parties that now sit on the other side of the House.  I will take it for granted that the President was quite correct when he said that on these matters the ideals of the Fianna Fáil Party were identical with those of the Labour Party, and as we know already their ideals in other matters, political matters, are identical.  The dividing line between them, I suggest, as the country has been inclined to believe for a long time, has practically vanished. However that is not what I would have wished to deal with were it not for the extraordinary way in which Deputy Davin occasionally breaks the self-imposed vow of silence that has been upon him for some time.  I am not quite prepared to accept the view put forward in this City by a very well-known public man that no statement of such import has been made in recent years outside Soviet Russia.  I do not want to put that interpretation on the President's words.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the speeches we have listened to here on this motion I fear there is ground for this uneasiness.  For instance, I think the only contribution made by the Fianna Fáil Benches on Friday week was a prolonged attack on the biggest industry we have in this country. The attitude adopted in this House by some members practically comes to this, that any person who puts <Col N="1421" /> his capital into industry in this country becomes immediately unpatriotic, an oppressor of the poor and of the labouring people of the country. That is the attitude that has again and again been taken up in this House.  I suggest there are grave grounds for the uneasiness expressed to me, when the President says if the present system fails, he is prepared to go beyond it and when many people in this country believe that his policy in many respects is calculated to bring about the failure of the present system.</P>
      <P>I rose merely as I say because I think a statement of that kind coming from the head of the State, coupled with the general tone of the speeches made here confirms the idea that he is more anxious to tax or quite as anxious to tax what he calls luxury as to prevent starvation.  In fact I have no doubt, again, that if he were to advance to this particular length he would receive the applause of Deputy Davin, but he does seem to be perilously near preaching a class war in some of the speeches he has recently made.  That has undoubtedly come forth from the speeches made in this House.  I think the statement made is one that should not have been made by a man in his position. I should like to know what the other system is into which he intends to go when he leaves the present system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one very important point that I think has been overlooked by the members of the Opposition.  That point I would put very briefly.  It is this that not alone were the present Opposition, when they were the Government, unable to find employment for 80,000 unemployed, but they were also unable to find employment for a quarter of a million able-bodied emigrants. If these people who were compelled to leave this country through want and starvation had remained in this country there would have been more to die of starvation in the country than were mentioned by the late Minister for Industry and Commerce. Furthermore now that emigration has <Col N="1422" /> stopped to the United States, the present Government is faced with the situation of providing work for those people who might have emigrated if conditions obtained such as obtained during the past ten years.  Deputy Mulcahy says that there is more unemployment in Dublin than has existed for the past four years.</P>
      <P>Those people whose outlet is dammed to the United States are coming along now for employment in this country.  Formerly it was an easy way out for the last Government to have these people emigrate from the country.  And not alone could they not find work for these people, but there remained behind them 80,000 unemployed men in a state of starvation, and the late Government could not find employment for them.  How then can they expect that this Government, which has been only a few weeks in power, could find work for these 80,000 unemployed and for those boys and girls who are growing up and who are prepared to take work if work could be provided for them?</P>

      <P>In my opinion, Deputy Morrissey deserves the thanks of every unemployed man and woman in the country for the presistent sympathy that he has shown towards the class he represents in this House. Deputy Tadhg Murphy, another Labour Deputy, has stated in his speech in this House that if there was one mandate more than another that the President of the Executive Council got, it was a mandate for the relief of unemployment.  The President is in a very friendly atmosphere in this House.  The whole sympathy of this House is with him in any plan he may bring forward for the relief of unemployment.  But the Minister for Industry and Commerce made a rather strange speech in this House when he said that the first step towards the relief of unemployment must be the abolition of the Oath.  I cannot follow that line of argument.</P>

But remarks like those of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he regards the removal of the Oath as the first step towards the relief of unemployment create unrest, and from unrest we have unemployment.  Remember that the firm of Jacob, the biscuit manufacturers, got scared after the introduction of legislation for the removal of the Oath&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think the position is bad at all if we face up to it. It is not as bad as the position the late Government faced in 1923.  They had to face up to a position in which they had to meet a demand for £30,000,000 as the outcome of the civil war.  Anyway, they set to work, black and all as the position was, and we know that they tackled the Shannon Scheme and the Carlow Sugar Factory, and they started work on roads and they subsidised house building.  Why should not practical schemes such as these be set going by the present Government?  As I have already said, they will have our <Col N="1426" /> sympathy.  We will not cut across you.  We will help you in every way and assist you in any scheme you put forward for the relief of unemployment. I think that they should do that and forget other matters that have been taking up the attention of this House for the last week or more and for which as Deputy Murphy said&mdash;and I thoroughly agree with him&mdash;there was no mandate for the present Government at the last election.  There was a mandate to try and come to the immediate relief of people out of work.  I appeal to them to forget things that do not matter, for the thing that does matter at the moment is to try and find employment for the workless.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to see a good old republican like Deputy O'Connor now professing his faith rather in the sale of biscuits than in the republic for Ireland.  It is a great change from the old times when he went out to fight for a republic.

I submit that a person with a history like Deputy O'Connor should be the last person in the Dáil to deal with such a question the way he has dealt with it.  If that attitude of mind came from businessmen who never in their lives have been republicans, we might deal with it in a different way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps you will allow me to finish my sentence.  Coming from a republican like Deputy O'Connor, his argument is simply estopped. I need not pursue that line because nobody pays any attention to him.  I <Col N="1427" /> should like to deal with some remarks of Deputy O'Sullivan who hinted, as he hinted all through the election&mdash;I happened to hear some of his speeches&mdash; at the sinister revolutions which would be brought about by President de Valera.  At that time, he was saying that if we got into power we would stand for some dangerous revolution in the country.  He was followed up by various people connected with the former landed aristocracy in this country. I read a circular issued by these people during the election to frighten the innocent and uninformed into voting for Cumann na nGaedheal on the grounds of these sinister suggestions now being repeated by Deputy O'Sullivan. We, on these benches, do stand for any necessary changes in the systems as they at present exist.  If Deputy O'Sullivan wants our authority for requiring these changes, we need not go further than the Encyclical of Pope Pius XI issued last year, which is in fact one of the most revolutionary documents produced within our generation. Pope Leo XIII spoke of the necessity of changing the conditions of the working classes, changing the system, and doing it quickly, or, he pointed out, great evils would come upon the people.  The present Pope has followed that up and pointed out in detail where the system should be changed.  I suggest to Deputy O'Sullivan that both the Labour Party and ourselves will find common ground and a common platform in interpreting that Encyclical to the great benefit of the working people and the removal of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say something about speculative building.  I happen to have had a little experience indirectly rather than directly of speculative building during the last five or six years.  The experience of those I was in touch with was that speculative building for the class that supplied that market during the last seven years has decreased so rapidly that houses were difficult to sell during the last six or eight months.  Prudent speculative builders feel that that market is almost exhausted.  There is a market for houses for people of more <Col N="1428" /> limited means, which is a different market from that supplied up to this. The very statement of Deputy O'Connor, that the last seven years have been very good years for the speculative builder, points to the fact that the period is coming to an end, that the market is gradually getting glutted, and that builders now will have to turn to building of a different type. Speculative builders up to this have not accustomed themselves to building for people of more limited means. How far they may be able to do that will depend upon the local authorities and their applying in their own districts the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  Under that Act there may be a future for them.  These are matters which have purely to do with what you might call the technical details of the various building schemes, and have nothing to do with the condition of unrest in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell the Deputy that speculative builders built houses for sale, and usually the houses they built were sold to people of the middle classes who were fairly well-to-do.  If they built working-class houses the workingmen could not buy them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the speculative builder built houses for sale.  When, gradually, he finds the houses will not sell, if he is wise he will get out of the business of building for the class the Deputy mentioned, and that is what the speculative builder is doing, because that market is very nearly exhausted.  The housing of very poor will have to be <Col N="1429" /> dealt with under a national housing scheme because there is nothing in it for the speculative builder.  But between the two classes there is I think &mdash;it is merely an opinion&mdash;a class that may be supplied with houses under the Small Dwellings Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it rather difficult to speak on this subject, more especially as I am supposed to ask the Government to solve a problem which I believe it is not in their power to do.  I should like to join issue immediately with Deputy Briscoe when he says that it is the duty of a Government to find work for everybody. I am willing to make myself unpopular by taking the very opposite view to that held by Deputy Briscoe, because experience teaches me that the more a Government try to solve the problem of unemployment the more unemployment they create.  In order to be fair to the Government, if I ask them to solve the unemployment problem, it would be only right and proper that all the resources of the country should be placed at their disposal.  To carry the suggestion made by several Deputies to its logical conclusion would mean that the Government, to solve the question <Col N="1430" /> of unemployment, would necessarily have to take over Guinness's Brewery, Jacob's Factory, every business in the City of Dublin and in every town and village in the Free State, all the farms in the country, put them all together and establish a situation something akin to that existing at present in Soviet Russia.  I wonder would Deputy Davin be in favour of that policy or would the working classes have the same conditions of labour under that régime which they now enjoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is about time that we should come down to a little common sense in this country and recognise our limitations, as I have said before in this Dáil; recognise that this is a poor country, and that if we want to solve the unemployment problem somebody must make sacrifices.  You cannot have the present state of affairs existing and hope to solve the problem at one and the same time. You cannot have what, in many cases, amounts to a war-time standard of living on a pre-war revenue.  It is about time that we recognised that fact.  Nothing touches the human sympathies as much as to meet a man who has been walking the streets idle for five or six months and to have to say that the provision of work for such a man is as far off to-day as ever it was.  It is hard also to try to convince such people that we are doing our duty to them by coming to this Dáil and simply stating it is the work of a Government to deal with unemployment.  I treated the late Government with sympathy on this matter and I am going to treat the present Government in the same way.  I am not going to follow the example of many Deputies by referring to the promises made at the general election.  That is ancient history; that will not solve the unemployment problem.  I would be much happier if I do all I possibly can to assist the Government in the solution of this very vexed question.  In all candour, I would say to the President, as regards the permanent solution of the question, that he should take his time and not be hustled in preparing his schemes, so as to ensure that when <Col N="1431" /> these schemes are put into operation they will be of a productive nature. That is, of course, as far as the permanent solution is concerned.</P>
    <P>Coming to the motion before the House in the name of Deputy Morrissey, it asks the Government to do something for the immediate needs of the unemployed.  I would ask the Government to do something in this matter; to make a grant that would provide immediate employment for those unemployed.  I am not going to make a detailed statement as to the amount of unemployment prevailing in my constituency.  It is sufficient to say that it is much on a par with that in every other constituency.  If the President can do something in the near future to provide employment for those at present unemployed, he will be conferring a benefit on a very big section of the people.  I repeat, however, as far as a permanent solution of this problem is concerned, it cannot be solved by any Government.  It can only be solved by the co-operation of all classes, employers and employees. There is no use in making references of a nature which will tend to bring the name of any employer into disrespect. People should be careful about their references to those who are giving employment.  I was brought up in a school that had as its headline, &ldquo;A fair day's work for a fair day's pay and to show respect to those placed over us.&rdquo;  That is the spirit I should like to see prevailing to-day.  I think it was Deputy Anthony who stated that the solution of this question was not the work of any particular Party.  I should say it is the work of all Parties, backed up by the whole of the people. If that can be brought about I have no doubt that in the near future the President will be in a position to say that he has to some extent carried out the promises made during the election. Again, I repeat that I would much prefer that the President should hasten slowly in the preparation of his schemes, so as to ensure that a fair return will be given for the money expended on them.</P>

We were told at every stage of that <Col N="1433" /> Bill to stop talking and get down to the consideration of the economic measures that are necessary to deal with the present unemployment.  We have, as I have said, wasted six and a half hours on this motion, wasted it largely because Deputy Morrissey, champing like an angry pachyderm, wished to utilise it in order to hold up the business of the Government.

But the body over which this gentleman presides met and struck a rate, and so far as I know made no provision in that rate for schemes to relieve unemployment.  Again, for over almost an hour in this House, Deputy Anthony dribbled out solemn hypocrisies while attacking the Government for adopting and pressing vigorously one policy that offers a chance of reviving industry and providing employment&mdash;namely, the policy of shutting out useless and unnecessary imports. I say that this debate has been a crime against the unemployed.  It has taken up the time of the Government unnecessarily while many important legislative measures await their consideration. The President in his speech on Friday last told the House how serious the financial position was.  He told the House and the country of the heavy deficit that has been left to us by the last Government.  And I say this, that every single asset that might be realised to meet just such an emergency as we are facing now, every asset which might be realised to provide either that work or that maintenance for which Deputy Morrissey is clamouring, has long ago been squandered by the Government which used to sit on these benches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain why. Does Deputy O'Connor say we have a mandate to accept the principle contained in this motion, to adopt that principle and to give effect to it, that is, provide employment or maintenance forthwith for the unemployed? Deputy O'Connor was very vocal a moment ago about mandates.  He is now holding a gloomy silence.</P>

      <P>I am asked by the Minister a question about mandates. I got up to speak and I quoted a statement made by a Labour Deputy, Deputy T. J.

      <P>No secret bargain is going to bind our hands or keep us from doing our duty for the unemployed. Whatever measures are introduced in this House, whether they be within the existing system or without the existing system, if they are necessary in order to enable us to fulfil our mandate and keep our pledges, there will be no veto on our legislation such as was conceded by the late Government in regard to the lands of this country&mdash;conceded by the late Government to Great Britain in relation to the lands of this country.  I repeat that we are going to fulfil our pledges because we are the free, unfettered servants of the Irish people.  None of our people is going to starve because of secret commitments entered into with Great Britain.</P>
      <P>This debate, as I have said, has been a waste of time because Deputy Morrissey and others who took part in it addressed themselves solely to the Government. Deputy Coburn states that this problem cannot be solved by the Government.  The Government are going to try, but the co-operation which would be very valuable, the co-operation which I regard as being almost essential to the adoption of that principle, must be afforded, must be offered, by the Opposition.  Why did not Deputy Morrissey turn his heavy eloquence upon Deputy Cosgrave?</P>

      <P>Why did not Deputy Morrissey address his remonstrances, his admonitions, his arguments, to Deputy Cosgrave?  After the Government had accepted the principle of the motion, surely the only people who remained to be convinced in this House were the people who sit on the Opposition Benches and the people who sit on the Independent Benches. Why did not Deputy Morrissey address himself to them?  After all, they are an important factor in the situation, particularly where money is to be provided for employment.  They are the people who control the money-bags. If Deputy Morrissey can prevail upon these gentlemen to accept his motion, then the rest will be very easy.  The Government will have no difficulty whatsoever in giving effect to the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan did intervene in the debate.  I am not sure whether his speech was directed to Deputy Morrissey or to the House.  In a fit of righteous anger and indignation, Deputy O'Sullivan made the strangest statement I have ever heard.  The President made the statement that if he could not fulfil his pledges to the suffering people of this country within this system, if he could not provide them either with employment or food, then he would have to seek a solution outside the system.  Deputy O'Sullivan said that was preaching a class war. <Col N="1440" /> Feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, harbouring the harbourless&mdash; that, according to Deputy O'Sullivan, is preaching a class war.  We are going to ransom the people from the captivity of hunger, but that, according to Deputy O'Sullivan, is preaching a class war.  In fact, when the Sermon was preached on the Mount it was not preached there by the Saviour of mankind, but, according to Deputy O'Sullivan, by somebody who was preaching a class war.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coburn followed on the same lines.  He joined issue with Deputy Briscoe when he said it was the duty of the Government to find work for everybody.  &ldquo;Feed the hungry&rdquo;&mdash;that was the admonition addressed to the individual, but very much more addressed to the community, and, in particular, addressed to Governments, and, because we accept that principle of feeding the hungry, not feeding them in idleness, but providing them with a chance to earn their bread, in accordance with the Divine decree, by the sweat of their brow, that, according to Deputy O'Sullivan, is preaching a class war.  I am glad, at any rate, to be one of those who will preach that war, and, so far as I and those associated with this Party are concerned, we will preach it until unemployment, hunger and want are banished from the territory over which we have control.</P>

      <P>We are accepting responsibility and we are asking you to address at least some of your questions to the Deputies on the Opposition side.  If Deputy Morrissey secures acceptance by the Opposition of this principle, then, as I have told him, the way is going to be easy.  Deputy Morrissey has his chance, when he comes to close this debate, to make the Opposition declare themselves in this matter.  The Opposition are his friends. Whatever anyone else may think, they think that Deputy Morrissey is a mighty fine fellow.  He says that he has had the cause of the unemployed at heart.  He has had it, he said, at heart since 1924.  Let him test the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and the Independents who occupy the same benches with him, and who profess a high regard for him, to see what their friendship is worth to the cause that he says he has at heart.  See if it will carry them into the Division Lobby in support of this motion.  The Government has been frank and open in its declaration.  Let the Deputy see that the Opposition is just as frank.  The Opposition, by their votes on Wednesday last, indicated that they regard Deputy Morrissey's motion as one of primary importance.  Even though that may not have been their opinion before they came into this House, even though some of the responsible members of it may have been of a different opinion, they seem to have changed their minds after Deputy Morrissey's speech.  No doubt, the moving rhetoric of the Deputy had something to do with Deputy Cosgrave's rapid change <Col N="1442" /> of heart on Wednesday afternoon.  The Deputy who is now absent became a friend of humanity and was willing, in Deputy Morrissey's hour of need, to sharpen the Deputy's knife for him. This motion by Deputy Morrissey means increased taxation, but that fact is not going to deter us from giving effect to it.  Let us see if Deputy Cosgrave's sense of humanity will carry him to the stage of loosening his purse strings, and the purse strings of his friends.  I hope Deputy Morrissey is going to challenge a division on this motion.</P>

A modified scheme for the drainage of portion only of the Moy was examined, and an approximate estimate of the contribution required was laid before the Council on 24th May, 1929.  So far as the Commissioners are aware no decision has so far been reached to make the necessary contribution.</P>
      <P>Unless the County Council withdraws the condition that the Gweestion, Pollagh and Yellow Rivers scheme should not be carried out sooner than the Moy scheme, no action can be taken by the Commissioners until the Council agrees to make the necessary contribution towards the cost of the Moy scheme.</P>
