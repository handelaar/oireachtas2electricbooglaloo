      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if part-time trade reporters are still engaged in Leeds, West Byfleet (Surrey), Sheffield, Burslem, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow, Cardiff, and Newcastle-on-Tyne, and, if so, if any recent reports have been received from them on the state of the market in relation to the sale of, and the demand for, Saorstát produce in these centres and what was the nature of such reports for each of the above centres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if there are still three trade inspectors serving under the High Commissioner in Great Britain, that is, one in the London area, one in the Liverpool area, and one in the Glasgow area, and, if so, if he will state if any reports have been received from them that might help to increase Saorstát trade in each of these centres, and what was the nature of such reports, if any.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) (for the Minister for External Affairs)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer questions 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trade inspectors and trade reporters are at present employed at the centres mentioned&mdash;except at Burslem and Newcastle-on-Tyne, and reports to the High Commissioner deal with demand and supply, local prices, transport problems, condition of produce on arrival, comparisons with products of other countries, and generally with all matters likely to be helpful to Saorstát exporters.  They <Col N="626" /> keep in touch with the principal importers of live stock and other agricultural produce in their districts, and stimulate interest in Saorstát exports by every means possible.  The reports of the trade inspectors and the trade reporters to the High Commissioner are embodied in general reports from the latter to the Department of Agriculture. A very full report based on the latest information received from the High Commissioner's office is broadcast from the Dublin Station every Tuesday night.  If the Deputy desires, he can have a copy of any of these broadcast reports on application to the Department of Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if there are at present any Saorstát officials in the High Commissioner's Office in London whose time is devoted to the display of Saorstát produce in various centres in Great Britain, and, if so, if he will state where such displays of Saorstát produce have been located for the past three months; have any reports been received on the result of such displays, and, if so, what was the nature of such reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The officials of the trade section of the High Commissioner's Office and the three trade inspectors devote some portion of their time in arranging displays of Saorstát produce at suitable centres.  No officer is exclusively employed on display work. The following is a list of the displays during the past three months, namely:&mdash;</P>
      <P>3rd to 9th September, 1932&mdash;Bakers and Confectioners Exhibition, London.</P>
      <P>17th to 23rd September, 1932&mdash;International Grocers Exhibition, London.</P>
      <P>Both of these exhibitions are held under the auspices of the Grocery, Provision and Allied Trades Association.</P>
      <P>3rd to 8th October, 1932&mdash;Rochester Exhibition.</P>
      <P>Organised by the Medway Chamber of Commerce, comprising the towns of Rochester, Chatham and Gillingham.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if any application has been received in his Department for a grant for a sewerage scheme for Carrigaline from the County Cork Board of Health, and, if not, whether he will communicate with the latter body for particulars of the plans of said sewerage scheme, which were drawn up by Richard Evans, C.E., for the old Kinsale Rural District Council, with a view that a grant be now made available for the carrying out of this very necessary work which, at the present time, would afford much needed employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if an engineer was sent by his Department to investigate the possibilities of working the Slieveardagh Collieries, County Tipperary, and, if so, whether he will state the nature of his report; whether he is aware that a similar investigation has been made on behalf of an English Company and reported upon favourably, and whether he is now prepared to have the possibilities fully explored with a view to encouraging the reopening of this industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>While no special investigation of the Slieveardagh district has been made by my Department in recent years there is a great deal of information available in the Geological Survey records of this area.  I am aware that an investigation of the district was made by certain outside interests recently, and certain financial proposals following such investigations were placed before my Department. These were not of a kind which I found it possible to entertain.  As regards the concluding part of the question, the Deputy will appreciate that the development of these coal deposits, which are in fact in private ownership, is, in the first instance, a matter for private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewFogarty" hpid="Mr. Fogarty Mr. Fogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to the fact that about 200 persons who could be engaged in mining are in receipt of home assistance and owing to the wide difference which, we understand, existed between the Department's engineer and the engineer of the English company, will the Minister see that an engineer be appointed to explore these mines and to get them opened up so as to relieve the distress that exists there at present?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware (1) that the prices quoted for straight run bakers' flour for the week ending 26th November, 1932, was 21/6 and 27/6 at mill, Liverpool and Cork, respectively (the difference amounting to practically 1d. on the 4lb. loaf); and (2) that wheat can be landed at Cork as cheaply as at Liverpool, and if, in view of this difference in price, he will take the necessary steps to permit the free importation of outside flour if the present restriction of imports is to mean that there is to be no limit to the price that Irish millers can charge for their flour, and that the Irish consumer will be compelled to pay more for bread made from a lower grade flour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information as regards prices quoted for straight run bakers' flour at mill, Liverpool, beyond information gathered from trade papers.  The price of straight run Saorstát flour at Cork on the 26th November, 1932, was, I am informed, 27/6 per 280 lbs. for small lots with reductions according to the quantities ordered.  I am taking the whole matter up with the millers concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that I am not responsible for the bad grammar in the question.  &ldquo;Prices was&rdquo; is not very good grammar.  Is the Minister aware of any local conditions&mdash;a high rate of wages or a low output&mdash;which would account for the discrepancy?  My figure of 21/6 at mill, Liverpool, is quite correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must bear in mind that there is probably a substantial <Col N="631" /> surplus of flour now available at Liverpool and that that may account for a lower rate prevailing than obtains in this country, where there is no such surplus.</P>

    <P>(b) When under the Customs Duties (Milk and Cream) (Provisional Importation) <Col N="634" /> Order, 1932, Customs duty first became payable on milk and cream, the required licences were issued to those concerns without restriction of quantity.  Subsequently, after the passing of the Finance (Customs Duties) (No. 2) Act, in which the provisions of that Order were incorporated it was found advisable to limit the quantity in each case to the amount of milk and cream normally imported, and licences were accordingly issued authorising, during the six months ending 31st December, the import of 367,539 gallons of milk, and 31,490 gallons of cream.</P>

I am not able to argue the question as well as he would be able to argue it, but I am told that &ldquo;may&rdquo; is mandatory as the section is drafted and having regard to the references all through the Bill to millable wheat.  It is mandatory on the Minister to prescribe regulations defining millable wheat, but it would appear that if &ldquo;shall&rdquo; were put in it would be too restrictive.  It appears that I have, at any rate, to fulfil what Deputy Bennett is aiming at and that I must prescribe conditions even with the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I undertook to examine the matter when the Bill was in Committee, and it is quite clear from that examination that these amendments should not be accepted.  The paragraph, as it stands, provides for the representative of a deceased miller <Col N="641" /> carrying on the business during two periods: between the death of the licence holder and the raising of representation, and between the raising of representation and the winding up of the estate.  The personal representative is not entitled as such to carry on the business of a deceased person for an indefinite time.  The paragraph, as it stands, permits him to carry on that business under that licence while such business is being carried on by him in due course of administration.  There is no power to transfer the licence to the personal representative.  The personal representative can transfer the beneficial ownership in the business, but the beneficial ownership is not vested in him.  The words &ldquo;during the currency of such licence&rdquo; are necessary, because the Minister might revoke the licence while the business was being carried on by the representative of the deceased for any of the reasons for which a licence might be revoked under the Bill.  I think that Deputy McGilligan and I are trying to achieve the same thing, and I am satisfied that the best way of meeting it is the way suggested or proposed in the Bill.</P>

What we want to secure is that the business will be passed on from one ownership to the successor of that ownership.  There can be no question of a stoppage at all.  This section is intended to provide for the case where the estate has been administered by the personal representative pending the passing on of the inheritance to the person entitled to it under the will or in the case of <Col N="642" /> intestacy to the person entitled to it in law and in the circumstances mentioned.</P>

I tried to do that and sought to frame the type of regulation that would be necessary if the word &ldquo;prescribe&rdquo; were inserted there, but I found it a completely impossible task to undertake.  The very first requirement here is the information that is necessary in order to satisfy the Minister that the person applying for a licence is entitled to it under Section 20.  It is necessary that the Minister must get any information he may need for the information of all concerned. That information would be such things as the value of the mill; the price of the machinery and the price at which other machinery could produce flour for sale or profit, and for all these other points on which information might be required, the information must be given.  That must be information required for the consideration of the application.  Now, if a miller is satisfied that the information asked for by the Minister is not required he can refuse to give that information and have the matter tested in court.</P>

      <P>It would involve trying to envisage the circumstances of every mill or prospective mill in the country, and trying to determine what information the Minister would require about each mill and the persons associated with it.  It would mean having all that information and prescribing the regulations that would ensure that we would get it.  I tried to do it, but found it to be an almost impossible task.  It is a task that should not be placed on the Minister.</P>

      <P>In fact it is only just at the beginning of the working of the Bill that this difficulty will arise.  It is only in the case of existing mills. As far as future persons entering are concerned we have wide powers.  We can get that information in any case in so far as there is more or less discretion as to whether or not a licence should be issued.  The applications that are likely to arise in respect of this information will come almost immediately following the passage of the Bill.</P>

If the Minister would put in the words &ldquo;such reasonable information&rdquo; it might meet the situation but here the Minister can ask for any information of any kind he likes.  Under sub-section (5) of Section 19 he can refuse to grant a licence if the information that he unreasonably asks is not forthcoming. Surely there ought to be some limitation. &ldquo;Prescribe&rdquo; would give the limitation, because the regulations could be debated if they were found to be unreasonable.  As it stands, in dealing with any case the Minister could ask for any information reasonable or unreasonable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="645" /> In page 10, Section 21, at the end of sub-section (1), to add the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In towns or areas, other than Dublin, Cork or Limerick, the wages payable to a workman employed at a licensed mill shall be such as are agreed on between the mill owner and the local trade union, and, failing such agreement, then such rates as are customary in such areas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister has looked into the point that I raised on the Second Reading in this connection. The intention of the section, I think, is quite clear&mdash;to establish a flat rate for mills in the industry.  Deputy Norton's speech, as contained in volume 45, column 136, of the Official Report, makes the point clear when he says: &ldquo;The purpose of the amendment (that is the amendment he proposed), is to ensure that the workers in the milling industry, which is being placed on a proper basis under this Bill, will be paid rates of wages in all cases on the same basis as the rates of wages which have been the subject of negotiations and agreement between certain employers in the industry and the trade unions catering for the workers in that industry.&rdquo;  The intention of that is that supposing an arrangement is made in a particular area where a port mill is situated, and a provincial mill some distance from the port it could be held under the Bill that the rates of wages should be the same, that it is a licensed mill subject to the same conditions.  If that be the intention and if that be the purport, this Bill will defeat the principle which the Minister has in view in the decentralisation of industry.  The provincial mill has heretofore enjoyed the advantage of a differential rate.  The reason why it was necessary that the provincial mill should enjoy that rate is first of all that it has a very much smaller output, and a heavier overhead charge in proportion to that output, which increases the cost of production.  It also suffers from the disadvantage of having heavier costs of transport by reason of its position.  A further burden it suffers from is that coal and <Col N="646" /> other such commodities which are used in the mill have to be carried a considerable distance from the port. To meet these disadvantages, the mill has in the past enjoyed the advantage of a reduction in wages, and it is the intention of all parties, as was pointed out by Deputy Everett on the Second Reading, that these provincial mills should continue to enjoy that advantage.</P>
    <P>Under this amendment which was accepted by the Minister, it is quite obvious that, except the trade unions in particular areas themselves come to some arrangement, the advantage that the mills now enjoy cannot be continued.  I am not at all clear that, under the wording of this amendment, even if the trade unions and the employers were anxious that a differential rate should continue in a particular provincial town, they would have the power or the Minister would have the power to allow them to continue, because the clause in the Bill states that the rates to be paid in licensed mills shall be the same.  To get over that particular difficulty, and to make quite clear what, I think, was the intention of the different Deputies who spoke on this matter on the Second Reading, I have put down two amendments.</P>
    <P>The effect of the first amendment will be to make sub-section (1) of Section 21 read as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The wages payable to workmen employed at a licensed mill in Dublin, Cork and Limerick&rdquo;&mdash;those are the port mills&mdash;&ldquo;shall be at a rate not less than the rate generally recognised by trade unions and employers as the rate applicable to workmen employed in a similar kind of work at licensed mills in that area.&rdquo;  That makes it quite clear that the workmen in the mills in that particular area will be paid at that agreed rate.  Then we add a new sub-section following that:&mdash;&ldquo;In towns and areas other than Dublin, Cork and Limerick&rdquo;&mdash;this deals with the provincial towns, while the other dealt with the ports&mdash;&ldquo;the wages payable to workmen employed at a licensed mill shall be such as are agreed on between the mill owner and the local trade union&rdquo;&mdash;that is what is customary at <Col N="647" /> the moment and we want to continue that custom&mdash;&ldquo;and failing such agreement then such rates as are customary in such area.&rdquo;  If these two amendments are adopted I think the matter will be quite clear for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to oppose these amendments, because they would defeat the very object Deputy Good has in view.  I am familiar with the agreements in the flour-milling industry at the present time.  There are three rates of wages for mills in the various areas.  There is one rate for, say, port mills like the Dublin mills, and there are others for the rural areas.  Deputy Good's amendment means that while the trade unions would have the various rates of wages for the three different mills, the other mills might form into a little local combination, starting as a recognised union, with a smaller rate of wage than, say, a mill within five or six miles.  By the acceptance of Deputy Good's amendment you would have various rates in various rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh no, it is between the flour mills and the Irish Transport Workers' Union.  Nearly all the mills have an agreement for the three different rates of wages.  You would be giving facilities in respect of a particular <Col N="648" /> mill to the men engaged in the mill to form themselves into a local union in competition with the mills that have a certain recognised rate of wages in a particular area.  Deputy Good mentioned on the Committee Stage &ldquo;The position, as I understand it, under Deputy Norton's amendment is that we are to have in the mills what we have on the railways at present under which a railway porter in Dublin and a railway porter in Skibbereen get exactly the same rate of wages.&rdquo;  That is not correct.  A railway porter engaged in Skibbereen is treated and classified as an agricultural worker, and he gets paid at the agricultural rate for that particular area, while the porter in Dublin is paid at the industrial rate&mdash;two different rates of wages for the porters engaged in the particular industry.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister not to accept the amendment for the reason I pointed out&mdash;that it would not have the effect which Deputy Good or the Minister or I intended.

I would say it is not what Deputy Good wants either, and I appeal to him to withdraw the amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister, as to the actual wording of the section as it stands, is he sure that it does not preclude the object which I assume is the object of the Minister, was the object of Deputy Norton and is the object now proclaimed to be the object of Deputy Everett?  I gathered when we had a discussion here the last day that the view was not to have an equality of wages right through the State&mdash;to recognise that there might be different wages owing to, say, conditions in Dublin, Cork and Limerick on the one hand, and in certain other areas.  In fact, as Deputy Everett said, there are three rates of wages.  I would like the Minister to consider this.  At present there are those three rates of wages.  Deputy Norton's contention on the Committee Stage was this&mdash;and it is Deputy Everett's view to-day, and I understand it was the Minister's point of view the last day&mdash;that there is no intention to have equality right through.  What I would like to know is whether the clause as it stands, which is a legal interpretation, does not compel you to have equality right through.  The clause as it stands lays down:&mdash;</P>
      <P>wages payable to a workman employed at a licensed mill shall be at a rate not less than the rate generally recognised by trade unions and employers as the rate applicable to workmen employed in a similar kind of work at licensed mills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But you have different types of work. Men performing miller's work in Dublin get the same pay as millers in the country.  It does not make any allowance for a difference in area as it compels the same rate of wages to be given.  As the clause stands, it seems to me that no matter what trade union regulations may be it compels the same rate of wages to be given to the man doing the same type of work no matter where he does it.  I do not think mere difference in area will differentiate types of work.  If that is so, I ask the Minister to carefully consider the matter.  I think it runs counter to the purpose of the amendment, and now we have just listened <Col N="650" /> to the speech made by Deputy Everett in favour of the clause as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that it is not intended there should be a flat rate of wages throughout the whole milling industry.  It is intended that the rate generally recognised and generally agreed upon between employers and employees in the industry should be the rate paid in each mill&mdash;that would be the rate applicable in that mill.  As I read the sub-section that is what it provides for, but as there is some doubt raised I would be disposed to have the matter examined fully, and if necessary an amendment moved on the later Stage to make it clear that where an agreement between the employers and employees permits of a differentiating rate of wages in certain types of work they will not be debarred from making such agreement by the section.  If necessary, an amendment will be moved or I would ask the matter to be allowed to stand over until the Report Stage.</P>

Where an office and mill are in the same town but in different buildings it would merely mean that the records should be kept in such mill referred to.  If you have a mill in Donegal with the office in Dublin it would be more than an inconvenience all round.  That goes a long way to meet the point raised in the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I admit the Minister has brought in the question of evasion of the regulations to-day. On the last day it was mainly a question of the convenience of the officials in enforcing the regulations.  The Minister has not made it clear yet if there was a central office, and there must be a central office if you have a number of mills running, how would that lead to an evasion of the regulations.  It will certainly mean a terrific amount of work and inconvenience, whatever inconvenience may be saved to the official, to the industrialist, to the miller, or to the people who may own a number of mills in different portions of the country.  Of course, the same thing applies to other industries that are dealt with in this Bill.  The same would apply to the importers, but especially in the case of a person who owns a number of mills.  It seems to me that the convenience of the Department, or of the officials, is being consulted and not the convenience of the person engaged in the industry.</P>

      <P>There is no case I know of where the circumstances would be such, and no representation has been received by me from millers apart altogether from the representations in respect of the type of case which is met by the new amendment.  It is obvious that the inspector would not wish to lose much time when comparing the records of the office and the mill. If they were a substantial distance away, and if it took a substantial time to travel from one to the other it is quite possible you would have to do something, but where they are in the same vicinity, and where it is a matter of the miller's convenience, from the miller's point of view there is no reason why he should insist on the records being kept in the mill.  We must insist that they be kept somewhere.  We are discussing something from a purely academic point of view, because <Col N="653" /> there is no place I know of where there are certain mills associated with one another and having separate sales and separate organisations, and would not be affected by this section.</P>

I made this point before, that some time limit should be given to the man in which to wind up his business.  This amendment means that once the Minister has held an inquiry and made his decision whether rightly or wrongly, and I am not entering into the merits of that&mdash; that he does not need, under this section, to give to that person the normal time that would be required to wind up a business in the ordinary way.

      <Col N="657" /> If any milling licence shall be revoked under this section, for any reason other than that it has been procured by fraud or misrepresentation, the person who was the holder of such milling licence may sell his interest in the mill to which such licence was attached, and if such sale is completed within a period of three calendar months from the date of the revocation of such licence the Minister shall grant to the purchaser, if a national of Saorstát Eireann or an Irish owned body corporate a milling licence subject only to the statutory condition referred to in Section 20 of this Act and to the further condition that milling shall be resumed at the said mill within a period of not more than three months after the date of the grant of such licence.&mdash;(Deputy Bennett.)</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is one which I am not disposed to accept, but, as I said with regard to a previous amendment, I think it is most unlikely that the circumstances contemplated will arise.  The revocation of a milling licence is altogether different from the revocation of, say, the licence to a pedlar or an egg dealer, or somebody of that kind.  To revoke the licence of a responsible miller would be a serious thing to do.  It would undoubtedly lead to a discussion in the public Press and in this House, and consequently would not be embarked upon lightly. So that the Minister is unlikely to do it unless very glaring circumstances prevail.  Normally, in such circumstances, if that did happen he would certainly make such arrangements as would ensure that the mill would be sold at its true value, and that the person who purchased it would be a person to whom a licence would ordinarily be given under the Act.  I think it is undesirable that a provision <Col N="658" /> of the kind that Deputy McMenamin suggests should be inserted in the Bill. It presupposes a condition of affairs altogether foreign to what is in my mind.  We are dealing now with a miller who, for some glaring reason, has been deprived of his licence.  It might be that the circumstances were such that the revocation of the licence arose out of the situation of the mill or out of something associated with the mill, in which case it would obviously be the policy of the Minister not to allow the mill to be re-started as a flour mill.  In a case such as that, a provision of this kind would be a very definite handicap, because it would mean that the Minister would be required to give the licence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had various analogies.  The Minister himself drew a number the last day between millers and egg dealers which he has withdrawn to-day to a certain extent.  In the case of other licensing Bills which went through this House I remember that provision was made that a person conducting a licensed business should, practically speaking, get notice to quit.  That was intended to make him realise that he was not a fit person to carry on the business: that there was some grave abuse in the way that he was carrying it on.  He was, therefore, given the opportunity to clear out of the business, and to sell his interest to somebody else. Therefore, no matter what the Minister or the Government at the time may have thought, there was an opportunity given to that person to sell his licence.  I gather that the Minister envisages the type of case where the man himself has been guilty <Col N="659" /> of grave fault.  Even so, the penalties in the Bill for that are very heavy. But why not allow him to sell in that particular case?  I am speaking now of the case in which the Minister says there is no likelihood of the Minister interfering and dealing drastically with it by an immediate withdrawal of the licence to prevent the sale of the mill as a going concern to somebody else.  Then there is the case where there is something wrong with the physical structure of the mill.  If there is any attempt to sell to another person the Minister can step in and deal with that.</P>

      <P>Supposing the licence is revoked because the quota of the mill has, over a number of years, gone down gradually to vanishing point, either because no one will buy the flour by reason of the price charged or because the quality is so poor that no one will consume it&mdash;in a case such as that, where the licence has been revoked either upon the application of the licensee because he has given up hope or because of the action of the Minister in reducing the quota, it would surely be the best policy from every point of view not to issue a licence in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>How could you? I am thinking of the case of the man who purchased it as a flour mill.  If the Minister withdrew the licence for one of the reasons he has stated, then the seller in such circumstances <Col N="660" /> would be guilty of misrepresentation in passing that on as a going milling concern.  Of course the seller in such a case could not succeed, and no one could get a licence for the mill because the seller would have been guilty of fraud or misrepresentation in the sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>He certainly would.  If a notice is served on the owner of a mill that his licence is to be withdrawn either because he is not milling up to the quota, or because the price he is charging is too high, that surly is notice to him that his mill is no longer going to exist as a flour mill.  For that reason he could not sell it as a going milling concern, and if he attempted to pass it on to anybody as a flour mill his contract would be invalidated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to regulate the flour milling industry and the insertion of an amendment of this kind would, to some extent, defeat that purpose.  If the licence of a mill is definitely revoked, the question as to whether a new licence for the mill under new ownership would be issued would have to be determined on the merits then existing, whereas the acceptance of this amendment would deprive the Minister of any discretion in the matter and would require the licence automatically to be issued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that if there is any uncertainty it will interfere with the credit of the miller?  If it is not certain that the licence will be permanently attached to the mill, does he not consider that will have a very serious effect on the credit of that miller?  That seems to me to be a more important consideration than the question of sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The licence permanently attaches to the mill and can only be revoked if the licensee applies to have it revoked or in the circumstances supposed in the section <Col N="661" /> to which this amendment has been moved.  If that occurs or is established that he has got the licence by fraud or misrepresentation or has gone out of business, it is only in those circumstances that the licence can be revoked.  Otherwise the licence attaches permanently to the mill and passes from one generation to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the three types of cases the Minister has in view, take first the unsuitability of the premises.  I do not see how the fact that a sale should be compulsorily allowed will affect that.  Then, as to the failure of a mill, that would have been advertised, and the Minister can deal very effectively with that by treating the mill in exactly the same way as any defective premises.  Either the premises will continue defective or they will not.  If they do not, the Minister's argument falls to the ground. If it is a case of a falling quota, due to the fact that no one will buy the flour of that mill, the continuance of the quota cannot possibly interfere with a sale such as is envisaged here. It surely can have no effect on the general quota system of the State as a whole.  It will simply mean that the quota would have been reduced so much.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moore asked the Minister to consider that there is hanging over all mills now the fear that the licence is something in the nature of a permanent adjunct to the mill.  Will not that interfere with the value of all mills in the market?  It means that the licence is a personal thing attached to the owner of the mill to a large extent. I do not think that the Minister has met the case for the compulsory sale of a mill and of giving a man an opportunity of clearing out and selling. In view of the very heavy penalties already provided in the Bill the matter as it stands now does seem to interfere very seriously with an owner in the sale of his mill.  If there is deliberate mismanagement on the part of a millowner there are very heavy penalties provided.  I do not think that the Minister has met the argument in favour of this amendment.</P>

      <P>That makes all the difference in the world because it is the person that is licensed and not the mill.  If the licence attached to the mill premises it would be quite different. It would be the same as in the case of a public-house.  There the licence attaches to the public-house, irrespective of the individual.  If I hold a spirit licence and if I am convicted and have two endorsements on that licence I lose my licence ipso facto. In this instance the licence cannot be passed on with the premises and, as a mill, they are not a saleable entity.  The moment the licence is revoked I have nothing to pass on and the premises are practically valueless.  There is no provision here to give a man the full benefit of any interest he has in a licence attaching to a mill.  I think some form of amendment, though not necessarily the one that is now suggested, should be adopted.</P>

I submit that no hardship is inflicted, under the provisions of the Bill as it <Col N="663" /> stands, on any person selling a mill, except to the extent that he can only sell to some person who is licensed as a flour miller; he must sell to someone who has got a licence as a flour miller.

      <P>I quite agree that is inherent in all advisory committees of a vocational kind, especially where the expenditure of moneys is concerned.  But that is no reason why the public and this House should not know when there is a difference of opinion between the Committee and the Minister.  Surely the Minister will be able to stand up to any difficulties that may arise between himself and the Committee.  I am not keen on committees of any kind, where they have not full responsibility; but in this case, once the Committee is appointed, it is only right that the House should know its views on matters submitted to it for consideration.  I cannot see what harm it will do to the Minister to have these views definitely known.</P>

Has the Minister any objection to publicity? Is there any guarantee that he will be able to prevent publicity in regard to any advice that may be given?

      <P>Up to this, flour has been imported into this country by two classes of people, one, persons who were agents of flour mills in Great Britain and Northern Ireland and, two, certain merchant firms who purchased <Col N="666" /> flour in other countries and imported it here for sale.  In the case of flour from Great Britain and Northern Ireland, we could not issue a licence to the agent of the mill and to any merchant who imported flour without having a certain duplication.  What was done when the licensing provision came into effect in July was to get the agents of the various mills who had been supplying this country with flour from abroad and give them licences, the amount to be imported being calculated on their average imports over some years past.  If we had given a licence to the merchants as well, it would have meant duplication.  The point is that if, in respect of the same quantity of flour, two licences were to exist, the scheme would become inoperative. Consequently, licences were confined, in the case of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, to agents.</P>
      <P>In the case of Canadian and other outside mills importing flour, the importers were not agents but were firms who bought the flour from the mills and resold it in this country.  A different set of circumstances applies there.</P>

      <P>With regard to amendment 46, the idea is fully covered.  It is particularly difficult to include such an amendment as has been proposed by Deputy Lynch.  At any rate, I think the whole point is already fully covered.  The point about &ldquo;or likely so to be registered&rdquo; will naturally be taken into account by the Minister. <Col N="667" /> Those in the business must automatically be registered.  If an application comes in at a later date for registration, all the circumstances will be fully taken into consideration. The Minister is certain to take into account, in the case of two or three applications, the applicant most likely to fulfil the necessary conditions.  It is very difficult to give the idea effect in legal form.  It requires several sections and sub-sections.  Amendment 47 is much on the same lines though not exactly the same.  I think that it is also covered.</P>

      <P>We had this point on Committee Stage.  The Minister did not meet us beyond saying that he had not very much belief in the value of secrets.

Let us take the case of a maize miller who has a retail shop.  If he were to transfer part of his maize meal mixture to the retail shop, his action would be covered by &ldquo;dispositions.&rdquo;  A compound feeding stuff manufacturer might be also a maize miller.  As a maize miller, he might transfer some stuff to the compound feeding stuffs department to be disposed of in that way.  There is also the possibility of certain feeding stuffs being unfit for further use and having to be destroyed.  &ldquo;Dispositions&rdquo; would cover all these things.  It is a wider term than &ldquo;sales&rdquo; and more suitable.  The point as to secrets can be raised on amendment 56.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment raises the point as to the Minister or his inspectors stumbling across secrets which the manufacturer of compound feeding stuffs may have.  In the Department, we are rather sceptical about those secrets.  We do not believe that there are any such secrets but if there are and if they are of any value, I do not see that any risk is being run by the manufacturer by inspection.  The inspector would be prohibited from publishing in any way any information he might get.  In any event, I do not think the inspector would be looking for those secrets.  He would have to find where maize was disposed of.  If he found from the books of the maize miller that he brought on to the premises a certain amount of whole maize, he would require to find what became of that maize when milled.  He might find that a certain part was sold and that a certain part went into the premises of the compound feeding stuffs manufacturer.  Perhaps he would have to go a little further. He might have to go to the books of the compound feeding stuffs manufacturer to find if the figures there corresponded with the amount alleged to have gone in.  In that way, he might have to find out what were the compound feeding <Col N="670" /> stuffs made and what was the percentage of maize in the amount of compound feeding stuffs issued from the premises.  In doing that, I do not think that he would necessarily discover any secret.  If a manufacturer of compound feeding stuffs was making laying meal or chicken food or something like that, the fact that it was found to contain 30 per cent., 40 per cent. or 60 per cent. of maize would not be revealing a secret because our inspectors can at present go in and take a sample of that compound feeding stuff and have it analysed to find how much carbohydrates, oil and proteins it contains.  From that, I think, we could all make a fair guess as to the amount of ordinary cereals contained in it&mdash;whether they be maize or barley or some of the common cereals used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would not have got at his secret of what exactly in that chicken food was working miracles.  What is in those things is some obscure remedy, supposed to cure everything, used in very small quantities, such as iodine or iron oxide.  It is these things that make the difference.  We would not be very much concerned with the amount of these things contained in the stuff.  We have power under another section to go more closely into this matter but, as I explained on Committee Stage, we would only do that if we came to the conclusion that the article was being sold at a ridiculously high price.  If, for instance, a food for calves, as happened some time ago, was being sold at £3 per cwt. and if, on ordinary chemical analysis, we found that the amount of carbohydrates, oil and proteins contained in it was only worth 8/- or 9/-, we would have power to go into the question further.  That was a case that cropped up here about two years ago.  The fact was published that this food was being sold at four or five times its real value and that was all the Department could do in the matter&mdash;give publicity to it.  Under a later section, we take power to take the licence to manufacture that particular article from the manufacturer in such a case.  I think there is no danger that we would unnecessarily pry into the secrets of the manufacturer <Col N="671" /> who is selling his stuff at the ordinary price of £10 or £12 per ton. There would be no further inquiry.</P>

      <P>May I take it that the Minister's position is this: he gets the documents and when he finds out that a certain amount of maize is being used for a particular mixture, say, of a proprietary character, he is satisfied, and he can check up that afterwards so far as the amount of maize is concerned by the analysis, and there is no necessity for the inspector to investigate any further as to how the mixing has taken place?</P>

I do not see how that can happen here.  This is an effort to make it clear that it has this particular limitation.  I can understand that it may be held that it is not necessary, but it was merely to satisfy a number of people and make their minds easy that the suggestion was made.  If the Minister assures me that putting it in would be analogous to those cases where words are proposed obviously with the intention of clarifying, and which have the opposite effect, I would be satisfied, but if it has not that effect I do not see why it should not be put in.</P>

The Minister recognises that cases might very easily arise under the section which ought to be dismissed under the Probation of Offenders Act.  In such cases it ought not to be open to the Bench to impose the penalty of imprisonment. Therefore, I suggest that on the Report Stage he should either make the penalties in Part III applicable to all offences under this section or at least provide that a first offence under this section would be punishable only under Part III of the Schedule.</P>

      <P>The reason for this amendment is that if we leave in &ldquo;carry on the business of milling&rdquo; it would more or less make the farmer-miller a maize miller, and therefore he would have to comply with the conditions. But by substituting these words &ldquo;to mill&rdquo; it would mean that the farmer would only be licensed and would not be registered.  He would get the ordinary licence to get, say, a ton of maize.  He would get, whatever he got in 1931.  If he got so much for 1930 and 1931, and if he made the case that in 1931 he got less than in 1930, then we could give him a little more.  The only condition would be that we would allow him to take a certain amount of maize to mill, not for sale, and we would also compel him to use a certain amount of home-grown grain.  The restriction would not be onerous.  We do not want these farmer-millers to go on the register and comply with all the conditions about keeping books.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment looks forward to a subsequent portion of the Bill.  By a subsequent portion of the Bill the Minister is to have power to engage in business. Our objection to it is not naturally to this little sub-section here, but is to some extent consequential on what goes with it, namely, the power of the Minister for Agriculture in this particular case, and in other cases the power of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to engage in business. We object very strongly to the Government without any case being shown for it, or without any case of urgent necessity for it, engaging in business. What we object to is that the Government takes it upon itself to engage in the ordinary business; not in big undertakings like railways and monopolies like that, but to engage in <Col N="681" /> business&mdash;in milling, in this particular instance.</P>
      <P>What case has the Government made or what case does the Minister make for this proposal that he and his Department shall engage in ordinary trade, ordinary business and ordinary industry, having at the same time in the State any number of other people in that particular business?  Under what circumstances does the Minister intend to engage in work of that kind? Our objection is an objection to the principle and to the fact that no reasonable case has been made out for this particular part of the Bill to which this sub-section looks forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that the Minister cannot engage in the business of maize milling unless he can take over an unworked maize mill.  He could not buy an ordinary maize mill and go on with the business.  As long as there are people in the country prepared to carry on the business of maize milling the Minister would not be called upon to engage in the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>He might.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible, but, of course, he would not.  An unworked mill would be premises that are not entered in the register but which would be suitable for milling maize.  The Deputy asks under what circumstances would we be likely to engage in the business of maize milling.  I think the present Minister for Agriculture would have no intention of engaging in this business unless he was absolutely compelled to do so for the want of a maize mill in the district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, first of all, I would like to say that the maize millers themselves were very reluctant, when consulted about this business of using home-grown grain, to fall in with the ideas we had on the subject.  Since certain regulations were made which more or less compel them &mdash;if they want to carry on business&mdash; to use home-grown grain, I know of one at least who has closed his mill and said that he would not carry on under those conditions.  If that example were to be followed to any great extent&mdash;<Col N="682" /> that maize millers were not prepared to carry on&mdash;it might be possible that with collusion amongst maize millers they would make the working of the Bill absolutely impossible.  Under those circumstances the Minister or somebody would have to come in and take over those mills and work them.  In the last resort it may be necessary for the Minister himself to do it.  I do not know.  It may be.</P>
    <P>Dealing with maize millers&mdash;some of them at any rate&mdash;is very difficult, because they are able to make a case sometimes that this mixture is not a very advisable food, and so on.  I was in touch for instance with one trader in Deputy O'Sullivan's constituency who sent me up a sample of the mixture when it was at first proposed. It consisted of finely-ground maize and a considerable quantity of black oats crushed in it, which looked very bad.  The only thing I could do was to ask the trader &ldquo;where did you get the black oats?&rdquo; because I was told there was no black oats ground in those mills in the district, so obviously the maize miller went to a considerable amount of trouble to prepare a very unsightly mixture, instead of trying to carry out the regulations to the best of his ability.  A few days ago I had a complaint from the same trader that he had unwittingly supplied maize meal mixture, that is maize meal mixed with white oats, to his clients for human food, and had not known for three weeks that he was doing so, which showed that the maize miller had made up this unsightly mixture to prejudice the scheme so that if he was compelled to go on with the mixture he could detect with the naked eye.  That is the sort of prejudice we have on the part of the maize miller against this scheme, and one at least has gone so far as to close his premises and say that he would not go on with it.  If it only amounted to one or half a dozen closing down in isolated districts, where the area is well covered apart from them, the Minister would not have to intervene&mdash;would not have to come in to the maize milling business. I may say that from my own experience, <Col N="683" /> although it is short, of working business on behalf of the State, I would be inclined to keep out of it as much as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister does not give way for once to his inclinations.  He envisages a case in which apparently there is going to be such conspiracy on the part of the maize millers that they would go out of business in order to embarrass the Minister in the operation of this particular Bill.  That is the justification he puts forward for the power that he is taking under this Bill, a power that he grants, even though his experience as Minister is short, he does not think is a desirable power to exercise, namely, the State engaging in business.  Instead of imagining conspiracy of this kind, based on the propaganda work of one particular miller he has come across, why not wait until that conspiracy has taken place, and then put up a case to the Dáil, based on mere facts and not on the fears and suspicions of the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should the Minister in this Bill, which is meant for an entirely different purpose, take power to engage in trade, and merely on the justification that he offer&mdash;not the normal circumstances existing, but a supposed conspiracy of such a nature that apparently a considerable number of maize millers are going to go out of existence in order to embarrass the Minister in the operation of this particular Bill?  I do not think that the Minister has given a justification for these particular powers that he is taking to engage in what is ordinary business, in competition if necessary with other people in the trade, which is, as he admits, an undesirable thing for the State to do.  If a crisis arises, or what the Minister considers a crisis, it can always be dealt with by getting the necessary legislation through the House.  The Government have not experienced any great difficulty in getting legislation of a most drastic and revolutionary character through this House in the last five or six months.  The Minister would certainly be in a position to put his case <Col N="684" /> before the House if he thinks the Government ought to take the very undesirable step of engaging in business. In addition, he brought in a number of other things.  It appears, in connection with the particular portion of the Bill to which this sub-section looks forward, namely, the part that gives the Minister power to engage in milling, that if the Minister does not get that power the other portion of the Bill may be so much intrigued against by the millers that it may break down altogether&mdash;that is the portion of the Bill which makes the mixture compulsory.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to my constituency. I already drew attention on the Second Reading to the fact that there is very strong objection on the part of the ordinary farmer as well as the trader, to this particular portion of the Bill, and on two grounds.  I am referring now, not to the part to which this sub-section looks forward, but to the part that makes compulsory the sale of a mixture and limits the sale of ordinary maize meal to packets of one stone.  There is very strong objection to that.  The objection is very vocal and very strong in the constituency I represent.  They object to it because they think that there is an unnecessary hardship, so far as the producer of maize meal for human consumption is concerned, in insisting that the packets be made up containing quantities not greater than one stone.  That is an unnecessary hardship, and would be inflicted on the poorest class of the population.  It would be a great inconvenience as well as everything else; people may be very desirous of purchasing more than a stone of maize meal.  There is also a very strong suspicion on the part of the people of my constituency that they are not going to get a good article when they get the mixture.  They know what they are getting, they say, when they are buying maize meal.</P>
    <P>In other portions of the country, perhaps in the portion represented by the Minister, the people may be more trusting.  They are not quite so trusting in the particular portion that I represent.  They fear that the mixture they will get will be of an inferior <Col N="685" /> quality, and the mere fact of the instance brought forward by the Minister himself that a mixture was offered for sale&mdash;a mixture of maize and oats so well disguised that it was sold as maize meal&mdash;will not tend to make their minds easier on the matter.  At least so far as the unsightly mixture is concerned they had the warning that it was unsightly, but now apparently nobody will detect the mixture that they are handing out. If that fact gets published it will not tend to increase their confidence as to the article they are getting.  As things stand at present they have at least a guarantee; they know they are getting a standard article, because, as has been pointed out again and again in various inquiries and here, there is a uniform standard as far as maize meal is concerned; there is not a uniform standard so far as the mixture is concerned.  We can deal with the important sections themselves when we come to deal with the particular matters raised, but it is because this section refers forward to the power taken by the Minister, and similar sections so far as the Minister for Industry and Commerce is concerned, that we object to it.  A hypothetical case has been put forward by the Minister, and that is the very best he can urge, to justify the Government in taking power under this section to engage in private business. As I say, we will have an opportunity later on of discussing this because there are amendments down to it.  It is not that a national crisis would be caused, but there might be interference in the administration of a certain portion of this Bill, and on that account, and on a vague suspicion of that kind, the Minister proposes to take very extensive powers under this Bill, and, as the Minister himself asknowledges, it is not a desirable thing to do.  If there is any basis for the case he puts forward, namely, that there may be a conspiracy, I suggest that is the time to deal with it. The Minister knows well, this House is not inclined to hold up legislation of any kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy should realise that having the power there <Col N="686" /> often prevents conspiracies of that kind.  I am sure it would take three or four weeks to get the Bill through both Houses and they may not be so deterred from putting up a certain amount of resistance to the working of this Bill.  With regard to the other point raised, that there were some maize mills in the County Kerry and other places where a mixture was used and that something was being consumed under false pretences, that of course will be remedied as soon as this becomes an Act, because both the mixture and the pure maize must be labelled and if a person goes into a shop to buy pure maize he will see the label.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we discussed the subject of these amendments but perhaps we did not come to the particular <Col N="687" /> point.  We will take the first one, 61 (3), line 64.  This deals with the question of a person who is not a registered maize miller &ldquo;subject to compliance with such conditions as he thinks fit to impose to mill at any premises specified in such licence maize, either as the Minister thinks proper.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that reference to the farmer-maize-miller I mentioned already.  It is perhaps somewhat on a par with the discussion carried on already with the Minister for Industry and Commerce. If we had a little experience in the matter we might be able to prescribe, but what we feel about it is, it is going to be very harsh on the farmer-maize-miller if we prescribe regulations.  If we prescribe regulations we must make them fairly secure and watertight. Then we may find many cases coming in where we would like to be more lax in justice to the particular farmer.  I think it would be against the interests of the farmer if we were to prescribe regulations.  I have already given some indication of the conditions we would attach to these licences.  The farmer would be permitted to bring into his premises a certain quantity of maize for twelve or six months based on the amount he had been using for the last two or three years.  He would not be allowed to mill that for sale and he would be compelled to use at least an equivalent of whatever the percentage might be in the maize meal with the mixture.  The ordinary maize miller would be also compelled to use the equivalent amount of home-grown grain in his milling operations.  I think if we were to prescribe regulations they would inevitably be very harsh on some of the people who apply for licences.  I think they would be very restrictive on these people and would hit the farmer-miller very much. I think perhaps after some time we will probably have, what I might call, unofficial prescribed regulations.  The experience of the Department is that people will be writing up to know what the conditions are, and this becomes rather troublesome and you automatically give a stereotyped reply which will contain all the regulations.  It <Col N="688" /> will be a sort of unofficial prescribed regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the Minister's point in dealing with this type of question, but I think the Minister is also prone to forget the point I raised here before, that it is the right of the average citizen to demand information as to what things he must comply with in order to acquire a licence or a benefit under the Act, and it is far more his right when he is threatened with a penalty such as is set out in sub-section (6) for a breach of the Act. Here there is absolute discretion left in the Minister's hands to make ad hoc regulations, and the situation might conceivably arise in which one farmer could be prosecuted and convicted for doing the same thing which his neighbour is permitted to do by the Minister.  That is not a desirable situation, and while the Minister desires a discretion as he thinks for the better working of the Bill, I have no hesitation in pressing upon him that the greater good is to secure that there will be uniformity and publicity in the matter of regulations of this kind, and that where he proposes to make regulations under this Act they shall be enforced as set out in Part II of the Schedule.  When a man knows precisely where he stands, he need not depend on the beneficence or good will of the Minister.  He is entitled to the letter of the law, and can get it if he deems it necessary for his own sake. I urge very strongly on the Minister that where penalties are prescribed in the Act he ought be prepared by consent to having everything done under the section where the penalty is prescribed by regulation.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister look into that? Is he open to consider the desirability of prescribing regulations where it is proposed to enforce any penalty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered that matter already, and I would prefer not to prescribe regulations in a case like this. I think any of the former Ministers will sympathise with me in that.  Where you have 500 or 600 farmers who want licences to mill wheat, it would be easier to have the prescribed regulations set down.  That would settle the <Col N="689" /> matter.  Perhaps after some time we can prescribe regulations, but in the beginning, it would be a difficult matter to deal with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason why the Minister could not prescribe regulations to-morrow, and later, if his officials pointed out that they were unworkable, he could publish further ones.  The Minister knows the Department of Agriculture better than I do, but from my knowledge of the officials, I have very little doubt that in the fullness of their wisdom they could devise a schedule and regulations which would cover any probable cases that might arise under the section.</P>

      <P>If the Minister thinks, after a while, that he will be able to do it by a little hard brain work, I think he will probably be able to arrive at a workable set of regulations, and he is not precluded from amending them afterwards if it were found necessary. There is another point which is always forgotten by Ministers when they want to get freedom for themselves.  If he does this he creates or sustains a precedent. I do not know if there is any precedent for doing this, and for putting complete discretion in the hands of the Minister where penalties are to be imposed.  Supposing there is a precedent, it is a very bad one, and it is sustaining it to follow it now.  So surely as the Minister does it in this Bill the time will come, perhaps within twelve or eighteen months, when someone will get up in his place to ask: &ldquo;Did not Dr. Ryan, when Minister for Agriculture, do this, or did not Mr. Hogan, when he was Minister, do it?&rdquo;  I would like to arrive at the point where a definite departure from that procedure should be marked.  I doubt if there is a precedent.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="691" /> There are a number of other amendments in the name of Deputy McGilligan dealing with Section 66. The Minister may remember that we had some discussion on the Second Reading Stage, and more particularly on the Committee Stage on the question of the price that was to be paid; how the Government arrived at that price, the calculation of the amount of millable wheat; the price fixed for home-grown wheat and the standard price.  Has the Minister any objection to this amendment as it stands?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the objection. &ldquo;Prescribe&rdquo; is not necessary.  What I object to is that the Government should have power to reduce.  The Executive Council stated what the standard price will be for the 1933/1934 crops.  If anything were to arise, and if conditions were to change as in the days of the great war, either through war, the inflation of money, or something else, we should have power to increase the price.  There should be no power to reduce it, because, having given that price two years in advance, it would be unfair to the farmers who perhaps had gone into tillage, in anticipation of that price holding for two years.  I think there should be no power vested to reduce the price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will take the opportunity to answer some questions: How has he arrived at 25/- as a standard price and 23/6 as the case may be?  He will remember that on a previous debate he was willing to accept the figure of 30/-. On the Second Reading he spoke of changed circumstances&mdash;and I think he almost regrets since what he said&mdash; that 25/- is now to be equivalent to 30/- then.  The Minister made a general statement of that kind.  In what sense would that amount be equivalent, seeing that more or less we are cutting ourselves off from outside.  The outside price of wheat does not come into <Col N="692" /> account, so far as the standard price is concerned.  The point, I presume, is what it would cost to produce that particular barrel of wheat.  How has there been a reduction, between when the Minister spoke of 30/-, and now, when he brings in 25/- and 23/6? What brought about that particular change in the Minister's mind as far as the standard price is concerned? Surely it was not the change in the world price of wheat.  It would be a change internally, to justify what would be the reasonable price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that 30/- would induce farmers to grow wheat.  I gave the costings and I brought out there that the farmers would have enormous profits at 30/- a barrel.  I think 25/- now is justifiable in comparison with other agricultural prices.  That is the real point.  In 1929, when the debate took place, if you took the prices of butter, bacon, cattle&mdash;I do not know about potatoes&mdash;I think it will be realised that they have gone down by at least 80 per cent.  from what they were, so that to take that point about wheat is not unreasonable, taking into account the general prices farmers can expect to get.  It would produce, I think, 25/-, which is fair at the present time.  Of course, that would only be found out by the results of the acreage sown.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister refers to the time when he showed how very attractive a proposition this was, but the Minister will also remember that, on that particular occasion, he painted such an attractive picture that there was no explanation at all as to why farmers got out of growing wheat.  There was, I think, general agreement not that enormous profits would be made on 30/&mdash;I think that even as late as the Second Reading he went on the ground that 30/- then was equivalent to 25/- now&mdash;but his justification now is that all the farmers' prices have fallen.  Farmers have <Col N="693" /> been hit in other directions&mdash;why hit them now?  Has the Minister shown that their costings have gone down? It is on that that the thing must be based, and not on the fact that they are losing in other matters as well, so let them lose here also.  It is on their costings that the standard price ought to be based and the Minister has not shown that their costings have gone down to that extent.</P>

      <P>On their costings in 1929, they could well grow wheat at 25/- a barrel, so far as I can gather from an examination of the costings.  The same question was asked in 1929 as is asked now&mdash;why, if it was so very attractive then, did they not grow it, and it was pointed out, over and over again, that a guaranteed market and a guaranteed price are what are required.</P>

Supposing, as the thing stands in the Bill, there is a price of 16/- and the standard price is 25/-.  The bounty in that case will be 9/-.  Supposing, under the proposition made in the amendment by Deputy McGilligan, the average price was 14/-, the bounty would still be 9/-because it is the higher of the two that is taken.  There would be no increase, therefore, in the bounty in that particular case.  Supposing, on the other hand, the price from 1927 to 1931 is 17/-, the bounty would not be increased in that case either.  It would be diminished, in fact, so I suggest that there is no possible increase of the bounty envisaged under the amendment as it stands.</P>

      <P>I move the three amendments standing in Deputy McGilligan's name:</P>
      <P>In page 32, before Section 69, (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister shall as soon as may be after the commencement of this Part of this Act ascertain as accurately as possible the amount per barrel actually paid for home grown wheat sold during the years 1927-1928, 1929, 1930, 1931, and averaged over these years, and the amount as ascertained by him shall be the ascertained actual price per barrel of home grown wheat for these years.</P>
      <P>In page 32, Section 70 (1), line 31, after the word &ldquo;between&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;either the ascertained actual price per barrel for the years 1927 to 1931, or.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In page 32, Section 70 (1), line 32, after the word &ldquo;barrel&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;whichever is the higher.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will remember our criticism of what seemed to us to be the very unsatisfactory state in which the Bill stands at the moment, namely, <Col N="696" /> as to how the price is to be fixed, as to how he is going to make these calculations and as to when he will make these calculations.  There is nothing definite and, with the distinction between the different kinds of wheat practically vanishing, it is still more difficult.  The Minister spoke, a short time ago, of rings or conspiracies on the part of the maize millers.  As I understand the Bill&mdash;and I should like to be corrected if I am wrong&mdash; there is nothing to prevent the millers of this country offering 10/- instead of 16/- as the price for first class wheat. I take that to be correct.  They can come to an agreement of that kind amongst themselves that will immediately lower the average price. It does not cost the millers anything&mdash; they pay less for what they buy&mdash;and the farmers lose nothing either, because, supposing, in the ordinary way of commerce, the price had been 15/- and, by means of what the Minister would call a conspiracy of that kind it is reduced to 10/-, it is made up by the bounty.  The farmers lose nothing and the millers lose nothing, and it is to the interest, I presume, of the millers to do that.</P>
    <P>The farmers have no reason to protest. They lose nothing.  I think I suggested on Second Reading that the general tendency of the Bill as it stands, and again the fact that if the average is depressed the farmer will lose nothing, must have the effect of gradually depressing prices, because if the average is depressed it is no loss to the seller.  He is not interested in keeping it up.  He is interested in keeping up his own individual price, but he is not interested in keeping up the average price.  I suggest that the country, which is liable for a very considerable subsidy under the Bill, may very well become liable for a great deal more as the Bill now stands.  Whether there are rings formed, or even if the Bill is allowed to operate in the ordinary way of business, I suggest that the amendment standing in the name of Deputy McGilligan is quite reasonable, and that at least the country which is asked to pay the piper so far as the Bill is concerned, should be in a position to know where it stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>To go a little further, let us take a group of farmers supplying one mill.  They know that the mill is bound to take their wheat from them. They know that the miller must take a certain amount of wheat and they know that he will prefer to take it from them rather than from some place some distance away.  They have a certain bargaining power in having that knowledge.  The farmers in each group will be inclined to work collectively and individually to get the best price. The individual in these collections will be trying to get 6d. or 1/- per barrel more so that when the bounty is paid he will be getting more than the standard price.  There will be an effort amongst the farmers to get more than the standard price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Still the general tendency which I have indicated will be there.  There is no incentive so far as the average is concerned.  It is inevitable that there will be a gradual diminution of the price year by year, because the average will go down, and if the average goes down the farmer is not affected.

      <P>Oh, no.  The unfortunate farmers have to sell to somebody once having grown the wheat.  The average price, once it is down, will not hurt the farmer.  They will see that.  The Minister brought <Col N="698" /> forward a point, in answer to me, which is a point that we made on more than one occasion.  He admits that in practice the miller will be confined to the local farmers, and no matter what the quality of the wheat is he will have to take it from them whether it is millable or not.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that it is another point, but that is the difficulty with the Minister.  He has two lines of reasoning which happen to be contradictory.  That is the reason I refer to it now without any excuse. The millers will have to take the wheat whether it is sprouted wheat or not. The miller must be very often practically forced to take it.  What the result will be on the character of the product, or how they can assess the price of it now that the Minister has despaired of laying down any definition of what he means by &ldquo;millable,&rdquo; that is in the sense of wheat that can be milled, I do not know.  I do not see how he can get out of the question of rings.  The farmers are not hit by the rings, if there is a general depression of the average.  The Bill simply brings more money out of the Exchequer and it does not cost the farmer anything.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>What is to happen my unfortunate county in these circumstances?  If these people attempt to grow wheat how are they to dispose of it now?  They had a hope that the miller might be compelled to take it even if it sprouted, because that is what happens to a great deal of the wheat grown in my county.  They cannot dispose of a great deal of that wheat, yet as consumers and taxpayers they are paying for the rest of the country.</P>

Perhaps the Minister could offer some justification for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that there is no desire on my part to engage in flour milling, but it is considered that it might be necessary to have these powers there.  I am not so sure that the Minister could not be held to have these powers already in another case under the Emergency Act of 1926, but it is better to be sure than sorry in these cases. What are we doing?  We are breaking through an organisation that supplied, roughly, one half of the flour required in this country.  That is an importing organisation.  It is true, in theory, that we have power at any time, if the necessity arose, to import flour in order to meet any deficiency in the supply from the existing mills, but in fact the organisation for doing that would not be in existence and could not be very easily brought into existence. If it should happen&mdash;take the extreme case&mdash;that the flour millers of the country, because of some regulation made, or some decision arrived at, decided to go on strike and stop milling flour, it is obvious that we would have to get flour from some <Col N="700" /> place, and it might be much easier to get that flour by keeping the existing mills working even though they were working under the control of the Minister, than to build up an importing organisation which might be able to get supplies from other countries.</P>
      <P>A situation might arise in which there would be extreme practical difficulty in importing flour to meet our requirements.  We are securing to the flour millers here a market but we are, also, making our people as consumers of flour dependent upon the flour millers for those supplies.  If, for any reason, the flour millers decline to keep up the supply it is desirable that we should have power to go in, and keep the mills working until whatever caused the dispute interfering with the supply of flour should terminate. It is not intended to nationalise the flour milling industry, nor is this section devised to facilitate the nationalisation of the flour milling industry. It is intended as a necessary safeguard to have, in view of the fact that a supply of flour is an essential of the country.  And as the supply is an essential of the country, consequently, the operation of the flour mills is an essential, and the State desires to have the power to ensure that they shall operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said it is not intended as the thin end of the wedge, in the way of enforcing nationalisation of the milling industry, but that it is to meet an emergency. If it is intended to meet an emergency only, why not deal with it with emergency legislation?  Why ask the House to pass this objectionable legislation, to deal with a situation which might not arise for a good time to come, and which, if it does arise, could be dealt with by emergency legislation?  Would not that be the proper way to deal with it?  The Minister is asking the House to assent to a principle to which it is opposed and with which it is certainly not enamoured.  The Minister repeated what one of his colleagues said, namely, that he is not keen in asserting this particular power.  If a crisis arises, I suggest, it should be time enough to have it dealt with by emergency legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that the necessity for taking these powers is not quite as clear now as it was at the time the Bill was drafted.  It will be recollected that the flour millers, or some of them, previous to this legislation being introduced, announced themselves as strongly opposed to it.  They modified their opposition since.  But there was a possibility, and there is always the possibility, that we may find some organisation of flour millers or individual flour millers deciding to shut down their mills rather than operate them.  The presence of a section of this kind in the Bill will be a very strong deterrent, and will keep them going instead of shutting down.  That was the reason why this section was framed along those lines.  I think it is desirable, in the circumstasces, that the section should be here.  If we were faced with a situation that nobody would come into the flour milling industry, if we had to contemplate a permanent deficiency in the flour milling capacity, I would not hesitate to say that the State should come in and make up the deficiency, by acquiring the existing mills or building new ones. But that situation, while regarded as a possibility at one time, has ceased since.  I mentioned, on the Committee Stage of this Bill, that if we conceded all the applications to build new mills or to increase the capacity of existing mills, we would probably have double the capacity required in this country. There are any numbers of people desirous of engaging in the flour milling industry and a number of new mills will be built in the future, so we will have no difficulties on that score.  But when devising our present legislation we could not have foreseen that.  I prefer, now, to leave the matter as it is, though it is not intended to operate it except in very exceptional circumstances.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to tie ourselves down to particulars as to how these facts should be secured.  We should like to have the power to vary these matters.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said previously that he would look into the question of adequate costs.  On that occasion I pointed out that the cost of a particular brand of Indian meal which is used for human consumption will be materially increased by the proviso contained in paragraph (iii) of Section 79.  The Minister at that time said that he would look into the question as to whether this brand of Indian meal could be distributed in a larger package or, if necessary, that the package should be a sealed package. I do not know whether that is absolutely necessary for the purpose of the administration of the Act or not. I do know, however, that the usual procedure is that this meal is supplied in hundredweight packages to the distributor, <Col N="706" /> who sells it in quarter or half-stone packages.  I think that the meal sold for human consumption is quite different from the meal sold for animal consumption, and under this section of the Bill the proposed admixture might increase the cost so enormously that it would be economically impossible for the maize miller to sell this particular meal for human consumption.  I should like to know whether the Minister has looked into that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that was looked into in connection with this section of the Bill.  The Deputy raised the point previously, but I think that we could not allow the maize miller to send out the meal to the distributor and allow that distributor to put it into stone bags for sale.  If we did so we would have to hold the maize miller responsible for the disposal of the maize meal, and we would not know whether the mixture in the sealed package was for human or animal consumption.  The maize miller must take the responsibility, but we must have some machinery by which to hold him to his responsibility.</P>
      <P>If we were to allow a maize miller to send, say, a cwt. of pure maize to a retailer and allow the retailer then to divide it up into eight one-stone packets, the inspection would become very much more difficult because the retailer would become subject to inspection also to see that he did not sell more than a one-stone weight.  In the case of a retailer having a cwt. of pure maize in his shop it would be very difficult, I think, to prevent him by law from selling more than a stone weight to any person that might come in.  It would be difficult to see that the law was observed if, say, people were desirous of getting five or six stones from the retailer.  If the law was that only a stone was to be sold, in such case it would be very difficult to see that it was observed.  It would mean, I think, that our system of inspection would be entirely inadequate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is satisfied that it is going to cost the consumer a great deal more, why make this proviso about stone packages at all?  There is no reason why a retailer should not sell a consumer 41 one-stone packages of meal.  He can do that.  Why then make this proviso that is going to increase the cost of this commodity considerably when the Minister is aware of an existing safeguard? He will be told by his advisers, or by any one connected with the trade, that the quality of maize meal which is suitable for human consumption is entirely different from the quality of maize meal which could conceivably compete with the maize meal mixture. Before the introduction of this Bill, the maize meal supplied for consumption by animals sold retail about 6/6 per cwt.  Golden meal, which is the type of maize meal sold for human consumption, sold at about £8 10s. per ton.  There would be a difference of about 2/- per cwt. between the two. I would like the Minister to look into that and satisfy himself on that point. If he is satisfied about the ordinary difference in price between the two commodities, I suggest to him that he ought to see whether that is not a sufficient safeguard without introducing this packet impost.  It may be that circumstances have altered and that the maize meal mixture approaches so closely in price to Golden meal now that a difficulty would arise&mdash;that there would be no price safeguard&mdash;but if he had not that price safeguard, I cannot see that this business of packing the maize meal in stone packages will provide any safeguard against the distribution of the meal for the feeding of animals, except by reason of the price.  I assume that the Minister does not want to raise the price of this commodity for the people who use it as a foodstuff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be extremely difficult to specify any particular type of ground maize that is used for human food and not for any other purpose.  This question of a maize mixture <Col N="708" /> has now been before the public for three or four years.  One of the big objections raised to it was that the poor people, principally in the West. found it convenient to buy a bag of ground maize, out of which they could feed the children, the chickens and the pigs.  That was the principal objection raised to this mixing scheme by people up to this: that the convenience of maize meal to the household in the poorer districts was that they could use the same sack of meal to feed the children, the chickens and the pigs.</P>

I think the point that I have raised is one that deserves the Minister's careful consideration.  It has been my experience that the quality of meal sold for human consumption is entirely different to the meal sold for animal consumption.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister give the House any idea as to what the additional cost to the consumer will be as a result of having the meal put in one stone packages?  First of all it will cause great inconvenience, and secondly there is the question of cost.  It is quite obvious from the provisions of the Bill that there is no limit to the amount that may be bought.  You can buy 3 cwt. under the Bill, the only thing being that it must be made up in one-stone packages. What does the Minister achieve by that to justify the increased cost?  In the case of maize required for human consumption, is he able to give the House any estimate as to what the cost of packing is likely to amount to? The Minister must remember that this will hit the poorer classes of people very severely.  It will also be a grave inconvenience to them.  In the case of people who live a long distance from a town it is practically inevitable <Col N="709" /> that they will buy more than a stone. It would be an inconvenience to them if they did not buy in the quantities that they have been accustomed to. If they do that now it will mean an increased cost to them.</P>
      <P>If there is any foundation for Deputy Dillon's statement, that the meal used for human consumption is entirely different from that used for animal consumption&mdash;that it is dearer than that used for animal food&mdash;what is the justification for putting this increased cost on the public, and on the poorer sections of the public particularly? Apart from the question as to whether there is such a distinction, this will undoubtedly inflict hardship.  A large number of people in my constituency use this particular kind of food for making bread, and if they are compelled now to buy it in stone packets, instead of half a sack at a time, it will undoubtedly be a distinct disadvantage to them as well as a great inconvenience and an unjustifiable cost so far as they are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question raised about the increased cost, of course the scheme has not been working very long.  It is very hard to get any sort of a settled cost.  It has been reported that the cost will be about 2/- or 4/- per cwt.  It is sometimes as low as 2/-, but has never gone above 4/-.  That would be, or about, 3d. or 6d. a stone of an increase.  I think, however, that will not last because certain maize millers will, I am sure, go in for this business and cut prices a bit when they go in for it properly.  Deputies must see that it would be impossible to work the Bill if we allowed pure maize free for human consumption.  We must control it in some way.  When the mixing scheme was first introduced, the question of the meal used for human consumption in Kerry and some parts of the West was raised and it was thrown out as a sop that it should be put in stone bags.  Some such method as that must be adopted.  I think it would be dangerous to make provision for selling more than a stone.  Of course, a person can buy a ton of pure maize if he wants to, in stone bags.  That, of course, <Col N="710" /> would not be an economic proposition for feeding pigs because the price is raised to a certain extent.  It is necessary to raise the price slightly in order to put it above the ordinary foodstuff; otherwise the whole scheme goes.</P>
      <P>I have already mentioned to Deputy O'Sullivan that in his constituency a complaint was made to me that they were using pure maize with white oats without knowing it.  When they found it out they objected strongly, not on the ground that it tasted badly, that they got gripes or anything like that, but wholly because they had been more or less cheated and because they had a definite prejudice.  I think that was the principal complaint.  After some time the need for pure maize may not be necessary at all.  There is one thing that it is possible to do, and that is to put No. 3 under the prescribed regulations. That, of course, has relation to weight, and we might try to raise it to two stones and see if that would be feasible.  We might have to go back to one stone if two stones are considered too high.</P>

      <P>One of my principal objections to this Bill is founded on this section.  It hits my constituency pretty hard, as the Minister now admits.  There is a very strong objection to it there.  I do not know if, in the west, maize is used for human consumption, but it is certainly used in Kerry.  Down there the people are hit also because of the unsuitability of the climate for wheat-growing purposes. Now they are hit by this section. The Minister stated that the deliberate raising of the price is a necessary part of the machinery of this Bill. It is not merely an accident that the price is raised; the price is deliberately raised in order to make the Bill work. The price is raised on the poor consumer so that the Bill may operate. There is a very strong objection to this part of the Bill in particular.</P>

It would seem as if it is the object of the Minister to make Golden meal, which is used for human consumption, prohibitively expensive.  By making it so dear he will prohibit people from getting it.  If that is the object of the Bill&mdash;to make the foodstuff of the poorest classes of the community too dear&mdash;then I am afraid it will be further jeopardised.  I will ask the Minister to keep an open mind on this question and to examine it more closely in order to see if it cannot be made operative without interfering with the supplies of people who habitually use this meal for their own consumption.

      <P>I beg to move amendment 125:</P>
      <P>In page 36, before Section 79 (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:</P>
      <P>(2) The provisions of this sub-section shall not apply to Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke about a certain meal being used for human consumption and he said that it differed from the meal used for animal feeding. There is a brand of yellow or Golden meal that is better and more expensive than the ordinary stuff used for feeding animals.  So far as I understand, this meal is very extensively used in County Donegal.  The same meal is used there for human consumption as is given to animals.  The reason I suggest this amendment is <Col N="712" /> because the Bill tends to impose a burden on the very poor people.  I have made extensive inquiries into this matter and I find that when this meal is mixed with flour it makes very good bread.  It is also used very generally for making porridge and that is regarded as the staple food of the poor people, of whom there are large numbers in the county.  The effect of this Bill will be to increase the retail price of yellow meal from £5 15s. 4d. to £10 per ton.  That is utterly indefensible and some scheme will have to be devised to avoid that course.</P>
    <P>If the Minister carries this proposal, it will have to be changed at some future date.  The proposal is utterly inhuman. It is outrageous that we who represent the people should assemble here and impose upon poor people, who cannot defend themselves, a burden to the extent of £4 5s. a ton on a commodity they use freely.  It is an outrageous tax on the very article of food that constitutes an important portion of their diet.  During the last twenty-two years there have been only three good harvests.  Last season was a bumper season.  In the other lean years this yellow meal was the staple food of many of the poor people.  It is now suggested that we should meekly submit to a tax of £4 5s. a ton on the staple food of these unfortunate people.  I will oppose such a proposal strongly and I will wreck it if I can.  It is absolutely intolerable that the poor people should be asked to pay this outrageous tax.  When this meal is mixed with flour it is quite good for feeding purposes&mdash;it is excellent stuff.</P>
    <P>An attempt is made to put a heavy tax on this meal and I consider that attempt is nothing but an outrage. There is no use in describing this effort on the part of the Government in mild language.  It is a sheer outrage, particularly at a time like the present when so much distress exists, and when the purchasing power of the people has been reduced.  I will ask the Minister to hold this matter over until he has had consultations with responsible people.  He should try to devise some other scheme that will avoid such an enormous tax on the poor people.</P>

      <P>Not quite so much.  A price of £10 for Indian meal at the present time is a price that astonishes me.  If the people are paying that price, as Deputy McMenamin states, the Minister would nearly make a convert to the Price Control Bill.  I should not be surprised to hear that they were paying £8.  The Minister seemed to be surprised that Deputy McMenamin compared a ton with a stone of meal. If the Minister knew the Indian meal trade as well as I do, he would realise that there is nothing to marvel at in that.  If Indian meal is selling at £8 per ton, any person can buy a stone of Indian meal for 1s. 1d. or 1s. 2d.  Indian meal is sold retail at a very narrow margin of profit.  Frequently, it is sold wholesale at no profit at all. The mill gets the profit, the wholesaler gets a discount and the retailer may get ½d. or 1d. per stone.  I agree entirely with what Deputy McMenamin said, that Indian meal, in one form or another, is very extensively used in Donegal as a foodstuff, particularly in the poorest localities.  It is in the very poor localities that the ordinary Indian meal would be used.  I thought that the finer product would be used in the other areas to which Deputy McMenamin referred.  I think the case made by Deputy McMenamin should give the Minister cause to pause.  I think he should make careful investigations immediately to ascertain if this Bill is calculated to increase the cost over a widespread area on the lines Deputy McMenamin indicates and if he is satisfied that this Bill is going to increase the cost of the staple foodstuff of the poorest section of the community in the congested areas, I think he will have to reconsider his position.  I doubt very much if the members of his own Party, representing these counties, would be prepared to support him in putting that tax upon the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I entirely concur with Deputy <Col N="715" /> McMenamin in his description of the circumstances under which these people live.  It is very little known in the eastern parts of this country that Indian meal, in one form or another, is the staple article of diet in these districts.  Indian meal porridge enters into the everyday diet of these people and, in many cases, they cannot afford oatmeal porridge.  In the portions which are better off, oatmeal porridge is used.  But in large parts of Donegal and in the western parts of Connacht, Indian meal is the staple article of diet of the people.  Before one starts out to increase the price of a commodity like that, one ought to exhaust every conceivable possibility.  What I ask the Minister to do now is to approach this question with a full appreciation of its gravity and, between now and the Report Stage, to try, with the assistance of his officials, to devise a scheme whereby these people will be spared extra expense in respect of a commodity which is their staple food.</P>

      <P>I think that the House will recognise that the increase of price is portion of the necessary machinery of the Bill, according to the Minister.  The increase in the price of this meal, used as a human food, is a necessary portion of the machinery and there is no use in the House blinding itself to the fact. The Minister has made clear that it is a portion of the machinery and if that increase is not brought about by this particular method of marketing the product, then he fears this particular portion of the Bill will fail.  So far as this portion of the Bill is concerned, it is so bad and it affects these people so seriously that it is better it should fail than that this provision should be passed.</P>

I have not the slightest desire to trip him up.  There is the compulsion on the miller to put this meal into a stone bag.  If the Minister will throw his mind back he will find that this all arose out of the request by me that he would allow the millers to consign the stuff to the retailers and let the retailers pack it in whatever quantity called for.  That is how it arose.  To compel the millers to pack it, not in a paper bag, but in a cloth bag, in stones, or less, will greatly increase the cost and make the working of the Bill difficult. The thing is full of pitfalls and I strongly counsel the Minister to leave the matter over for Report Stage and investigate it fully in the meantime.

      <P>This section was considered fully before it was introduced. It has been considered on the Committee Stage and again on this stage. As far as the Department of Agriculture and myself are concerned, we gave it a great deal of thought and we cannot do much better I am afraid.  When Deputy McMenamin talks about maize being sold at £5 15s. 4d. he certainly bears out Deputy Dillon when he says that there is very little margin in maize, because it would appear from our own imports during the month of October that, landed at the port, maize was at least worth £5 per ton.  I do not know if it is possible that in an inland town like that maize could be sold at £5 15s. 4d., taking that into account.  Certainly if you take less than a ton it could not be sold at that rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davis</NameTxt>
      <P>Pure maize meal would be £5 10s.  As a result of packing it in 14 lb. bags, the price per ton is £7. That is the wholesale price.  The retail <Col N="718" /> price is £7 10s.  Therefore, the difference between £5 10s. and the price when packed in 14 lb. bags is £1 10s. per ton.  You may refer to the fact that the mixture is being sold at £6 per ton, but that is the wholesale price, the miller's price.  The difference is accounted for by the extra labour in packing maize meal in 14 lb bags.  The extra cost for 14 lb. cotton bags is considerable.  You can investigate these facts for yourself by referring the matter to the Department or to any miller who is milling maize meal, and at the same time producing the admixture with 10 per cent. of barley, oats or rye in the town of Ballina.  I think the investigation will verify what I have said.</P>

      <P>In page 36, Section 79 (2), line 21, to delete the figure &ldquo;I&rdquo; and substitute therefor the figure &ldquo;III.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Some of the Deputies have already referred to the fact that the punishment suggested in the Bill, measured by a fine of £100, is altogether out of proportion to the offence.  If one acts on the dictum of making the punishment fit the crime, surely the offence might more easily and equitably be met by the insertion of the figure I have suggested.

      <P>Amendment 127 not moved.</P>
      <P>The following amendments stood on the Order Paper:</P>
      <P>128.  In page 36, Section 80 (1), to delete in line 23 the word &ldquo;all&rdquo; and to delete paragraphs (b) and (c) and substitute the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b) if the weight of maize meal mixture is one hundredweight or more, there is indicated in the prescribed manner on such package particulars of the percentage by weight of each of the component parts of such mixture.&mdash;(Aire Talmhaíochta.)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="723" /> 129.  In page 36, Section 80 (1), to delete all words after the word &ldquo;unless,&rdquo; line 23, to the end of the sub-section, line 31, and substitute the words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) such maize mixture is contained in a package, and</P>
    <P>(b) if the weight of the maize meal in such package is not less than one hundredweight, such package bears a label stating that the contents comply with the requirements of the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act, 1932, in regard to home-grown cereals.&mdash; (Deputies O'Neill and O'Donovan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the amendment in my name covers both.  Again, this is a point where we would prescribe a certain procedure and make it as easy as possible on the trade&mdash;probably by label or something of that nature&mdash;and see that that would be sufficient to meet requirements.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am seeking to do the same thing in this amendment as I sought in <Col N="724" /> amendment 126.  I would again suggest to the Minister that that fine is altogether out of proportion to the offence.  Whilst I admit that it allows of a fine of something below £100, I do feel that if he were a little more definite in the Bill with regard to fixing a fine, the working of the Bill would be facilitated.  I again suggest that the Minister might see his way to reduce that fine somewhat, and that in the case of a first offence a fine not exceeding £25 and in the case of a second or any subsequent offence a fine not exceeding £50 might be substituted for Part I of the First Schedule.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Whilst the Minister is cogitating on that, do I read Section 80 aright when I get the meaning from it that you cannot sell less than a hundredweight of maize meal mixture to any one individual?  Sub-section (1) says: &ldquo;It shall not be lawful for any person to sell or offer for sale any maize meal mixture unless all the following conditions are complied with, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) such maize meal mixture is contained in the package, and</P>

No. 7 in the Third Schedule reads: &ldquo;All food for the use of horses, mules, jennets, asses cattle, sheep, swine, goats or poultry.&rdquo; Is there any list going to be published as to what these things are, or how is the public to know what the Department will hold to be material for the feeding of these animals?  Then you go on to say: &ldquo;Articles of the nature of a food or medicine for internal use, for the use of horses, mules, jennets, asses, cattle, sheep, swine, goats or poultry, which pass in commerce under the designation of a proprietary or protected trade name.&rdquo;  That is perfectly sensible, because the final paragraph, &ldquo;which pass in commerce under the designation of a proprietary or protected trade name,&rdquo; clearly warns everybody of what is required under this Act, but No. 7 in the Third Schedule is so vague that I think it will give very great difficulty in administration.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will realise that it would be very difficult to specify everything.  There are certain foods which if we specified by name might easily have their names changed.  Under the powers we have at present we have been asked to license the import of mill sweepings and other things which should not be allowed into this country and passed off as food.  There is a certain name for these things at present.  We have not allowed these things to go in.  If we were to put them all down by name it would be very easy to change the name and get them in in spite of our Schedule so we may hit them badly by a fairly general description.</P>

      <P>If the Minister stated no feeding stuffs which contained cereals or molasses or a series of products of that character that would immediately give an opportunity to any trader to put a question to the consignor.  He could say: &ldquo;I want to order such and such a thing from you.  Does it contain treacle, cereals or so forth?&rdquo;  If it did then he would know he should approach the Department of Agriculture and get a licence and have it ready, so that the thing would not be held up at the port of entry.  But here nobody knows, until notice is received from the port, whether it is necessary to get a licence or not.  I think that will create great inconvenience.  If the Minister could see his way to prepare a Schedule along those lines and show <Col N="728" /> the list of feeding stuffs containing cereals, treacle, oil and so forth it would be a very valuable guiding line for traders in the ordinary course of trade.</P>

      <P>Of course, the power we have taken in this is to schedule feeding stuffs as far as possible so as to meet that point.  Sub-section (2) of Section 87 reads: &ldquo;The Minister for Agriculture may by order under this section declare that any article (not being already a scheduled feeding stuff) shall be a scheduled feeding stuff for the purpose of this Part of this Act and whenever any such order is made the article to which such order relates shall be a scheduled feeding stuff for the purposes of this Part of this Act.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce would be more concerned with the importation of certain things mentioned here.  The importation of bread and buns appears to be rather difficult to prescribe. There would be other things in the second part.  &ldquo;Any scheduled feeding stuff&rdquo; would be rather difficult because in the manufacture of compound feeding stuffs it is sometimes necessary to allow in a quantity of &ldquo;scheduled feeding stuff.&rdquo;  You have also articles necessary for other purposes, such as barley and malted barley, which it might not be difficult to prescribe.  Taking everything into account I think it would be difficult to provide for all eventualities.</P>

    <P>Before the Minister for Industry and Commerce compulsorily acquires any potential flour mill he shall serve on the owner there of a notice requiring such owner to sell any such potential flour mill either by private treaty or by public auction within a period of three calendar months, and if within such period the owner of such potential flour mill shall find a purchaser therefor the Minister shall grant to such purchaser, if a national of Saorstát Eireann or an Irish owned body corporate, a milling licence subject only to the statutory condition referred to in Section 20 of this Act and to the further condition that milling shall be commenced at such mill within a period of not more than twelve months after the grant of such licence, and on the grant of any such licence the mill shall cease to be a potential flour mill.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;All losses incurred in carrying on any business under this Part of this Act shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sting of this Bill is in the tail. It appears to me the Minister is not justified in asking the taxpayers to accept his inexperienced and amateur knowledge to run the mills of this country.  Similar power may be asked by other Ministers in regard to other industries if this power is given to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on this occasion.  It seems to me to be an entirely wrong principle that the Minister should approach the Dáil and ask for power to run a certain class of business in this country, particularly a business, which, the Minister himself admits, is run on most efficient lines.  If that business was allowed to run in competition among its members it would continue to be run on efficient lines in the future.  The Minister has admitted that it is rapidly becoming more efficient, while it has competition both at home and from outside.  It is inevitable, of course, that the taxpayers <Col N="737" /> will have to bear a very big loss in consequence of the powers the Minister is taking if he attempts to exercise them.  I hope, for the sake of the taxpayers, he will never exercise those powers, because if he does the State will have to bear a very big loss. I do not want to labour the point.  The amendment proposes to eliminate the sub-section which provides that the money lost upon this enterprise if the Minister does embark upon it should be paid out of funds provided by the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading.  Since the present Government came into office, in March last, representations have been made from various parts of the country with regard to the scarcity of seeds for the purposes of the spring sowing.  It was felt that it would be well to enable local bodies to meet necessitous cases, <Col N="738" /> in their areas, by enabling them to promote a scheme for the supplying of seeds for oats and seed potatoes to small farmers in need of such facilities, the cost to be recovered after the harvesting is completed.  County councils throughout the country were requested to consider the position locally, and where the need existed to enable the farmers to obtain seed supplies, to make arrangements accordingly.  The county councils were authorised to arrange with merchants for the supply of seed potatoes and oats, on loan terms, pending the harvesting of the crops.  When an application was accepted by the county council the order was sent to the merchant who would be named by the applicant in his application, and from whom the applicant arranged to receive delivery of the seeds, having filled up the application on a prescribed form, guaranteeing to the county council the repayment of the cost of the seeds.  The seed supplies were undertaken on this basis in about 20 counties in all; the total amount of advances of credit facilities arrangements involved approximately £25,000 The supply scheme has been strictly limited to necessitous cases, which were comparatively small, in each of the areas.  In connection with the seed supplies of barley, oats and potatoes and also supplies of fertilisers, forms undertaking repayment were signed by the recipients in all cases. The recipients are responsible, in every case, for their share of interest on the money borrowed and any administrative expenses.  The undertakings provided for repayment on harvesting on 31st December, 1932.  It is anticipated that portion of the money will still be outstanding on 31st December, 1932, and it is desired to provide for recovery with the poor rate levies of 1933 and 1934.  The Bill makes such provision.</P>

      <P>The Bill proposes to validate the sales of seeds and fertilisers by county councils and to give legal authority to agreements made by such local bodies with any occupier to obtain seeds and fertilisers.  Provision <Col N="739" /> is made in the Bill to ensure that the obtaining of seeds is not to be regarded as particularly belonging to a local body.  Various things already done are proposed to be validated, and provision is made for the recovery of sums already given under the agreement.  It is proposed, under the Bill, to validate the borrowing of such sums.  It was intended originally to find means for the recovery of sums advanced in that way, but in point of fact no such provision was made.  It is felt that legislation of a permanent character may not be desirable for the purpose of empowering local authorities to proceed with supplies in areas when the necessity for supplementing individual effort might be found to be necessary. That matter is under consideration at the moment, and the Minister hopes to be able to introduce a Bill early in the new year giving the local bodies the necessary powers to get these facilities which are proposed to be validated under this Bill.  The present Bill, as Deputies will observe, deals entirely with the legislation of the loan facilities already put into operation in connection with the supply of seeds.</P>

      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second time.  It gives effect, as far as the schedules are concerned, to the Resolutions which have already been before the House.  In addition, it makes one or two additional provisions to which, I think, it might be desirable to draw the attention of the Dáil.  The first of these is provided for in Section 7 of the Bill.  The object of this provision is to exempt from customs duties cinematograph films made outside the Saorastát when Saorstát residents organise the production and the producer and a majority of the persons engaged in the production are Saorstát nationals or are resident ordinarily in the Saorstát.  It also makes provision to exempt from customs duty cinematograph films made wholly or for the most part in the Saorstát when the majority of persons employed in the production are nationals or ordinary residents of the Saorstát.  Hitherto, exemption was granted to negatives of films produced anywhere when the organisers and the producer and principal artists were Saorstát nationals resident in the Saorstát, but this concession was found to be valueless owing to the absence of any film printing industry in this country.  On the other hand, cases have arisen where the negative was produced entirely in this country by Saorstát residents and the copies (positives) were printed abroad and these were chargeable with duty on return for showing here.  Obviously, this was a hardship.  The provision in this section will remove it and will help persons who take small films in their home surroundings and send the negatives abroad for the ordinary printing of the negatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 8 authorises the repayment of duty in certain cases.  This section is designed to alleviate a case of hardship which was brought to the notice of the Department of Finance by the Department of Agriculture.  In January last a duty was imposed on bacon for the first time at a rate varying for non-Commonwealth <Col N="743" /> countries with the price of bacon, imports from the Commonwealth being untaxed.  The duty on American bacon in July last was, approximately, 15/- a cwt., and this was the position when the Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 1) Order, 1932, was made.  This Order imposed a duty of 84/- a cwt. on all pigs' meat, except pigs' heads and pigs' feet, where the duty was at the rate of 42/- a cwt; the Commonwealth preference rate was 56/- per cwt., and 28/- per cwt. for pigs' heads and pigs' feet.</P>
    <P>Remembering the circumstances in which this duty was imposed it will be quite clear that it came as a surprise. The earlier duty had been to a large extent ineffective, and importers had continued to bring in consignments and were, apparently, of opinion that no change in the duty was to be anticipated. Messrs. Looney and Company of Limerick were on the point of importing a quantity of American bacon which they had bought and paid for at Liverpool, but the consignment did not actually arrive in the Saorstát until after the duty had been increased.</P>
    <P>In connection with this particular case, I should like to emphasise that the Department of Finance does not admit the principle that consignments in transit at a time when import duties are imposed, or are increased, should be admitted free of the increase. It had refused an application made by Messrs. Looney in January last for the exemption of a consignment actually in transit on the ground that the company had notice that an application for a duty on bacon was being examined by the Tariff Commission and should have taken steps not to be caught heavily committed on imports. The circumstances, therefore, in the present case are rather exceptional. No notice of a probable increase was given.  The amount of the increase was exceptionally severe, not more severe than the circumstances warranted, however, and there was no possibility of the company reimbursing itself in any way.  As the long-run protective effect of the duty would not be materially diminished by allowing this <Col N="744" /> consignment to be imported, it was agreed, on representations made by the Department of Agriculture, to grant a concession.</P>
    <P>In the first Order imposed, however, under the Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 1) Order, 1932, it was found that no licensing clause had been included, and though steps were taken to have an amending order made conferring on the Minister such licensing power, the Department was advised that it could not be retrospective and that legislation would be necessary to enable the bacon to be imported without payment of the additional duty.  To have delayed importation until this legislation had been enacted would have involved complete deterioration of the bacon, and it was, accordingly, arranged that if Messrs.  Looney and Company imported the consignment and paid the full duty due under the Emergency Order power would be sought from the Oireachtas for the additional duty to be repayable.</P>
    <P>On this understanding the company imported the consignment and paid the duty.  The amount of duty payable on the consignment at the rate of 15/- per cwt., applicable since January last, would have been £289 10s., while the increased rates would have involved a payment of £1,621 4s., so that the increased amount that had to be paid was £1,331 14s.  The import value of the consignment was £1,262. If the concession had not been granted Messrs. Looney would not have imported the bacon because by importing it they would have lost more than if they had not imported and had not been able to dispose of it in any way.  On the other hand, if they had not been permitted to import it, if some undertaking of the sort mentioned had not been given to them, the Revenue would have lost a sum of £289 10s., and Messrs. Looney and Company would have lost £1,262.</P>
    <P>The position which we are now seeking to put the company in is that in view of the extraordinary circumstances under which the importation was made, in view of the fact that no notice had been given of the proposed emergency duty, and in view of the <Col N="745" /> fact that if the licensing clause had been embodied in the original order Messrs. Looney would undoubtedly have been permitted to import the bacon, it seems to us that the case being clearly one in which that licensing power would have been exercised, the Dáil should confer the authority which we are now asking and permit us to repay the sum of £1,331 14s. to the importers of this particular consignment of bacon.</P>
    <P>Section 9 amends in some minor ways several provisions of the Finance Act of 1932.  These are mentioned in the second column of the Third Schedule.  The first of these amendments, Reference No. 1, is an amendment to Section 16 of the Act.  The amendment is sought in order to admit, as hitherto, without payment of duty, such articles as musical instruments of comparatively small value.  The power was given in 1915 and was renewed from year to year since, until the duty was made permanent this year.  This provision was not originally included, but it was felt it should have been. Reference No. 2 makes preparations of malt extract and cod liver oil liable to a package duty of 1d. per pint, with a minimum charge of 2d.  Reference No. 3 exempts from package duty single gelatine capsules, leaving any quantity of those articles imported in a package under 7 lbs. in weight liable to the said duty at the statutory rate of 1d. per lb., minimum 2d.  Reference No. 4 repeals the duty on stone as formerly described, a new description for assessment being included in this Bill. Reference Nos. 5, 7 and 9 are necessary in order to grant exemption from all duty in respect of blankets made of cotton.  Reference No. 6 makes the alterations indicated in the scope of the linen piece goods and woven textile goods duty.  Reference No. 8 is a corollary to the revised duty on articles of wood set forth in the First Schedule of the Bill.  Reference No. 10 gives effect to the alteration in the wood smoking pipe duty.  Reference Nos. 11, 12, 13 and 14 are consequent on the changes in classification or rating made in duties on roof felting, lead, cordage and plaster of Paris.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the alterations <Col N="746" /> of duty set forth in the Fourth Schedule of the Bill.  These have all been covered by the Financial Resolutions that were recently before the House.  Reference No. 1 applies a preferential rate of 6d. per lb. to cut flowers of British origin.  Reference No. 2 applies a duty of 21/- per cwt. to potatoes of British origin.  Reference No. 3 provides for the exemption of rubber soles and heels for boots which are to be fitted to boots after they are finished and ready for wear. It also provides power to readmit, without payment of duty, boots, etc., which are returned to this country. Reference No. 4 provides for exemption of small household shovels, such as fire shovels.  Reference No. 5 provides exemption for motifs, crests and badges, exemption for such articles as electricians' gloves, smoke helmets, gas masks, etc., and it enables articles of clothing returned from abroad to be admitted without a second charge of duty.  Reference No. 6 exempts certain classes of small brushes.  Reference No. 7 extends to single proofed cloth an exemption which applied only to the double texture proofed variety.  Reference No. 8 frees castors from duty and re-enacts the exemption of patent cleaners and parts thereof.  Paragraphs (d), (e), (f) and (g) remove certain items in the category of furniture duty which are now covered by the category of articles wholly or mainly of wood. Reference No. 9 refers to parts of horse-drawn vehicles.  This duty is reimposed in a modified form.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned that an alteration has been made in the description of stone.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce will remember that on a previous occasion I drew attention to the fact that large quantities of Portland stone and Bath stone are imported into this market. They come in a rough state and are then worked.  Before they leave the quarry they are roughly squared&mdash;what is known in the trade as scappled on the surface; they are not sawn on the surface.  That might be held by the Revenue Commissioners to be a form of labour.  The Minister promised that he would look into that matter.  I <Col N="747" /> would be glad to know if that stone will be subject to any duty by reason of that labour on the surface.  The stone is imported in considerable quantities.</P>
      <P>Another matter I would like some information about relates to planing timber.  I pointed out to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on another occasion that it was usual in this market to import floorings and sheetings dressed or planed on the surface.  It was the intention of the Minister to put a duty on such dressed timber with the object of having the dressing done here.  I pointed out to the Minister that the rough timber which is used in other places where the dressing is done locally is not imported into this market.  I also drew his attention to the fact that this rough timber can only be imported&mdash;if we are to get it at the ordinary rates at which it is imported into other markets&mdash;at certain seasons by reason of the fact that the ports from which it comes are very largely ice-bound at certain periods of the year.  The Minister undertook to look into the matter and I am sure he did so.  I would be glad to have from him the result of his inquiries.  I would also be glad to learn from him what information he has to give the House with regard to the setting up of these special machines.  It was pointed out by Deputy Dockrell&mdash;I am sorry the Deputy is not here&mdash;that these machines would take some considerable time to instal.  By reason of the size of the machine, a considerable amount of timber is necessary in order that it may run economically.  I should like to know the result of the Minister's inquiries into that aspect of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further question was raised on the Schedule as to lead goods.  The Schedule only refers to sheet lead and lead piping.  I understand that other items in which piping and sheet lead are used have been stopped by the Customs.  Whether that was the intention or not, I have not been able to find out but, as it appears on the Schedule, the duty applies only to sheet lead and lead piping.  If it is intended that that should have a wider <Col N="748" /> meaning, some information would be desirable as to the extent to which it is to apply.</P>
    <P>If it is permissible, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the extraordinary delays that are taking place in the Customs.  One hears from business men widespread complaints as to the way work is held up and business interfered with by the delays in the Customs.  We are approaching the time of year when business is usually more brisk than at other times and it is very essential that any effort which can be made now to expedite the passage of goods through the Customs should be made.  I am sure that the Minister has had complaints, as we have all had complaints, about these delays.  If anything can be done, it ought to be done to help business at the present time.</P>

      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to hardship inflicted on some importers of small articles used in advertising.  Small articles of cutlery, such as penknives, were ordered about three months ago or earlier.  Their manufacture took a considerable time owing to the fact that advertising inscriptions had to be placed upon them.  At the time of ordering the people concerned got, I understand, an undertaking that no duty would be imposed on these articles.  The articles have arrived at the port now and the people who ordered them find that they are being called upon to pay the duty.  The Customs authorities say that, as cutlery, these articles are liable to duty. But they are not cutlery in the ordinary sense, because they are to be given away as advertisements.  It is hard lines on the agents who ordered these goods that they should be left on their hands.  They cannot be sold or returned. They are a special line and those who ordered them find themselves in a very awkward position.  If it is possible for the Minister to make an exception in such cases, I think it would be only fair to do so.</P>

The <Col N="749" /> work involved in roughly squaring stone is not regarded as making the stone come within the description of &ldquo;worked stone.&rdquo;  The Deputy can be easy in his mind as regards that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the description to make that clear.</P>

      <P>The interpretation put upon that expression &ldquo;worked stone&rdquo; is stone definitely worked for use.  In the case of planed or dressed timber the position is somewhat as the Deputy stated.  At the present time, we are issuing licences for the importation of planed or dressed timber to those who are engaged in the saw-milling trade and who have undertaken to instal the necessary machinery for the doing of that work here in the future.  In certain cases licences were also issued to other persons who had cargoes shipped at the time the duty was imposed because of our desire to avoid hardship being inflicted upon those people.  For a period which we fixed&mdash;up to the end of this month&mdash; the normal quantity of planed and dressed timber will be imported, subject to that one condition, that persons who will be importing it as merchants, or persons who will not be installing machinery, and, consequently, will not be in a position to supply planed or dressed timber in the future are not getting these licences.  There is an exception in the case of Donegal, where, as Deputies are aware, certain abnormal conditions exist.  A question was raised as to whether it is possible at this time of the year to get supplies of the rough timber.  On that matter, we will have full information before the present period of the licences expires. If it is found definitely that suitable timber cannot be secured until the ports in the exporting countries are free of ice, the licensing arrangement will continue until supplies of the raw timber are available.  On the question of sheet lead and piping, if duty is being demanded on articles in which sheet lead or lead piping is incorporated, it is not being done correctly. If particular instances are brought to my attention I shall arrange to see that the articles are cleared free of duty and the practice will definitely be <Col N="750" /> stopped.  Duty is chargeable only on sheet lead and lead piping as such.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the raw material.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As to the Deputy's remarks concerning Customs delays, it was, of course, inevitable that when a large number of additional duties were imposed, certain delays and certain confusion would arise in consequence of the fact that the staff available to the Revenue Commissioners was not adequate to the new duties imposed and largely due to the fact that persons who had not heretofore to bother about Customs duties were not experienced in the best way of getting their goods cleared.  A large number of delays were due entirely to the fact that importers were not familiar with the correct procedure.  They were themselves the cause of the delay.  That is gradually disappearing and I think we have reached, or are very near, the point where no more than the normal delay will occur.  No doubt, difficult cases will arise from time to time in which delays will necessarily occur because of the necessity of getting an authoritative decision from responsible officers as to whether a particular consignment of goods is dutiable or not. But in regard to classes of goods in respect of which decisions have already been given, unusual delays should not occur.</P>
      <P>As to the point raised by Deputy Goulding, I am afraid nothing can be done.  The duty imposed upon cutlery is a small duty, largely designed for revenue purposes.  It is naturally collectible upon knives imported for distribution as advertisements as well as upon knives imported for distribution by way of sale.  It would be almost impossible to get an amendment in the Finance Act which would enable a distinction to be drawn between cutlery imported for one purpose and cutlery imported for another.  Consequently, no concession is possible in that connection.  The duty is only ten per cent. and I doubt if that can be regarded as very onerous on those who are in a position to give away penknives free for advertising purposes.</P>

      <P>I do not know to what duty the Deputy is referring.  It is possible that he is referring to an Emergency Duty and not a duty imposed under the Finance Act this year.  However, I suggest that the Deputy should send particulars of the case he has in mind. In the case of an Emergency Duty, there would be a certain discretionary power exercisable by the Minister for Finance if undue hardship was being caused.  However, I could not say what can be done in the absence of all the facts.</P>
