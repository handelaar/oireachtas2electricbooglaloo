      <P>The Saorstát delegates to the Ottawa Conference will embark at Belfast.  It was considered desirable that the delegates should reach the Canadian capital some time in advance of the opening of the Conference.  The liner was selected which would enable this to be done most conveniently.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that the unemployment existing in Bandon, Co.

      <P>I understand that the industrial position in Bandon is being considered by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, <Col N="1702" /> who is making a statement on the matter in reply to two questions on the Order Paper to-day.  The necessity for special provision out of Relief Grants for public works in Bandon has not so far been brought to my notice by the local authorities concerned, but the needs of the Bandon area will certainly be considered in connection with the distribution of any grants to be allocated towards relief works in Cork County.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the Deputy's two questions together.</P>
      <P>The work done on the roads at Ballybane and Behaugh five years ago consisted of the repair and widening of portions of old roads serving a number of tenants.  The work was done out of moneys then available for the relief of unemployment and not out of Land Commission funds.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission have received local representations regarding the need for the construction of a road at Kealties, Durrus, out of relief funds.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Deputy should wait an announcement as to the Department which will deal with the funds now being provided for relief of unemployment and address applications to the appropriate quarter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that persons insured against unemployment in Great Britain are not entitled to unemployed benefit in Saorstát Eireann in respect of the contributions paid for them in Great Britain.  Protracted efforts to arrive at reciprocal <Col N="1705" /> arrangements by virtue of which contributions paid in the one country would entitle the persons for whom they were paid to unemployment benefits in the other have up to the present proved fruitless.  I have recently endeavoured to re-open the question and am considering whether any further measures are possible which might offer greater prospects of success than those already taken.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his efforts to bring about the sale of the Maize Mills of Messrs.

      <P>I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>I regret to say the efforts made to secure the continued operation of the mill referred to have up to the present proved unsuccessful.  The mill is, I understand, offered for sale and there is no reason to believe that it may not be purchased.  In view, however, of the unemployment position in Bandon, which has been aggravated by the closing of the mill, I am having the possibility of providing employment in that town examined, and no available opportunity will be missed of directing the attention of interested parties to the facilities there available for industrial enterprises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The mill has not been forced to close down.  It has been closed by the proprietor, who, I understand, is ill, and who has been unable to make any arrangements for the carrying on of the business.</P>

Approximately 140 such claims have been inquired into since 1st April last and, in these cases, it is anticipated that the valuers will be in a position to enter into negotiations relative to the compensation within three weeks.  It is not possible for me at this stage to say how long it will take to dispose finally of all claims, as the process of investigation involves a number of factors which are outside the control of my Department but no avoidable delay will occur.</P>

We are especially glad at the wonderful reception accorded to the Pope's representative by the people; and the Government, feeling that the people desire that they should do everything possible to show respect and esteem for the Papal Legate, have had the honour to extend to his Eminence and his suite the hospitality of the State in respect of the journey from Dublin to London next Sunday. The representative of the Holy Father has graciously accepted this offer.</P>

      <P>Is there any prospect of getting agreement to terminate the Report Stage of this Bill in an hour? There was an agreement to terminate the Committee Stage on Friday, the 17th June, and to dispose of the amendments by 2 p.m. that day.  The amendments had not been disposed of and all these amendments have been put down again for the Report Stage.  This is a departure from the agreement then made.

      <P>There are the usual channels through which to make proposals of that sort and I deprecate any departure from established precedent in that connection.  May I say that I do not accept the statement that, on Friday, the 17th June, there was an understanding that the Committee Stage of the Bill then in progress would be taken with amendments by 2 p.m.  I think that statement has been challenged by Deputy McGilligan and I think it is unwise and imprudent to introduce a discordant note such as that, especially when one is looking for a concession.</P>

      <P>These amendments might be discussed together.  During the Second Reading and Committee Stages of this Bill a question arose on more than one occasion concerning the rate of import duty levied upon second-hand clothing.  I agreed to have an amendment introduced on this Stage that would enable the Dáil to discuss the matter, and if it were so inclined, to amend the Bill so as to reduce the duty payable upon imported second-hand clothing.  Under the Bill as introduced, second-hand clothing was liable to pay the full rate of duty. A duty was levied at the rate of 60 per cent., with a preferential rate of 40 per cent., but in view of the fact that it was not possible to get a certificate of origin in respect of second-hand clothing, the preferential rate did not apply and duty at the full rate had to be paid.  I am now moving to reduce the rate of duty to 25 per cent. When this matter was before the Dáil I mentioned the difficulties and dangers associated with any differential rate on second-hand clothing.  The amendment in the form I am moving it meets some of these difficulties.  We saw the possibility of a differential rate being used for the purpose of evading the main duty and thus defeating the object we had in view of promoting the ready-made clothing industry here.  We saw also the administrative difficulty that would arise in respect of such a differential rate, particularly the possibilities of evasion which were there and which Deputies know are availed of, particularly by persons travelling home from Great Britain to this country who buy new clothing and wear it coming in here on the boat and thus escape paying duty. However, we think the form of words devised here, that the lower rate shall apply only in respect of clothing which has been &ldquo;substantially worn or otherwise used outside Saorstát Eireann by a person other than the importer or members of his family or household.&rdquo; meets that difficulty.  I move the amendment, and I think it meets <Col N="1719" /> whatever case has been made in the Dáil.  It is proposed also in amendment 3 that there shall be no preferential rate in respect of this duty, so that the difficulties associated with the certificate of origin cannot arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This first Government amendment cannot pass without certain comment.  We embarked upon the new financial policy with an assurance from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that tariffs were not calculated to raise the cost of living. I never accepted that assurance quite fully.  I think this Government amendment marks finally the admission by the Government that the tariff policy is calculated to raise the cost of living and to raise the cost of those commodities upon which a tariff is levied.  I think that is a very important stage to have reached.  It cannot be passed either without drawing the attention of the House again to the fact that we seem to be in considerable doubt as to how best this policy is to be prosecuted. I observed here on the last day when this matter arose that the Labour Party had divided themselves into two camps on the head of this amendment.  It was maintained then very forcibly and effectively by Deputy Curran that the adoption of this amendment meant grave injury to the Irish ready-made clothing trade.  It was maintained by his colleague, Deputy Murphy, that unless the tariff on second-hand clothes were reduced it would result in grave hardship to the poorer sections of the community.  To reconcile these two approaches to this amendment is somewhat difficult when you find them both coming from the same Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is a great deal to be said for this amendment but, at the same time, I hope the Minister has moved his amendment with a full realisation of what it involves.  There is no doubt whatever that Deputy Curran is perfectly right in saying that this amendment means that there will be brought into competition with the ready-made clothing manufacturers of this country a grade of clothing closely analogous to the cheap products of continental manufacturers.  I believe, <Col N="1720" /> on the other hand, that on the whole a very strong case can be made from Deputy Murphy's point of view to the effect that the tariff on this second-hand clothing means that the price will be made prohibitive for the people who buy it, who are the poorest people in the country.  I wonder has Deputy Murphy looked into the question carefully and, if he has, has he drafted his amendment to meet the situation?</P>
    <P>I believe that the reason why second-hand clothes have become prohibitively expensive since last Christmas is not the change of duty but the change of revenue practice.  The Revenue Commissioners have recently refused to accept the <i>pro forma</i> invoice issued to the rag merchants of Glasgow and have determined that these <i>pro forma</i> invoices will be reviewed by the revenue officials at the port of entry, and they have valued these rags at their valuation and not the valuation set out in the invoice. The result has been that where these discarded clothes were coming in at twopence or threepence per garment the revenue officials now assess them at from one shilling to two shillings, and the result has been that from the tariff point of view a twopenny garment has six or seven times the <i>pro forma</i> value of the garment.  I believe that is the reason why the clothing has become so much dearer recently.  I believe that if Deputy Murphy had looked into the question more closely he would agree with me.  I do not know whether it is the intention of the Minister to revise that practice or not.</P>
    <P>I must say that on this matter I have an open mind.  I find it very difficult to make up my mind as to whether the tariff should be reduced, to the detriment of the clothing factories, or whether it should be maintained, to the grave hardship of the poor people depending on these clothes.  It is very difficult to find out on which side the balance falls, but I think that before the Minister introduced an amendment of this kind he should have informed the House of his views on the revenue practice of valuing these garments.  I feel sure he is aware of that practice and aware that it is a practice that has <Col N="1721" /> been introduced very recently.  I do not think Deputy Murphy is aware of it, but I think the Minister undoubtedly is.  I believe that if the Revenue Commissioners are not to be defrauded that practice must continue, but if that practice continues I submit that this amendment is a blind.  It achieves practically nothing.  The root of the matter of the increased cost of second-hand clothes, to which Deputy Murphy has referred, is the alteration in revenue practice, not the increased duties, because I am informed by persons engaged in this trade, who have made representations to me that the average cost of garments coming in is from 2d. to 4d.  The difference between 25 per cent. and 50 per cent. on a twopenny article is very small, but if the revenue officials open the parcel and revalue an article at 1s. 6d., then the difference is substantial.  Unless the Minister proposes to revise the revenue practice and virtually abolishes all taxation on incoming second-hand clothes, I submit that this amendment as set down here really achieves nothing, except as a grand gesture to the poor and lowly which saves Deputy Murphy's face and achieves the Minister's purpose at the same time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In normal circumstances, I dislike intensely encouraging the trade in second-hand clothing. I think there is something morally wrong, something culturally wrong, and something nationally wrong with a system which enables one section of the community to sell its cast-off clothing to a less fortunate section.  Personally, I dislike intensely the social system which condemns our poor and needy people to buy the cast-off clothing of the more wealthy elements in the community.  To that extent, in normal circumstances, I would be utterly and unalterably opposed to anything which savoured of encouraging a system of condemning the poor to wear the cast-off clothing of the rich.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But unfortunately in this and other countries we have such a social and economic system that poverty and misery are the destiny of the poor people.  Even in this House you will <Col N="1722" /> find Deputies to tell us that poverty and want are the inexorable destiny of the poor.  Consequently, until such time as you have a proper social system, until such time as this House is prepared to enact the legislation and to devise a social system which will give to all the people in the community the decent standard of life to which these people are entitled, we must look at these matters not so much from the point of view of doctrinaire principles as from the point of view of the needs of our poor and destitute people.  That brings me to the point of saying that there are to-day within our country unfortunately a very large number of people who are compelled to depend on second-hand clothing.  There are many people in the country to-day, especially in the South and along the Western seaboard, who would be unclad were it not for the possibility of buying second-hand clothing cheaply from the second-hand clothing dealers.  So long as these people are compelled through sheer economic necessity to depend on the purchase of clothing in that manner, I think it is the duty of the House to ensure that people in such straitened domestic and financial circumstances should be enabled to get their clothing at the cheapest possible price. Although I dislike the trade in second-hand clothing, I dislike also, perhaps more intensely in existing circumstances, the idea of imposing an additional burden upon people who are unable to bear any additional burden. It is because I desire to save these people from the additional burden of high tariffs upon imported second-hand clothing that I support, in a kind of qualified way, the amendment introduced by the Minister.</P>
    <P>On the Committee Stage of the Bill, I asked the Minister to give special and sympathetic consideration to the case of charitable organisations outside this country who export clothing to charitable organisations within this country.  There are to-day a number of organisations in Great Britain and elsewhere who send in clothing to charitable organisations here.  That clothing is not for sale but for distribution among poor and needy people <Col N="1723" /> here.  The imposition of a tax upon that kind of clothing, not imported for sale, but imported as a gift for needy people, is an indefensible kind of taxation, in my opinion.  I suggested to the Minister then that these organisations might be registered or might be licensed with a view to permitting the free importation of clothing as between one such organisation outside the country to another such organisation within the country.  I notice the Minister has made no provision for cases of that kind in the amendments which he has submitted and I should be glad to hear from the Minister the reasons why it is not possible to meet this eminently reasonable request.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there may be administrative difficulties, but I cannot foresee any difficulties arising which would be so great as to make it utterly impossible for the Department to devise amendments which would cover the main portions of that traffic between the more important organisations concerned in this country and outside this country.  I refer in particular to clothing which is imported from the Headquarters of the British Legion by branches of the British Legion here. That clothing does a good deal to supply the needs of poor members of the Legion here and anything which would permit of the continuance of these benefits for needy Irish ex-servicemen here would be of great advantage to them and, as far as this country is concerned, it could not be said to be an attack on home industries because these things are not coming in in any sense in competition with home industries.  They are coming in as a gift to people who are in very necessitous circumstances.  I hope the Minister will give us some indication that even at this late stage it is not altogether impossible to meet cases such as I mentioned on the Committee Stage and such as I bring to his notice again now on the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to re-echo the remarks of Deputy Norton.  I certainly deplore the necessity which exists in this country for any class to be compelled to accept or to wear cast-off <Col N="1724" /> clothing, but while a state of affairs exists at the present time, such a necessity must be catered for, particularly when we bear in mind that high tariffs have been imposed on imports of ready-made clothing.  These tariffs make the poor people go for the cheaper second-hand article.  I therefore support the amendment moved by the Minister, and I should be very glad if the tax could have been taken off altogether.  I also support Deputy Norton in the appeal which he has made in regard to parcels of second-hand clothing, which are sent from charitable organisations outside this country to similar organisations within the country.  These are a very valuable source of relief, and the people who receive them would be in a very bad way if they were unable to get such help.  With regard to second-hand clothing imported for sale, and which is purchased by the very poor, it would be appalling to think of the results if they were not even to have that very slight form of relief.  They purchase this clothing at fairs, and while I recognise the need for discipline from a board of health point of view, still at the same time these people would be in a very bad way if the clothes were not available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I opposed this on a previous stage, and I desire to make my position clear, as my name has been mentioned by Deputy Dillon.  I quite agree that gifts of second-hand clothing or parcels coming from one individual to another should be exempt, but I am rather disappointed at the amendment moved by the Minister.  I think that he should have prohibited the importation of second-hand clothing altogether.  This clothing is sold at the fairs throughout Ireland. I fail to see why any Deputy should encourage the wearing of cast-off clothing by people in Ireland.  I hold that the people in Ireland are entitled to get ready-made clothing here which is made within the State.  They can get that clothing as cheaply as this cast-off clothing which is brought across from England.  I am sorry that any Deputy in the House takes up that attitude. Why should we ask our fellow-workmen <Col N="1725" /> to wear clothing that is cast off by other people?  We do not know what is on them.  You are liable to get any class of disease from them.  I say that this country is able to make ready-made clothes just as cheaply, and the Minister should see that the people of Ireland should get proper material.</P>
      <P>We hear a lot about poverty in County Cork, but the people are just as poor in the county I represent, County Dublin.  We have heard about County Cork and County Limerick where these clothes are sold in the middle of the streets.  I have been in Cork and Galway and have seen them selling them there, but I say you will get ready-made clothing as cheaply as you will get this second-hand clothing in these places and the Government should prohibit its importation altogether. I am surprised that any Deputy should ask any of the Irish people to wear the cast-off clothes of English people.  Of course, I shall be satisfied if the House decides otherwise, but personally I would not ask any person to wear second-hand clothing. It is all right where such clothing is given to poor friends or is given to the ex-servicemen through the charitable institutions.  I think the selling of such clothes at fairs should be prohibited altogether.  I do not agree even with the amendment because as a man of the working class and as an Irishman I fail to see why you should ask anyone to wear second-hand clothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>It strikes me that there <Col N="1726" /> is something in this amendment that cuts across the economic nationalism propounded by our Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I think he told us, and I mentioned it the last day in the House, that one of the guarantees he had given us in connection with the increased tariff on clothing was the fact that we are now able to produce ready-to-wear garments made in Ireland that would compete with any kind of cheap shoddy brought in here. If that is so, I do not see that there is any necessity for his giving any sort of preferential treatment to second-hand clothing.  I may tell the Minister and the House that I am directly interested in the second-hand clothing trade, and I think if he can guarantee, as he stated originally, that factories here can turn out new goods to compete with the shoddy foreign goods, there is no necessity whatever for giving any preferential treatment to the second-hand clothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one element that needs protection in this country, one element that has been hit very hard by the second-hand clothing trade and that is the drapers in our small towns.  If you go to the fairs mentioned by Deputy Brasier you will see hawkers there in very large numbers with these second-hand clothes displayed outside the drapers' shops, to the detriment of the shopkeepers and the loss of trade to the town.  These drapers form the bulk of the tax-paying community in these towns.  It is in that interest, although it hits myself directly, that I would oppose very strongly any consideration whatever in regard to second-hand clothing.  In regard to the clothes that come in as gifts for distribution some special machinery could easily be instituted for the distribution of them and the reception of them without paying any duty.  I think this matter of the second-hand clothing trade is a question that should be very carefully looked into.  Deputy Dillon mentioned something about articles costing from 2d. to 4d.  That puts the famous epic of the Minister about the 1s. 8d. trousers into the shade.  I do not think Deputy Dillon's figures in regard to the cost of second-hand clothing are quite correct.  Sometimes you <Col N="1727" /> get a class of second-hand clothing that is very good, a class known as misfits. The clothing is of a very good standard; it may have been worn once or twice but it is practically new.  On the whole, I think it is detrimental to the policy that the Minister has laid down to give this consideration to the second-hand clothing trade.</P>

      <P>I want to say, at the beginning, I am sorry that this amendment is being discussed in the absence of the Deputy who put down the original amendment on Committee Stage.  I presume an agreement has been made with that particular Deputy. Otherwise I think it would be a breach of Parliamentary Order to have a Bill, which was set down for Thursday, and appearing for that day, to be taken to-day, in the absence of the mover of the amendment which brought this in as the Minister's alternative.  This amendment has to be considered in relation to the tax upon woven fabrics and made-up clothing.  We had an amazing and an amusing performance from Deputy Norton to-day.  He objects to the people of this country, as if they were peculiar in this matter, having to buy the second-hand clothing or cast-off clothing of anybody.  Is there not a second-hand clothing trade in nearly every country in the world?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is not concerned with that, but the point is that he deplores, as if it were peculiar to this country, the fact that the people should be, economically, in such a position that they have to buy second-hand clothing.  It may be deplorable, but people here are worse off than the people in every other country in that particular matter.  The Deputy, however, should be reconciled by thinking that second-hand political clothing is not included, or he would find himself arrayed in the second-hand cast off toggery which he now parades as homespun.  This tax has to be considered in relation to other taxes.  If what Deputy O'Neill pointed out were true there would be a good case to be <Col N="1728" /> made for this amendment, but it is not so.  We are told that the reason why a tax on second-hand clothing is equitable is because people can get made up new clothing as cheaply.  That I deny.  I had an amendment, upon the last stage of this Bill, with regard to woven tissue, reducing the duty to a very low rate for a very low grade of stuff.  I proposed that amendment and made my case upon it on the fact that when the woollen manufacturers previously made application to the Tariff Commission for a tariff they stated they were not going to engage in the manufacture of a cloth below a certain value.  The Tariff Commission put up to them the proposal that they should, if they did not individually proceed to manufacture this material, there should, at least, be a co-operative effort made to run a factory for this low - grade stuff.  That recommendation of the Tariff Commission was made because, in the first instance, the argument of the applicants was that they were not going to defame their reputation for good material by engaging in the manufacture of this rather shoddy material, and in the second place they made an elaborate argument that they were not going to do so, because it was of a more expert type of manufacture for which they had not the skilled hands or machinery and it would not pay them to put up a factory of that type.  At any rate it issued from the report of the Commission that these people, giving evidence on oath, had sworn that they were not going to engage in the manufacture of this type of stuff, and I do not think the situation has changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not certain that some manufacturers may not have dropped into the Minister's office, and finding him in an accommodating humour, and making all sorts of promises, have been able to induce him to raise the tariff to whatever height they desire.  They promised him, I have no doubt, that at some time, in this country, a factory would be established for the manufacture of this material, when they would guarantee that the poor man would get a suit cheaply.  But as long as that is not done the poor man will not get <Col N="1729" /> the ready-made suit of clothes cheaply, as promised.  In these circumstances we have this amendment brought forward raising the tariff to 45 per cent.  We still have the operative 20 per cent. tariff under a preferential rate on the very cheapest clothes which are coming into the country.  But the very cheapest clothing is not likely to be manufactured in this country in considerable quantities for a very long time to come.  And you are going to continue to pay 20 per cent. on the raw material that goes to the making up of them.  The people in the making trade are charged upon every item of their manufacture.  They are charged on the raw material, and they will have to lay out a considerable amount more money at the Custom House in addition to what they have already paid. They will find their capital shorter than ever before, and they will find their credit more restricted by reason of the taxes on the banks.  In these circumstances, ready-made clothing will go up in price because most of the raw material has to be purchased more dearly, and the finished product that comes from these materials will cost more.  And we will have this as a concession, that we will have 25 per cent. on second-hand clothing raised to 45 per cent. with whatever preferential rate there is.</P>
    <P>Another matter that I think the rush procedure that we have drifted into entitles us to raise is, that when this was discussed on the Committee Stage, the general feeling of the House was that the reduction of the duty was not good enough.  Certainly the mover of the amendment, Deputy Tadhg Murphy, showed no disposition to accept a reduction, although it was phrased at a considerable reduction. Now we have an amendment sent round in such time that any amendment of that would be impossible, and the House finds itself in the position that it must either vote for this inadequate reduction, or let the old tax stand.  In these circumstances the only choice to be made is that something is better than nothing, but certainly not much better than the original amendment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1730" /> Deputy Norton expressed great concern for those charitable organisations that get in second-hand clothing.  He mentioned the British Legion.  Surely, as the Deputy knows, there are a great many other associations beside that.  Why confine this to people who are merely poor when the plea is poverty because of a common organisation? Why not put forward the plea for poor people who are not in any of those charitable organisations? The Deputy could secure the necessary amendment if he liked.  He could secure an amendment by which there would be no tax on clothing consigned to the charitable organisations about which he speaks.  In justice to the Deputy's interest in the poor affected by this particular amendment, will he not insist upon this being done?  It is quite easy to profess interest in the poor and to roll off a few phrases about what might be done, but the Deputy has power to get a particular amendment passed, and he will have to face up, afterwards, to the consequences, when he is asked by certain poor people why he did not use his power to get into the country, tax free, gifts of second-hand clothing coming to the poor even if limited to certain charitable organisations.  He could, at any rate, get something in addition to this which apparently is the best proposal the Minister can bring in, from the angle of the clothing tax.  Again it is going to do no good to the people that Deputy Norton represents for the Minister to give his assurance that he believes or that somebody told him or that some manufacturer assured him that at some time there is going to be a considerable amount of our requirements in the way of second-hand clothing met at a reasonable cost.  The only case that could be made for a tax on second-hand clothing was that made by Deputy O'Neill and that rested on whether ready-made clothing could be produced from very cheap material and produced cheaply.  It is understood, if we could, on hygienic grounds make an exception and use cheap clothing, we could do away with the importation of second-hand material.  But until that is met and <Col N="1731" /> it ought to be met in great detail, people should be able to get all the second-class clothing they want.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton has argued this question on a basis that does not exist.  He talks of the rich and the poor.  It is not a question between the rich and the poor at all; it is really a question between the rural dweller and the city dweller.  In every city where there is a large city population you are bound to have an amount of clothing that will not be worn, to the same degree that it would be worn in rural districts.  You never hear of second-hand clothing coming from the country because farmers and farm workers can wear their clothing to a point that does not operate in cities. There is a certain amount of second-hand clothing always coming out of Dublin.  It is not fair to confuse that with shoddy or even with ready-made clothing.  The second-hand clothing there is good clothing.  Shoddy has to be made up.  It is put together in the factory and made into cloth and it is very often no use.  It would be wrong to deprive our rural population of the privilege that they have in being able to secure these second-hand garments from the urban population.  It is not a question of rich or poor.  It is really a question of trying to deprive the poor of the country of what is a great boon to them.  This tariff which is most unjustifiable and improper would inflict great hardship on the rural population.  The people in the country who use these garments can wear them almost threadbare and can wear them to a frazzle which the people in the towns could not.</P>

      <P>I moved this amendment without any enthusiasm.  I move it because, like Deputy Dillon, it appeared to me that there was room for a lot to be said on both sides of this question of second-hand clothing. I was not influenced by representations made in favour of the reduction of the duty but if the Dáil should decide, or if any Deputy should decide, to challenge a division and if the Dáil had decided to reject the duty and leave it <Col N="1732" /> at the higher figure I would not feel very much concerned.  It is quite true, as Deputy McGilligan said, that there is a second-hand clothing trade in every country in the world, but it is not true, as Deputy McGilligan implied, that there is an import trade in second-hand clothing in every country in the world.  This particular type of trade that exists here does not exist normally anywhere else.  There is a considerable amount of output of clothing from the towns and cities in the country but we also import large quantities into the country and the import duty only applies to second-hand clothing that comes from outside.</P>
      <P>It is quite true also that there are a number of people in such cases who are very badly paid, such as agricultural workers, who would not be in a position to purchase new suits.  It is, as Deputy Gorey said, true that frequently they get better value in second-hand clothing than in low grade shoddy materials sold new.  The amendment proposed here is designed to reduce this duty.  It will permit of the importation of these clothes subject to that duty, and subject also to the regulations enforced by the health authorities on second-hand clothing imported.  They must be either disinfected at the port of arrival or they must be accompanied by a certificate of disinfection at the port at which they were exported.  These regulations will be continued and in fact the public authorities are inclined if anything to make them more severe than hitherto because undoubtedly there is some danger of infection arising from the importation of these goods.  I do not quite follow his logic.  I introduced it here merely as a proposal to meet the case made here and not for the purpose of admitting anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy then went on to talk about the practice of the Revenue Commissioners in refusing to accept a <i>pro forma</i> invoice in respect of second-hand clothing.  It is quite true the Revenue Commissioners have refused to accept as accurate the value of the second-hand clothing as declared in the invoices which accompany the goods because they have discovered <Col N="1733" /> an organised system to defraud the revenue by invoicing the goods at a much lower value than they actually represent or at a much lower price than is actually paid for them. In order to defeat that organised attempt to defraud the revenue they have refused to accept the declared values as set out in the invoices and they insist on making their own valuation of the goods.  It is not possible to depart from that procedure.  It is the duty of the Revenue Commissioners to see that the duties imposed by the Dáil are put into effect.  If they find that the decisions of the Dáil are being defeated they have to find a way to circumvent the methods that may be adopted.</P>
    <P>I have considered Deputy Norton's representation in respect of clothing imported not for sale but for charitable purposes.  I found that it would be practically impossible to devise any satisfactory method of permitting that clothing to be imported duty free.  The administrative difficulties are insuperable.  In that connection I should like to draw attention to the remarks made by Deputy McGilligan. A duty upon second-hand clothing was imposed by his Government six years ago and that duty has been in operation ever since.  Deputy McGilligan made no attempt, despite the fact that he was repeatedly asked to do so, to overcome these administrative difficulties and to permit the entry of second-hand clothing, not for sale, free of duty.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is great at explaining his own inactivity.  He had the power for six years to remove the duty on second-hand clothing and he refused to exercise it.  He is merely weaving words, his main occupation, when he talks as he talked a few minutes ago.  The fact is that any <Col N="1734" /> attempt to meet the case&mdash;and I went into the arguments in favour of it with the utmost sympathy&mdash;would produce difficulties which might, in the long run, permit of a much wider evasion of the duties and a much greater defrauding of the revenue even than has been practised heretofore. The duty has been reduced to 25 per cent.  It seems to me that the reduction of the duty to that level, which was somewhat lower than I originally intended, and than was suggested by Deputy Murphy, would meet not merely the case made by Deputy Murphy but also the point made by Deputy Norton.  The position is now practically unchanged.  The duty is increased, but only very slightly; the charitable organisations are involved as well as those who send clothing to relatives in this country.  They are not in a much worse position than they were.</P>
      <P>These were the main points raised. The actual implementing of the amendment will cause some administrative difficulties, but the Revenue Commissioners will be able to get over these.  I hope it will be possible at some future date for a Minister to come here and propose that this concession be withdrawn, because the necessity for the importation of second-hand clothing will have ceased.</P>

      <P>When introducing the Order imposing this tariff the Minister said that it was necessary to prevent an expected dumping of this commodity. There is one commodity which the farming community want to purchase at a low price.  It is a commodity that is absolutely indispensable to them.  That commodity is maize meal, particularly the yellow meal imported from the Argentine.  That is the meal most generally used by farmers. It is an indispensable food in the production of bacon.  I agree there are other animal foods as good as maize meal, but I contend that there is no animal food of the same all-round value and usefulness.  In every country in the world where tillage is carried out the importation of maize meal is encouraged.  In Denmark they use four or five times the amount of maize meal that the farmers here use.  During the last four or five years organisations of Danish farmers have imported shiploads of maize meal so that they could sell it at a low price to the farming community there.  They have also imported in bulk other raw materials necessary for the farming industry so that those materials could be sold at very low prices to farmers.  The result is that Denmark has been able to survive the agricultural depression of the last four or five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1736" /> The Minister said that the price of Indian meal is falling.  The price has been falling during the last few months, but it is not as low this year as it was last year.  If the price of Indian meal has fallen, the price of everything the farmer is selling has also fallen and has fallen out of all proportion to the price of Indian meal and other raw materials.  Lambs were selling last year at 45/-; this year they are selling at 20/- to 15/-. Bacon has dropped enormously in price and the same thing applies to many other articles produced by the farmers.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Government have imposed tariffs on the raw materials of the farming industry. I do not believe that in any country in the world, under existing conditions, a Government would impose tariffs on the raw materials of an industry that represents approximately 60 per cent. of the country's total production.</P>
    <P>I am opposing this tariff.  Notwithstanding what the Minister has said, I believe the price of Indian meal will later on be increased.  I admit that the big mills engaged in the production of Indian meal in the past did sell the commodity to the farmers at world prices and are selling at world prices now.  Quite possibly a number of small mills will spring up; many of them will be inadequately equipped, mechanically and otherwise, and it is inevitable that these mills will have to charge higher prices in order to cover production costs.  It may be that the bigger mills will, in the course of time, secure a vested interest in the small mills and it will be to their interest to keep up prices.  Eventually you will have a ring completely controlling the price of Indian meal.</P>
    <P>The pig population of this country is declining rapidly.  If there is an increase in the price of Indian meal it is inevitable the pig population will decline still further.  I am altogether opposed to the principle of imposing tariffs on any raw material connected with the farming industry.  I am particularly opposed to the imposition of a tariff on such a vitally essential raw <Col N="1737" /> material as this.  Hence it is I have put down these amendments proposing a reduction of the duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>Two statements made by Deputy Roddy are rather interesting; they tend to strengthen the arguments for a tariff on Indian meal.  He said that so far the mills grinding the meal in this country are selling at world prices.  That proves that the tariff has not increased the price.  The Deputy then said that a number of small mills would in all probability spring up here and there and he mentioned that later on the bigger mills might get control of them.  If a number of small mills will spring up as a result of this tariff and if the price of meal will not be increased, that is a very sound reason for the tariff.  That would be a most desirable achievement. If there are numbers of small mills, will not the competition result in keeping prices at a comparatively low level?  I observe the Deputy shakes his head.  It is generally understood in trade that competition has that effect.  If it were possible for one big organisation to get control of the industry that organisation, being in sole control of the supply, could undoubtedly increase prices.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, if you have small mills engaged grinding meal, that is a thing very much to be desired.  It would be far better for this country if we could get a number of small mills established in the rural areas supplying the needs of the neighbourhood rather than have the requirements of the whole country supplied from Liverpool. We should endeavour to create that state of affairs.  It would be a most desirable thing to have rural mills supplying local wants, affording much-needed employment and distributing amongst the people a sound article such as they cannot always be sure of getting from abroad.  I think the two statements made by the Deputy go a long way to support the reason for this and if it has the effect of starting these small mills in the country every Deputy should welcome it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Goulding's <Col N="1738" /> speech is altogether composed of &ldquo;ifs.&rdquo;  He said that Deputy Roddy shook his head.  Deputy Goulding is also shaking his head.  We have had with the Indian meal mills in the country up to now a certain amount of competition between the meal coming in and the meal ground in the country. That competition is going to be taken away by this tariff.  There is no possibility of resurrecting the small mills that were in operation on the streams some years ago.  First of all they would have to instal new machinery. The old method of grinding corn with the grindstone is unsuitable now. People will not buy as they used to. Of course the ground meal has to be cooked and the new mills have installed a finer grinding plant.  This meal is more easily assimilated and of better value for the money.  For that reason, I say there is no chance of resurrecting small mills.  But there is and always has been a certainty that the supply and price of meal to the country are going to be directed by the large mills who will form a ring if there is no competition from outside. Then the price of meal will go up.</P>

      <P>About thirty years ago there was no possibility of getting <Col N="1739" /> maize meal in our country except from the large rings.  All the mills in our part of the country&mdash;and this is a notorious fact&mdash;were idle so far as the grinding of Indian corn was concerned. There was a lot of power plant in the country and not one hundredweight of Indian corn could they get because all the corn was in the hands of one big combine.  The combine would supply nobody else but those who were in the ring.  As a matter of fact, I happened to be interested in the matter and I brought in a cargo of Indian corn myself.  I put down £3,000 for it.  We distributed this corn to the mills.  That was the first time we had to handle the ring. Now all these mills are distributing centres.</P>
      <P>I make no complaint about the manner in which we are served by the mills in our constituencies.  We get good meal, well-ground, from them, but we want to preserve this competition from outside so that the meal can be sold at the lowest price possible to the farmers.  A tariff of 2/6 a cwt. means £2 10s. a ton.  It is going to be a decided disadvantage to the producer that he cannot produce his bacon and cannot feed his farm animals if there is no competition against the local miller.  At present we have that element of competition to keep down the price, but now when this tax is put on, the price will rise by the amount of the tax.  That is what is going to happen, and if it does not happen in one district it is going to happen in another.  Anything that will reduce the price of Indian corn to the farmer is good business.  Deputy Goulding might have heard fifteen or twenty years ago about one ring in the Indian meal business; that is Halls.  That ring was there then and is there now, and it will be the same all over the country.</P>

I hope the country people will be given an early opportunity of cross-examining the Minister's colleagues on that point in every constituency in this country.  I should like to hear Deputies explaining to their constituents how they served them by taxing their Indian meal.  Is amendment 4 moved?</P>

      <P>Amendment 4 is a token amendment, and it is put down for the purpose of doing away with this tax.  I see the Minister's face blanches at my use of the word &ldquo;tax,&rdquo; but it is very desirable that the people of the country should know what this tariff is.  It is a tax on the agricultural community to promote other forms of industry in this country and everybody who has to do with agriculture knows that.  Amendment 4 may be described as a token amendment for the purpose of removing this tax from the basic raw materials of the agricultural industry.  I have said repeatedly in this House that a lot of persons who could not feel the same cordial enthusiasm that the Minister feels for industrial development on the lines he is going, are prepared to go a good deal of the way with him in order to give his policy a chance provided he would give those who do not want any help, except fair play, an opportunity of earning their living and provided that he would not interfere with the livelihood of one section of the community in order to provide a hypothetical means of livelihood for another section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that the agricultural industry is supporting five times as many people as any other two industries in the country.  To tax that industry to promote the welfare of mills which are already operating in this country in close combination; to protect their welfare by excluding what the Minister himself admits was never more than ten per cent. of the total consumption <Col N="1741" /> of Indian meal in this country, is not going to help the agricultural interests.  These mills were able to operate and make a good profit while competing with foreign imports at all times.  Even when they had to withstand the ordinary movement of world prices only a dribble of meal came into the Free State from across the Border.  This dribble immediately regulated the price and brought down the price of the meal in the Saorstát to the price level outside. As soon as the price came down the outside imports ceased to come in. That has happened time and again. Any person who was in the Indian meal business knows that that is so. Time and again the Irish millers' prices did not follow the fall in the Liverpool and Argentine maize markets.  They lagged behind time and again in reducing their price and it was the corrective of the imports of meal coming in that brought down the prices here.  The very minute the prices came down the imports stopped. The Minister has before him one instance after another in which these infinitesimal imports of about ten per cent. acted as the most effective brake upon the endeavour of the meal ring in this country to force up prices.</P>
    <P>No Government intervention, no auditor's certificate, no host of Government inspectors, no inquiries or commissions were required in order to keep down prices of Indian meal in this country.  In the dribble of Indian meal into the country there was an agency which did the job far more effectively than the Minister can ever hope to do it with all his price fixing machinery, secret service agents and Government Commissions.  This tax will mean that the farmers will be exploited in the raw material they require by these Indian meal rings. For some extraordinary reason the Minister is going to put on a tariff so that, as he says, we can secure that all our farmers are to be supplied by Irish millers.  But at the present moment, with the exception of ten per cent., the meal used in the Free State is ground in the Free State mills.  Except in very abnormal times there was never more than ten per <Col N="1742" /> cent. of Indian meal imported.  That ten per cent. has always operated so as to keep the prices down.  This tariff will raise the level of prices and in that way an absolutely prohibitive tax is being put on the farmers' raw material.</P>
    <P>I know Deputy Goulding will excuse me if I say what may seem offensive to him.  I have not the slightest desire to use an offensive word but I cannot help saying that he does not appear to understand the Indian meal business when he speaks as he has done.  When the Deputy speaks of competition from the small mills he does not evidently know that ninety per cent. of the cargoes of Indian meal are brought on the high seas.  The corn market fluctuates with such violence that the object of every miller is to buy his supply as near the port as he can, lest at the time the corn is being discharged the bottom may have fallen out of the market and the corn merchant may find himself ruined.  The small miller is absolutely helpless.  He is bound to get his supply of corn from the big millers.  Even if the small miller had the capacity of milling a whole cargo, supposing that he were able to bring it in, the fact remains that the Indian meal market is the most violently fluctuating market in the world and at one stroke a miller may be wiped out. The only safeguard the miller had is to buy constantly in modest quantities.</P>
    <P>We had a case mentioned here of a mill that is being wiped out in Bandon. I asked the Minister why and he said it was due to illness on the part of the proprietor.  If the Minister has certain information to that effect I have no more to say but I heard that there was a deliberate attempt made by the big millers.</P>

      <P>If the Minister knew as much about the Indian meal trade as I do, he would not give that invitation to his best friend, and I hope I am the Minister's best friend.  If the Minister has an enemy I suggest that he should tender to him the advice he <Col N="1743" /> has now tendered to me.  It is better than advising him to set a candle on the hob.  If that man that he refers to is dealing with Halls he would get his supplies regularly from them. Naturally, if he attempts to cut the price, his weekly loss at a reduction of 3d. per cwt. on Indian meal is comparatively small, but it may be something gigantic for the man importing the corn.</P>
      <P>What will happen the next time he sends for a couple of waggons of corn?  He will be informed that the cargo has not turned up, and that there are no supplies available, but that that day three weeks, if there is a cargo in, they will do what they can for him. Gradually that man will be crushed out of business.  He is not going to be crushed out next week or the week afterwards, because the Minister would be on his hind-legs to know the reason, but when the Minister has settled down and passed on to some other important matter, then is the time the big man will start dealing with the small millers, and if any of us try to defend them it will be explained to us that there was incompetence or imprudence, or something else, and that if anyone wanted to buy a mill it would be a very good investment.  It would be a very good investment if you are prepared to make yourself the slave of some large importer next door, who can cut off supplies and hold you up as incompetent, simply because you are not prepared to crawl on your stomach to him and to do what he tells you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not the end of the difficulty, because Deputies forget that a large miller who wishes to keep down, and wishes people to keep down world prices must mill his corn under the most modern conditions.  That requires that he will bring meal in off his waggons by elevators, that there will be as little haulage and cartage as possible, and that he will get his meal at the lowest possible overhead charges, mill it in the most expeditions way, and get it to the consumers with the lowest possible measure of overhead cost.  I can see the Minister's point when he says: &ldquo;I am not going <Col N="1744" /> to let that criterion of costs be the actual criterion which will apply for all manufacturers in this country.&rdquo;  I can see that point of view.  But where you are dealing with the raw material of a great industry, the greatest of all our industries, then I think that criterion should apply.  Indian meal admittedly is a manufactured article, but for the great agricultural industry it is a raw material.  Would the Minister get up here and say, if by intensive agriculture you can produce two blades of grass where you used to have one, &ldquo;I am not going to have people indulging in intensive agriculture; I will not allow you to make slaves of the people and work them that hard&rdquo;? The thing is obviously ridiculous.  If they do not adopt the most modern methods of conducting the agricultural industry, in the rearing of cattle and pigs they cannot hope to compete in the markets where they will have to compete.</P>
    <P>I can quite see his point in regard to clothing and other matters, that if a section of the community is in dire distress as a result of cut-throat competition from abroad, if this State can possibly afford it we are obliged&mdash;I am stating his point of view as I see it&mdash; if necessary to do a little more in order that sections of the community may have a livelihood.  But where it means that in order to provide a livelihood for such a number of persons as will manufacture the extra 10 per cent. of meal would come into this country on a free market we are to open our agricultural industry to the dangers of exploitation, of close rings, such a course I contend would be absolute madness.  The Minister may say that he will control prices or he may say &ldquo;What is the use of talking to me? I have made up my mind.&rdquo;  The object I have in talking to him is this, that he may make up his mind, but I think that some agricultural members of the Fianna Fáil Party will come to realise that, whatever be Party politics and whatever be Party discipline, they are not entitled to betray their own people in order to maintain a Party programme. If they go into the Lobby and vote for the taxation of Indian meal, which is used by the greater part of the agricultural industry in <Col N="1745" /> this country, they are betraying their own people and they will have to answer to these people sooner or later for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDavis" hpid="Mr. Davis Mr. Davis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pleasure to me to join with Deputy Dillon in his protest against this tariff of £1 per ton on imported Indian meal.  It ought to be known to anybody with any knowledge of the trade that the quantity of maize meal imported at present is infinitesimal. The fact that it is very small is one reason why the Minister should hesitate in imposing the tariff.  It is the one means by which a monopoly will be prevented.  There are two parties to this question, the miller and the farmer.  I wonder which of these is the better able to take care of himself? I think the Minister should not have any difficulty in coming to the conclusion that millers at present in this country are quite competent to take care of their position and that the farmers should be afforded a reasonable opportunity of securing their position by reasonable competition, which will be killed by this tariff.  A tariff of £1 per ton on imported maize meal is to be borne by the farmer, whom we pose here as trying to safeguard, at a time when every article that the farmer has to dispose of in the market is going down by leaps and bounds.  That is the manner in which the Minister proposes to protect the farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quantities of maize meal coming in are very small, but the fact that there is a slight importation and that that importation is coming from millers who have the most modern machinery at their disposal, and as a consequence are in a position to meet similar modern machinery in this country, prevents a monopoly in the trade.  It secures competition, regulates prices, and prevents the farmers being fleeced by such a monopoly as will be created under this tariff for one purpose only, and that is to exploit the farmer for the benefit of the miller.  When that competition is killed, I wonder is it the £1 per ton imposed by the tariff that the farmer will have to pay extra for his meal or will it be £2 or £3?  The latter, I <Col N="1746" /> think, is more likely.  The Minister is taking a risk by killing that limited competition which to-day safeguards the farmer.  When he removes that competition he constitutes a monopoly. To my mind, and I think to the mind of any businessman, it is almost inevitable that a monopoly will at once spring up and the result will be that the price will be forced up to such an extent that the Minister will have to try and rectify the grave injustice caused by imposing this tariff which the farmer will have to bear.  That is a fact that cannot be disputed and I think it should appeal to the Minister. He has taken on his shoulders a very grave responsibility, and there is no getting away from it that it is going to inflict on the farmers a very grave injustice.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look into the matter very carefully as it is a very grave question.  If the farmers are to have a fair chance they must have certain competition which will regulate prices and enable them to get the produce that is necessary for them on reasonable and fair terms.  Once you kill that competition you remove the one safeguard for the farmers to secure a foodstuff which to-day is used more extensively for pig producing than anything else that the Minister can mention.  Is this the means by which the Minister hopes to do the farmers a benefit?  Does he think that the millers carrying on the trade at present here are not well able to take care of themselves and that they require his assistance in this matter?  I say they do not.  I believe that there are millers carrying on in the maize business at present who are equal to any proposition put up to them from England or anywhere else, because they can import their cargoes direct from the Argentine at the very lowest freight and on the very best terms. They have the most modern machinery, as Deputy Dillon has mentioned. They have elevators and mills alongside the ports.  They have dispensed with all unnecessary overhead charges and they can produce their stuff certainly on as economic a basis as any other millers competing with them. For that reason, they are on an equal <Col N="1747" /> footing with any miller who tries to compete with them.</P>
    <P>In such circumstances, is it right, for the small quantity of maize meal that is now being imported, and which is a mere bagatelle as compared with the quantity of maize turned into meal here, that such a risk should be taken when that risk is going to be at the expense of the farmers?  I say finally that you are going to kill the competition that now regulates the price; you are going to remove from the farmer the one protection he has to get his article on fair and reasonable terms. Having done that, it is not the £1 per ton tariff that the farmer will have to be content with, but you will have created a monopoly and placed in the hands of these millers the right to advance prices not by £1 per ton, but perhaps by £3.  If the Minister considers that that is good business he can proceed with it, but I think he will have reason to regret it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this tariff on Indian meal.  I come from a constituency where there are thousands of tons of it used.  In a great many cases the farmer who formerly could only keep six or seven cows can now keep nine or ten as a result of the low price of feeding stuffs.  I made a statement here that within the last few years the ring in the Cork trade tried to put a mill in Bandon out of business. The Minister has denied this.  I am now prepared to make an offer to the Minister that I will give £25 to any charitable purpose he names if I cannot prove this statement and that on one condition only, that I am allowed to produce evidence at the inquiry. Who made this demand for a tariff on Indian meal?  I am quite sure it was not the farmer.  If it was the working classes made the demand I think the Minister, in justice to the House, should state what extra hands it is going to employ and what it is going to cost the country.  If it came from the millers, what is the idea of the millers in looking for it?  Is it not for the purpose of increasing the price to the consumer?  I think that the Minister should inquire very carefully into the <Col N="1748" /> matter before imposing the tariff.  I am not talking politics; I am talking business.  I have been listening for 35 years to the question of feeding being discussed and I have often heard it discussed in my business place.  I have heard the question asked: How did certain people who drew a pile of stuff for feeding purposes make it pay? The extraordinary thing about it is that these were the people who were the most successful.</P>
      <P>I can prove this.  I say that anything that leads to an increase in the price of raw material for these people would be a crime in my opinion.  Just to give you an idea of the effect of this tariff I might mention that about three years ago there was a question of the admixture of barley and Indian meal.  I discussed the question with farmers who lived in my own area, one of them a man who feeds fifteen cows and had about 70 acres, half of which would be arable.  The price of Indian meal was then about £10 per ton.  He said that he bought about £300 worth. That would mean he used about 30 tons, and if the price of feeding stuffs was increased by £1 per ton it would mean about £30 to him.  He said that that would be about the amount of his rates and annuities.  I would again appeal to the Minister before deciding on imposing this tax to inquire carefully into it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is not often voluble in these debates and he is not very successful in making himself clear when he is voluble.  He might easily restrain himself.  His Trinity College education has not brought him forward to the extent that one might expect.  The price has not gone down in any degree equivalent to the decrease in the price of the raw material. Secondly, on the fact that eleven out of every twelve consumers use the home produced stuff, this is the same argument we had in regard to the manures, that four out of every five use the home produced stuff, but the Minister has not realised that it was the one individual out of every twelve who insisted on using the foreign stuff, who kept the price at a reasonable level for the other eleven because we got the impact of world prices on the foreign manufactured product.  If we had not that one person in every twelve using the foreign product then all the consumers here would be at the mercy of the home millers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister further states that he is going to have price fixing, and that in the end, if necessary, he is going to take over the importation of corn into the hands of the Government.  The Government will fix a price.  They will require a host of inspectors to decide what is a fair price in the various areas in the country.  They will require a host of assessors and other inspectors to see that that price is charged and nothing more, and a host of prosecutors to see that people who do charge more are brought to justice.  Finally we are going to have the importation of corn taken over by the Government. The Minister, the man who talks of fixing prices in regard to furniture, soap, candles, sugar confectionery and a host of other things, is going out to take in cargoes on the high seas and to control prices in the feeding-stuffs market in connection with this particular duty.  He is going to do all this with civil servants, who for their pains are <Col N="1750" /> going to have their salaries reduced. These are the new economics which the country is facing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon used a phrase in reference to dealing with little driblets of Indian corn coming into the country, but let it be remembered that it is that one-twelfth of the entire consumption which comes into the country that keeps down the price of the other eleven-twelfths.  It has done that, without interference by inspectors or civil servants, or without the necessity for further legislation to enable the Government to take over the importation of corn, or to fix prices.  Until that system which has operated here, has broken down, it should be tried out.  We are asked to-day, in order that some little employment may be provided by the milling of one-twelfth of the entire consumption of the country, to take away the impact of world prices, which gave us the situation that we have at the moment.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan having listened to the clotted nonsense of his colleagues who talked about this tariff, stepped in at the last moment to cover up the damaging effects of the statements which some of them had made.  Deputy O'Leary, Deputy Gorey and others were telling us that this tariff was bound to increase prices. Deputy McGilligan had to admit that prices have fallen since the tariff was imposed.  I have said before that the greatest tragedy in life is to see a beautiful theory killed by actual facts. The beautiful theories that have been created by Deputies opposite have got to go out against the fact that the prices have not gone up since the tariff was imposed.</P>

      <P>That is a fact.  Let me make a correction.  The Deputy said that in some areas only prices went down.  I have got to admit that in <Col N="1751" /> one area one miller tried to increase his prices.  There is, of course, in this particular case no need for me to deal with it, because that miller was a member of the Oireachtas, and also a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, and I thought that perhaps the members of that Party would approach him personally and say that in the national interests he should not dare to profiteer.  He brought down his prices eventually.  He brought the price lower than it had been at the time the tariff was imposed because his attempt to profiteer brought such competition into his area that he is now practically fighting for his existence.</P>

      <P>The fact is that this is the most successful tax ever imposed. Not merely have we got a reduction in price, a reduction in price greater than the reduction in the price of the raw materials, but we have got considerable development in the re-starting of mills.  Deputy Roddy talked about small mills coming into production in the Northern counties.  Of course, Deputy Gorey said that the tariff would not bring the small mills back into production.  I do wish that the Cumann na nGaedheal would argue these things and settle their differences outside the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The fact is that such mills are coming into production in many areas and I regard that as an excellent development. I know that Deputies opposite do not think of small scale industries.  They think always of the big mill at the port, the mill with the suction plant for loading and unloading ships and the mill with the latest machinery.  They will be glad to hear that already there is a proposal to establish such a mill here as the result of this tariff.  It is coming in here as a result of the tariff.</P>

      <P>I say that the existing mills are capable of supplying the home consumption and are capable of supplying much more if necessary.  The fact that these mills have gone into production <Col N="1752" /> means competition and explains the fall in prices.  It explains the nonsense of Deputies who are talking about rings being formed for the purpose of exploiting consumers. Where are the rings?  The only attempt I know of, to exploit consumers following the tariff, was that made by an odd profiteering shopkeeper here and there.  We were told that this was an attack on the agricultural industry.  It is nothing of the sort.  We had Deputy Roddy talking of the duty and ignoring the distinction between maize and maize meal.  We import maize because we cannot grow maize.  I admit that but we can mill it here.  We have always made about eleven-twelfths of our requirements, but the milling of the quantity imported was not a negligible factor.  It was not a mere bagatelle.  It was about 1,000,000 cwts. per annum.  There is a good deal of employment to be given in the milling of that 1,000,000 cwts.  Deputy Dillon said it is a problem of how you are going to keep down the price.  The obvious way to keep down prices is to promote competition. We had an export trade in maize which we lost this year when Great Britain imposed a duty on it.  There was maize milled in Donegal which was exported and I would ask Deputy Dillon to go with Deputy Carney and Deputy Blaney and explain this to the workers, that the fact that the British Government imposed an import duty on maize meal, rendered them liable to unemployment.  We were faced with that danger of unemployment, a danger which has now been removed because another market is made available for them.</P>

      <P>Let me say that in one particular district there has been for a number of years not much competition in respect of maize meal.  I will admit that the price for these areas is and has been for years dearer than in the rest of the country but in the majority of districts, particularly in the north and in the south, there has always been fairly intensive competition in this industry and the price has been kept down because of that fact.  We have been told about a mill that has <Col N="1753" /> been closed in Bandon.  Let me say that that was a prosperous mill, and it had all the advantages which enabled maize to be milled at a profit.  Its closing down arose out of purely fortuitous circumstances.  I suggest to Deputy Dillon if he has any money to invest that he should put it into that quarter.  Deputy Roddy talked of farmers organising themselves to import shiploads of maize in bulk.  I do not believe that the Danish farmers are foolish enough to import milled maize in bulk.  I agree that they probably import maize in bulk, but they mill it in Denmark and that is what we propose to do here.  We are importing maize.  We shall try to get maize as cheaply as we can and try to facilitate those farmers who organise themselves for that purpose but the maize will be milled here and the resultant price will be much lower in this country than it is in most others. We cannot pretend that we are doing something here which is going to restrict in any way competition.  The British, who are not advised by fools on these matters, imposed a duty on maize meal going in there and the British farmer as a result of that duty has had to use meal ground in England.</P>
      <P>The Irish farmer is going to have his maize ground in Ireland and the Irish farmer has the advantage that the price of maize meal has gone down here since the tariff.  I recommend this as a tariff, not only just in itself, but the most valuable of our whole tariff policy, and one that should not be removed under any pretext whatever.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 7, Section 11 (1), line 59, to delete the word &ldquo;seventy-five&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;fifty&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In this section an imperial preference rate on furniture is introduced. I propose an amendment which would leave the preferential rate at 33? per cent. and the other at 50 per cent.  I think there is absolutely no case for increasing the existing duty on furniture. The duty on furniture was put very high for the purpose of giving a big fillip to that industry.  Nobody can deny that a great fillip has been given, that existing firms have been put into a position to extend very substantially, that new firms have been able to establish industries and make progress, that the quality and variety of the goods available have increased steadily since the tariff was imposed.  To increase that tariff can have no effect other than to destroy the element of outside competition and create conditions favourable to monopolies and rings within the country. It seems to me that, except the policy of the present Government is to put on tariffs where there were no tariffs and to increase any tariffs that they may find actually in existence, there can be no possible reason for this tariff.  No reasons have been stated by the Government other than reasons in such general terms as I have just mentioned.  The arguments in favour of each tariff generally are simply that the Government has decided to increase them, that these are their proposals, and the Dáil can take it or leave it.  We can get no indication that there is a necessity for an increase or that there is any substantial need that is or is not likely to be supplied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A tariff ought not to be higher than is necessary.  In my opinion too high tariffs encourage the springing up of industries which are not well organised and are not likely to be carried on on an economic basis.  Over-high tariffs create a monopoly position where it <Col N="1758" /> is very easy to have agreements and to mulet the consumer.  For every reason a tariff should be just as high and no more.  I think that 33? per cent. in relation to furniture has been proven to be ample.  If there are minor requirements in the country that cannot be made with the protection of 33? per cent.  I think they ought not to be made.  If we can manage to make the big bulk of the requirements, I suggest that that is the most that can be achieved.  In big countries with large central units there are certain items that they do not produce and that they find it more satisfactory to import from abroad. In regard to any industry we should not take up the position of tariffing every industry.  As far as the great bulk of the requirements of the country are concerned, our tariffs are bound to be very much too high.  This tariff will impose hardships on the public for which there is no justification and will injure the development of the industry along healthy lines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not correct in stating that no case for this tariff was made to the Dáil.  We discussed the necessity for the duty at very considerable length on previous stages, and if the Deputy has any doubt as to the nature of the case made, he can look back over the official reports and he will find that his statement is at least a very grave exaggeration. The main reason for the tariff was because, despite the 33? per cent., there was an import of furniture into this country valued at about £100,000 a year.  When the duty was imposed in 1924 the value of our imports dropped substantially&mdash;as low as £80,000 in 1926.  Despite the fall in prices, the value of our imports since then has tended to go up until the average for the last couple of years has been £100,000.  The furniture imported was of a very cheap grade, produced under conditions permitting it to be sold at very low prices, and we decided that the increased duty was necessary in order to stop that furniture coming in here, and secure for Irish factories and Irish workers the full output represented.  It seems to me that this duty is quite justifiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1759" /> I do not think there is any real prospect of any of the dangers referred to by the Deputy emerging.  If they should emerge it is not beyond the wit of man to deal with them.  In any case these dangers could emerge whether the duty was increased or not.  At the moment the position is that the firms engaged in this industry are in competition with one another and that that competition is likely to increase and grow in intensity.  In fact a number of the larger firms are getting quite voluble, as Deputies will have noticed from the Press, about the nature of the competition they have to contend with and they have been actually pressing on the Government to take action to limit that competition in particular directions.  Deputies, therefore, need have no fear whatever that it will be possible for any one individual manufacturer to indulge in profiteering of any kind.  If the combination of manufacturers into a ring should arise, as the Deputy seems to fear, then there will be a new situation.  There is no sign, however, of such a ring emerging for a considerable time to come and if it should emerge it might also have emerged under the old tariff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 8, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 8, Section 11 (1), paragraph (c), line 3, after the word &ldquo;bedsteads&rdquo; and within the brackets to insert the words, &ldquo;and also other than blind rollers and wooden portions of kitchen utensils.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1760" /> The Minister has told us that the furniture trade is adequately catered for by the manufacturers in that particular industry.  I do not wish, at this particular stage, to quarrel with that statement made by the Minister, but if that is true in general it is certainly not true in certain particular items.  With that object in view I framed this particular amendment which I now recommend to the House.  I will state, without fear of contradiction, that there is not a single, solitary blind roller made in this country by an Irish firm.  I think that that would be admitted by the Minister, and if that is so, it is merely increasing the cost of blind rollers by 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Minister views raising revenue from very small items that entail considerable machinery in their collection.  I have said all I wish to say about blind rollers, and will now mention what I wish to bring before this House with regard to kitchen utensils.  I believe that technically they come under the furniture section, although possibly there might be some doubt as to whether in some cases they would not come under the other Finance Bill, the schedule 7.  However, I am assuming that they come under this particular section.  I suggest to the Government that it is absolutely absurd and preposterous taking an article which is not manufactured in this country and insisting that some one particular small part of it shall be either sent along separately and invoiced separately and duty paid on it, or, on the other hand, an effort made to produce it in this country.  If you try to get one manufacturer to supply one-tenth of the things required to complete a particular machine, you have all sorts of difficulties.  You have double assemblies.  You have two manufacturers and one has to fit his goods to the works made by another.  I have in mind, say, for instance, the wooden handles on an enamel pail, or the wooden handle on, say, an aluminium teapot, or the small wooden knob on the top of an aluminium teapot, or the wooden portion of a strainer or sieve&mdash;either a wire or a <Col N="1761" /> hair sieve.  I suggest to the Minister that the trouble and annoyance and expense caused to the trade and the general public by forcing the trade to bring in the wooden parts of those articles is out of all proportion to the revenue that is produced to this country. As I have said before, the wooden parts have to be brought in separately and a duty paid on them, and the manufacturers have to furnish invoices and all sorts of other arrangements have to be gone through, and I would suggest to the Minister that, if he has got his main duty, as he has on furniture, and his main revenue, he ought to exempt these smaller things in which you have to spend probably 5/- or 6/- of the community's money in order to raise a shilling in revenue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not quite correct in saying that blind rollers are not manufactured in the country.  Rollers for the external blinds used by shops and also particular rollers used internally by shops are manufactured here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is correct to say that the smaller household roller has not been made in this country heretofore, but the Department has been in touch with certain firms engaged in associated industries and I am informed they are making arrangements for the manufacture of these things now and that as soon as certain minor difficulties are overcome there will be an adequate supply of them from within the country.  As regards the second point of the amendment, if the Deputy looks at sub-section (3), paragraph (c), he will see that we have made provision to meet the point to which he has been referring.  It is true that, heretofore, pails, teapots and other articles with wooden handles have been subjected to duty as wooden furniture.  We are giving the Revenue Commissioners power to exempt from duty articles of that kind.  The paragraph states: &ldquo;In respect of any article of furniture (other than a bedstead) or any component part of an article of furniture (other than a bedstead) that the <Col N="1762" /> quantity of wood contained in such article or component part forms only an inconsiderable part of the whole of such article or component part&rdquo;&mdash; the exemption applies in that case. That is designed to meet the point to which the Deputy has been referring.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 9&mdash;in page 8, Section 12 (1), line 59, to delete the words &ldquo;one shilling and.&rdquo;  I put down this amendment merely because I want to get some information as to why this extraordinary rate has been decided upon.  The rate goes up to 1/6, with 1-3rd taken off the preferential rate.  The only information we have got by way of a case for this tariff is that which the Minister gave on the 24th May when he said that the existing factories in the Saorstát are in a position to supply not merely all the requirements of the country but half the requirements of Europe as well.  Consequently, we need a tariff of 1/6.  I do not understand the reasoning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The tariff is intended to be prohibitive and to stop the importation of sugar confectionery, so <Col N="1763" /> that all the requirements of the country will be met by the existing factories, which are not alone capable of meeting existing requirements but are capable of supplying half the requirements of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have that statement now for the second time.  We are capable of meeting half the requirements of Europe.  That statement is not so very far inaccurate when compared with many other statements the Minister has made.  We are asked to accept that definite statement &mdash;that we are capable of supplying half the requirements of Europe in sugar confectionery&mdash;as a reason for imposing a tariff of 1/6 on this material.  We have got no information as to the imports coming in still or as to what was the rate of decrease in imports over the years in which the smaller tariff had been in operation. We have got no differentiation made by the Minister as to the different classes of confectionery coming into the country.  He might have made the statement that so far as the lower grades are concerned we have pretty definitely seized the trade. The Minister has made no reference to the failure of those operating this business to meet the requirements of the country in the higher grades of whatever is covered by this peculiar tariff.  We have had no statement by the Minister as to whether he believed that in some reasonable time&mdash; which he might make concrete by giving the number of months&mdash;the requirements of the country in the higher grades would be met.  There ought to be some explanation, if importation has lasted over a number of years against a particular rate of duty, as to why an increase is required and there ought to be some statement from the Minister of a reassuring type, backed by detail, as to the period in which we are going to have the country's requirements met. Otherwise, we have got to face this as a tax.  It is not a tax I am going to be very vehement about, because it applies to material which, except in the jam line, cannot be considered in the nature of an essential requirement <Col N="1764" />&mdash;and, in the jam line, I think we meet our own requirements.  This is a tax.  It may be a tax on a particular commodity about which people will not get vehement but it is not protection.  Otherwise, we would have had a case made by the Minister, if it were possible to make a case, and we would have been told what is going to be done in the near future and what prevented whatever is going to be done in the near future from being done some time ago.  I want to lessen the tax.  I regard it merely as a tax and I say &ldquo;Give them some increase.  The sixpence I propose is a definite increase on what was in operation up to date.&rdquo;  If the Minister says that he wants money, I refer him again to his own election promise, that we were to have economies amounting to £2,000,000.  A party which promises £2,000,000 in economies in a particular year ought not to be looking for fresh taxation and it is only on the basis of a tax that this proposal can be justified.</P>

      <P>Largely because certain brands of confectionery of one kind or another were so well advertised and had been for such a long period known to the public, who had become accustomed to them, that the particular rate of duty heretofore in operation was not sufficient to break <Col N="1765" /> that connection.  The connection continued despite the fact that the duty was in operation.  Very intensive advertising campaigns conducted by the firms in question enabled them to hold their position, not altogether but to some extent, although imports were declining year after year.  The position now is that the higher and prohibitive rate of duty has definitely stopped the imports and is giving the market to the Irish firms, which are rising to the occasion and which are now producing all the classes of sugar confectionery required by the people and supplying them in the quantities required.</P>

    <P>I described this recently as the worst of the tariffed industries&mdash;probably the greatest disappointment of the whole lot&mdash;and one which had the greatest advantages so far as tariffs, trade loans and money from other sources were concerned. In spite of that, we find that the productivity of those interested in this industry has been sadly lacking, and that there has not been a great deal of progress made.  Not merely is that the situation but the people interested in this industry showed themselves as amongst the most demoralised of all those who benefited by any tariff.  This is the industry from which the most outrageous proposal which ever proceeded from any group of <Col N="1766" /> manufacturers operating in this country was made.  They made the definite proposal&mdash;they were not slow even to make it public in letters&mdash;that there should be a statutory ring established in the industry.  They wanted to have industrialists grouped.  They wanted to have legislation passed, under which only those would be allowed to manufacture in this industry who held licences.  They wanted themselves established as the people to give the licences.  They were not even going to allow those in the trade in their entirety to be in the licence-giving body. They wanted a certain number of people cut out.  They showed themselves in their proposals as clearly and definitely unfit to run an industry under any ordinary conditions of competition. They were even afraid of the limited amount of competition existing. They had made no special move to meet the requirements of the country in, say, higher-grade chocolates and they do not even represent as great a percentage use of home-produced raw material as the importing firms do.  I should say with regard to the vast bulk of the cream chocolates which come into this country, that they are really Irish exports reimported.  They are, in the main, butter, milk and cream, sent out of this country and brought back here in the finished state.  The home manufacturer is not producing from Irish raw material to the same extent at all as the importer was. Because of this, I see no reason whatsoever to give these people the increase they, presumably, have asked for.  This duty, I suppose, again, is meant to be prohibitive.  It is going to be prohibitive, but it is not going to be prohibitive merely of imported chocolates. It is probably going to be prohibitive of chocolate-eating.  It is going to be prohibitive of the eating of chocolates of a certain type, because the taste of the country in certain respects is not being met to any degree whatsoever by those engaged in the home industry.  I sat here throughout the debate that took place on this question previously, and listened to the particular arguments used.  There was no justification given for this huge increase.  There may be something to be said for helping, <Col N="1767" /> by way of a differentiated scale, for loading the tariff in a particular way against a particular type of chocolate, and for scaling that, so that if we saw the industry progressing, the scale could have operated, and could have slid up against the dearer commodities, but I think that, with the industry as it is, and with the failure that, to a greater extent, I may say, has marked the industry, there is no reason whatsoever why we should lump on this prohibitive tariff in this way.  It is one of the worst of the tariffed industries, and it certainly does not require any extra help at the moment, and does not deserve any extra consideration at this moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The value of the chocolate confectionery imported last year was just under £300,000.  The amount of labour represented by that import was very considerable, and in view of the fact that there appears to be no reason whatever why we cannot produce that chocolate confectionery for ourselves, we decided to impose a prohibitive duty to ensure that these imports would stop, and that the production of these goods would take place here, and that the employment represented by them would be given to our own people.  The imports have stopped and the industry is developing as we anticipated, but, perhaps, not as rapidly as it might have under somewhat different circumstances because certain doubts and uncertainties have been created as to the future.  These are now being resolved and development is proceeding.  The firms that were engaged in the industry heretofore are extending their productive capacity and one other firm which was engaged in this industry in a minor way&mdash;the well-known firm of biscuit manufacturers here in the city&mdash;are extending their capacity for production of chocolate confectionery quite rapidly, and giving substantially increased employment in that sphere of their operations.  The tariff, therefore, appears to be one which has justified itself.  It is also one which has involved a loss of revenue to the Government, because the prohibitive <Col N="1768" /> import duty which now operates stopped the influx of these goods entirely, while, formerly, as I have pointed out, there was a very valuable import on which a substantial rate of duty was paid.  However, the loss to the Exchequer is a small consideration if the substantially increased employment we anticipate follows from it, and, therefore, we think it would be a very foolish action for the Dáil to take to reduce this import duty in any way, or to give the impression that we were prepared to facilitate the importation of these goods, subject to revenue being paid to the Exchequer on them.</P>
      <P>I am afraid I must question the accuracy of the statement made by Deputy McGilligan that the chocolates imported represented in any form reimported Irish milk or Irish butter. The information available to me would seem to indicate that the firms which have been principally engaged in the importation into this State of chocolate confectionery did not use any Irish milk or milk products in their manufacturing.  Whether or not the Irish firms are using Irish raw materials to the extent they should is a matter that can be examined, but I have no reason to believe the contrary, or to believe that, if circumstances are favourable, as they now are favourable, we will not be able to get associated with this industry, certain kindred industries which will give increased output to the agricultural industry.  I have had, already, certain discussions in that connection with the Minister for Agriculture, and certain projects are under consideration. I think the amendment should be rejected and I ask the Dáil to reject it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister said about one large firm entering the industry in a substantial way provides more justification for this than anything he has said, because, undoubtedly what is happening, apart from that, from the imposition of this prohibitive tariff, is that a monopoly is being given to a group of manufacturers who are incompetent.  It may <Col N="1769" /> be that under the tariff that existed, the firms here could not have captured the whole of the home market in the superior grades, and it may be that some case could have been made for a small increase, but the difficulties before the manufacturers were not mainly due to greater advertising expenditure of outside firms or the lowness of the tariff.  The thing that held back the development of the industry here was that, for some reason or another, the home firms could not produce a good quality article.  It may be that there are secret recipes in this trade, and that it is difficult for a new firm to produce a good quality.  I do not profess to know at first hand, but I have questioned many people who are strongly in favour of the support of home industries, and I have got the universal testimony that the dearer grades of the home made chocolates were of very third rate quality, and I am certain that, to a large extent, the consumption of the imported chocolates will not be replaced unless the operations of the big firm which the Minister has referred to alter the position. Except for that, they will not be replaced by consumption of the home made chocolates.  The home made chocolates of the best grades are so much inferior in quality to what has been imported that there will be a reduction in consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very unsatisfactory thing to give a monopoly to a group of people who, heretofore, have not shown themselves able to produce goods in a quality at all comparable to what is imported.  It would be much wiser on the Minister's part to give them some small increase, to give them some little additional help and encouragement to improve the quality of their goods and fight for their market.  Instead of making them fight for the market and helping them to improve the quality of their goods and to give the public what they want, the Minister is presenting them with the market, and saying to the public &ldquo;You either eat these goods you are going to get from these manufacturers or you are going to do without.&rdquo;  I do not think we can get real industrial <Col N="1770" /> development along those lines.  I think it is a most wrong-headed policy.  Of course, it is of no great economic importance that these goods are not of the right quality, because they are all in the nature of a luxury, and it would not matter at all if their consumption went down, but it is because it is of a piece with the general policy of the Ministry to make the public suffer, to bolster up inefficiency and not to try to strike a mean between giving some reasonable help to a manufacturer and altogether disregarding the interests of the community as a whole, that I am opposed to this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is entitled the Diseases of Animals Bill.  The original Act in this connection was passed in 1878, and an amending Act was passed in 1914.  This is a continuing Act.  The Diseases of Animals Fund is made up by a local levy which pays half the amount that has to be paid under the Diseases of Animals Act in a particular county or county borough for the year, and the other half is provided from a Central Fund.  The Central Fund is collected from the whole country, also, by a rate, so that really the Diseases of Animals Fund comes altogether from local rates.  It is, however, complicated in this way, that a county pays half, even though it may have a very heavy charge for the year owing to swine fever or some other disease, and the other half comes from a general fund levied over the whole country. That levy from the whole country is got by a farthing or a halfpenny rate, as the case may be, each year, and it is put into the Central Fund for this purpose. Under the original Act, passed <Col N="1771" /> in 1878, there was authority to go only to 8d., that is, when the total sum of 8d. had been levied over the various years, it ceased.  The amending Act, passed in 1914, brought the total up to 1/-.  This Bill proposes to bring the total up to 1/6.  I do not know if there is any opposition to the Bill, which is really a continuing Bill of the Diseases of Animals Acts, 1878 and 1914.  The diseases that are dealt with under this Bill are particularly defined as tuberculosis, swine fever, glanders, anthrax and sheep scab.  The disease of foot and mouth is not dealt with under the provisions of this Bill, but it is dealt with in another way.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been very brief in his explanation of the meaning of the Bill.  Am I to assume that the amount of money in the fund is not sufficient to meet the demands made on it and hence the necessity for increasing the rate from 1/- to 1/6 or is it on account of the development of new diseases that it is found necessary?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>It is not due to the development of any new diseases but that the total levy of a farthing or a halfpenny added each year could only go as far as 8d.  Under the 1914 Act, it could go another 4d. and now we are asking another 6d, not that we are going to levy 6d this year but, for the years to come, it may amount to an extra 6d.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, and amendment 15 having a somewhat similar purpose, deals with matters which the Minister promised to consider.  At an earlier stage, the Minister promised to consider the points I raised in connection with this matter, and I have not had any indication from him as to whether his consideration led to any favourable result or otherwise.  I pointed out that there is a particular hardship imposed on rather the towns, than the farmers adjacent to the Border, by this particular tax.  So far as I know, the application that has been made in the past for a tariff was really for a tariff on governess traps, and vehicles of that sort, and not on farm carts or even spring vans that might be used by farmers.  I am suggesting that certain words should be struck out; we should have the result of leaving the tax a tax purely on governess traps and vehicles, vehicles for the carriage of passengers.  When the Minister was supporting the tax originally, he talked about the coach-building industry and it seems to me that the whole thing was being based on the consideration of employment in the coach-building industry.  I do not know whether he used the coach-building <Col N="1774" /> industry in such a way as to include in it the construction of farm carts.  So far as I know, there is no great importation of farm carts, and I think the Minister should agree to limiting the scope of the tariff to the matters that were dealt with in an application previously before the Tariff Commission.  I will move an amendment at a later stage, if the Minister does not accept this, to deal more specifically and more narrowly with the Border difficulty, but, of course, the Border difficulty would be met, as well as perhaps other difficulties, if this amendment I am now proposing were agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy wish to have the importation of new carts exempted from duty, or is his point that the farmer using a new cart for bringing in his produce would be liable to duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I was arguing about two things.  I deal specifically with that in amendment 15, but, in this amendment, I am just arguing that the case that was made for the tariff was a case dealing with the coach-building industry, and there has been no argument put forward so far from the Ministerial Benches in favour of a tax on farm carts or on spring-vans.  Perhaps the Ministry is fixed on continuing the tariff on these vehicles, but if they are not, and I have no reason to believe that they are, when I have heard no argument on these lines, the whole of the Border difficulty is met by dealing with that.  Is there any importation? I have not heard there is. The importation we have heard about is the importation of vehicles intended for the conveyance of passengers only, and I would like to hear what the attitude of the Government is in regard to the whole thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, this was put into the Bill after consideration. There is an importation of farm carts, but the principal importation is through the ports, and not across the Border.  They come, I believe, from Scotland more than anywhere else, and if this amendment were accepted it would have the effect of allowing the <Col N="1775" /> carts to come across the Border duty free and having a tariff on those that come in by sea.  I know that the Deputy did not mean that and that it could be made right, but the principal import is by sea from Scotland.  There is no great import across the Border from the Six Counties, and I think there will not be any undue hardship inflicted on anybody by this tariff or on those living over the Border, because there does not appear to be any imports from across the Border.</P>

      <P>I propose again to move that this duty be reduced.  I need not take up the time of the House with argument on the point, because it is a similar argument to that used in relation to the other duties&mdash;simply, that if there is to be a tariff there is no justification for making the tariff as high as is proposed here.  Any purpose that is required to be served could be met by a tariff of 33? per cent.  Goods that cannot be kept out by a 33? per cent. tariff in the present industrial circumstances here, ought to be admitted, and if the tariff is to be beyond that, it means an unreasonable burden on the consumer, having regard to the fact that the economic structure of this country, the whole economic fabric, rests on agriculture, which cannot get an advantage, practically speaking, from protection, but which must sell in the open market and which cannot bear to have costs put up against it as these tariffs are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>As the only course left to me, I am supporting this amendment of Deputy Blythe's to reduce the tax.  It was my original intention with my colleague, Deputy Desmond, who could better argue one portion of the case than I, to move on Committee the rejection of the <Col N="1776" /> section.  As I said a moment ago, when arguing, perhaps wrongfully, we were precluded from making our case on Committee Stage by the lapse of time, and we understood that, on this Stage, we were to be allowed to debate the amendment that was then on. However, we were not.  I am opposing the 75 per cent. tariff for the principal reason that it will be a considerable hardship on numerous small farmers and others who, at the moment, are the largest users of imported traps, and when I say imported traps, I include second-hand traps, which I believe constitute the greater portion of these imported vehicles.  Under this section of the Bill, the Minister proposes to add to these second-hand traps, a tax varying from 75 to 150 per cent.  This will possibly be a more serious hardship on the farmers and other users of this class of vehicle in this country than most Deputies, except those living in the country, realise.  Possibly three-fourths of the traps one sees farmers driving every day in the country to Mass and for other purposes are imported traps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has been a declining industry in this country.  The great makers of traps and such like vehicles in the State, hitherto, have gone into the motor trade, and if they make any traps at all, they are made as a side issue and at prohibitive prices.  Most of the people who are producing traps, practically all of them, have of late years gone into the motor trade, and, as I say, if they manufacture traps, they manufacture them at prohibitive prices, prices that the ordinary small farmer cannot afford to pay.  Of late years, farmers have been able to purchase the imported trap for anything from £15 to £20, quite a good trap and a trap that cannot be produced at the money here. This Bill proposes to add a duty of 75 per cent. to that £15 trap and a vehicle of lower value would have a greater tax added to it.  Outside of the extreme injustice that this tax does to the farmers, it will possibly have the effect of extinguishing two declining industries in this country, two industries which provided considerable employment for a certain <Col N="1777" /> class of workers, who, if they lose that employment, will find it difficult to procure another sort of employment. I refer to the livery and undertaking trades in the country, and when I allude to the undertaking business I allude to the horse drawn hearse business, and not to the motor trade.  Any undertaker in the country who carries on a large trade, knows full well that if it were not for the landaus and closed traps and other vehicles that he supplies when providing a hearse, he could not carry on his business.  As I said, this is a question which Deputy Desmond, who is in the trade, could argue better than I if he were here, but so far as I know, practically all the vehicles used by the livery people and undertakers are imported.  I do not know that I am right in saying that they are not made in this country, but I believe I would be right in saying that landaus and such vehicles are not at present being made here.  At any rate I am right in saying that the men carrying on the livery business and the undertakers who supply the needs of the country population in carriages and other vehicles, do get all their requirements from imported articles.  If this tax is persisted in, it will, to my mind, have the effect of driving the livery proprietors out of business and, in doing so, driving a considerable number of men, elderly men, men in the fifties and sixties, who have grown up in the trade, out of employment, and who, when disemployed will have no other avenue of employment.  This will certainly be one of the effects of this tariff if it is persisted in.  It was, as I said, my intention to propose the deletion of the whole section; but as that is not permitted, as the next best course, I heartily support the amendment by Deputy Blythe to reduce the tax from 75 to 33? per cent.</P>

It is ridiculous that this tariff should be hindered in the way proposed in the amendment.  If the Deputy goes on these lines his case will be that the Minister intends to kill the undertaking industry.  If better arguments cannot be found such amendments should not be moved.  The proposal is to reduce the tariff from 75 per cent. to 33? per cent.  The obvious conclusion must be that the Opposition are prepared to force the consumers to pay 33? more for imported cars, carts and carriages. They are prepared to fleece the consumer to the extent of 33? because they hold that with a 33? per cent. tariff the foreigner can send in vehicles. Under the tariff proposed in the Bill the foreigner cannot send in vehicles, but there is the chance with healthy competition here that prices will not increase.  It was stated here to-day, and it cannot be contradicted by the Opposition, that certain of these tariffs will have the effect of depriving the Government of a certain amount of revenue.  The only effect of the tariff which was put on by the last Government was to collect revenue at the expense of the consumers.  The same thing will happen if this amendment is passed.  The only effect will be to collect revenue while no adequate protection will be given to the home industry.  The tariff proposed in the Bill will prohibit the importation of newly made and second-hand vehicles. That will give a chance to home <Col N="1779" /> industry.  It cannot be said by the Opposition that the Irish coachbuilding industry cannot make coaches or carriages and supply the demand.  I think it is not fair on the part of the Opposition to obstruct in this way. Tariffs are either going to be a success or not.  They cannot be a success by the half-hearted protection which the amendment would give.  This country has to face the problem of building up industry.  It is a very big problem and must be tackled in a big way. Even risks must be taken when tackling it in a big way.  The claim that every tariff that is put on is going to hit the farmer, and the farmer only, is surely a ridiculous one. On another occasion the Deputy who used that argument claimed that the farmer is carrying the main burden of taxation on his shoulders.  Undoubtedly the farmer has been carrying the main burden, because there are no other industries to carry part of the burden.  I say that the farmer is quite prepared to support the Government in creating industries that will take the weight of taxation off his shoulders.  I understand the main outlook of this Government to be that industries must be created in order to lighten taxation on the farmer.  Arguments against this tariff were put up by certain Deputies who have no other interest than that of the profiteers.  The most ridiculous argument was put up by the Deputy who spoke last, to have the tariff 33? per cent. and to allow the foreigner to send in his vehicles and sell them at an enhanced price.  The Bill proposes to fix a tariff that will create healthy competition and give a chance to an efficient Irish industry.  By competition prices will be lower than they are at present.</P>

      <P>I think the statement of the last speaker, coupling undertakers and funerals, has brought the discussion into a very funereal atmosphere.  I think Deputy Cleary is not quite honest in twitting Deputy Bennett about supporting a positive tariff policy by substituting 33? per cent. for 75 per cent.  Deputy Bennett was at great pains to explain that he <Col N="1780" /> wished to have the whole section deleted as he was opposed to every part of it.  However, there was nothing left for him but to support the amendment moved by Deputy Blythe in order to forward his case.  I am very glad to hear from Deputy Cleary that coachbuilding is a very widespread industry in this country.  I do not know where it exists at present.  It has practically ceased to exist as far as the building of vehicles mentioned in the section is concerned, landaus, governess traps, and the class of carriage used in connection with funerals. I do not think these are made to any extent in this country nor are they likely to be.  As Deputy Bennett pointed out, the man who is going to suffer is the small farmer.  If he went to an Irish coachbuilder, such as Deputy Cleary speaks of, and asked him the price of a horse-drawn trap, a back to back trap, or a raleigh trap perhaps he would find that it was beyond his capacity to pay for.  These vehicles are imported second-hand and in good condition.  Owing to the prevalence of motor-cars in other countries they are sold cheap.  The farmer is enabled to buy them at a low price and to have a decent turnout going to Mass on Sunday.  Deputy Cleary and his Party would deprive the farmer of the advantage of turning cut in a decent trap, and would send him back to the springless cart, another corollary of the hairshirt economics.  I only want to point out that Deputy Cleary was not quite honest in his reply to Deputy Bennett, because even if a tariff of 33? per cent. is put on it will be prohibitive. We do not approve of that but this amendment is the best thing we can move to show our disapproval of the whole section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Neill put down a Parliamentary Question to-day asking me to suggest, or to take steps to substitute, in Bandon some industry to replace one that had recently disappeared. I think I am correct in saying that coachbuilding was once firmly established in Bandon and that a large number of people found employment at it.  I think the remnants of that industry still survive and that <Col N="1781" /> there are still people there engaged in coachbuilding.  I would suggest to those who are interested that they should consider what developments are now possible in the coachbuilding industry in Bandon in consequence of the imposition of the duty.  It seems to me that we have at present, and for a long time to come, a substantial market for horse drawn vehicles of one kind or another, which will have to be supplied from within the country. The position is that we are capable of supplying our own requirements. When the coachbuilders went to the Tariff Commission with an application there was no opposition from any quarter in respect to horse drawn vehicles of any kind.  The Tariff Commission recommended against the imposition of the duty, very largely on the ground that they considered that a duty was not necessary.  In my opinion they were wrong in that.  It is true that there are not very large imports of new cars and carts.  The great bulk of the imports are second-hand cars and carts.  It is the influx of these cars, often at ridiculously low prices, that injured the industry here.  It is true that farmers are not going to get second-hand cars at the very low prices at which they were hitherto available.</P>
      <P>We are going to preserve and, in fact, develop an industry of a kind which is very suitable to this country. It is an industry that was, at one period, fairly widely established; an industry that was associated with rural towns, and that requires a very high percentage of labour in relation to the value of the total output.  Skilled labour is available.  The skilled workers who were formerly engaged in the industry have been, for a number of years, unemployed in large numbers. For them the future looked hopeless, because they saw little prospect of being engaged at their own craft. That prospect is now bright.  The imposition of this prohibitive duty gives them the prospect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under all the circumstances, it is a duty that should be maintained at the prohibitive rate which was originally imposed.  There is no reason why we should permit the importation of any <Col N="1782" /> of these cars or carts.  The farmer who might have had the temporary advantage of being able to buy a cheap second-hand cart will undoubtedly lose, but at the same time we are going to do a great deal of good for the country and in the long run the farmer will be no worse off.  We are not increasing the cost of production.  It may be that individual farmers may have to go to Mass in a cart instead of in a trap.</P>

The amount of employment which this industry can give is very substantial.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 15:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 11, Section 15, before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) Farm carts imported by road from Northern Ireland shall not be liable to the duty imposed by the preceding sub-section.</P>
      <P>When I first raised the point dealt with here the Minister said he would consider it.  I do not know whether he is disposed to meet the point or not. As I pointed out, there are towns in the Free State&mdash;I mentioned one in particular, Clones&mdash;near the Border and other towns perhaps not quite as close to the Border and not quite as much affected, but they are still very seriously injured by this tariff.  The point is that these towns are market towns for areas in Northern Ireland. The farmers have been accustomed to go in there with their produce and dispose of that produce and they buy considerable quantities of household necessities in the towns.  The imposition of the tax on horse-drawn vehicles has meant that there are certain difficulties in the way.  While the farmer living quite close to that town and some distance away from another town may overcome the difficulties and still have the Free State town as his market town, the man in whose case the difference between the Saorstát town and some possible Northern Ireland town is not so great will not attempt to overcome the difficulty and will not continue to go to the Saorstát town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest, in the first place, that the importation of farm carts is a small matter.  I was not aware that there was any importation worth talking about.  Whatever importation there is will be an importation by ship.  No importation in the proper sense of the <Col N="1784" /> word, no additional importation, will occur if the Minister were to accept this amendment.  All that will happen will be that the farmer accustomed to visit Saorstát towns for market purposes will be able to come in under the old conditions.  There will be no formalities of any kind to comply with. He will drive his car up to the Border, will go across and will not be asked to have any document or to comply with any formalities.  I think it is necessary, in order to prevent Saorstát towns suffering a loss of trade, to relieve farmers of the formality necessitated by this tariff.</P>
    <P>I was told in the case of the town I have referred to that farmers accustomed to go there with pork had gone elsewhere rather than face compliance with any formalities there might be. The position has probably been very much eased as compared with the first few days of the tariff.  I think complete relief is the only thing that will prevent a number of marginal farmers &mdash;the people who can, without terrible inconvenience, go to a Northern town &mdash;being driven northwards.  I do not think any harm will be done by accepting the amendment.  It may seem illogical that a cart imported one way would be subjected to tax while if imported in another way it would not be subjected to tax; but in practice you will not have carts shipped to a Northern Ireland port, fitted there for transport by road and then dispatched to some destination in the Saorstát. This amendment will only have the effect of relieving the farmers of the need for complying with any customs formality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The object the Deputy has in mind is quite clear, but I doubt if any of the desired results would be achieved by adopting this method.  It might mean, for example, that a cart imported by ship at Buncrana would be subject to duty, but a cart imported at Derry and wheeled over the Border would be exempt from duty.  The difficulty the Deputy is trying to meet is one that I have discussed with the Revenue Commissioners.  It seems that by far the most practical way of dealing with it is the way we are <Col N="1785" /> attempting, namely, by interpreting the existing exemptions in such a way as to overcome the great majority of the inconveniences and difficulties that resulted from the duty.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are prepared to administer the duty in such a way that a cart driven by a farmer or his servant to and fro across the Border would not be held liable to duty at any time, even a new cart if it be used for the farmer's purposes. The difficulties that exist at present in relation to the Border and in relation to the transportation of farmers' carts across the Border would not be removed even by the insertion of an amendment such as the Deputy suggests, because there are large classes of goods now subject to duty which were heretofore free.  Numbers of these items are now subject to duty, such as poultry and meat, so that a certain amount of supervision would have to be exercised over the farmers' carts crossing the Border in the towns in the Border area.  I am anxious to reduce to a minimum the inconvenience caused to the farmers, and I am satisfied that the easiest way in which to do that is by administrative action. That administrative action is being taken and the inconvenience and trouble caused by the duty in that area is being reduced to a minimum by the instructions issued by the Revenue Commissioners to their officials and by the permission given to the farmers to bring their carts across the Border to and fro.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister what are the formalities that now exist?  Is the farmer able to drive up to the Border; that is to say, can a man who has not been crossing for some time, on signing a simple form go right through, or has he to give prior notice of his intention of going across?  How is the matter of admitting these carts arranged at the moment?  Some particularly simple formality would not deter the farmer but if he had to do anything substantial such as is the case with the motor car owner it would be sufficient to prevent the farmer from going into a particular town.  The people <Col N="1786" /> quite close to the Border would not be affected, but the people who have already the choice of another town in Northern Ireland would be affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that I cannot give the Deputy an outline of the arrangements made by the Revenue Commissioners, but as I understand them the formalities are reduced to a minimum.  Even in the case of new carts used by the farmers for their own purposes for visiting a market town, no prior notice is required. However I will make more definite inquiries.</P>

      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that it would be possible to get a form of words that would carry out his intention.  It seems to me that it would not be satisfactory that a Bill should leave this House in a particular form and that then the Revenue Commissioners would be instructed that they were not to carry out the Statute which the Oireachtas had enacted.  That would be most unsatisfactory.  I would ask the Minister whether he could not on the Report Stage devise some form of words giving effect to the intention now expressed in the House?  For instance he might say &ldquo;farm carts in actual use driven by the owner or his servant and imported not for the purpose of sale.&rdquo;  Just some form of words like that.  I am only giving a rough outline.  If the Minister could put in words like that then the Bill would leave the House and become Statute Law expressing the full intentions of the House; that would be more satisfactory than that the Bill should leave the House in a particular form with an undertaking that it would not be administered in that form.</P>

      <P>We do not propose to ask the Revenue Commissioners to exceed their powers under the Bill, but there are certain exemption provisions designed to deal with that situation already in the Bill and it was to this manner of the administration of these particular provisions that I was referring. The Revenue Commissioners can devise the method of administration <Col N="1787" /> which will reduce the inconvenience to a minimum.  These provisions are contained in sub-sections (3) and (6) of the section.  They exempt from duty an article imported previous to its exportation or an article that had been first imported prior to 6th May, 1932, or that the article had been imported on or after the 6th day of May, 1932, and the duty chargeable by virtue of the section had been duly paid thereon.  A cart imported by a person making only a temporary stay would also be exempt, so that there is ample provision there to exempt from duty the particular carts referred to.  The manner in which the Revenue Commissioners can ease the situation is by the administration of their powers under this sub-section.</P>

      <P>In moving amendment 16, I want to say the object of the amendment is to increase the amount <Col N="1788" /> of the exemption here from 5/- to 15/-. The Minister originally brought in sub-section (d) to exempt articles which do not exceed 5/- in value, so as to allow the farmers to get the small parts for their agricultural implements and machinery.  It was discovered in practice that 5/- is not a high enough figure and it is proposed to extend it to 15/- so that it would include parts in common use such as knives. The knives cost 10/-; a Pitman or connecting rod costs 11/6d.  These are wholesale prices.  These are parts of the machinery very often broken and they would cost between 11/- and 12/-; pinions cost 6/-; cranks 6/-.  In the case of ploughs the mould board will cost 14/6d. and a head 14/6d; a coulter will cost 6/-.  Now none of these will come within the limits of 5/-.  If the Minister will accept this amendment it will give people who have to import these parts an opportunity of procuring the parts free of duty.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is one which could not be accepted at all.  It would mean, with the exemptions to which we have already agreed, that no duty would be payable.  No duty is payable on 90 per cent. of the parts imported.  Quite a number of these parts could in fact be made in the existing factories here.  In regard to other parts they can be produced in the factories here.  The result of the exemption would be to defeat very largely the tariffs altogether.  I did not catch the names of all the parts which the Deputy mentioned. These knives are, I understand, made in sections.  The sections can be imported duty free under the exemption.  They cost about 1/- each.  In any case, most of the parts to which he refers can be procured through the Irish factories, even parts for foreign machines, and that applies particularly to ploughs. There is no reason whatever why this exemption limit should be increased.</P>

    <P>I have the same argument to apply in moving this amendment as in moving certain others of these amendments. It is with the object of asking the Government to consider again the imposition of a much more moderate tariff than they are at present inclined to impose.  I do not know what the present position is in relation to the building of motor bodies.  The Minister indicated when the matter was last before the Dáil that there were going to be great and immediate developments in this particular line.  I do not know whether there have been any definite negotiations or any definite promise held out of development of this industry along these lines. Certainly there is no prospect I should say of employment to the extent that has been frequently indicated.  If all the requirements of the country were to be made here, and if they were to be made by any sort of up-to-date and efficient process, the amount of employment that would be given would not be very considerable, taken on the whole, because the amount of machine work would be very great.  If they are not to be made by an up-to-date process, there may be a much more considerable amount of employment, but the burden on the consuming public is going to be very high.  I think in this respect the burdens are very much too great and that there ought to be a reconsideration of the proposal.  The Dáil has already accepted the proposal for a tax and it ought to be graduated and something that is more reasonable, and displays more consideration for the consuming public, ought to be adopted.</P>

      <P>The position is that we have to face up to the fact that unless a very substantial rate of duty were imposed we were not likely to get the minds of those engaged in the <Col N="1790" /> motor car industry to examine even the possibility of getting the bodies of these cars built here.  It is undoubtedly, true that in relation to the passenger car, the pleasure car, there are very considerable difficulties. We realised, however, that these difficulties cannot be overcome, I mean that no serious attempt will be made to face up for the purpose of overcoming them, unless a situation were created that those who wanted to continue in this particular form of business were forced into the position that they had to deal with the concrete fact of a very substantial duty.  As far as the goods-vehicle is concerned, the ordinary truck, or lorry, or motor of one kind or another, used for the conveyance of goods, the importation is stopped and the existing firms are at present engaged in the production of these things and doing it quite satisfactorily and successfully.  We realised always, and realise still that the really difficult end of the business was in the passenger car, because certain companies that sell the bulk of the cars used here are now building an all-steel body. Formerly the bodies were coach-built, and so long as coach-built bodies were the vogue the difficulties I refer to did not exist.  It was the invention, if I may say so, of the all-steel body that increased the difficulty of getting the building done here.  We have had various discussions, and are still having various discussions, with those who are thinking of engaging in that business, with those who are engaged in it, and with representatives of firms that are considering engaging in the building of bodies here.  Very substantial progress has been made.  Occasionally new difficulties are brought to our notice and, as the Deputy is aware, we have slightly extended our powers under the Bill, in so far as an amendment of an earlier section gives power to the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to exempt from duty any part of a motor body which is not manufactured in Saorstát Eireann.  That power was taken in <Col N="1791" /> order to deal with certain difficulties in respect of particular parts that emerged, but it is a power we do not intend to use except in very extreme circumstances; because, of course, as I said, we have found that we will not get people's minds concentrated on the solving of these difficulties unless they are convinced that there is no easy way out of it. While that attitude has been maintained we found that a genuine effort is being made to overcome these difficulties.  Some firms have succeeded in doing so and, undoubtedly, we will have cars with bodies built in this country available here within the time limit we contemplate.  Some firms now selling cars in this country may not rise to the difficulties. They have a somewhat small trade and they may prefer to lose that trade rather than to engage in the building here.  I do not know that that is likely to happen, because any firms who have difficulties to contend with, that is, firms using all-steel bodies, have all got a substantial trade as well.  It is only firms with a substantial trade that can afford to build here.  The main firm which sends in cars here has definitely got to the point when it should fix the date of assembly, because it is at present engaged in the installation of the necessary machinery and equipment for the purpose.  Discussions with the representatives of other firms are, in fact, going on at present.  Despite the fact that there are, undoubtedly, difficulties, I am confident that we will be able to get round them and get this industry established here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of employment which will be given is hard to estimate.  It has been said to be in or about five hundred persons.  Five hundred persons, particularly 500 skilled workers, and fairly highly skilled, is an important consideration, and if the imposition of this duty, with the exemption in respect of parts, which we have imposed, does result in the employment of these persons and the revival of the industry, we expect that fairly substantial benefits will accrue, not merely direct benefits in the employment of <Col N="1792" /> these persons but also benefits to other subsidiary and ancillary industries.</P>
    <P>Altogether the duty is one which certainly should have been imposed and one which if maintained, will produce much the greater part of the results which we anticipate.  As far as the goods vehicle is concerned it is completely justified.  I do not think that at any time there was any serious opposition to the imposition of the duty on the truck or the lorry.  In fact the Society of Irish Motor Traders by resolution some years ago when the matter was coming to the Tariff Commission, agreed to support the application in respect of the goods vehicles.  It is equally true in the case of omnibuses, there is no reason whatever for the importation of bodies.  They can be built here and in fact have been built here as cheaply and as efficiently as the imported body can be obtained.  In respect of the passenger vehicle and the difficulty which exists in connection with steel bodies, we are getting over these.  Even if it were found&mdash;although I do not anticipate that this difficulty will arise&mdash;that we could not get the all-steel body assembled here, and that we had to be content with a coach built body, we should not at all be in an unsatisfactory position because these bodies I am informed are quite efficient and in every way as satisfactory as the all steel body.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of people in the motor industry say that the all steel body is being pushed now because the firms engaged in the production of cars bought equipment in their first enthusiasm for the all steel body and, because it was extremely costly, they cannot afford to scrap it and get back into the fabric or coach built body.  The general tendency in the opinion of a number of people interested in the industry, as conveyed to me, was that the all-steel body will disappear in time and the coach built body reappear. If that should happen the difficulties in this industry would be considerably less, but even if that should not happen we can still get industry here of assembling the stamped parts of these parts. Considerable progress in that direction is being made.  There is still a month <Col N="1793" /> or six weeks before the exemption period expires.  In that period we hope to get over any difficulties in the way.</P>

      <P>Some doubts arose as to the exact meaning of the term &ldquo;adapt for sale.&rdquo; It is a term used in statutes before this.  On occasions the question was raised in court whether &ldquo;adapt for sale&rdquo; included packing or bottling for sale.  I have had an examination made but I am unable to find that any definite legal decision was given on the point on that question which arose in one or two cases.  It seems desirable therefore that, in order to remove doubt and avoid the possibility of litigation, the intention of the Bill should be clearly stated and that the term &ldquo;adapt for sale&rdquo; should be definite as including packing, bottling or labelling for sale.</P>

      <P>Can we have some information as to what the scope of the manufacture that was contemplated is, because I notice in the margin of the Bill &ldquo;restriction on the carrying on of manufactures.&rdquo; Now apparently a person who puts a pennyworth of peppermint lozenges in a paper package is packing for sale, so that there would be no difference between that class of person and Guinness's brewery under the Bill.  I ask the Minister does he contemplate the wholesale trade only, because if so he has not mentioned it.  If he is contemplating getting down to the absolute retail business, to a person who may pack sweets or toffee in penny packages in his shop, I suggest that the Minister should give us some information as to the stage at which he wishes to take any further notice of these people.  In other words does he wish to bring within the ambit of the Bill the whole of the retail trade, because, as far as I can read it there is nothing to show what is the size, or the scope of the business which it is intended to bring in under this Bill. Apparently, as I have said, it reaches a person who puts a pennyworth of sweets in a package of paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The person who puts sweets in a paper package is not packing for sale; he is packing after the sale.  The term used here, &ldquo;make, order <Col N="1798" /> or adapt for sale&rdquo; is a phrase used in previous legislation and has had a definite meaning assigned to it in a number of contested cases.  The principle in the phrase &ldquo;adapt for sale&rdquo; was questioned in certain cases.  We have had an examination made, and got a record of those cases, but we have been unable to prove that any judicial decision was given as to the precise meaning of the term, although in some cases the question was raised whether it included bottling or packing. In view of the fact that these questions were raised but no judicial decision recorded we have decided to define the term in the manner stated. It is intended that the scope of the Bill should extend over any manufacturing enterprise.  It is not intended to include the retail trade.  We contemplated the possibility of having an omnibus Bill that would include the retail trade, but decided it was not practical.  This Bill is not intended to apply to the selling of goods retail. In regard to this particular phrase &ldquo;adapted for sale&rdquo; it is true we must include the publican who bottles stout and one or two other operations of that kind.  We considered the possibility of excluding them but we decided it was better in the long run to prevent ambiguity and to make sure that the Bill did cover the particular form of enterprise we had in mind when we were subjecting these people to the scope of the Bill and making it necessary that a foreigner, proposing to engage in that particular business, should get a licence.  I do not think it is any hardship upon the community that a foreigner should get a licence. It brings the Bill slightly further than we intended, but we decided that it is better to bring it forward in this respect than to raise ambiguity as to the particular class of industry to which the Bill should apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised by the statement of the Minister that this does not apply to retail trade.  I should like if the Minister would point out what are the words that confine it to the wholesale trade or to manufacturers.  In the ordinary acceptation of the term one would think a person carrying on <Col N="1799" /> business for the purpose of gain might be engaged in the retail trade.  What does the keeping and carrying on of a shop mean?  I take it everybody who owns a shop works for the purpose of gain.  It appears to me to be perfectly plain, as I have said, that the Bill applies to retail business as well as manufacturing business.  If I am guilty of any oversight, or fail to see any limiting words in the Bill, I should be obliged to the Minister if he would point them out to me, but as far as I know there are no limiting words.  The Minister has drawn a very fine distinction indeed.  He says if you put sweets into a paper after you have sold them you are not putting them into the packet for the purpose of selling because the sale is complete.  So there is this very beautiful distinction according to the Minister that if there is a person in this country who can sell, say a pennyworth of sweets, provided he puts them into a paper bag after sale he is not packing for sale, but if he puts them into the little bag before sale, and then if he sells a pennyworth, he will be guilty of a very grave and heinous offence unless he has gone to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and got a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister does not mean that supposing a man is selling sugar and makes up in advance a pound of lump sugar in a bag in anticipation of what my friend here calls the rush hour and a purchaser comes in and he sells him a pound of lump sugar made up in a bag in that way&mdash; surely the Minister does not suggest that he is not within this Act if he makes up the bag in the purchaser's presence and that he is within the Act if the bag has already been made up in the manner in which I have suggested. If so, it is simply a farce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be an authority on farces.  I do not claim to be so, but if he reads the section it is not the carrying on of any business for the purpose of gain but the carrying on of a business for the labelling, packing or bottling for sale.  That is one which is contained in the Factories <Col N="1800" /> Acts and other legislation and means the manufacturing interests as distinct from a retail business.  The Bill is intended to do that and not include retail business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not got to Section 2 in which we can discuss the full effect of the measure and what it is intended to include within its scope. The words &ldquo;adapt for sale,&rdquo; as used further on in Section 2, are considered as being the packing, labelling, or bottling for sale.  The Minister says it is not intended for the retail trade. Personally, I think the retail trade should come in more than the manufacturing end.  If we have got to put up with this, it has at any rate saved something from the wreck.  Packing one can understand in a particular sense.  Bottling, particularly, we can understand.  Labelling, I cannot understand, if it is not intended to bring in the retail trade.  Even publicans who bottle are going to be brought within the scope of manufacturing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of packing for sale. Deputy Dockrell referred to the example of the pennyworth of sweets which are got up in packages or twists in readiness for the children who are let loose from school at halftime. Does the Minister know of the packing that goes on in anticipation of the rush?  These twists, as they are called, are got ready for the rush and does the Minister suggest that these retailers are to be reckoned as manufacturers hereafter?  That is packing in preparation for a sale or packing before a sale.  Does that come under the definition &ldquo;packing for sale?&rdquo;  I cannot see how it is going to be taken out of the scope of the definition. Take labelling for sale.  There used to be price labels on different goods. The type of label or tag depended on the commodity&mdash;such as meat.  There were labels or tags with a spike on them with which the thing could be stuck up.  The same applies in the clothing trade.  Price labels were sold with a certain hook at the back so that the label could be pinned easily on to goods displayed in the window. Take a draper who displays goods in his window.  He hangs on tags of this <Col N="1801" /> kind.  That is not labelling after sale. It is labelling for the purpose of sale. Are these drapers going to be brought within the scope of this?  The Minister says it is not his intention. I am arguing that the phrase does not carry out his intention.  When the Minister walks into any fruit or vegetable shop in which every article is labelled, is that to be considered a process of manufacture which will bring the ordinary greengrocer within the terms of the Act?  The Minister says it is not his intention, but surely it is going to happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The term &ldquo;adapt for sale&rdquo; is one which was devised and intended originally to include these particular processes of bottling, labelling and packing for sale, but in consequence of certain questions which had been raised and in consequence of the ambiguity of certain decisions given in regard to these questions, certain doubts had arisen. It does not make any difference, whatever, whether a certain person is to be called a manufacturer or not.  It is of very minor importance.  But within the scope of this Bill we get exactly what we want to get.  It may be possible, and is possible, that in order to ensure that we cover all the manufacturing processes that we have in mind we will also have to cover certain other processes, for the present, which we would prefer to exclude.  It will not prevent any citizen engaging in these industries. In certain cases the foreigner coming in would require to get a licence, and we prefer to take the lesser risk of going too far to not going far enough in respect of our definition.  I will use a word which I would prefer not to use&mdash;it is intended to cover the business of packing, labelling or bottling for sale, wholesale, that is, as a firm to manufacture, and not for sale retail, but it is not possible to put in that phrase, because it would be open to all sorts of evasions and ambiguities in respect of the Act and, secondly, it was decided to include the phrase as it stands there to clarify the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;adapt for sale&rdquo; in the manner that <Col N="1802" /> we suggested, and to operate the Act to ensure that no restrictions would be imposed in any quarter except in such quarters as were intended.</P>

      <P>I feel that these words, which the Minister endeavours to explain, namely, &ldquo;adapt for sale,&rdquo; will be liable to many interpretations.  I am rather concerned with regard to two commodities, and I want some information from the Minister as to how he will interpret the term &ldquo;adapt for sale&rdquo; in the case of, say, bread and milk.  The Minister is aware that, for hygienic reasons, bread is now packed in paper.  As we are all aware, that is quite an up-to-date way of presenting the bread.  We have also had milk distributed in bottles in the towns for many years. It is delivered by retailers with small caps used in the bottles instead of corks.  Will the Minister consider bread so wrapped in paper known as parchment&mdash;a very fine quality of paper&mdash;as coming within the ambit of this measure?</P>

      <P>The Minister has admitted that he cannot carry out what he wants to carry out because it would lead to ambiguities. He wants to exempt retail traders but he cannot because there would be an ambiguity.  Therefore, he is asking <Col N="1803" /> the House to do what he himself does not want to have done because of his inability to find words to carry out his ideas.  That is a very strange attitude for the Minister to take up.  The Minister talks about the meaning of &ldquo;adapt for sale.&rdquo;  As this section stood at the beginning, &ldquo;adapt for sale&rdquo; would have had, in my opinion, a comparatively restricted meaning because you would construe &ldquo;adapt for sale&rdquo; ejusdem generis, to use the legal phrase.  The words that went before would mean altering in some way to make saleable a particular article, but according to this extension of the words&mdash;a very broad extension&mdash;there is to be no alteration or anything of that kind.  Not only does it clearly take in the case of a retailer putting a lb. of tea or a lb. of sugar into a bag prior to sale, but it is sufficiently extensive to cover almost anything&mdash;even bottling peas.  A foreign greengrocer who had not lived here seven consecutive years who engaged in shelling peas, would be obliged to have a licence from the Minister.</P>

      <P>The word &ldquo;wholesale&rdquo; used by the Minister would need some explanation.  In country districts, a large number of traders distribute to smaller traders sugar and other commodities made up in paper bags.  There might be misunderstanding in cases of that kind.  In country districts, the business is usually a &ldquo;rush&rdquo; business.  A post office would have, about post hours, a large quantity of goods made up in anticipation of customers arriving just prior to post time.  In country villages, too, on Sundays, there are certain hours during which there is a rush.  Small farmers and labourers would do their marketing at a time when they would be in that particular village.  A good deal of revision should take place in connection with this question.  So much packing is done and so many small items are involved, that a considerable hardship would be inflicted, particularly in the case of the retailer in the country district who sells wholesale to small shopkeepers.</P>

      <P>I want to make clear that whether this amendment is carried or not the position will probably be the same.  I have been advised that there is some doubt amongst jurists that the term &ldquo;adapt for sale&rdquo; includes packing, labelling and bottling for sale.  There is some doubt amongst those who have had this question under examination on that point.  The amendment is inserted for the purpose of clarifying the position in regard to this Bill so that litigation will not arise.  Deputies have come to the point that they cannot see the wood for the trees. They are examining one particular phrase and they are losing sight of the Bill.  The phrase must be interpreted in the light of the Bill which is a Control of Manufactures Bill&mdash;a Bill which makes provision for the control of manufactures in Saorstát Eireann. The intention is&mdash;and I am informed by those responsible for the phraseology that the effect is that the Bill will apply only to those engaged in a process of manufacture, whether it be the complete process from the raw material up to the finished article or some intermediate process.  Any person engaged in a process of manufacture comes within the scope of the Bill.  The borderline case is that of the publican who bottles stout.  It is, I am informed, probable that the publican who bottles stout is within the scope of the Bill.  In that case, we would prefer to keep him there rather than risk ambiguity and have the law that any foreigner who, after 1st June, 1932, wants to engage in that business here, should have to get a licence.  I do not think there is any harm in having persons of that kind brought within the provisions of the Bill, though if we could get a clear border between those who are primarily retailers and those who are primarily manufacturers it would be preferable. The processes are so involved that it is not possible to get that clear definition. There must be borderline cases, at any rate, and the difficulties which will arise in that connection can be overcome only by wise administration.</P>

      <P>Have the <Col N="1805" /> Minister's legal advisers, when advising him, as he said they were, as to these words, given him an opinion as to what they meant standing by themselves or in the particular context in which they are now?  Naturally, they are controlled by their context, and I would press the Minister for an answer to this question&mdash;if his legal advisers told him that in construing a section of a statute the title of the Act would be taken into consideration by any Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get an answer to another point.  &ldquo;Adapt for sale,&rdquo; we are told, has a certain meaning in another piece of legislation &mdash;dealing with what?  Factories, I think, the Minister said.  The words &ldquo;sale&rdquo; or &ldquo;adapt for sale&rdquo; will bear a certain construction in that piece of legislation.  Has the Minister been advised that any interpretation or extension given the phrase &ldquo;adapt for sale&rdquo; in the Factories Act, arising out of the context of the Factories Acts, is going to be carried bodily into this phrase when used in what is described as a Control of Manufactures Bill?  I do not think that any lawyer would advise him in that way. Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has put the other point as to the title.  The Minister says that we cannot see the wood for the trees.  He fails to see his own Bill for the title.  The title has no validity.  The operative section is Section 2.  Does the word &ldquo;manufacture&rdquo; occur in Section 2?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The title has no effect.  It is not part of the law.  A judge might refer to the title in the last resort, but only in the last resort. This Bill refers to persons who carry on a business by way of trade or for the purposes of gain.  They are not to do &ldquo;any of the following things,&rdquo; and we get a list of things&mdash;&ldquo;make, alter, repair, ornament, finish or adapt for sale any article, material or substance&rdquo; and so on.  The word &ldquo;manufacture&rdquo; does not occur in the section and there cannot be a limitation placed on the section which is not there and which I say is, designedly, not there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1806" /> The operative section of the Bill does not contain the word &ldquo;manufacture&rdquo; from beginning to end. &ldquo;Business&rdquo; and &ldquo;trade&rdquo; are the two words that are mentioned.  The word &ldquo;manufacture&rdquo; or the words &ldquo;process of manufacture&rdquo; are deliberately left out.  The Bill, as I read it was, I think, designed to catch the retail trade.  We are told by the Minister to-day that that is not his intention. Does it carry out his intention?  I do not believe that it does.  This amendment is a very definite extension of the Bill as far as I can see.</P>

      <P>There has been a considerable amount of argument about this and we might be arguing it for the whole night and yet get no further, because we are dealing with what obviously must be a very difficult question.  We are trying to deal with a border line, and at some particular place the border must be fixed.  In the whole process of business there is a process of manufacture, a further process of manufacture, a yet further process of manufacture, a process of adapting for sale, and a process for actually selling retail or wholesale.  Somewhere along that line you must put a mark and say that one set of operations comes within the scope of this Control of Manufactures Bill and that the other set does not.  Where are we going to put the mark?  Wherever you put it there are certain cases in which it will be almost impossible to decide whether or not they should be regarded as within the scope of the Bill or without the scope of the Bill.  Our intention is that this Bill should apply only to those who are engaged in a manufacturing process of some kind.  We have got a form of words which appears to carry out our intention, although we realise that in certain aspects the scope of the Bill has extended a little further than we should have liked. But I do not think that any harm was done by that.  I do not think that any harm would be done if it were practicable to have a Bill which would cover the process of retail selling as well as the process of manufacture <Col N="1807" /> I think it would be probably necessary at some time to have legislation similar in principle with this dealing with the retail trade.  But for the moment we are anxious to confine the Bill to the process of manufacture and this form is the best that we have been able to devise for that purpose.  I agree that there will be certain classes in respect to which doubts will be expressed, and we could discuss these doubts for years without getting any nearer to agreement.  When the Bill was introduced we thought that the term &ldquo;adapt for sale&rdquo; by itself was sufficient for our purpose.  But certain doubts have been expressed in that regard arising out of certain judicial decisions based upon that term, and in order to prevent these doubts arising in respect of this Bill, we define the terms as including packing, bottling or labelling for sale.  It may be that it would be held in the Courts that the term &ldquo;adapt for sale&rdquo; does not include packing, bottling or labelling for sale; and in order to avoid any necessity for taking the Bill to the courts for interpretation we are putting in this definition section at this stage.</P>

Every retailer in the country comes under the scope of this Bill.  Every newsagent who puts up a newspaper in a wrapper and labels where it is to go to and every species of retailer in this country comes under the scope of this Bill.  The Minister says that he wanted to catch the manufacturers and in order to be sure of doing so he got a bit beyond the border line.  I suggest that when he said that he could not see the forest for the trees&mdash;he has decided to take in the forest in order to include the trees. That is the position.  He has gone far beyond the limit that anybody thought was intended by this Bill.  He said that that is in order to make assurance doubly sure.

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move amendment 3.  The words in the Bill are not very clear.  I am unable, in the absence of any explanation from the Government Benches, to explain what is meant to be conveyed by paragraph (a) of sub-section (2).  In any case, I think that any meaning it could have is narrowed unreasonably, having regard to the purposes of the Bill.  As the Bill stands, I think the President of the Executive Council&mdash;I mention him by way of illustration&mdash;would in 1923 or, in fact, at any time down to 1927, have been unable to carry on any business that involved the putting of a piece of paper around goods in this country without having a licence from the Minister for Industry and Commerce as he was not born in the Saorstát or in the area now comprising Saorstát Eireann&mdash;I do not know what the difference is there&mdash;and as he was, owing to his absence in America in 1919 and 1920, in the position that he had not been seven consecutive years in the country, he would have been unable, within the scope of this Bill, to carry on any business without a licence.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the words I propose, which follow the Constitution, are much more suitable.  This Bill is aimed at confining the ownership of certain classes of business to Irish people.  You probably cannot easily get a definition that will be completely watertight and not subject to criticism. A person may be born in Ireland, but that person in no sense of the word could be described as Irish.  He might have no interests in the country, no sympathy with the people of the country. You might easily have people whose parents are Irish who would have an enormously greater interest in the country than people whose parents might be foreigners, but who might be born in Ireland.</P>
      <P>When the Constitution was being devised, for the purposes of citizenship we admitted all who were born in Ireland or either of whose parents was born in Ireland.  What is good enough for citizenship should be good enough for the carrying on of these industries; it certainly should be good enough to authorise the packing of sweets or anything of that nature.  What is good enough for citizenship should be good enough for the carrying on of any business.  We adopted something of the same nature for entry into the Civil Service.  A person who would not be qualified under this Bill to carry on business in the Saorstát would be qualified to sit for competitive examination and enter the Civil Service and afterwards be engaged in very responsible official duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should try in these matters to have a certain amount of consistency. I do not want to suggest to the Government that they should alter the provisions of the Constitution in regard to citizenship or the provisions of the Civil Service Regulation Act in regard to eligibility.  The definitions in those Acts were the subject of a good deal of discussion and it was thought when they were adopted that they met the needs of the situation as far as they reasonably could be met.  Deputies on the Government Benches talk a great deal about the partition <Col N="1813" /> of the country and about re-union. We had that in mind when we considered the definition clauses in the Civil Service Regulation Act.  There are people who are outside the Saorstát not through any fault of their own and very much against their wishes. They are outside as a result of circumstances over which they have no control.  We felt we ought not to slam the door in the faces of people of that sort in regard to the Civil Service if they were willing to come and work here.</P>
    <P>Equally, it is not a far-sighted policy in regard to industries to slam the door in the face of other people and to treat them as if they had no interest in and no relationship with this country.  So far as the children of Irish parents who happened to be born in America or England are concerned, their interest in this country is quite likely to be as deep as the interest of a person who happened to be born here but who went out of the country; probably their interest would be greater.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether in drafting the Bill, the Minister had certain cases in mind; that he had in mind individuals whom we wanted to exclude&mdash;to make it impossible for them to carry on business here.  If he had anything like that in mind it was a bad principle on which to draft a Bill. It would be far better to look at this matter more or less in the abstract. The Bill proposes to be a permanent measure and the bigger considerations ought to operate in the minds of the Ministry to the exclusion of any sort of personal issues.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is aiming at in getting Irish nationality in the ownership of manufactures will be adequately served if he adopts my amendment, which sets out that the ownership must be that of persons born in Ireland or one of whose parents was born in Ireland.  It is going a great deal further than there is any precedent for to take the line that the Minister is taking.  I suggest it is certainly inconsistent to have a person eligible for citizenship, eligible for a place in the Government service, but ineligible to carry on the very minor <Col N="1814" /> operations in the nature of packing, for instance, that are now included in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two things that arise out of this amendment. There is first of all a definition of the term &ldquo;National&rdquo; for the purpose of the Bill.  In that respect let me say that I am not prepared or anxious to stand rigidly upon the definition contained here.  It seems to me to be a sound definition.  That people are excluded from the definition that should be included would apply to whatever definition one could get.  If any Deputy thinks there is a better definition possible and if he produces that definition he will find that I will not be unreasonable.  I realise that the definition there is not perfect.  It is possible that somebody might produce a better definition.  What I am not prepared to do is to extend the advantages which it is proposed to confer upon citizens of the Saorstát to engage in any industry here to persons who are not citizens of the Saorstát&mdash; persons resident or born in the Six County area.  That is I take it the main feature of the Deputy's amendment that these advantages which we confer upon our own citizens should also be conferred upon people in the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as including in that definition persons both of whose parents were born in the Saorstát I am quite ready to accept it.  I have no objection to that at all, but I see strong political objection to extending to persons in the Six Counties the same advantages and privileges that we give to citizens of the Saorstát&mdash;people who have been cut off from the purview of this State by partition and who are in the majority at any rate anxious to maintain partition.  So long as they are anxious for political reasons to maintain the Boundary there they must be prepared to accept the disadvantages which the Boundary implies. If these people want to have the advantage of trading in this territory, the advantage of direct contact <Col N="1815" /> with our people they can secure that advantage by co-operating with us for the termination of partition.  But so long as the Boundary is maintained and so long as there are persons in the Six Counties anxious to insist on the partition of the country, then these people must be prepared to accept the disadvantages as well as what they may consider to be the advantages of that situation.</P>

There must be somebody, some individual or collection of individuals whom it is decided to exclude and the House is entitled to know what that body or individual or individuals are and who the persons are who are to be excluded. The Minister has not given any indication of whom they are.  We have got two definitions, one, where a person derives as a citizen from the Constitution and the second definition where persons so entitled are now deprived of the advantages of engaging in business in this State.  I have got no brief for the President of the Executive Council.  Is there any reason why the President of the Executive Council was excluded?</P>

      <P>The Minister must have felt weak on the matter and thought he was getting off.  We have a definition of &ldquo;national of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  It has not been explained yet what it means.  I personally have some doubts which it may be possible to resolve, as to the meaning of the phrase in paragraph (a) &ldquo;a person born in Saorstát Eireann or the area now comprised in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo; If that word &ldquo;now&rdquo; had been &ldquo;at the relevant time&rdquo; I could understand it better.  What is the precise meaning of the phrase?  Does it mean that the Minister is taking the words &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; as covering all Ireland up to a certain date and, thereafter, that it will only cover the Twenty-Six Counties, and that a birth certificate will be required to find out whether persons were born in the Twenty-Six Counties area after a date in 1925?  Is that the purpose of the phrase?  I am anxious for information on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>Why 1925?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>1925 is the date of the Boundary settlement.  That is why <Col N="1819" /> I take it as the operative date.  If the Minister has some date in mind we should know what is the pivotal point of time around which this portion of his proposal is to turn.  That is one thing.  The second thing is what has just been urged.  At present we have a definition of &ldquo;national&rdquo; for citizenship purposes&mdash;for all the rights and duties of citizenship.  That right and these obligations are given to people in a wider way than in this phrase where they are &ldquo;those who were born in Ireland or either of whose parents was born in Ireland.&rdquo; The Minister is restrictive at present to the point of excluding from citizenship all those except people born in Ireland.  I am always remembering the second part, the seven years point, those whose parents were born in Ireland.  So that all whose parents were born in Ireland are still outside the scope of &ldquo;national&rdquo; as far as this is concerned.  We are told that the Minister is likely to consider an amendment sympathetically to bring inside the scope of &ldquo;national&rdquo; people both of whose parents were born in Ireland.  I am not sure whether he is going to that extent, or whether he is restricting it to &ldquo;both of whose parents were born in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  That is still a restriction on the constitutional position in regard to citizenship, because a person, either of whose parents was born in Ireland, can claim to be a citizen of the State.  Why the change?  There may be some reason. Either it is haphazard or otherwise there is reason for it.  Has it been found that the wider extension of the term, namely, that to be deemed to be a citizen of the country, a man must have been born here or either of his parents born here, has brought an undesirable class into the country?  Has it been found that our aspirations, or business capacity have been limited by the inclusion inside the term &ldquo;citizens&rdquo; of those people for the purpose of citizenship?  If there is no answer going to be given, we must simply take it that this was arrived at in a haphazard way, and there is no great reason for the exclusion of people either of whose parents was born in <Col N="1820" /> Ireland and limiting it to people both of whose parents were born in this country.</P>
      <P>We may be told that this Bill has a different purpose from the citizenship Article of the Constitution.  Of course it has.  But I should say that the interests affected here are less important than what was comprised in the term &ldquo;citizenship,&rdquo; and the class of people under consideration here are relatively less important and even the objects for which we are going to operate this here are less important than the whole wide scope that is given in Article 3 of the Constitution in relation to getting citizenship here in the beginning.  The Ceann Comhairle has said that it is not relevant to discuss nationality on this.  The whole question of nationality is coming in. I am wondering&mdash;I just ask the question&mdash;is this a forecast of what is in mind with regard to nationality hereafter?  Because, again, if it is, it is going to be a very serious limitation upon the wide freedom conferred by the Constitution and it has not yet been explained as being dangerous in any way that that freedom should exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he is ready to consider one extension only, and that is the inclusion in paragraph (a) of people who, although not born in this country, spring from parents both of whom had their origin here.  I object to that as a limitation.  I think that until a case is made the Article of the Constitution holds the field and no case has been made against it.  On the other hand, the Minister objects to the geographical extension from keeping it &ldquo;in Ireland,&rdquo; as it is in the Constitution&mdash;keeping it &ldquo;in Ireland&rdquo; at any rate.  He says he is going to keep it so that those who had their origin in the Six Counties after a certain date are to be excluded until such time as the Six Counties themselves are brought inside the geographical area of this country. That surely is against all that was inherent in Sinn Féin.  I always thought that one of the principles of Sinn Féin was that the minds and eyes of anybody who could be considered a <Col N="1821" /> national of this country should be centred upon this country and not turned away from this country.  There was a great drive in the old days to get people's eyes turned away from Westminster, to get their minds and eyes turned upon Dublin.  We were going to look for a centripetal sort of force instead of centrifugal, taking Dublin as the centre.  The Minister is departing entirely from that at present. He is going to penalise.  Why penalise?  I could imagine his taking power, since he has taken such wide powers of discrimination to himself in this Bill, to discriminate against certain folk, but he is going to penalise a whole class of them.  The question has been put to him that he may be penalising people who, if they could achieve the object, would be ready to have the Six Counties transferred under the Government of the Free State.  He is not going to give these people even the help they might have against folk who think the other way by pointing out to them the advantages that there are in having association of a particular type here.  The whole context of the Minister's argument, his whole outlook, is definitely away from what Sinn Féin used to be.</P>
    <P>One last thing.  The Minister said he is taking this clause with paragraphs (a) and (b) as being roughly what comprise citizens at present, as being more or less the conditions that achieve the acquisition of citizenship for a person.  I presume he knows that there is no person born since the Free State came into existence who is in fact a citizen of this country.  That has still to be rectified by legislation.  That is why I thought the Minister was giving a forecast of what is in the Government's mind with regard to nationality and the legislation which is still to come.</P>

      <P>I merely wish to state that the terms used here are in no sense to be taken as a forecast of what any measure dealing with nationality would provide for.  We considered only the narrow question raised by the Bill.  It is proposed to exempt certain classes from its scope. It is proposed that certain people can at all times engage in any form of manufacturing enterprise here without any restrictions whatever.  What classes should they be?  Persons who are born here and persons who had a long period of residence here.  These are the two classes we are including in the scope of the Bill.  I am prepared to agree if pressed to include persons both of whose parents were born here.  Let us consider the possibilities of giving privileges to persons within these classes without relation at all to what the Constitution provides for in respect of citizenship or what the Civil Service regulations provide in respect of entrance to the Civil Service or what the Nationality Bill to be introduced may provide for. The narrow question before us at the moment is to what classes should these special privileges be given in our nation.  I believe it would be inadvisable and unfair to the country and detrimental to the purposes of the Bill if these privileges were extended to any wider class than those provided for in this definition with possibly the amendment I have suggested.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that in this amendment we are proposing to reduce the period in which a man must be domiciled in Saorstát Eireann to three years.  In my opinion, the provision in the Bill absolutely rules out anybody who has taken up residence for trade purposes. At the present time it is exceedingly difficult to get manufactures started and to get employment for our <Col N="1825" /> nationals.  We see that while other countries are engaged in putting every inducement they can in the way of people who wish to manufacture, we are busy piling on difficulties for them. I should like to suggest to the Minister that this period of three years might in certain circumstances become very important.  A man might make a very important invention and this very question might decide him as to whether he would take the manufacture under it to some other country. Remember that success in manufacturing is composed of a number of small items, each one of which is almost so small as to be negligible.  I would suggest to the Minister that he cannot be too easy in facilitating people in starting manufacturing in this country. The fear of a thing is often very much worse than the thing itself.  If a man has to consider whether he will get a licence or apply for a licence it may just make all the difference to him as to whether he will embark in industry in this country or not.  I would appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

The proposal here is that a person who is not a citizen of this State, who had no previous connection with this State, should be regarded as a citizen and given all the rights of citizenship after three years' residence.  I do not think that the Dáil could agree to that.  I think that the period provided for in the Bill is a reasonable period and that any shorter period would tend to make the Bill entirely inoperative.</P>

      <P>May I point out that the case the Minister instanced to-day, in reply to a question from a Deputy, was mainly that of an owner who may have fallen ill?  May I instance a similar case, if he forces this question of seven years' residence, that might happen?  Some of the manufactures of this country are of a highly technical character.  A man who has been carrying on a business may, for some <Col N="1826" /> reason or other, be unable to continue to carry it on.  He has got to get somebody with technical skill to continue that business.  Perhaps that person cannot be found on this side. What is he to do?  Is he to close down his business?  Let me give an illustration. A man dies who had been carrying on a highly skilled business. His executors are unable to get anyone to carry on, but it is necessary to maintain the business.  How is it to be maintained?  The executors can carry on to a certain period.  If the period of three years is accepted a person could get qualified.  A man will not give his skill and operate a business unless he is going to get control or become owner of the business.</P>
      <P>Under the Minister's Bill he would have to wait seven years before he would have an opportunity of controlling that business.  It appears to me that the Minister is placing difficulties in the way of nationals carrying on their business that he is not placing in the way of non-nationals.  A non-national who gets a licence for a business can give that licence to another non-national, and the Minister cannot object.  But in the particular case I mentioned the Minister can close down the business which he cannot do in the case of a non-national.  In other words, he is putting difficulties and restrictions in the way of nationals, which are not imposed on non-nationals.  That does not appear to be reasonable.  If he had to take powers in certain circumstances it would be different but in all cases to say that the person must have seven consecutive years to qualify him before he can carry on a national business is a very serious matter.  I think the Minister ought to consider a proposition of this kind in the interests of our own nationals.  I press upon the Minister to say whether at a further stage he will not consider this aspect of the problem and bring up some further proposal to meet the case put forward.</P>

      <P>The Deputy seems to be arguing altogether away from the point of his amendment.  The Deputy says that if a person is carrying on a business, when he wants to sell it he <Col N="1827" /> cannot sell it to a foreigner without obtaining a licence.  That is quite true.  It was for that the Bill was introduced.  It was introduced to make it impossible for foreigners to acquire the ownership of industries established in this country unless, in the opinion of the Government, it is desirable that they should do so.</P>

      <P>I do not.  This Bill is designed to deal with the position created by the fact that a foreigner, of any kind, up to now could obtain immediate ownership of an industrial enterprise here.  The Bill relates only to ownership of industrial enterprises. If a person is carrying on a business here he can bring in an Englishman or a Scotchman for his business or 20 Englishmen or 20 Scotchmen, and there is nothing in our law to stop him.  If he brings in a Frenchman or a German the law will stop him.  That is one of the anomalies of the law.  This Bill deals only with the ownership of businesses and with persons who want to sell their business.  They can sell to any other citizen of the State without restriction, but if a man sells his business to a foreign ownership, then under this Bill a licence is necessary.  And it is in the power of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to stop it, if he believes it to be in the national interests to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to <Col N="1829" /> the narrow point between the seven years and three years.  On Second Reading I asked the Minister to give me some statement as to legislation of as drastic a type as this in any other country.  I phrased my questions rather precisely, but he did not answer.  He gave examples of certain discrimination by way of taxes operating in certain countries against foreigners, and a few things like that of which I knew.  Is there in any of the countries he mentioned, in reply to me, to be found a difference made between the period prescribed for national purposes and the period prescribed for obtaining licences to do business?  For instance, has he any knowledge of what the conditions obtaining in Norway are, as to whether or not in certain cases a very limited period of residence is required in order to be deemed a national for Norwegian purposes?  I understand, in some of the countries mentioned, and in other countries that could be mentioned, where they have certain restrictive legislative taxes there is a differentiation made between the period required to qualify for citizenship, and to qualify for admission on the payment of admittance taxes. That is a point that the Minister might enquire into before the next stage.  I think he will find there is a difference which would point this moral, that countries which have to discriminate against foreigners coming in by way of licence taxes do not operate their nationality law in all its rigidity upon business.  At one time the period in Norway was as low as a year.  The phrase ran in a negative way that no person could qualify to be a director of a Norwegian company unless he passed twelve months in that country.  There is a case to be made for something less rigid in connection with business enterprise than with citizenship or nationality. There is considerable rigidity in the qualifying period for nationality, which ought to be something longer than the qualifying period for taking out the licence under this Bill, and from that point of view there is a case for a shorter period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1830" /> Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the word proposed to be left out stand part&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 6.</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), after line 27, to add a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(c) A person who has become entitled to the beneficial ownership of a business or of a share therein either through the bequest or on the intestacy of a national of Saorstát Eireann as defined in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said, speaking of this Bill, that it does not place any new restriction of any kind on any industry now existing in this country, or upon any industry if established in this country by citizens of this country. Under the Bill as introduced a national will not have the same powers of disposal over his business as he has at present.  If that is not introducing a restriction or a limitation, I do not know what the word means.  This undoubtedly is a limitation, and one which may have very serious effects where it often happens that the next of kin may live in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales.  A man may have a business, and his family may be scattered, and he gets old and he wishes someone to succeed him. The Minister also said the firms engaged in industry here are for the most part small firms.  They represent the enterprise of private individuals who risked their savings in a pioneering attempt to establish certain forms of manufacture.  Surely you must have continuity in business if a small business is to establish itself and grow, and surely the avowed object of the Minister is to promote industry in this country.  Why then is there this limitation when a national goes to dispose of his business?  The amendment only asks for powers to bequeath the business or, in the case of an intestacy, that the business should pass unfettered to the next of kin.  Where a foreigner applies for a licence and it is granted, such licence remains in force, and must under Section 7 be transferred with the business.  Why, therefore, is there this discrimination against <Col N="1831" /> a national?  The foreigner gets a permit to hand on his business to a foreigner, and why should not the national be placed in the same position?  If a national dies and bequeaths his business to a foreigner, possibly his next of kin, maybe his son or daughter or somebody else who has been for a number of years in Northern Ireland. Scotland, England or Wales, the owner (for such would be the owner) may be debarred from carrying on the business and the bequest becomes valueless unless he can find a national to purchase the whole of the controlling interest in the business.  If that is not imposing a limitation on the national as opposed to the foreigner, I really do not understand what this Bill means. I give the Minister credit for suggesting that he wants to give the utmost power and the widest scope to his own nationals to carry on business, but it really seems to me, in the case of a national business, that it is in danger of being over-laid by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and I would suggest to him that he should consider this amendment in the interest of fair play between his own nationals and foreigners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is not one which can be accepted.  It is in conflict with the principle in the Bill. It proposes a very wide extension in the cases in which no licences would be required.  If a national bequeaths his business to a foreigner a licence will have to be necessary.  I think the Deputy is wrong to assume that any unreasonable attitude will be adopted by any Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;</P>

It proposes a very wide extension in the cases where no licences would be necessary, and would involve a very great departure from the <Col N="1832" /> original scheme, which could not be considered.</P>

    <P>(a)  where a national of Saorstát Eireann dies and is at the time of his death the beneficial owner of any shares in a body corporate, <Col N="1834" /> such shares shall, until the grant of probate of his will or letters of administration of his personal estate, be deemed to continue in the beneficial ownership of a national of Saorstát Eireann, and upon such grant being made the personal representative of such national shall, so long as he is entitled to such shares in his representative capacity, be deemed to be the beneficial owner of such shares and, if he is not a national of Saorstát Eireann, to be a national of Saorstát Eireann; and</P>
    <P>(b)  where a national of Saorstát Eireann becomes a bankrupt or carries an arrangement with his creditors and such national was at the time of his bankruptcy or arrangement the beneficial owner of any shares in a body corporate, and his interest in such shares becomes vested in his assignee in bankruptcy or a trustee of the estate of such national as an arranging debtor, such shares shall be deemed, so long as such interest remains so vested, to be in the beneficial ownership of such assignee or trustee, and such assignee or trustee shall, so long as such interest remains so vested be deemed, if he is not a national of Saorstát Eireann, to be a national of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>(3)  Every person who does any act which is a contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds together with, in the case of a continuing offence, a further fine not exceeding ten pounds for every day during which such offence is continued.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where a person is charged with having committed an offence under this section, the onus of proving the matters or any of the matters mentioned in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g) respectively of sub-section (1) of this section shall lie on the person so charged, and until the contrary is proved it shall be presumed that none of those matters is applicable <Col N="1835" /> in relation to the act alleged to constitute such offence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are different references in the different sections but the idea is common.  I would like to be allowed to consider how far they absolutely fall when we come to consider Section 5.  It is proposed under amendment 10, which relates to the operative section of the measure, to cut out all these phrases that occur mainly in lines 30 and 31, that is to say, to substitute for certain phrases here now as follows: &ldquo;to do any of the following things in the course, or as part, of such business, that is to say, to make, alter, repair, ornament, finish, or to adapt for sale,&rdquo; the simple word &ldquo;manufacture.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alternatively, amendment 11 proposes to get these various processes in Section 2, as it stands, limited in this way&mdash;to do any of the following things... to make, alter, repair, ornament, finish or to adapt for sale any article, material or substance or any part of any article, material or substance &ldquo;as materially to alter the nature or character thereof and substantially to add to the value thereof.&rdquo; That gets us back to the main purpose of the measure of which Section 2 is the operative section.  When arguing previously on an amendment <Col N="1836" /> to the definition section, the Minister did say, I think in an unguarded moment, that the whole of the phraseology had to be considered within the framework of the measure itself and that the measure itself was a Control of Manufactures Bill.  At that time, I pointed out, and was joined by other Deputies in pointing out, that the word &ldquo;manufacture&rdquo; nowhere occurs in the operative section. We got, I think, the Minister's tacit admission, in the end, that the phrase used in the title was of very little effect so far as the scope of the Bill was concerned.  This Bill, according to the Minister's statement of his own intentions, is aimed only at manufacturing processes and controlling those who engage in manufacture but it is so drawn that it will take in anything which can be interpreted to be covered by the phrase in that section &ldquo;to make, alter, repair, ornament, finish or to adapt for sale any article, material or substance.&rdquo;  Take that one word &ldquo;repair.&rdquo;  Sewing a button on a garment is &ldquo;repairing.&rdquo;  Is it intended that the person who, in the ordinary course of sale-business, engages in repair should be brought within the scope of this measure?  At the beginning, when I heard the explanation of the measure, I should have thought not.  I am beginning to doubt now what is intended.  Take the word &ldquo;ornament.&rdquo; I know that certain types of ornamentation which are affixed to a variety of materials are in the manufacturing line but there is a tremendous amount of ornamentation of a trivial type which would not come within the second phrase &ldquo;materially to alter the nature or character thereof and substantially to add to the value thereof.&rdquo;  Then we have the phrase &ldquo;adapt for sale.&rdquo; It was because the phrase &ldquo;adapt for sale&rdquo; appeared so loose in the context of this Bill that I tabled these amendments. This evening we have got that phrase still further extended.  We have got it extended to cover packing, bottling or labelling for sale.  It was pointed out, when that amendment was being discussed, that anybody who labels&mdash;and most traders label&mdash;will certainly be deemed to be <Col N="1837" /> inside the scope of this measure and, if he is not a national, he cannot carry on except under licence given at the discretion of the Minister.  The whole scope of the measure turns upon this phrase.</P>
    <P>Remember what the licence means. The licence is to be granted at the absolute discretion of the Minister. The licence may grant to the person who makes application leave to do all, or some only, of the things he asks leave to do, or the licence may be refused.  When granted either in whole or in part, it may be granted subject to such terms and conditions as the Minister thinks fit to specify.  We were told&mdash;it was insisted upon on Second Reading&mdash;that one of the guarantees in this was that once a licence was granted it could only be withdrawn on application precisely made for its withdrawal or for an offence.  The hint was rather conveyed that the offence would have to be proved by a court process to have been committed.  But when the Minister can himself say what he considers to be the proper terms to be imposed on the licensee and when he is to be&mdash;as he is to be here&mdash;the judge of the relevancy of certain information which he can demand, the court is thrown very much into the background and the Minister has complete control not merely of the grant or refusal of the licence but of the insertion of conditions.  He may afterwards request information which, in his opinion, is relevant, and not to furnish information which he thinks is relevant is a breach of a condition which may lead to the withdrawal of the licence.  That is the licensing system and it is going to be applied&mdash;to what? The Minister says manufactures.  The measure itself does not say that.  In the operative section&mdash;Section 2&mdash;the notable thing is that the word &ldquo;manufacture&rdquo; is nowhere used.  We do get the word coming into the context of the Bill later on, when reference is made to the granting of new manufacture licences, but in this section&mdash;the operative section&mdash;the word &ldquo;manufacture&rdquo; does not make its appearance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1838" /> It is proposed to do by these alternative amendments what is declared to be the intentions of the Government. All these phrases can be cut out and the simple word &ldquo;manufacture&rdquo; put in.  That would mean that the section would read: &ldquo;It shall not be lawful for any person who carries on a business by way of trade or for the purposes of gain to manufacture for sale any article...&rdquo; unless the conditions set out are fulfilled.  Alternatively, let us keep these phrases, as they are probably considered to be of value in describing certain variations in manufacturing processes, and let us limit them by some of the phrases which ordinarily are used when manufacturing processes are described.  I think that these words in amendment 11 have the sanction of many pieces of legislation dealing with manufactures.  The section would then refer to the doing of any of these things so &ldquo;as materially to alter the nature or character thereof and substantially to add to the value thereof.&rdquo; It would be interesting to hear from the Minister what grievance he has against the phrase proposed.  I should be glad if he would indicate what he thinks is going to be kept out by the use of this phrase which he intends to catch by the measure itself&mdash;not by the phraseology, because I think it is very loosely drawn and the scope is very far flung.</P>
    <P>But does he really want to catch as a manufacturer the person who, in the course of business, sews buttons on garments, or does any small repair of that type?  I do not know whether he considers that a boot repairer is a manufacturer, and whether that type of business should be brought within the scope of the Bill.  I do not know whether ornamentation of a trivial type is to be brought within the scope of the Bill.  In the discussion we had on this matter previously, I asked if the Minister intended to bring within the scope of the Bill people who packed or did up for sale.  The Minister has given me further examples to-day&mdash;the wrapping up of sweets in twisted pieces of paper, and the labelling of articles, as every trader labels articles in a shop window, which <Col N="1839" /> is labelling for sale.  Is it intended to bring all these things within the scope of this measure?  If so, why not go boldly out and say &ldquo;manufacture or sell&rdquo; and clearly and distinctly bring in not merely the manufacturing end but the retail end?  It would be a much easier method to administer, and it would be much easier to get simple definitions if the Minister adopted that policy.  There is a great deal more to be said, in the industrial state we are in at the moment, for limiting the retail end of things to nationals than for limiting the manufacturing end, but certainly in the state in which we find ourselves there is no case for doing both.  If this Bill is going to do it in regard to manufacturers, then let it be so defined.  Let us know what is in the Minister's mind, and let us see can we get a phrase for it.  I am moving, as alternatives, and I would like to have them discussed together, amendments 10 and 11.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy has any strong sentimental attachment to the word &ldquo;manufacture,&rdquo; and would like it inserted in that section, I cannot, at the moment, see any reason why it should not be inserted, but I think a necessary consequential amendment would be a new paragraph in the definition section to the effect that the term manufacturer shall be taken as including making, altering, repairing, finishing or adapting for sale.</P>

      <P>I have been advised that my purpose, which was to confine this Bill to persons engaged in manufacturing enterprises, is met by the insertion of that particular form of words in that particular section, in that particular manner.  What is the alternative suggestion?  The alternative suggestion by the Deputy would create a new host of difficulties.  Not merely would it obviously limit the scope of the measure to a substantial extent, but it would also give rise to another set of questions as to what &ldquo;material alteration in the nature or character of the substance&rdquo; is.  We want to bring subject to this Bill, for example, the business of packing peas in bottles.  We want to bring subject to this Bill the business of blending and packing tea, of packing salt, and of packing patent medicines and things of that kind.  Is any one of these processes capable of being described as &ldquo;material alteration in the nature or character of the substance&rdquo;? I do not know.  It might be held that the packing or bottling of one of these substances would be a material alteration of the nature or character of the substance, but it is not clear, and, instead of resolving the difficulty which the Deputy sees arising in this amendment, he would create a new host of difficulties if his amendment were accepted.  I think the safer course to take is to stick to the term which is used in existing legislation, and which, in a law court, has a clear meaning, and to keep it in the Bill, knowing that under any circumstances <Col N="1841" /> the effect of this Bill on individuals, or on the course of industrial development here, is going to be determined, not so much by the words contained in it, as by the spirit behind its administration. In so far as it is intended that the Bill should apply only to persons engaged in manufacturing enterprises, if it were found, and I do not think it is likely to be found, that, in fact, the form of words used extends its scope to cover some other form of activity, then, obviously, those responsible for its administration would feel themselves obliged to restrict their activities, to restrict the Bill in operation to those engaged in manufacturing enterprises until the necessary amendment could be effected in its terms, but the term used there is, we are advised, that best suited to give effect to our will in this matter, and our will and our wish in this matter is that this Bill should, in its scope, extend only to manufacturing enterprises and to no other form of manufacturing activity.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister on the last occasion, and he rather gave me a different answer, had he been advised that the definition which applied to a phrase like &ldquo;adapted for sale&rdquo; in other legislation was going to be carried bodily into this Act, and he rather said &ldquo;no.&rdquo;  Surely it is clear it will not.  Would the Minister consider this: the word &ldquo;surgeon&rdquo; can be used in regard to veterinary practice and it can be used in regard to medical practice and to dentistry.  Does the Minister say that whatever interpretation was attached to the word &ldquo;surgeon&rdquo; in a Veterinary Bill would be carried into a Dentists Bill?  The word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; is a word generally used.  It is used in regard to house property, in, say, town tenants legislation and things of that nature.  Supposing we come to legislation dealing with sanitation <Col N="1842" /> and supposing we come again to legislation which is to deal with Factory Acts and the observance of certain conditions.  Is the definition that goes with the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; for the purpose of landlord and tenant going to apply to the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; when introduced into sanitary legislation? Clearly not, and yet that is the case the Minister is making, that these phrases have a definite meaning.  They have in a certain piece of legislation in the past.  I have said to him, by means of this or in some way, let the word &ldquo;manufacture,&rdquo; not extended by these words, appear somewhere in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, certainly, in the absence either of any extending terms or limiting terms, a definition which will be given ordinarily by the courts, but mainly it is an etymological definition that the Minister has.  The Minister says that he put to certain advisers &ldquo;cover me for manufacturing processes,&rdquo; and they dealt with it in the etymological sense of anything that was done by hand, in which there is a hand process performed.  Sewing on a button is manufacturing, if you take the mere meaning of the word, but it is not manufacturing in the sense of the word &ldquo;manufacture&rdquo; that the Minister wants to get, in the sense of industries in the country, as we ordinarily understand it.  But this is to be brought into the scope of the Bill as it is.  That is no answer.  You may say &ldquo;very good, take that definition,&rdquo; but a border line has to be put somewhere, but do not attempt to make the excuse that because a certain meaning applied to this phrase in another piece of legislation, it is going to apply here.  It clearly will not.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (1), paragraph (b), <Col N="1845" /> line 46, after the words &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;provided always that where such business is at the time such thing is done owned by a body corporate which has been incorporated subsequent to the passing of this Act it shall be sufficient for the purposes of this Act if during the period of the first seven years after the date of its incorporation the issued capital of such body corporate is to an extent exceeding one quarter (in nominal value) thereof in the beneficial ownership of a person who is or of two or more persons each of whom is at that time either a national of Saorstát Eireann or of a body corporate the issued capital of which is at that time to an extent exceeding one-half (in nominal value) thereof in the beneficial ownership of nationals of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I move this amendment with the object of facilitating the establishment of a company in the first instance.  I will ask the Minister to accept this amendment.  It leaves a period for foreign shareholders to qualify as nationals.  As I stated on a former occasion, it makes the way easier for a company so that some part of the technical knowledge, etc., may be provided by foreigners.  I suggest that as long as the Minister's object is achieved after a certain time he may very well give a period of grace during which the company may be nationalised in the full sense.  I have much pleasure in moving this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the amendment could not be accepted.  It cuts across the principle of the Bill.  The purpose of the amendment is to facilitate the establishment by foreign companies of manufacturing enterprises here, without the obligation of procuring a licence.  The intention of the Bill is that there should be certain powers of planning and control in relation to industrial development, so that, if necessary, we could limit the extent to which foreign capital, foreign companies, and foreign individuals might engage in industrial manufactures.  In <Col N="1846" /> the case of a company which it is considered desirable should be established, or establishing an industry of which there is need, or engaging in any particular form of industrial activity which heretofore has not been established, power will be given, or there will certainly be no difficulty in procuring a licence.  The intention, however, is, that there should be power of control in certain cases.  This amendment is designed to destroy that power of control, and to make it possible for a company to establish an industry here without the obligation of getting a licence, although in fact under foreign ownership.  That is undoubtedly the purpose of the Deputy's amendment.  If it is obviously desirable that a particular company should be allowed to operate, a licence will be available.  If it is not desirable, and if there are good reasons in relation to the industrial situation why such a company should not be permitted to operate, there is no reason why the power given under the Bill to prevent it should be limited or evaded by the insertion of a provision of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that while what he has stated is absolutely correct, probably in a particular instance he will be very much inclined to facilitate people who want to start manufacturing, unfortunately, in practice, he will not find the occasion arising just as he hopes. The Minister has envisaged the case of a person who goes round to him and asks for the best terms he will give for starting an industry.  In practice, I suggest that something quite different happens.  A manufacturer who is contemplating starting an industry in the Free State will endeavour by post to secure a position and he will get a number of replies by post.  He will make his decision without ever getting near the Minister for Industry and Commerce, even though the Minister, as he suggests, will be in a very complacent mood.  I suggest that he is sacrificing the substance for the shadow.</P>

      <Col N="1847" /> 15.  In sub-section (1) (c) to delete all words from and including the word &ldquo;would,&rdquo; line 51, in page 2, to the end of paragraph (c), page 3, and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;is authorised by the memorandum and articles of association of such body corporate; or.&rdquo;&mdash;(Patrick McGilligan.)</P>
    <P>16.  In sub-section (1) (c), page 3, line 1, to delete all words after the word &ldquo;been&rdquo; to the end of the paragraph and substitute the words &ldquo;within the memorandum of association and articles of association of such body corporate which were in force on the said 1st day of June, 1932.&mdash;(John Good; Henry Morgan Dockrell.)</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 16, which is practically of the same character as amendment 15.  The amendment suggests that the latter portion of sub-section (c) of Section 2 should be deleted.  The object of the latter portion of the sub-section is to limit business to exactly the same lines of business and the same departmental control as existed on the 1st June, 1932.  The Minister will agree that if a company wanted to get into any department that they were not in at that date they would have to get a permit. The object of the amendment is to limit them to such business as is set out in the articles of association.  If the Minister does not see his way to concede this right to these companies it will mean that on the day the Bill becomes law more than 1,700 articles of association will, more or less, become invalid.  In other words these companies, which have certain rights under their articles of association to embark on certain businesses, will be prohibited, except with a permit from the Minister.  That is for nationals. We do not think that that is desirable in business, where it is necessary that there should be a considerable amount of enterprise.  We do not think it is desirable that there should be any <Col N="1848" /> handicap on enterprise.  The Minister will see that it is a handicap and that it certainly should not apply to the business of nationals.</P>

      <P>There is no restriction at all on companies more than 51 per cent. of whose capital is owned by nationals of Saorstát Eireann.  They do not come under this Bill and are in no sense subject to any restrictions. The proposal here would so extend the scope of the Bill as practically to nullify it altogether, because every company takes power in its memorandum of association, and articles, which it does not exercise.  Acceptance of the amendment would really defeat the intention behind this Bill.  Further, the reference to memorandum and the articles would have no meaning at all in the case of a body corporate established outside, say, Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention behind the Bill is that any foreign company which was engaged in manufacturing enterprise here prior to the 1st June, 1932, can continue in the same manufacturing enterprise indefinitely, without being subject to any new restrictions of any kind.  If, however, a company which was engaged in one form of manufacturing industry, but which had powers under its memorandum and articles of association to engage in another form of manufacturing enterprise, decided to do so, then obviously it would be defeating the intentions behind the Bill.  Deputies received recently, perhaps, a memorandum and articles of <Col N="1849" /> association of a company which is proposing to operate a laundry here and which took power to operate any business from banking down to distribution. A large number of companies have very extensive powers under their articles of association but they do not exercise half of them.  The intention is clear that a company can continue without any restriction to do what it has been doing; but I would not be prepared to accept any amendment which would mean considerable extension of that principle.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been amended by a previous amendment, amendment 2 (a) which has altered that definition. Otherwise the definition there confines it to companies which are registered in Great Britain and Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1927" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Minister's intimation that he could not accept this amendment, the position of any body corporate is that in the ordinary way the memorandum or articles of association are the charter of the company.  People in the case of a public company are invited to subscribe to shares in that company on the basis that that particular company is to carry on a particular class of business. I understand the Minister's intention in this Bill is to deal with companies that are formed here or commence to carry on business here after a particular day.  But in the case of the companies which are said to be <Col N="1850" /> protected by this amendment and which are already carrying on business here, the position is that people are shareholders in them; they have subscribed for those shares or they have accepted the transfer from other shareholders of those shares on the basis, according to the charter of the company, that they are entitled to carry on certain business.  I think Deputy Good's remarks are justified when he says that the effect of Section 2 as it stands is to cut in on the charter of those companies and to impose, as it were, a sort of restrictive power in the Minister to deal with the general trading power of companies to which the public were asked to subscribe on the basis that these companies could carry on a particular business.  I would impress on the Minister that foreign companies, I mean those companies not registered under the Companies Acts, might not be excluded, and that he would preserve for the companies registered under the Companies Acts the provision that such company would not be excluded from carrying on here business permitted by their articles of association, provided that the company was carrying on that business prior to the 1st June, 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be possible to accept the principle that the State has no right to cut across the articles of association of any company.  There may be ten, twenty, or one hundred companies registered who may have taken power under their articles of association to engage in the business of the distribution of electricity.  The State would be quite within its rights in deciding that nobody can engage in that business except the organisation established by this State.  As the Deputy says, under this Bill we may decide to-morrow that in a particular industry certain conditions shall apply. We may decide in relation to an industry that does not exist here at the moment that a certain firm shall be allowed to engage in it on the understanding that no other firm shall have a right to engage in it; and we would have the right to do that, notwithstanding how many other companies had the power to engage in it under <Col N="1851" /> their articles of association.  We may decide that the powers to be exercised by any company shall be only those powers that they have been exercising and that are secured to them under the Bill.  We may decide that if they want to increase their powers or to exercise further powers or if they want to go into any branch of industry then they become subject to the Bill.</P>

We are dealing here with a Bill called the Control of Manufactures Bill, and this particular amendment is an amendment of much more importance than has been considered by the Minister.  The Minister deals with a foreign company in much the same way as one deals with a medicine bottle upon which there is a label.  What is a foreign company?

      <P>In two of the larger concerns that there are in this country, probably two of the largest, a majority of the capital of the company is owned by residents and nationals of this country.  One is discriminated against because it is not registered here, and the other is discriminated against in another Bill.  Now, during the War, it so happened that certain manufacturing companies discovered that it was possible to use certain by-products very profitably. These two particular firms in question may possibly discover within the next few years a new use for some byproduct. It may be that there are some potentialities in respect of their articles of association which would permit them to engage in that particular manufacture: but they would be stopped owing to the Minister's confusion of mind as between the meaning of the terms power and right. The Minister has confused these terms. The Minister will have to put on his considering cap with regard to this and <Col N="1852" /> other matters in connection with the Bill unless he means to savage the capital of the people of this country invested in these concerns.</P>

      <P>I will undertake to do anything the Deputy suggests if he promises to read the Bill.  There is nothing about being registered here or elsewhere.  If 51 per cent. of the issued shares are held by persons resident here, a company for the purposes of this Bill is regarded as a Saorstát company and exempt from any restrictions. The Bill does not stop anybody, foreigner or national, from engaging in industrial enterprise, but in the case of foreigners who were not established here on 1st June, 1932, it provides that in certain cases the Minister will have power to stop them, if it is in the national interest.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows as well as I do that the capital of big concerns fluctuates daily.  What might be 51 per cent. to-day might be 49 per cent. to-morrow.  How does the Minister stand with regard to that?  Is it that if 51 per cent. is in the hands of our nationals they can start, and are they estopped when it is 49 per cent.? Has the Minister read his Bill?  And what is his answer to my question?</P>

      <P>The Minister has given as examples why he cannot accept the amendments what I conceive to be entirely outside the scope of the Bill. He tells us what everybody knows, that in a memorandum or articles of association a manufacturing company may take power to do the business of banking, it may take power to lend money on the security of land.  That could not possibly come within the scope of the Bill, because what this Bill purports to put a prohibition upon is set out in Section 2: &ldquo;to do any of the following things in the course or as part of such business, that is to say, to make, alter, repair, ornament, finish, or to adapt for sale any article, <Col N="1853" /> material, or substance or any part of any article, material, or substance.&rdquo; The example that the Minister gives as a reason why he could not accept the amendment is that of doing banking. What on earth has that to do with the section?  There are very few memoranda or articles of association, so far as my recollection of them goes, dealing with manufacturing companies that do not specify with particularity the articles which they are about to manufacture.  The Minister has given one example of some company within the last week or so that purports to carry on another industry in addition to the industry which it in fact is carrying on.  What I suggest is this: that if either the memorandum or the articles of association specify with any particularity the particular classes of business which the company takes power to carry on no power to prohibit any of these should be taken by the Minister.  The Minister gives another example&mdash;the distribution or supply of electricity.  That was dealt with in a particular Act.  I do not think that is an example bearing on the question before the House. Where companies have taken power, as they do, in a memorandum or articles of association, to carry on by way of manufacture particular classes of business, I do suggest to the Minister that he has made no case in his argument here, by referring to the general power of banking or other powers, for not accepting the amendment giving relief to these companies that, by their memorandum or articles of association, have taken power to carry on particular classes of business.</P>

      <P>If what the Deputy says is correct the amendment is not necessary, because the Bill provides for what the amendment purports to do. The Deputy says that any manufacturing company specifies the particular manufacturing processes it proposes to engage in.  If that is so, and if any foreign companies operating here are, in fact, engaged in the particular manufacturing processes which are specified in the articles of association, then they can continue to do so.</P>

      <P>The Minister is mixing up taking power to carry on businesses with actually carrying them on.  What we object to is limiting the powers of a company to the business actually carried on on 1st June.  What we say is that there should be no infringement of the powers of a company which has undertaken a right to carry on certain businesses, although in fact, it may be carrying on only one of these businesses on 1st June.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the Minister has produced here such a magnificent doctrinaire Bill that he, tied down to his theory, does not seem to have ever considered how his Bill will work out in practice. He has been talking glibly about foreign companies.  Let us take a large company whose shares are being sold, and are changing hands from time to time.  Take Messrs. Guinness.  Suppose Messrs. Guinness wish, under the new definition of altering for sale to alter for sale their stout by putting it into bottles, and they start a bottling industry and put a label on their bottles, what must Messrs. Guinness do?  They must go round to every single shareholder they have got, and they must say: &ldquo;Will you please send in your birth certificate; we want to know whether you were born in Saorstát Eireann?&rdquo;  Then to those who reply: &ldquo;I was not born in Saorstát Eireann; I cannot produce my certificate,&rdquo; they have to say: &ldquo;Will you please produce to us documentary evidence that you have been residing for the last seven years in Saorstát Eireann; otherwise we will not be entitled to start our bottling industry unless we get permission from the <Col N="1855" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce,&rdquo; and the Minister, at his mere whim, can withhold permission because he may say that there were sufficient bottling industries for stout already in the country.  That is only one example of what may happen to a very large firm. Any firm that wishes to carry on its business, that in fact has a varying number of shareholders, must immediately get permission to carry on anything. As has been pointed out, there may be a company which is what the Minister calls a native company.  A block of 5,000 or 6,000 shares may change hands as a result of a sudden sale, and immediately that native company becomes a foreign company, and is liable to prosecution and to a heavy fine for every single day it carries on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is obviously conceived as a doctrinaire Bill, and to safeguard the existing companies in this country I think the Bill is going to jeopardise all sorts of companies, native or foreign, that may start.  I can hardly imagine any Bill so well designed to prevent even native companies starting in this country because it is preventing persons investing capital in industry as they can never dispose of their shares, because their shares are made unmarketable. Let, at any rate, the existing companies be safeguarded.  There are not so many existing companies.  If the Minister does see that there are any companies that have wild and extravagant articles of association let him deal with these companies, but let the general principle be that the existing companies in this country are now <Col N="1856" /> safe.  If there happens to be a sale to a person living in this country, who was not born in it, and has not been permanently residing in it for seven years, although he may be the son of Irish parents but happened by accident to be born in the Channel Islands or anywhere else, and he invests a large sum of money, the company in which he invests the money becomes an illegal company at once.  Let us at any rate have the existing native companies safeguarded.</P>

      <P>The last amendment aimed at the enlargement of the nature of certain business for the purpose of carrying it forward after a particular day.  These amendments are somewhat different.  The last amendment aimed at giving a business more or less its legal right at the time of incorporation.  These refer to points raised by one or two Deputies on Second Reading as to whether or not, if a business decided on extension, it would be permitted to engage in ordinary extension or whether it would be confined rigidly to the phrase &ldquo;things in the course or as part of such business as they carry on.&rdquo;  I take an example that must occur to everybody.  I take the firm of Fords in Cork, which was established, originally, for the purpose of making motor cars.  Afterwards they gave up the idea of making motor cars and took to the manufacture of tractors.  Somewhat later because of the state of the <Col N="1859" /> Russian market, which was the big market for export they decided, in attempting to save the factory, that they would engage their machinery and plant in a certain type of business very far removed from either motor cars or tractors.  The managers of that firm did a considerable amount of publicity for themselves and a tremendous amount of work seeking orders.  They were even going to engage in the manufacture of grates.  At one time they were looking for orders for railway material.  How far they succeeded I do not know, but they had the intention of extending along these lines.  Whether going into the tractor business, from the motor car business, would have been deemed to be in the course or as part of the firm's business, previously carried on, I do not know, but I think it is clear that the manufacture of fire grates by a firm established for the purpose of assembling motor cars, and afterwards drifting into the manufacture of tractors, would not be within the terms of the section here.  And in fact after I drafted this amendment I was wondering if it was sufficiently wide to catch all these things in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At any rate, I think the second or alternative clause is sufficiently wide. The amendment I drafted would be sufficiently wide to take in, say, the case of a firm like Guinness.  If you had a firm which was a foreign firm, engaged in the manufacture of stout, but had not gone in, at a particular period, for the manufacture of their barrels, would cooperage count <Col N="1860" /> as an extension and such an extension as would come within the meaning of &ldquo;things in the course or as part of such business&rdquo;?  If you had such an establishment conducted here under private auspices, and it decides to branch out into something so near as the making of barrels by people engaged in the factory, or if you had a firm engaged in the manufacture of cars, and bad times coming, and they, having considerable plant, turned to another type of manufacture that could not be considered akin, I think it only right that they should have the right to change over to that other form of business.  We do seek to get firms into this country and in a big way.  The Minister was optimistic enough to hope that we might even get an export business from here.  If that is so, we certainly must allow them to change over from one business to another if they consider their plant suitable so to do, in the normal expansion of their business, and the security for these things would be that there would be no undue interference by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I do not think the amendment moved by the Deputy is any substantial improvement on the terms of the Bill.  The Bill states that foreign firms engaged in the manufacturing enterprise on the 1st June, 1932, may engage in anything that would be done in the ordinary course or as part of such business.</P>
