      <P>Will the Taoiseach allow the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill, 1995, to be taken in view of the fact that the Irish Press workers have been denied social welfare payments for the past two months?  All Stages of this technical measure should be taken today to assist these workers who are living from hand to mouth.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the case of the employees in question will be heard this afternoon by the Social Welfare Appeals Tribunal, the terms of reference of which allow it to take into account all the factors affecting them, including the status of their position <i>visá-vis</i> an industrial dispute, the existence of the new legislation governing examinership and all the other matters of concern to the Deputy.  That is the best way to deal with the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Government agreed to decouple the arms issue from the talks process in Northern Ireland by the establishment of a commission and, if so, will the House be required to approve a motion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that matter not being raised today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  The Taoiseach should be more forthcoming given that he campaigned for Dáil <Col N="1720" /> reform.  Occasionally, when it suits him he chooses to reply to matters raised on the Order of Business.  As the House has not met for three weeks it is important, in the context of what has not been happening in Northern Ireland, that he respond to a reasonable query from me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem in responding to any queries, but it is my understanding that on the Order of Business questions should relate to promised legislation.  No legislation has been promised on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>What about Dáil reform?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Having said that, the Government is doing all it can to advance the process to a point where all the parties which are relevant will be present and participate in all party talks. It is important that both communities in Northern Ireland, Nationalist and Unionist, should feel a sense of ownership of the process.  When the Government states that it is working towards, as it is, all party talks it means inclusive of all.</P>
      <P>One of the issues which has to be overcome along the way is the issue of decommissioning.  The Government is considering various ways, including the possibility mentioned by the Deputy, by which this difficulty can be overcome. We have not reached the point, however, at which there is a proposal to put to the House and we may not reach it for some time.  The question of a debate, on a specific proposal does not therefore, arise at this stage.  If and when that point is reached we will want the House to be involved in approving a proposal which will be brought before it at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that an international body will be set up in early September to deal with the issue of arms decommissioning? Will he ensure that the deliberations of that body will not be <Col N="1721" /> used as a further pretext to delay the commencement of all party talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot debate the matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All party talks would include the Unionists.  Obviously, their concerns on the issue of decommissioning are different from those of other parties.  We are looking for a formula to enable all the parties to come to the table.  This does not mean that we should act unilaterally and say that they must take it or leave it and come on the date set by us.  That is not necessarily the best way to get what the Government states it wants &mdash; a process in which everyone, Unionist and Nationalist, would feel a sense of ownership at the outset.</P>
      <P>To avoid a situation where people feel they are being asked to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to a specific proposal devised by somebody else within a time limit we will not set a date, say, September; rather we are working to secure agreement which means allowing all the parties time to accommodate new proposals put forward in good faith and setting time limits is not necessarily helpful in that context.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Harney, I explained that the possibility of establishing an international commission is one of the ideas being considered to overcome one of the obstacles along the way to all party talks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>No party should have a veto on the commencement of talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of such terms is not necessarily helpful.  It has to be recognised that parties which represent 50 to 60 per cent of the population must be taken into account.  While one cannot <Col N="1722" /> state that they can hold up progress forever if we are to hope for a genuine settlement and not some form of steam-rolling exercise we must work in such a way that they can feel a sense of ownership of the process from the outset.  That involves taking the time to listen to them and understand their concerns rather than setting deadlines and saying that unless talks start by a certain date we will not do X or Y.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; will the Taoiseach indicate if the divorce referendum Bill and the Family Law (No. 2) Bill will be published before the end of August?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will publish that legislation as soon as it is ready.  The Family Law Bill is complex legislation involving a large number of sections. The heads of the Bill have been approved by Cabinet and it is being drafted.  We would like if possible to have it available by the end of August and if it is ready by that time we will publish it, but I cannot give the House a commitment that it will be ready by that time.  As soon as it is ready it will be published.  The Minister, the Attorney General, the parliamentary draftsman and all involved are working <Col N="1723" /> to publish the legislation as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not normal to answer question about statutory instruments. The Deputy is not referring to <Col N="1724" /> original but to delegated legislation about which I do not have information. Deputies who study the Order Paper will realise that there are two or three items of delegated legislation every day. I could not possibly answer questions about such legislation.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt quite a number of Members will remember well the day former Deputy Keaveney was elected.  This year an Independent candidate was elected without the aid or backing of any party, which was considered to have been an unprecedented event but it was not.  The last occasion this happened was when former Deputy Keaveney was elected as an Independent Member for Donegal North East.</P>
      <P>The former Deputy Paddy Keaveney, throughout a long portion of this career, was associated politically with Deputy Neil Blaney.  Deputy Keaveney was a gentle person.  Those of us who remember him here will recall that, whenever he spoke, which was not very frequently, he did so with a sense of conviction and in a very quiet, persuasive voice.  While he represented the constituency &mdash; if I recollect correctly &mdash; being a native of Moville, he was particularly concerned with the needs of our largest peninsula, Inishowen, which he represented especially well.</P>
      <P>On behalf of my party, who contested the election against former Deputy Keaveney without success on that occasion &mdash; and I am sure many others who may have crossed swords with him in Donegal County Council and elsewhere who, nonetheless, will have recognised him as a gentleman in politics &mdash; I should like to express our sympathy and that of the Government to his family and many friends on his sad passing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Taoiseach said, while Deputy Keaveney's career here was brief, he continued to have a very distinguished career at local level, as a county councillor, as a very committed public representative of the people of Donegal and his constituency.  He was elected to this House as an Independent but, later <Col N="1729" /> in his career, he returned to the fold, so to speak.  Our colleagues from that area speak very warmly of his unceasing work and efforts on their behalf, with such great vigour, in his career in local government.</P>
    <P>At the time of his death &mdash; because I was speaking about him on local radio in Donegal &mdash; I looked up the Official Report when I verified that subjects on which he spoke here were always those in connection with his constituency, when he did so with great vigour, defending their interests at national and local level.  Prior to his death, his daughter took his seat on Donegal County Council and, therefore, the name and work tradition of his family in that area will be lovingly and conscientiously continued.</P>
    <P>I wish to record our sympathy to his widow and family and our appreciation of the many long hours of duty he devoted to our party.</P>

He was mentioned in this House on the day Deputy Mildred Fox first took her seat when Deputy Blaney, with great pride, reminded us that Deputy Keaveney too had had a spectacular win as an Independent candidate in 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the late Deputy Keaveney's term in this House was one year only, I am keenly aware that he was very much involved in the local politics of County <Col N="1730" /> Donegal, particularly, as Deputy O'Rourke said this morning, following his return to the fold.</P>
    <P>While I did not know the late Deputy Keaveney, I agree with the Taoiseach that obviously in a very quiet, effective way he made an impact on the politics of Donegal.  If he had not, he could not possibly have won a seat as an Independent in 1976.</P>

      <P>In paying a tribute to the late Deputy Paddy Keaveney and extending our sympathy to his widow and family, as a constituency colleague of his, may I revert to his arrival in this House, when there was much turbulence in the country, particularly within the Fianna Fáil Party?  Indeed his election to this House signalled a message from the people of Donegal that there were different opinions held on this side of the Border.</P>
      <P>The late Deputy Keaveney was not an extreme politician.  He was a man of gentle persuasion, great understanding and patience.  I would have found myself very much at home in the same party as he, perhaps because we shared many interests and pursuits in County Donegal not really appreciated in southern parts of the country.</P>
      <P>The presence of former Deputy Keaveney here was a reminder to everyone that on this island there is conflict, that he was elected here because of conflict and I have no doubt that, if he had been elected in normal times, his tenure here would have been much longer than one year.  His passing has left the people of Donegal, particularly the people of Inishowen, the poorer but I am sure they will remember him fondly for the service he rendered them.  I know they will appreciate what I said, that if he had been elected in more normal times, his contribution and service would have been of longer, greater benefit.</P>

      <P>Paddy Keaveney was a gentle, family man, interested in local politics, particularly in those evolving around the Border.  I agree with Deputy Harte, that if he had been elected at a different time, he would probably have continued to have been a Member of this House, and I would not be here.  As Deputy O'Rourke said, since he returned to the fold in 1991, the late Paddy Keaveney was nothing if not helpful to our party in Donegal North-East.  He came from a large family that enjoyed longevity. He is the first of the 12 children in his family to pass away.  His death was unexpected but we are happy that he had his last wish in that his daughter, Celia, has been co-opted to Donegal County Council.  We are looking forward to co-operating with her and with the other parties in Donegal North East in the coming years.  I would like to be associated with the sympathy extended to his wife and family.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to include new provisions in the Fisheries Acts whereby the Minister for the Marine may intervene, in accordance with a strict process and subject to the approval of both Houses, to deal with the failure of a fisheries board to manage its affairs effectively.</P>
      <P>In such circumstances, or at the request of a board, the Minister may appoint a commission for a specified period, generally speaking not exceeding two years, to take over some or all of the functions of that board.</P>
      <P>These provisions supplement existing provisions in the Fisheries Acts which allow the Minister in certain circumstances to remove a board from office.</P>
      <P>The principle of ministerial intervention involved in this Bill is thus not new to the Fisheries Acts.  Moreover, the model proposed has already been adopted in other legislation relating to State boards.</P>
      <P>I emphasise in the strongest possible terms that this legislation is not prompted by any general view that the fisheries boards are not being well managed. On the contrary, fisheries boards have a most difficult job to do and with present structures and resources are, by and large, making a major contribution. I have over the past number of months met representatives of all the boards and I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the board members, their managers and staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only in rare and exceptional cases that one would expect central Government to intervene directly with possible serious difficulties in the management of a State board.  It is reasonable in the public interest that a Minister should <Col N="1735" /> have such powers.  This right of intervention must, however, be carefully tailored to prevent arbitrary ministerial intervention and to protect the legitimate rights of boards.  This new legislation strikes the right balance.</P>
    <P>While this legislation is not based on a view that there are serious general management weaknesses in fisheries boards, the new provisions arise from a review of existing provisions which was prompted by recurring allegations concerning the Southern Fisheries Board. Deputies will be aware that for some time, there have been allegations concerning the Southern Fisheries Board, some of which have appeared in the press, and some of which related to a Garda investigation into certain matters in that board.</P>
    <P>When these allegations were brought to my attention, I met the chairperson and the manager of the Southern Fisheries Board.  Following these meetings and an examination of the existing legislation, it became clear that the existing provision would be an inappropriate and cumbersome mechanism to deal with the issues arising.  Accordingly, it was decided to prepare the Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>As regards the position in the Southern Fisheries Group I must repeat what the then Minister said on 9 May last.</P>
    <P>The administration of the Southern Fisheries Board is, and remains, a matter for that board.  As matters stand, Ministers have no direct function in relation to the investigation or handling of the reported allegations.  We are not in a position, nor do we have a basis, to form any opinion on the allegations made.  We must be particularly conscious not to prejudice the ongoing legal process, or in any way injure the rights of persons involved.</P>
    <P>I repeat that no decision has been or could be taken by us at present on what actions we might initiate in respect of that board if and when this legislation is enacted.  That matter will be considered at that time in the light of the prevailing <Col N="1736" /> circumstances which we do not wish to anticipate.</P>
    <P>Before looking in more detail at the background to the Bill and commenting on its main provisions, I would like first to set the context by looking at the constitution and role of the fisheries boards.</P>
    <P>The Fisheries Act, 1980 replaced the Inland Fisheries Trust and the 17 boards of conservators with the central and seven regional fisheries boards.</P>
    <P>The Central Fisheries Board has primary responsibility for the overall coordination and direction, where necessary, of the activities of the regional fisheries boards in the areas of protection, conservation, management and development of the inland fisheries resource and the promotion and development of sea angling.  The board also provides specialist scientific, technical, financial, personnel and engineering services to the regional boards, ensures that policy directions are carried into effect and advises the Minister on matters relating to the most effective conservation, management and development of the resource.</P>
    <P>The seven regional fisheries boards are responsible for the management, conservation, protection, development and improvement of the fisheries within their region, and offshore to the 12 mile limit insofar as the protection of wild salmon is concerned, and for the promotion and development of sea angling.</P>
    <P>The boards are financed primarily by way of an annual Exchequer grant which now amounts to more than £8.5 million.  In recent years the boards have also had access to additional funding under the Structural Funds, INTERREG, Surveillance and other EU-funded programmes which has led to a considerable increase in their development and operational activities.</P>
    <P>Elections to the regional boards, membership of which ranges from 20 to 22, including seven ministerial appointments, take place every five years from panels representing various interests in the region.  Membership of the central board, which also has a five-year fixed term, comprises 13 members, seven of <Col N="1737" /> whom are <i>ex-officio</i> chairpersons of the regional boards and the remainder, including the chairperson, appointed by the Minister.  Some 315 permanent staff are employed by the fisheries boards.</P>
    <P>At this point.  I would like to refer to the existing provisions whereby a board may be removed from office.  Under section 24 of the Fisheries Act, 1980, a board may be removed from office if it has not complied with a policy direction given under section 8 (1) (b) of the Act or where its functions were not being duly and effectively performed or where the performance by a board of its functions has been unsatisfactory.  In the latter two cases a formal inquiry must be conducted under section 50 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, as amended by section 65 of the Fisheries Act, 1980, into the performance by a board of its functions.  If the Minister is satisfied, following that inquiry, that a board has not duly and effectively performed its functions or that the performance by the board of its functions has been unsatisfactory or, as I have already stated, where a board has not complied with a policy direction, the Minister may, by order, remove that board from office and replace it with a person or persons who would carry on the functions of the board until the next elections to boards generally or a special election is held to the board in question.</P>
    <P>Section 24 of the Fisheries Act, 1980, and related statutory provisions provide a means by which the Minister could intervene to ensure that the functions of a fisheries board are performed in the public interest.  For example, if a fisheries board failed to comply with a direction given by the Minister in relation to general policy for the management, conservation, protection, development and improvement of fisheries he or she could, in accordance with section 24 of the Fisheries Act, 1980, remove that board from office and appoint a person or persons to perform its functions.  Equally, if concerns are raised as to whether a fisheries board is duly and effectively performing its functions the Minister could, in accordance with section 24 of <Col N="1738" /> the 1980 Act, hold an inquiry under section 50 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, as amended.  If, on the basis of that inquiry, the Minister is satisfied that the functions of the board are not being duly and effectively performed he could remove the board from office and appoint a person or persons to perform is functions.  These powers have not been used to date.</P>
    <P>While the existing statutory provision in the 1980 Fisheries Act relating to the removal and replacement of a board provide a means of ministerial intervention in circumstances in which a fisheries board, among other matters, has failed to manage its affairs effectively, I do not consider these provisions to be sufficiently flexible or sufficient to deal with the range of specific circumstances which can arise.  In particular, the requirement to hold an inquiry, which would be subject to the detailed provisions set out in the Fisheries Acts and in High Court Rules governing notice, the summoning and examination of witnesses, the service of documents, etc. could be unduly protracted.  It would also be open-ended and prone to litigation. Such a process could also be extremely costly and could shift the focus from the immediate problem giving rise to the inquiry in the first place.</P>
    <P>The existing legislation does not provide, therefore, for circumstances in which the Minister may be obliged to move quickly, and without removing a board, to relieve that board of some or all of its functions.  In addition, there may be circumstances in which a board may request the Minister to relieve it of some or all of its functions.  It is of the utmost importance that the fisheries boards are in a position to perform their statutory functions effectively both at a general level and in specific circumstances and that the State can intervene effectively on those occasions, which admittedly will be rare, when those functions are not being duly and effectively performed.</P>
    <P>The Bill is designed to address the shortcomings in the existing legislation outlined already.  It provides that the <Col N="1739" /> Minister may, by order, appoint a commission to perform some or all of the functions of a board where a board has so requested or after considering the report of a person appointed by the Minister to examine the management and organisation of a board and the performance by it of its functions generally or in particular.  The provisions of the Bill are similar in many respects to those in the Regional Technical Colleges (Amendment) Act, 1994, relating to the appointment of a commission to a college.  That Act provides a mechanism whereby the Minister for Education can act quickly in a case of emergency caused by deficiencies in the governance or management structures in a college.</P>
    <P>I wish at this point to outline the main provision of the proposed Bill.  Section 1 governs the interpretation of terms used in the Bill.  Section 2 provides for the appointment by the Minister of a person or persons to report to him on the management and organisation of a board and the performance by it of its functions and for the inspection by such person or persons of a board's records or documents.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the establishment by the Minister, following a request by a board or after consideration by him of a report of a person or persons appointed under section 2, of a commission to carry out one or more functions of a board as he may determine. Section 4 makes provision for the furnishing of notice to a board where the Minister proposes to appoint a commission following consideration of a report under sections 2 and 3 and for the making of representations by that board.  Section 5 lays down detailed provisions in relation to the appointment, membership and removal of a commission. Section 6 provides for co-ordination between the commission and a board where one or more but not all of the functions of a board have been conferred on a commission and for the resolution of any dispute or disagreement which may arise therefrom.  Section 7 <Col N="1740" /> provides for the furnishing of information and documentation by a board or its officers to a commission.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the removal of board members for failure to comply with sections 2 and 7 insofar as compliance with a request for documentation or records is concerned. Section 9 governs the making of orders by the Minister and provides, among other matters, that such orders, drafts of which shall be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, may be annulled by a resolution of either House.  Section 10 provides that the powers conferred by this Act to a board are not in substitution for any other powers conferred on the Minister or any other person in relation to the board immediately before the passing of the Act.  Section 11 provides that expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of this Act shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Section 12 makes provision for the short Title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The central provision of this Bill is the proposed granting to the Minister of the power to appoint a commission to carry out some or all of the functions of a board.  As the appointment of such a commission would be an exceptional measure, a number of safeguards have been provided for in the Bill.  First, section 4 makes provision for the furnishing of notice to a board where it is proposed to appoint a commission and for the making of representations by that board.  Second, unless a board has so requested, a commission can be appointed only after consideration of a report made under section 2 thus making it a statutory requirement that a decision to appoint a commission must always have some objectively determined basis.</P>
    <P>A third safeguard is that a commission can, in accordance with section 3 (5), be appointed for a maximum period of two years thus preventing the indefinite transfer of a board's functions and ensuring that board members cannot be left without knowledge of their future role for any lengthy period.  The <Col N="1741" /> fourth and final safeguard is the requirement, under section 9, for Oireachtas approval of any order providing for the appointment of a commission.  As such an appointment is an exceptional measure and is defensible only by reference to the common good it is appropriate that both Houses of the Oireachtas should consider orders which provide for the appointment of commissions while leaving <i>in situ</i> the bodies whose functions they are to exercise.</P>
    <P>I have outlined in detail the background to the proposed legislation and its broad provisions and implications. This legislation must also be seen in the wider context of the more general review of policy and strategy and the major development programmes now being pursued by the boards.  Last March a fundamental overhaul of marine policy was initiated with a view to tapping the full potential of the marine sector in the interests of coastal development, leisure and tourism and increased national economic and social prosperity.  This review, being undertaken in full consultation with the sectoral interests in the marine sector, will involve a series of public seminars to focus public debate on the issues, the establishment of a marine advisory council to advise on longer-term strategic options in marine policy and a major review of the organisational and management structure of the fishery service.</P>
    <P>The review will examine the institutional framework for the development and regulation of sea fisheries, acquaculture and inland fisheries sectors and recommend any changes necessary.  The central and regional fisheries boards are encompassed by this review and particular account will be taken of the important role they play.  National policy on wild salmon is also being reviewed as part of our review of general policy.</P>
    <P>I again express the Government's appreciation of the valuable contribution the fisheries boards have made, often in difficult circumstances and subject to resource constraints, to ensure <Col N="1742" /> that our valuable inland fisheries resource is managed, conserved and developed in its own right and to exploit its economic potential.</P>
    <P>The considerable developments in the inland fisheries sector, the challenges arising from pressures on stocks and the freshwater environment and the obligation on the State to ensure that State agencies operate efficiently and effectively require that the State be in a position to intervene in cases where a fisheries board cannot, or is not, duly and effectively performing its functions.  The proposed new legislation provides a well balanced and measured means to allow such interventions.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Over a long period in public life I have consistently fought to extend local democracy.  I am in favour of leaving to people in local areas the responsibility for making decisions about their lives and it is always a matter of regret when one must support in the House an extreme measure of this type.  At a time when the principle of subsidiarity is much debated in the wider European and world context, it is a pity to come upon a circumstance in which the Minister deems it necessary to take these new powers.</P>
      <P>I intended to support the Bill but I find myself in a difficulty from which the Minister must try to extricate me.  I understood the Bill was to provide for an exceptional circumstance in the Southern Fisheries Board.  Newspaper reports about these matters are of concern and the fact that the matters are now in the hands of the Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions heightens that concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the reputation and management of all the fisheries boards are safeguarded.  I agree with the Minister that, for the greater part, the boards do an extremely difficult job without adequate resources and occasionally without adequate support from local communities.  They serve the country <Col N="1743" /> well and I wish to be associated with the tributes paid to the boards by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I was satisfied with the safeguards in the Bill which include the requirement to come before the Oireachtas and the time limit on the establishment of the commission.  It can only be established following an inspector's report, so clearly there will have to be specific circumstances in which this action could be taken.  The measures also ensure that due regard must be given to the views of the individuals named or involved so that they have every possible opportunity to outline why these powers may be removed from them.</P>
    <P>I was happy with these provisions and prepared to support the Bill until the Minister stated in relation to the review: &ldquo;This legislation must also be seen in the wider context of the more general review of policy and strategy and the major development programmes now being pursued by the boards.&rdquo;  I regret that statement because it takes away from what I thought was the Bill's specific purpose.  I had no idea the Minister intended this type of legislation and the removal of power from local communities to be part of an overall strategy. Perhaps the Minister could ease my mind in that regard in his reply.</P>
    <P>The Minister must accept I am prepared to support these extreme measures and safeguard the integrity and management of fisheries boards which do an extremely difficult job. However, I could not, under any circumstances, support a Bill of this character if it is to form part of the general strategy and thinking of the Department of the Marine.</P>
    <P>I share the Minister's previously expressed view that it is often considered the country can only be run if further powers are brought back to the centre.  The more that is attempted, the more frustration is created at local level. We should remember that the fisheries boards and their predecessors go back to the latter part of the previous century and that many of the angling, fishery, <Col N="1744" /> land owners and other interests are embodied in what the boards set out to do.</P>
    <P>There will always be circumstances in which, for various reasons, regional boards may not be as co-ordinated as possible and may not do as good a job as many feel they ought to do.  However, I have no doubt if powers are pulled back to the centre &mdash; regardless of the reasons for doing so &mdash; it will not only take away from the democracy, commitment and resolve at local level, but it will be impossible for a handful of people at central level to know exactly what is going on.</P>
    <P>While research, surveillance, training and personnel matters can be better handled in a co-ordinated way at central level, the primary function of operations and their success depends on a commitment to devolve power to local people, even if they make mistakes, and allow their capacity to manage to grow without interference.  The Minister must spell out his intentions specifically because it is regrettable that this legislation is forming part of Department of the Marine thinking in this area.  If that is not the case, the Minister must explain why he made that statement.</P>
    <P>The Minister covered the importance of the inland fisheries sector.  It is a very valuable national resource which attracts a huge number of visitors.  I do not have the exact figures but probably 200,000 people visit Ireland to fish in our rivers and lakes.  The protection of these assets in terms of fisheries surveillance, etc, is a critical part of our industrial and tourism infrastructure.  Providing more sustainable jobs and improving access are critical matters.  We welcome the resources being provided to inland fisheries and it is time we considered devoting more energy and time to ensuring these resources are improved.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the operational programme and the technical and other assistance granted at EU level.  It has been brought to my attention that many of the fisheries boards are acutely frustrated that they are unable to access these funds.  Physical <Col N="1745" /> works, instream bank development, stock management, the provision of improved systems for monitoring and protecting water quality and the rehabilitation of depleted stocks have been mentioned.  Given the elements of the national plan which were devoted to the marine sector, particularly the tourism and angling aspects, it is a pity we now find ourselves in a bottleneck.  I do not want the Minister to take this criticism personally but it appears that an unnecessary amount of bureaucracy surrounds decisions at European level to release funds which formed part of the national plan and agreed at all levels including the Council of Ministers. These funds, earmarked for development of our fisheries, cannot now be accessed as we move into the latter half of this year.  I ask the Minister to use his good offices to ascertain to what extent we can more quickly access these funds. We were very happy to support that development in the national plan.  We are glad the Government is pursuing the same line but it will prove fruitless if these unnecessary obstacles are put in our way.</P>
    <P>We paid tribute earlier to the fisheries boards and the difficult work they do. Many anglers and others involved in the inland fisheries sector are themselves involved in restocking waterways, in the erection of slipways, the purchase of gravel for spawning areas, the purchase of brown trout and in cleaning river banks.  I have been in touch with them in recent months.  Many of them put up their own funds.  That they should do so as well as raising funds locally to provide the necessary facilities &mdash; better access to our waterways, etc. &mdash; in the interest of tourism demonstrates serious commitment.  They need and deserve support.  That support is available, but in many areas it is not possible to access it as quickly as we ought to.</P>
    <P>We welcome the reduction in fish kills, which is accounted for by an increased public awareness of the need for environmental protection and by massive investment by the farming community. Despite the improvement, <Col N="1746" /> however, there is a steadily growing nitrification of our waters.  This is brought about by intensive agricultural production, over-use of fertiliser, inadequately designed systems for sewage treatment and the increasing use of certain types of detergent.  I have referred to this before in regard to the Lough Derg catchment area in my constituency. I put down parliamentary questions in regard to this matter, although the Department of the Marine transferred them to the Department of the Environment.  However, I wish to mention briefly that the schemes which were designed for that catchment area are tied up in the same kind of bureaucratic bottlenecks at European Commission level.</P>
    <P>Funds were provided for in the Estimates. Funds are available under the national plan.  We talk about subsidiarity, yet the vital national interest is affected at European level in circumstances in which there are resources. Where there is a commitment by the present Government, as was the case of previous Governments, and by local authorities in regard to the cleaning up of these waters, an outcome on which the improvement in fish numbers, fishing and angling tourism depends, I ask the Minister to use his good offices to solve this problem despite the fact that he and his officials maintain that it is primarily a matter for the Department of the Environment.  It is of equal concern to the Department of the Marine.</P>
    <P>I welcome the review.  I intend to be involved as much as possible in deciding how to reshape the structures which will use the additional resources to develop inland fisheries in a new and dynamic way.  I do not want this Bill to be linked, even in the slightest way, to that review. I do not want the power given to the Department of the Marine in this Bill, which is an exceptional measure for an extreme circumstance, to form a part of that review.  If that were to happen it would lead to increased centralisation of control which is not the direction in which we want fisheries policy to go in the future.  I came into this House to <Col N="1747" /> support an extreme measure, and find that the Department's thinking on this matter is different from what I assumed it was.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, by and large.  It is necessary and, in general terms, appropriate though I would quibble with some of the detail and consider that it does not cover some areas it should cover.</P>
      <P>It is deplorable that a situation in a certain fisheries board which caused difficulty for so many people should have been allowed continue for almost ten years.  The matter the Minister of State referred to this morning did not just come to light recently.  A letter was written by the Chairman of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board to the then Minister for Fisheries in December 1987, pointing out that there were serious problems in the management of the board about which he was extremely unhappy.  He did not receive any reply to or acknowledgment of that letter. Complaints were made at about the same time to the Central Fisheries Board.  They failed to deal with the matter.  That is very unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>It is to the credit of the present Minister of State that he is at least bringing forward this legislation now.  The procedure for removing a board under the 1980 legislation is ponderous.  I agree, in the light of some recent experience we have had of tribunals of inquiry, that one would be slow to set up a tribunal so the approach in this Bill is more practical and for that reason I welcome it.</P>
      <P>One of the weaknesses of the Bill is that there does not seem to be any direct power to suspend any official of a board at any level.  It may be that when a commissioner is appointed he will take steps to suspend certain people but up to now one of the major difficulties has been the failure, rather than the inability, of the board in question to suspend certain officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda to their credit have <Col N="1748" /> engaged in a very thorough investigation of this whole matter.  I understand that they finished their investigation six or seven weeks ago and have submitted a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions who, as far as I know, has not yet issued a decision on the issue.  As this is an urgent matter I hope there will be a decision without further delay.</P>
    <P>Power to replace, suspend or remove the whole board is often an unnecessarily wide power.  Unfortunately, it is a feature of this board, and potentially of others, that while the board as a whole and a great majority of board members are not engaged in improper practices, one or two individual members may be. Between now and Committee Stage, the Minister should consider replacing or removing certain individuals rather than have the whole board set aside as circumstances may arise where this is the appropriate thing to do.</P>
    <P>The Minister specifies a period of not more than two years for the duration of a commission.  The boards are elected at five yearly intervals, therefore, the appropriate period of time is until the next election.  This may be less or more than two years.  Whichever way it works out, it is more appropriate than specifying a period such as two years.  If it is necessary to replace a board, the right step to take would be not to reinstate the board, but to have it replaced by a new, elected board.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Smith's remarks on trying not to interfere with local representation and local democracy, but unfortunately it has been a feature of some areas of administration that inadequate supervision from the centre unhappily damages the concept of local democracy because abuses appear to arise from time to time.  I am not aware of any evidence from the other regional boards of any serious abuses or malpractices. I am sure there are none, but the Bill was necessitated by what happened in the Southern Fisheries Board, and to cope with the possibility that something similar may unhappily occur on some other board in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1749" /> With regard to making an order by the Minister, section 9 is long and confusing. The Minister should look at it again before Committee Stage.  Section 9 (4) states that an &ldquo;...order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House&rdquo;.  I agree with this.  However, section 9 (5) states that where either House fails to pass such a resolution within 28 days the order concerned may, notwithstanding subsection (4) be made after 28 days.  The number of days does not refer to 28 sitting days, but 28 calendar days.  Given subsection (5), what is the point of subsection (4)?  Subsection (4) will not be used if the Minister does not wish to attend the two Houses to have the order made and debated.</P>
    <P>Section 9 (6) has an annulling procedure where the orders are not approved by a resolution.  This would not be appropriate.  If the two Houses had approved the order they should not then have the right to annul it within 21 days of their approval.  Section 9 is a confused section.  It must be made clear.</P>
    <P>While I am aware of what has been happening over a long period in the region covered by the Southern Fisheries Board, I do not wish to go into detail as it is not appropriate to do so here. However, it is often the case that the chief sufferer is the chief whistle blower. In this case, the man concerned is suffering in every sense of the word.  He gave the Garda every co-operation in its attempts to have the facts elucidated, but was assaulted in the course of his duties as a fishery officer.  The most serious injuries were inflicted on him. They have necessitated his being in hospital and his confinement to a wheelchair for long periods.  They have also caused him to be in pain of different degrees of severity, some extremely severe, over a period of more than two years.</P>
    <P>The man is getting a pittance from the Southern Fisheries Board.  He is getting his social welfare allowances plus £20 per week.  He is now being sued by hospitals for his maintenance in <Col N="1750" /> hospitals while he was having operations necessitated by the injuries inflicted on him.</P>
    <P>It is grossly unfair that this man or any fishery officer, or servant of the State who is severely injured by assault while trying to enforce the laws passed by this House, should be put at such an appalling personal and financial disadvantage. The man has had to borrow money to try to support himself and his family.  He has run into debt and is trying to live on a pittance.  This is not good enough.  A fishery officer, like a prison officer or a garda, should have a proper code of compensation available to him for injuries inflicted on him in the course of his duties.  This man has been treated deplorably.  I do not know how the Minister, and especially the Minister for Finance who apparently will not agree to him being paid his wages, can stand over their testament to him.</P>
    <P>The man who blows the whistle is the one who suffers most.  This is the Irish system.  We saw it in the aftermath of the beef tribunal and we are seeing it here again in another matter, which is not perhaps as widely known but is of some importance because of what has taken place.  I have had a number of conversations with the Minister of State about this matter and I believe him when he tells me he is entirely sympathetic to this man, but the man has still received no money.  Court cases are now being brought against him which will probably result in judgments being made against him and bailiffs seizing his goods.  This is extremely unfair and wrong.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the Bill.  In all the complicated circumstances, it is a reasonable stab at attempting to deal with the situation.  The Minister dealt in broader terms with inland fishery policy, which I would have liked the opportunity to address.  Having observed the workings of the regional fisheries boards in some detail I have concluded that the Central Fisheries Board does not achieve any great purpose.  It is doubtful if it is worth retaining it.</P>
    <P>If the seven regional fisheries boards <Col N="1751" /> could deal directly with the Department an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy would be removed.  The central board did nothing to resolve this problem, to support officers who were under greater pressure or to stop the abuses and malpractices brought to its attention over a lengthy period.</P>
    <P>An official in the Department explained its difficulty under the 1959 and 1980 Acts in dealing directly with the regional boards because of the intervention of the central board in the legislative framework between the Department and the regional boards.  That unnecessary difficulty should be removed.  The Department and the Minister should be able to deal directly with the regional boards in cases where it is necessary, such as the one we are discussing today.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister that the people who assaulted the officer I mentioned, but did not name, were convicted by a jury in County Wexford and sentenced to a period in prison for their activities. Yet the officer has received no compensation and has no chance of getting any from his assailants.  He is entitled to be paid his wages from the date of the assault.  Nobody should ever be put in the position in which he now finds himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank God something is happening at last.  At times facts can be stranger than fiction.  What has happened in the Southern Regional Fisheries Board area over the past ten years, maybe longer, is a terrible blot on the system.  It is a disgrace the way in which power has been abused.  We are indebted to the former Minister for the Marine, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, for initiating this legislation.  It should have been done years ago.  I hope the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Barrett, will put his shoulder to the wheel, although he may not be as <i>au fait</i> with the situation as the former Minister and the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1752" /> It is an appalling situation if the allegations which have been made are true. Many people, not only the fisheries officers concerned, but senior people in high office and in other ranks stand indicted if the allegations are true.  This alleged skulduggery or criminal activity has been going on for at least ten years. It was starkly portrayed to me on a number of occasions by fishermen who suffered under the regime, which will exist until this legislation is passed.  I spoke about this matter in the House on numerous occasions to different Ministers but nobody lifted a finger to do anything about the injustices perpetrated against good, hard working fishermen in the Southern Regional Fisheries Board area.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the fisheries officer who was assaulted off Dungarvan harbour approximately one year ago and who has been seriously ill since then.  He was right when he said that the treatment of that individual, a public-minded citizen above and beyond the call of duty, is another blot on the system. He has been virtually forced into submission and the system allowed that to happen.  This man was viciously assaulted by a fisherman but was still decent and public-spirited enough to go to the Circuit Court in Waterford last November to tell the court and the judge, who must have been surprised that he did not blame the fisherman who had assaulted him with an iron bar because he was aware that fishermen were being discriminated against, hounded and blackguarded to such an extent that he could understand why one would react in such a manner.  We should think of the system and the people who allowed that situation to evolve.  If there is a court case as a result of the file being sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, many senior people should be in the dock with the fisheries officers against whom the allegations were made and which have been made to me by fishermen for ten years.</P>
    <P>On 5 September 1990, almost five years ago, an article appeared in <i>The</i><Col N="1753" /><i>Cork Examiner</i> as a result of a statement I made.  The headline stated: &ldquo;Deasy Urges Inquiry into Drift Net Law&rdquo;.  I had information from another fisheries officer, not the man who was assaulted, to the effect that malpractices were taking place.  He was very frightened when he made those allegations and found it difficult to come forward.  I sent a copy of my statement to the Minister for the Marine, the Minister for Justice, the Garda Commissioner, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the manager of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board and I got acknowledgments in most cases.  The Garda Commissioner said he did not believe it was any of his business.  Imagine that. Although a Dáil Deputy made an allegation on the basis of information given to him by fishermen and a fisheries officer pursuing fishermen fishing illegally, they did not consider it worthwhile investigating the matter.  I was never asked by the Garda Síochána to substantiate my allegations.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Marine did not acknowledge my letter which referred to the newspaper article in which I pointed out the seriousness of the allegations made which were from a number of very reliable sources.  The then Minister for Justice, Deputy Ray Burke, acknowledged it and said there would be a follow up letter, but there never was one.  The manager of the board wanted to know what I was talking about, although the dogs in the street knew what was going on.  Those people in high places who did not act should be brought to book.  The fisheries officer who was seriously injured last year and who made the allegations which form the basis of an investigation should be congratulated.</P>
    <P>The people who did not react in 1990 are guilty.  It is a shame more fishermen who have information of serious irregularities have not come forward and given statements to the Garda Síochána. They are a disgrace and should be ashamed of themselves.</P>
    <P>This matter arises from the use of monofilament nets &mdash; which are illegal <Col N="1754" />&mdash; for salmon fishing.  A salmon review group was set up in 1987 but its report was never acted upon, that is the basis for the present conflict.  The group comprised higher civil servants, a Garda Chief Superintendent, the Commander of the Naval Service, and the Secretary of the Department of the Marine, who acted as chairman.  The report recommended that a certain length of monofilament net be legalised.  These problems would not have arisen if that report had been acted upon.  However, every subsequent Minister has also ignored its findings.</P>
    <P>There has been total indifference to a serious problem which nearly resulted in loss of life and which was never addressed by anybody at senior level until Deputy Coveney, then Minister for the Marine, and the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, became involved.  I am glad a commissioner is to be appointed to ensure the board is run in a proper and fair-minded manner.  I accept the majority of board members are fine and upright citizens.  However, there is an element which needs to be investigated and I hope those investigations will result in fair play for the fishermen who have suffered.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> The Bill gives is an opportunity to deal with the allegations, to address the operation of the fisheries boards and assess their advantageousness to the regions they represent. Deputy Michael Smith made the point that too much ministerial intervention in the fisheries boards would not be good.  Within reason the actions and operations of the fisheries boards should be left to them.  If there are wrongdoings or problems the Minister should have power to deal with them. When other Departments, such as the Department of the Environment, intend to give more power to people at local <Col N="1755" /> level, there should not be too much ministerial intervention by the Department of the Marine.  That would not be good for the operation of the fisheries boards.</P>
      <P>I am amazed that the Central Fisheries Board and the Department of the Marine are not aware of the alleged malpractices referred to, particularly by Deputy Deasy, given that the boards are comprised of seven ministerial appointees and that the Secretary of the Department of the Marine is a member of the Central Fisheries Board.  They would be in a position to know if wrongdoing was taking place and should have a duty to report it to the Department or to the Minister directly.</P>
      <P>I hope the commission being set up will not be permanent or interfere willy-nilly with the operations of the fisheries boards.  The Central Fisheries Board seems to operate separately and distinctly from the regional boards and there does not seem to be much co-ordination or co-operation between them. Does the Minister feel there is a clash of personalities involved or a clash as to how the boards should operate?</P>
      <P>Inland fisheries have a major role in attracting tourists and developing rural areas but we do not seem to be operating as we should in that regard. In his review I hope the Minister will examine how the boards operate, if we need seven regional boards and if we need a Central Fisheries Board in Dublin operating separately?  I hope the review will be available to us as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the fisheries boards have been short of money; they do not have the financial wherewithal to operate and develop as they should and more money should be made available.  The Minister said that EU funds will be available. Local groups and concerns should become more involved with the fisheries boards.  There should be greater involvement and co-operation between those in the private sector of the tourism industry and the fisheries boards as ultimately, they are all working to benefit their local areas.  In his overall review I <Col N="1756" /> hope the Minister will examine that matter seriously.</P>
    <P>There should not be too much political or ministerial interference.  He should only become involved if serious problems arise.  The Minister should consider how he can &ldquo;beef up&rdquo; the fisheries boards and make them more relevant to the development of tourism by giving them a more developmental role and more funds.  He should also encourage the private sector to become involved.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for sharing time with me.  What can the Department of the Marine do about articles which have appeared in <i>The Sun, The Belfast Telegraph</i> and <i>The Sunday World</i> concerning a dispute on one of the best trout and salmon rivers in County Donegal, the River Finn? This matter has come to a head as a result of a High Court decision by Mr. Justice Costello some years ago in which he decided that a verbal agreement existed between namely Mr. Leslie Mackie of Glenmore Estate and Mr. David Wilde of Cloghan Lodge regarding 17 miles of the River Finn.</P>
      <P>As a result of that decision Mr. Wilde spent a month in jail.  The Foyle Fisheries Commission and the Department of the Marine will not examine the dispute. I urge the Minister to ask the Foyle Fisheries Commission to become involved or to ask the Department of Justice to hold an inquiry.  One party to the dispute wants to make an exclusive club out of this area and the other party, an elderly English gentleman, who would prefer to leave the river for the locals, has been harassed and harangued into selling.  There has been skulduggery behind the scenes yet nobody seems to be interested in the case.</P>
      <P>This elderly man has been jailed for contempt of court because he has stuck to his principles and I urge the Minister to investigate this matter which has attracted the attention of the national and local newspapers.</P>

      <P>I thank <Col N="1757" /> Deputies for their contributions to the debate and their support for the Bill.  I reassure Deputy Michael Smith that the Bill is not a Trojan horse for a centralising agenda.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The Bill is intended to address exceptional circumstances which can arise from time to time and which require quick action.</P>
      <P>I do not want to get into the allegations made in relation to the Southern Fisheries Board.  It would be quite improper to prejudice any investigation which might take place but once those allegations &mdash; some of which were the subject of a Garda investigation &mdash; had been made, repeated consistently and had appeared in the public press, it would have been quite wrong for the Minister not to take some interest.</P>
      <P>The difficulty under the existing legislation was that the only recourse open to the Minister was to initiate an inquiry.  For all the reasons that have been stated here that would be an inappropriate way of dealing with this issue. We need a simple mechanism whereby allegations of this type can be inquired into, a report made to the Minister and appropriate action taken.</P>
      <P>Under the existing legislation the only sanction which can be brought to bear on a fisheries board is that the entire board can be stood down.  It was felt there was a necessity for some means other than that.  For example, the personnel functions of a board might be taken on by a commissioner for a period to address whatever deficiencies were thought to exist in that board.  They are functions which, essentially, are being provided for in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure Deputy Smith that there is no agenda to overcentralise.  My reference to the overall review of marine policy and, specificially, to the review of salmon policy currently under way in the Department, was to indicate what we are doing in that context.  A number of Deputies have raised other issues which touch on the inland fisheries sector. These include the points raised by Deputy O'Malley about structures for the governance of the inland fisheries <Col N="1758" /> sector, and the points raised by Deputy Deasy on salmon policy generally.  They are issues which have to be addressed and I simply wanted to put on record that they are being examined.  I wanted to locate the Bill in that context.  There is not an agenda to centralise the administration of inland fisheries.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the safeguards we have built into the Bill, requiring notice of matters to be brought before the House, are specifically intended to prevent this legislation from being used in future for purposes other than the type of purpose for which it is being introduced.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the length of time these allegations have been going on and I am aware of that. He also drew my attention to a number of provisions which we can usefully address on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Malley and Deasy referred to the case of a fisheries officer who was injured in the course of his duty.  The fishery officer concerned was assaulted during the course of a fishery patrol on 28 July 1993 and appears to have suffered damage to his lumbar region.  I am fully aware of, and sympathise with, his position and circumstances arising from the injuries received by him and as Deputy O'Malley knows, have met him to discuss the conditions of employment which govern entitlements arising from such injuries and to assure him that every means at my disposal will be employed to reduce or meet, within reason, any losses arising from these injuries.  The appointment, grading, remuneration, tenure of office and conditions of service of staff of the central and regional fisheries boards are governed by the terms of a staff scheme drawn up in consultation with the recognised unions and approved by the Minister and the Minister for Finance in accordance with section 32 of the Fisheries Act, 1980.</P>
    <P>The fisheries officer has received the following assistance since the injury: under the board's staff scheme he remained on full pay for six months after the assault; he received benefits <Col N="1759" /> under the occupational injuries scheme operated by the Department of Social Welfare and refunds under the State's medical care scheme.  These benefits are similar to those to which public servants in general are entitled.</P>
    <P>In addition, Department of Finance sanction was secured, as an exceptional measure, to maintain him on full pay for an additional period of seven months.  I regret, and I have informed the fisheries officer concerned, that I have now been advised by the Minister for Finance that there is no scope for further exceptional arrangements.</P>
    <P>In so far as compensation is concerned, the fisheries officer has a number of options by which he may proceed. As I understand it, he has not yet exercised those options.  It is an area where, perhaps, he may take the advice of his trade union which has a scheme that may be able to assist hin in that area.</P>
    <P>The 1980 Act provides that the central board may, after consultation with each of the regional boards and with any recognised staff associations, at any time, and with the approval of the Minister given with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, amend a staff scheme.</P>
    <P>The Central Fisheries Board and SIPTU agreed in January 1985 to the establishment of a joint working party consisting of three representatives from each side, to consider an amendment to the staff scheme or other appropriate arrangements, to provide for an extension of benefits applying to officers injured in the course of their duty.  The working party issued its report which was submitted to the Central Fisheries Board.  Recommendations made by the central board on foot of this report are being considered by the Minister.  Any such amendments will also require the approval of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that officers of fisheries boards do not suffer financial or other loss arising from injuries received in the course of their duties.  I will approach the Minister for Finance on this matter in the very near future <Col N="1760" /> with detailed proposals for an amendment of the staff scheme which may be able to assist the fisheries officer in this case.</P>
    <P>On the matters raised by Deputy McDaid, I am not a regular reader of <i>The Sun</i> and, consequently, I did not see the articles to which he referred. However, I can certainly arrange to have the matters he referred to examined.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith raised a number of issues which touch generally on the question of inland fisheries administration. For example, he referred to access to EU funds.  Virtually all the funds available under the tourism angling measure for 1995 have now been approved. In relation to 1996 and subsequent years we have decided to bring forward the closing date of applications &mdash; in the case of 1996 the date will be the 15 September 1995 &mdash; to facilitate regional fisheries boards and others making applications for these funds, and to allow sufficient time for applications to be processed and decisions made to enable work to commence in the spring and summer of the following year.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to fish kills. I share these concerns, particularly in connection with the recent kills in a number of our waterways.  There is a danger, when water levels are low in rivers, that fish kills can occur more easily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons signed at Strasbourg on 20 August 1986, as supplemented by the EU Agreement on the Application among the Member States of The European Communities of the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons signed at Brussels on 25 May 1987, copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on 24 July, 1995.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that under Article 29.5.2º of Bunreacht na hÉireann:</P>
      <P>The State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>While in the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995, the House has made the necessary legislative provisions to give effect to the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, as well as the supplementary EU Agreement, the motion before the House today is necessary under Article 29.5.2º to enable us to proceed with the ratification of the Convention and the Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously the Government &mdash; and I believe all sides of the House &mdash; is anxious, particularly in the context of the consolidation of the peace process, that ratification should proceed without <Col N="1762" /> delay.  This is the first available opportunity for the House to pass the necessary motion since the President signed the Bill into law on 17 July last.</P>
    <P>Since its publication in April last, the transfer of sentenced persons legislation has received a positive welcome outside and inside the Oireachtas.  It was the subject of a very thorough and constructive examination by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  It underwent considerable amendment during its passage in the House and its provisions have been significantly improved as a result.</P>
    <P>Many of the amendments which we made arose from representations made by the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas and I am sure that all Members will join me in paying tribute to the role which that organisation played in this area generally and, particularly, in relation to the legislation.  It is fair to say that the legislation as enacted represents a comprehensive and effective measure I am sure we are all pleased to see having been passed into law so quickly.</P>
    <P>It is no secret that the measures necessary to give effect to the Convention were long overdue.  I can assure the House that the delay in bringing forward the necessary legislative proposals did not arise through any lack of commitment on my part.  On the contrary, I made it my business on coming into office to give priority to the necessary legislation and thereby fulfil a commitment in the Government's programme. It gives me great pleasure, therefore, that we have reached the stage at which I can put this motion before the House.</P>
    <P>The thinking behind the Convention &mdash; and of the Act &mdash; is to address the position of persons serving sentences in other countries who may have to endure added suffering beyond that normally involved in the deprivation of liberty itself.  Obviously, additional difficulties can arise because of language barriers and cultural differences, but in the majority of cases the greatest additional penalty is the absence of contact by the <Col N="1763" /> prisoner with family and friends. Indeed, a major practical concern of the Convention is not just to ameliorate the conditions for prisoners but also to alleviate the plight of their relatives, particularly through making visiting, and the maintenance of contact generally, easier.</P>
    <P>Much of the attention given to the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act has arisen in the context of the role which it will play as part of the consolidation of the peace process.  Certainly it has that positive and worthwhile role and I know that is very much welcomed by the House, but I believe Members will equally welcome the fact that the Convention makes no distinctions based on categories of prisoners: in other words applications can be made under the Convention irrespective of whether there is a paramilitary background to the offences for which people are serving sentences.</P>
    <P>The basic aim of the Convention is to provide for a simple and expenditious procedure under which persons sentenced in a foreign country can serve their sentence or balance of their sentence in their country of origin, if that is their preference.</P>
    <P>It might be helpful to highlight three key aspects.  First, the transfer procedure is voluntary.  The sentenced person, the state to which he or she is seeking a transfer and the state where he or she is serving a sentence all must consent to the transfer.  Second, although it is a Council of Europe Convention it is not confined to Council of Europe countries.  Accession by non-member states is possible and so, for example, the Convention applies to the United States and to Canada.  So far 26 of the 36 Council of Europe member states &mdash; as well as five non-member states &mdash; have ratified the Convention.  Also four EU states have given effect to the EU Agreement on the operation of the Convention among member states. Third, the approach which the Convention takes is to set out administrative procedures.  The Transfer of Sentenced <Col N="1764" /> Persons Act is an enabling one: it was not necessary to include in it all the matters contained in the Convention, many of which can be simply implemented on an administrative basis.  What the Act contains are the legislative measures necessary to enable Ireland to give effect to the Convention.</P>
    <P>Obviously a key consideration in bringing forward this measure is its likely implications for prison accommodation. While, clearly, concerns arise in this regard I believe they are not insurmountable and that what will be at issue in practice is drawing the right balance on humanitarian grounds, between facilitating transfers as much as possible and at the same time ensuring that undue pressure is not placed on our parison system.</P>
    <P>The Convention could impact on prison population in terms of numbers in this country somewhat more so than it might do on others.  This is because, on the one hand, we have a relatively small population of foreigners in our prisons today &mdash; about 180.  On the other hand, we know that the number of Irish nationals serving sentences abroad at any given time far exceeds that figure. The latest available figures indicate that there are at least some 600 Irish nationals imprisoned throughout the world who would be eligible to have their cases considered under the terms of the Convention.</P>
    <P>Clearly, not all those persons would be interested in a transfer and, indeed, in all probability only a small minority of them would be, but we have to be conscious of the fact that there may be a difficulty because the number of potential transfers into the State is higher than the number of potential transfers out.  While I certainly do not wish to stand in the way of transfers unnecessarily, and would be keen to facilitate people where at all possible, the reality is that I have a duty to guard against placing an intolerable burden on our prison system.  The best approach to this would be to draw attention to this potential problem when ratifying the Convention and enter an appropriate <Col N="1765" /> reservation at that time.  This I propose to do by indicating at the time of ratification that Ireland reserves the right to limit the excess of inward over outward transfers in the light of the availability of prison spaces, and will regard the degree of closeness of applicants' ties with Ireland as a primary consideration.</P>
    <P>This will allow the necessary flexibility between playing our part in implementing the Convention and avoiding unsustainable pressure on prison accommodation.  I acknowledge freely that in the absence of the Convention being in force it is difficult to ascertain precisely the likely level of interest there will be in applications under it.  It should be borne in mind that many Irish nationals serving sentences abroad &mdash; particularly in the UK &mdash; have long-established roots there and would have no interest at all in returning here.  It is worth noting that at one stage the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas estimated that the number of prisoners seeking a transfer here would be about 40 and would level off at less than ten a year subsequently. It has to be borne in mind, too, that, if needs be, applications into the country could be dealt with on a phased basis. If an inordinate number of applications were to be received it will always be the case that I, as Minister for Justice, can withhold consent to transfers.</P>
    <P>The Convention does not place an obligation on any contracting party to effect a transfer.  Instead, emphasis is placed on the three-way consent to which I have already referred.  Special emphasis is placed on the consent of the sentenced person.  There would be nothing to be gained by transferring someone against his will and without the person appreciating fully what the legal consequences of the transfer might be. Accordingly, the consent of the sentenced person must be a voluntary and informed consent.</P>
    <P>In addition to that three-way consent, the Convention lays down other criteria which must be satisfied before a transfer can take place which I will mention later.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1766" /> Under the Convention the receiving or administering state can opt for one of two ways of enforcing the sentence imposed by the sentencing state: it may choose to continue to enforce the sentence, in which case it is bound, subject to any necessary technical modifications, by the nature and duration of the sentence as determined in the original sentencing state; or, alternatively, it may choose to convert the sentence into a decision which substitutes a sanction prescribed by its own law for the sanction imposed in the sentencing state.</P>
    <P>As regards transfers of prisoners into this country, the Act enables us to use the procedure of continued enforcement, which is considered the more straightforward of the two procedures provided for in the Convention and should operate with greater certainty and, thus, generally in the best interests of the sentenced person.  At the time of ratification we will be making a declaration to the effect that it is the continued enforcement procedure which Ireland will use.  The Act provides that legal authority for the continued enforcement in the State of a sentence imposed by a foreign state will be by way of warrant issued by the High Court.  The warrant will issue on foot of an application to that court by me as Minister once I have consented to the transfer.</P>
    <P>As regards transfers out of the State, we have no extra-territorial jurisdiction and are unable, therefore, to legislate for the nuts and bolts of how a sentence will be enforced in another jurisdiction, but parties to the Convention will enforce the sentence in line with the terms of the Convention.  The facilitation of transfers abroad is treated under the Act as an entirely administrative function as distinct from involving a judicial process.  The 1995 Act provides a legislative basis for the exercise of that administrative function.  In keeping with the aim of the Convention to provide a speedy and simple mechanism for transfers the Act provides that the legal authority for transfers out will be <Col N="1767" /> by way of warrant issued by me as Minister and there is no need for application to court.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House today cannot be considered in isolation from the 1995 Act which provides the legal basis for how we will operate the Convention and in those circumstances it might be useful to remind the House of the key provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that foreign nationals serving sentences here must be informed of the substances of the Act in order that they may make an informed choice as to whether to seek to avail of it.  Sections 4 and 5 deal with applications and legal authority for transfers of persons outside the State: that is, the outward &ldquo;traffic&rdquo; under the Act.</P>
    <P>Under section 4 applications for transfer must be made in writing to me as Minister by the sentenced person concerned.  If, however, the person is unable to apply him or herself by reason of their young age or physical or mental condition, application may be made on their behalf by an appropriate person, such as a parent or doctor.</P>
    <P>Before an application can be granted the conditions for transfer as laid down by the Convention must be met.  The first condition is that the applicant be a national of the receiving or administering state.  Where, however, the person is a national of another EU member state that has ratified the 1987 Agreement that person may be deemed to fulfil this condition.</P>
    <P>The second condition is that the sentence must be final and enforceable.  In other words, all available remedies must be exhausted or the time limit for lodging an appeal against sentence and-or conviction has expired.  This does not, however, preclude the possibility of a later judicial review of the sentence or a petition for pardon in light of fresh evidence under the Criminal Procedure Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1768" /> The third condition concerns the length of sentence still to be served. Normally this must be of at least six months duration or be indeterminate.  In exceptional cases, however, this requirement need not be rigidly complied with and, provided the receiving or administering state agrees, a transfer can be effected where there is less than six months left to serve.</P>
    <P>The fourth condition is that the transfer must be voluntary &mdash; the sentenced person must consent freely and with full knowledge of what the legal effect of his or her transfer will be from the point of view of both jurisdictions.  Consequently, the Convention and the Act in section 4, (5) lay particular emphasis on the necessity for full and informed consent, since transferring someone without consent would lack fairness and be, ultimately, counterproductive.</P>
    <P>The fifth condition is that the offence concerned would constitute a criminal offence if committed in the administering state.  This is intended to ensure compliance with the principle of dual criminal liability.  It is not necessary that the criminal offence be precisely the same in all respects under both the law of this jurisdiction and that of the sentencing state, but some element of comparability or compatibility is necessary.</P>
    <P>The sixth and final condition is that the administering state must also agree to the transfer.  This condition confirms the convention's basic principle that a transfer requires the agreement of the two states concerned as well as that of the sentenced person.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that the legal authority for the transfer of a person out of the State will be by way of warrant issued by the Minister for Justice.  The warrant provides authority for taking the sentenced person to the point of departure from the State &mdash; which will normally be an airport &mdash; and for handing him or her over to the escorting officer authorised by the administering state.</P>
    <P>While the delivery and removal of the sentenced person is being effected, he <Col N="1769" /> or she will be deemed to be in legal custoday. When a person has been transferred, the sentence imposed by this jurisdiction will continue to be enforceable so that if, for instance, the person should escape from lawful custody he or she would be liable to be taken into custody on foot of the original court order.</P>
    <P>The sentence will cease to be enforceable, however, once the receiving or administering state considers enforcement to have been completed.  We do not want to have a situation where a person who is granted the equivalent of full temporary release in a foreign state would be liable to arrest and imprisonment should the person return here. Accordingly, section 5 provides that the Minister may direct that the sentence be varied or cease altogether in order to give effect to the Convention.</P>
    <P>The procedure for transfers into the State &mdash; that is, inward &ldquo;traffic&rdquo;&mdash; is set out in sections 6 and 7.  The grounds for a transfer are to all intents and purposes the same as those for ongoing transfers which I have just outlined.  The one significant difference is the role the High Court has to play in providing the legal authority for the transfer once it has been consented to.  I will return to that in a moment.</P>
    <P>Applications for inward transfer must be made in writing, either by the sentencing state or directly to me by the sentenced person.  The legislation, as initiated, had provision only for the former method of application, but the House will recall that we thought it prudent to make an amendment to allow for applications to come direct to me from the prisoner as well as from the state where the prisoner is held.  The ability of a person in another state to apply directly to me should help with any difficulty there may be of other countries perhaps, for example, delaying the transmission of applications.  The legislation was amended to make it clear that the term &ldquo;national&rdquo; for the purposes of applications for transfer into the State should be interpreted in its widest possible sense and, so, it includes <Col N="1770" /> persons who, though not strictly speaking nationals, have close ties with this country.</P>
    <P>Once I, as Minister, have satisfied myself that these requirements under the Convention have been met and I agree to the transfer, it would be a matter for me to apply to the High Court for the issue of a warrant providing legal authority for the bringing of the person into the State and the continued enforcement of the sentence here.</P>
    <P>The role of the High Court is set out in section 7.  In sum, the court must issue a warrant if satisfied that the necessary conditions for transfer have been fulfilled. In issuing a warrant for continued enforcement, the court will be bound by the type of penalty and duration of sentence determined by the sentencing state.  There may occasionally be cases, however, where the legal nature or duration of the sentence imposed in the foreign jurisdiction will be incompatible with the law of this State.  This could arise, for example, because of different penal systems with regard to the division of penalties, or the minimum or maximum length of sentences prescribed. In such cases the High Court may, under section 7, adapt the sentence to one prescribed by the law of this State for a similar offence.  The adaptation procedure must take place within the very limited boundaries specified: the adapted sentence must, as far as practicable, correspond with that imposed by the sentencing state.  Also, it must not aggravate the sentence imposed in the sentencing state and must not exceed the maximum sentence prescribed by the law of this State for a similar offence.  In other words, the High Court may adapt the sentence to the nearest equivalent available provided this does not result in a longer sentence, so that the sentenced person is no less well off from the point of view of length of time still to be served.</P>
    <P>Section 7 also seeks to make explicit that the High Court, in issuing a warrant for continued enforcement, must take into account any remission accured in the sentencing state.  In other words if, <Col N="1771" /> say, a person has already earned one-third remission in respect of the portion of a sentence served abroad, he or she will be credited with it and this will be reflected in the amount of sentence he or she will be required to serve when transfered here.</P>
    <P>The issue of the warrant will mean, in practice, that the balance of the sentence to be served in this jurisdiction will have the same effect as if it were a sentence imposed here.  It will not be subject to appeal since that remains the prerogative of the sentencing state, but in all other respects will be served in precisely the same way as a sentence imposed here and will be subject to all the normal rules governing administration of sentence generally, remission and temporary release.</P>
    <P>Enforcement will cease sooner than it would do in the normal course where notification is received from the sentencing state of any decision taken there, other than one concerning remission, which would mean in effect that the sentence would no longer be enforceable in that state.  This could happen where there has been a quashing of the conviction by the sentencing state.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the legal custody of the person being transferred to the State in accordance with a High Court warrant and the designation and powers of persons authorised to take the person to and from any place under the warrant.  Under the Convention the sentencing state alone has the right to take decisions on applications for review of conviction.  If the outcome of such a review is that the sentence is to be quashed, then the administering state must reciprocate and terminate enforcement as soon as it is notified of any such decision or measure.</P>
    <P>Section 9 contains a general power for the Minister or the High Court, as the case may be, to revoke or vary the warrant under which the person has been transferred either out of or into the State to give effect to the Convention where necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Act deals with two <Col N="1772" /> things.  First, it contains what might be called an anti-discrimination clause.  It provides that in considering applications for transfer there can be no discrimination between applicants without good reason.  Second, subsection (2) deals with an obligation on me to furnish a statement specifying the grounds for any refusal of an application for transfer under the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 11 requires that each year I must put before the Houses, by way of a separate annual report, an account of how all aspects of the legislation have operated and this will include information relating to each application made.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the Act will not become operative until the process of ratification is completed &mdash; that is, under the terms of the Convention, on the first day of the month following the expiration of three months after the date of deposit of our instrument of ratification.</P>
    <P>The process of ratification, which can proceed when we have passed the necessary motion today, will have very positive benefits for Irish nationals serving sentences in foreign prisons and particularly for their families.  Equally, it will provide an avenue of hope for those non-nationals who happen to have been sentenced in this jurisdiction but who would prefer to be in their home country.</P>
    <P>Given that this process is fulfilling our responsibilities as a member of the Council of Europe, the humanitarian nature of what is proposed and the part this measure will play in the consolidation of the peace process, I am confident in commending this motion that it will be approved by this House.</P>

      <P>It is a matter of deep regret that the British Government has not recognised the vital role played by republican and loyalist prisoners in <Col N="1773" /> Northern and British prisons in bringing about the peace process, persuading terrorist organisations on both sides of the necessity for that process and the support they have given it since 31 August last.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of particular regret that there has not been any relaxation regarding the release of prisoners.  I congratulate the Government on the action it took at Christmas and since in recognising the importance of a prisoner release mechanism to consolidate the peace process but that has not been reciprocated in the North.  Surely it is illogical that there were fewer prison releases last Christmas when the peace process was in operation than the previous one.</P>
      <P>The treatment of prisoners in British jails and the unhelpful statements made yesterday by the Home Secretary are to be abhorred.  Since the ceasefire conditions in Belmarsh Prison have worsened considerably with the introduction of closed visits which can only be described as an act of sheer vindictiveness on the part of the British Government.  During the past 20 years prisoner transfers were refused causing families unnecessary hardship. Additional punishments had been given, such as, confinement in special secure units, denial of compassionate leave, refusal of parole, closed family and legal visits and constant movement between prisons throughout England.</P>
      <P>It is incumbent on both Governments to make progress in the peace process to allow the prisoner issue to be tackled but in tackling it one must recognise also the sensitivities of families and friends of victims who have been murdered or maimed during the 25 year conflict, which we all hope will not recommence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the peace process, it is proper that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste should regularly fulfil their obligations by meeting British Ministers and officials as well as prominent American peace activists and the main protagonists who seek to develop a peace dividend from the historic peace process in <Col N="1774" /> operation since last September.  It is terribly disappointing that nothing concrete emanated from Monday's meeting which was surrounded by hype and heightened expectations, not all of which were manufactured by the media. More was expected and much more needs to be done.  It is a sad reflection on the inertia of both Governments that they could only re-echo the general commitment to the peace process made by the paramilitaries last year.  It is incumbent on Government to fill the potentially dangerous vacuum that exists by political activity.</P>
    <P>It was clearly understood at the outset that the peace process would be demonstrated by a structured political process but that has not happened.  It is unhelpful for British politicians to say that Sinn Féin or any other group, loyalist or republican, are disqualified from participating in a dialogue on peace consequent on their firm commitment to peace.  That does not show good faith and the peace process was built firmly on the good faith of the key players to deliver what was necessary.  Certain parties to the peace process have delivered on their side and we have had almost 12 months of peace.  There are still many items of unfinished business and many examples of barbarity that appeal, but the peace process and the peace delivered is still the peace agreed.  Other parties have not yet delivered on the potential of the peace dividend.</P>
    <P>We, in Fianna Fáil, recognise that there are difficulties, obstacles and sensitivites to be kept in mind along the way, but there were just as many difficulties, obstacles and sensitivities before the ceasefire and the work was still done.  When a multi-faceted process such as this loses its momentum somethings of its original impulse is also lost; we cannot afford that.</P>
    <P>We fully support the Government in its official meetings and those behind the scenes, we hope its efforts will bear fruit, but time is of the essence and we have not yet seen any results.  A great deal of time has been lost in tiresome word games, rowing backwards and <Col N="1775" /> kicking to touch.  We want to give both Governments the benefit of the doubt but it is sad to witness so much effort resulting in such barely discernible progress; to describe it as a snail's peace would not overstate it.  We all expect a breakthrough soon, which is what is needed to lower the tension that has invaded the political vacuum created by inertia.</P>
    <P>I want to mention specially the great work being done by my party colleague, Deputy Ó Cuív, who has been going quietly about British jails over the past six months, where possible, listening to prisoners, meeting their families and representing their views to British and Irish officials.</P>
    <P>It is a pity the Government did not see fit to accept the comprehensive Fianna Fáil motion tabled on prisoners which would have constituted a powerful democratic force behind its representations, in taking such a stand with the British Government before and after the Cannes meeting.  It would have demonstrated to the British Government that our Government really believed what backbenchers in the House of Commons were saying to them.  It would also have added force to the recent Labour Party mission clearly demonstrating our Government's strong commitment to necessary movement on the prisoners' issue: the fact that the Government did not accept our motion is a matter of deep regret.</P>
    <P>With regard to the overall peace process, the prisoners' issue is a crucial one as is decommissioning of arms. However, decommissioning of arms was not a precondition of the peace process; the precondition was that there would be a ceasefire, yet the decommissioning of arms has been raised consistently in recent months.  If there is to be an international commission established to oversee such decommissioning, let us examine its terms of reference in detail and allow its members to implement their mandate as soon as possible.  Any such international commission should not be seen as an excuse for further <Col N="1776" /> delaying all-party talks.  We heard the Taoiseach's view of those talks here this morning.  I agree that all parties should sit around the table but the unwillingness of a party to so do should not be allowed to constitute a veto on the remaining parties to them.</P>
    <P>The British and Irish Governments agreed the framework document &mdash; signed by the Taoiseach on assuming office &mdash; which has been in existence since February last, yet no progress has been made and it appears it has been put to one side.  As a matter of priority, we want to see all-party talks on the Joint Downing Street Declaration, the framework document constituting its central element.  If the Unionist parties want to place a document on the table, so be it, but the framework document is there; we want all-inclusive talks and nobody, Unionists or anybody else, should have the right to veto them.  Let the talking begin at the earliest possible opportunity; let the decommissioning issue be tackled, as it must, as an item on the agenda or through the establishment of an international commission but let that not be seen as a mechansim for delaying those all-party talks because, if that happened it would lead to continous delays.</P>
    <P>We must never forget that peace is a very precious commodity on this island and we should not allow any delay in talks to destroy the peace we now enjoy and long to see continued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much welcome the motion and the finalisation of the relevant Bill, for which much credit is due to the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.  Indeed, Fianna Fáil gave Sinn Féin a commitment to enact this Bill prior to Christmas 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Bill's passage through the House, I argued strongly on several occasions that we should insert a right of a foreign national imprisoned in this State to obtain a transfer to his or her country of origin, obviously, subject to the consent of the receiving state.  The reason I tabled and strongly argued in <Col N="1777" /> favour of that amendment on numerous occasions was that I believe it would impose a moral obligation on other states, in particular, the United Kingdom, to grant such transfer, as of right, from that jurisdiction to ours.</P>
    <P>In retrospect my amendment must be seen to have been appropriate and proper. The British Home Secretary, Mr. Michael Howard, is reported in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> as having said yesterday:</P>
    <P>We have a clear policy on the transfer of prisoners.  It was set out in Parliament in 1992, and since then 18 prisoners had been transferred to Northern Ireland, three of them in the last week.  There is no question of a change in that policy...  It sets out the general desirability of prisoners serving their sentences nearer their homes and families, and sets out the criteria by which applications for transfer will be granted...  We have clear criteria for the transfer of prisoners that have been applied consistently since 1992.</P>
    <P>Either Mr. Howard has been living in cloud cuckoo land since 31 August 1994 or is speaking from a position of deep ignorance; either way, his comments were unhelpful, unwise, arrogant and provocative.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the British Home Secretary would now like to explain what criteria were used in the release of Private Lee Clegg: were they the same criteria he so loftily said were established by Parliament in 1992?  Private Lee Clegg was transferred from Ireland within weeks of his conviction for having murdered a young girl and released on licence having served two years only in prison. How could the same criteria shut English cell doors firmly on Irish prisoners requesting a transfer to Ireland when some of them were arrested as teenagers and remain in British prisons after 20 years?</P>
    <P>The British Home Secretary might also explain why the British Government finds it necessary, following a ceasefire that will shortly move into its <Col N="1778" /> second year, to inflict unnecessary hardship on the families of Irish prisoners, by using the refusal of transfers as an extra judicial punishment; what cause is served by such action and, in addition, why the British Government finds it necessary to impose additional punishment on those prisoners, including confinement on special secure units, the denial of compassionate leave, refusal of parole, closed family and legal visits and constant movement between prisons throughout England because it would appear, since the ceasefires, conditions for some, if not all, Irish prisoners have worsened considerably.  In that respect, Mr. Howard might also say what criteria are being used by his Government to dictate this policy.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that prisoners were an integral element of the ceasefires and &mdash; eventual peace.  How then can the British Government explain the cruel, inhuman treatment of prisoners since the ceasefires?  It does not make sense and is downright immoral.  No amount of post-colonial, imperialist ignorance can advance the cause of peace in this island.  Mr. Howard would do well to remember that the people of the Six Counties have just emerged from 25 years of horrific violence, mayhem and death.  The last thing they need is indolence and arrogance on the part of senior members of the British Government with complete disregard for the promises they made so solemnly with regard to all-party talks.</P>
    <P>I suspect it is not the case that Mr. Howard is not capable of learning the history of this country or, in particular, of the Six Counties, rather that he wishes to put his true blue unionism and naked hias on public display.  Mr. Howard and others within the British establishment who share his political backwater should be consigned to the dustbins of history.  Meanwhile, the remainder of us should look forward and request those who understand the problem on this island to look to the future in the light of the terms of the Joint Downing Street Declaration, which underpins the peace process, in <Col N="1779" /> which firm commitments of generosity and magnaminity were set out.</P>
    <P>Preconditions such as decommissioning did not arise and, desirable as it is, will not be achieved prior to all inclusive talks.  It is downright foolhardy to link the transfer or release of prisoners with the decommissioning issue.  Any attempt, covert or overt, to use the release or transfer of prisoners as a pawn in the decommissioning of armaments is a dangerous road to go down. Nonetheless, some British politicians, not least Mr. Howard, appear to take that line.  In doing so, they may well be digging a hole for the peace process rather than building upon its foundations.</P>
    <P>We are not calling on the British Government to treat loyalist prisoners any differently from IRA prisoners.  We are merely asking for movement on the question of transfers and release as a matter of common sense and ordinary justice.  The words &ldquo;parity of esteem&rdquo; have been used a great deal during the past two years.  If parity of esteem is to mean anything it will surely translate into action with a view to bringing that about.</P>
    <P>Surely the British Government has learned by now that if it does not learn from Irish history it is doomed to repeat the same mistakes.  It would be a tragedy for everybody on this island if violence were to resume.  British intransigence on the prisoners issue is clearly giving rise to early scepticism from extreme republicans and loyalists. Under no circumstances must they be given even the flimsiest excuse to resume their murderous campaigns. Like many a time before, the future peace of this island is in the hands of the British Government.</P>
    <P>We must be perfectly clear about one thing.  The paramilitaries were promised that inclusive talks would begin soon after a ceasefire.  Those talks did not begin.  The British Government broke faith.  It is time for it to turn over a new leaf and make a gesture on the prisoners issue in order to enhance confidence in <Col N="1780" /> the peace process and deliver on the spirit of the Downing Street Joint Declaration.</P>
    <P>It is of crucial importance that prisoner releases and transfers also apply to republican socialist prisoners in a balanced way.  Equity and justice demand that all prisoners be treated alike and fairly.  There have been complaints from Portlaoise prison that the Provisional IRA group of prisoners receive more favourable treatment than the other groups of republican prisoners.  Will the Government have the matter investigated to ensure there is not any discrimination between different sets of prisoners?</P>
    <P>It is time for the peacemakers in the British Cabinet to come out of the woodwork and advance the cause of a just and lasting peace at this crucial juncture in Irish history.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any objection to this motion and I am happy to support it.  It is right that it should be moved now that the legislation has been passed.  The convention was signed nearly nine years ago and, as is the case with many of these conventions, we have been somewhat remiss in not having ratified it for so long.  Unfortunately, there are various other conventions that have not been ratified either, which many people would regard as being equally important and, in some cases, more important.</P>
      <P>It is inevitable that one should conclude it is because of the peace process that this ratification procedure is now being brought forward and the legislation passed.  Without it, this convention, like many others, would probably have been ignored.  I am concerned about the effect this may have on our prison system.  We do not have any definite prisoner figures and I do not believe much research was done on it. In her contribution, the Minister referred to at least 600 convicted Irish nationals held in custody abroad.  In the debate on the Bill she referred to 650 but the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas say the figure is 1,200.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Potentially any country is eligible; they do not have to be members of the Council of Europe. They can accede to it and make arrangements if they accept the rules set out in the convention.  If a significant proportion of the 600 plus prisoners were to opt to come back here, it would create huge problems for our prison system which is virtually on the point of breakdown anyway.</P>
      <P>In the course of her contribution, the Minister referred to the estimate of the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas, that approximately 40 prisoners will apply initially and that there would be ten new cases per annum afterwards. If the commission is right in that figure &mdash; and I hope it is &mdash; that number is manageable.  The Minister did not make any comment regarding her belief as to whether that is likely to be the actual figure.  I would be surprised if the figure was so small; I would have thought it would be much larger.</P>
      <P>I am a little concerned that many hundreds of prisoners might apply to transfer at a time when the prison system here is virtually on the point of breakdown. We have a revolving door syndrome, as the Minister and everyone else knows &mdash; people are in and out of prison in very short periods.  That will be further accentuated by these transfers if the numbers are very large.  The Minister should give the House an estimate of the number of people likely to be involved as these transfers could cause chaos.</P>
      <P>I am given some reassurance that she has to agree to each transfer and that Ireland will enter a reservation to the terms of ratification of the convention. I am a little concerned about the nature of that reservation because it could be used to virtually stultify the whole process. The Minister stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This I propose to do by indicating <Col N="1782" /> at the time of ratification that Ireland reserves the right to limit the excess of inward over outward transfers in the light of the availability of prison spaces, and will regard the degree of closeness of applicants' ties with Ireland as a primary consideration.</P>
    <P>I do not have any problem with the second proposal but if the first is taken literally, some future Minister could say he or she will only accept prisoners from abroad in direct proportion to the number here who are going abroad.  Since the numbers here are clearly much smaller than the number of our nationals imprisoned abroad, that could limit transfers.  However, it is a potential safety valve if the process became unmanageable and I hope it will not create further chaos in the prison system here which gives rise to so much concern.</P>
    <P>If, in addition to this, we were to pass in the next year, say, a referendum changing the bail arrangements and if bail became somewhat less common than it is &mdash; it currently applies in practice to about 99 per cent of people charged &mdash; and the proportion of those getting bail on serious offences was significantly smaller, that of itself would create a huge problem in our prisons. The combination of that and this convention, if it were to result in the return of a huge number of people, could make the process entirely unworkable.  I hope that will not be the case.  What is relevant to this &mdash; and perhaps the Minister might deal with it in her reply &mdash; is how the bail question now stands and whether there will be a referendum.  I believe she is of one view and that some of her colleagues in Government are of another.  Our bail laws have been in place since 1966 when the O'Callaghan case was decided by the Supreme Court and it is time, almost 30 years later, we made up our minds to do something about this very serious problem.  A significant proportion of offences are committed by people on bail and it is fair to say that those offences would not be committed if the people concerned were <Col N="1783" /> not on bail.  We must have the most liberal bail laws in the world.  They are unnecessary in the interests of individual liberties as the community as a whole has certain rights which should be protected.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a long and detailed account of how the Convention will work here.  We are grateful for this as it is helpful.  However, she did not deal with one of the most tricky points of all, the circumstances under which remission will be given to people who are transferred to Ireland.  If she dealt with this point I missed it and I apologise&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <P>I think that is what is envisaged by the Convention in any event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of prisoners is topical in the context of the peace process.  As I have pointed out on more than one occasion, the peace process must not be seen or portrayed as a Nationalist process and one of concern to Nationalists only.  There is a huge political vacuum in Northern Ireland which has been caused by the fact that the agenda is essentialy being run by a minority party which I find difficult to accept as a member of a normal democratic political party.  One of the reasons the agenda is being run in that way is that the elected representatives and leaders of the Unionist community in Northern Ireland seem to have virtually opted out.  They are not taking part in the fundamental debate and they simply react from time to time to events and make comments on them.  They have no input into what is going on because they <Col N="1784" /> choose not to have any.  This is very regrettable as it has caused the entire debate and agenda to become somewhat one-sided.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects one could talk about but if one reads the newspapers or watches television one would think prisoners were the only issue.  This if far from the case and it is very disappointing that the moderate parties in the centre on both sides are playing such a relatively low key role in the entire process and that the effective interaction appears to be between Sinn Féin, which represents at most 10 per cent of the population in Northern Ireland, and the British Government.  It seems from their present attitude that the Unionist leadership would prefer to have no power than to share power.  The people whom they represent are being badly done by and this has inevitably led to a serious political vacuum.  As in the case of everything else, every political vacuum is filled, and the manner in which this vacuum is being filled at present is not necessarily the best.  This makes many people at home and abroad assume that the agenda is the real one and the only possible one.  It allows people to call the shots and to say that their particular requirements are the only real ones which will make the peace process successful and permanent. Of course, this is far from the case.</P>
    <P>If the process is to be successful and permanent we need a political settlement of a fundamental nature which will only arise from dialogue between all the parties.  We would do well to remind ourselves that when we talk about all parties we are not only including the need to try to have Sinn Féin involved but we are also trying to ensure that those who represent much larger sections of the community will take their place at the table and play their full part.  They have not done this to date and that is why the running is being seen to be made by those who are making it.  This motion should be seen in this context.  It relates only to a small number of people, to the priority requirements of a very small section of the <Col N="1785" /> community and is only one of many matters which should play a prominent part in the dialogue that should now be taking place.</P>
    <P>Today the Taoiseach said he thought the procedures now under way might take some time and may be slow.  This includes the establishment of a commission by the Irish and British Governments which hopefully will lead to procedures for the decommissioning of arms.  I understand other procedures are supposed to proceed in parallel with this.  However, if the procedures are slow and the kind of timetable implied by the Taoiseach is adhered to there is a danger in the circumstances of the political vacuum I have described that something will go wrong.  If active genuine political dialogue and negotiations were taking place and everyone wanted to be actively involved then those dangers would not be as great and we would not have a lopsided picture where everything would appear to depend on one minority party and nothing else would appear to matter.  If people are not prepared to play their part then they cannot blame a small unrepresentative minority party for appearing to speak for more people than they do and for giving their requirements a priority which is not warranted by the facts.  This is a very sensitive time when everybody concerned should seek to reflect on where they stand and the contribution they can make.  In particular, there is an obligation on the more moderate people to play their part so that a proper balance can be struck and a more complete picture given.</P>
    <P>I am glad this Convention will be ratified but I do not regard it as a matter of major importance.  It is a very small contribution towards the overall process. I hope when this is behind us that people will be able to get on with more fundamental matters and will not shy away from dialogue simply because all their requirements are not met in advance before that dialogue takes place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. As the Minister stated, the thinking behind the convention is to address the situation in which persons serving sentences in other countries may have to endure added suffering beyond that normally involved in the deprivation of liberty.  For people in prison, 95 per cent of their punishment is the fact that they are in custody and it is proper that the prison system should be as humane as possible.  I look forward to the implementation of the convention and the transfer of prisoners as rapidly as possible from Britain to the North and South or to wherever their relatives are located.  The Minister referred to the importance of the convention to relatives and this should be taken into account.</P>
      <P>Regarding prisoners who are not being transferred to this country, the Minister should impress upon the Governments of countries in which Irish citizens are held, particularly the British Government in relation to political prisoners, that it is unacceptable in any civilised society to treat prisoners with inhumanity or unnecessary hardship. Unfortunately, this applies not only to the prisoners but also their relatives when, for example, prisoners are moved around every six months.</P>
      <P>I understand one prisoner was moved to eight different prisons in two years and I cannot see what that does for security, the image of a Government or the prisoner.  The overwhelming majority of prisoners are eventually released and we all wish them to be rehabilitated in their communities as quickly as possible. I ask the Minister to raise the issue of moving prisoners with the British Government because it creates unnecessary hardship for the prisoners and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of the placement of prisoners in British prisons. Often relatives are not informed that prisoners have been moved and prisons are often inaccessible to relatives &mdash; in particular, elderly relatives &mdash; travelling from this country.  This issue of <Col N="1787" /> access to medical treatment must be addressed but unfortunately, there are incidents where easy access to such treatment is not available.</P>
    <P>The issue of closed visits and compassionate parole also arise.  Some prisoners have been in prison for over 20 years but are not released when a parent dies which is unacceptable in a civilised society.  Recent problems in British prisons could have been avoided if the administrative procedure relating to the transfer of prisoners had been expedited.  I understand decision taken six months ago were only implemented in recent weeks after problems arose in prisons, such as the dirty protest.</P>
    <P>The motion, which is welcome, is very much related to making progress in the peace process.  As I said in the recent debate on this matter, the  sentences of all political prisoners in this country and in Britain should be reviewed.  I am sure some prisoners would be released and those in a similar position to that of Private Clegg in terms of doubtful convictions should certainly be released &mdash; although Private Clegg's case was heard by the highest courts, including the House of Lords, and they all upheld his conviction.</P>
    <P>Following 11 months' peace, it is time to reinstate the system of 50 per cent remission of sentence.  This existed up to 1989 but was removed as a result of a very high level of violence.  As there has been a total cessation of paramilitary violence for 11 months there is no reason the 50 per cent remission of sentence system should not be reinstated. This would help to further the peace process.</P>
    <P>The position of republican and loyalist prisoners must be addressed and I share the concern expressed by my colleagues about the political vacuum.  On 31 August last year, the republican paramilitaries stopped their violent campaign and they were followed some weeks later by the loyalist paramilitaries. It is unfortunate that, 11 months later, a political vacuum exists and, regrettably, the undoubted cause is <Col N="1788" /> the intransigence of the British Government.</P>
    <P>The first delay centred on the definition of &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; but after a few months it was accepted that the paramilitaries on both sides were committed to pursuing their aims through democratic means.  There is also the ongoing debate about decommissioning, which is very one-sided in that republican paramilitaries are expected to hand up their weapons.  However, in terms of decommissioning, it is important to recognise that there are far too many weapons in Northern Ireland in the hands of republicans, loyalists and the security forces.</P>
    <P>The release of Private Lee Clegg raised tension even higher than normal in the week before 12 July.  We saw some of the consequences of that decision in Portadown and the Ormeau Road.  It is important that people appreciate the fear which exists, particularly on the Garvaghy Road in Portadown when families were up all night worried that their homes would be burned.</P>
    <P>It was unfortunate that elected leaders of unionist political parties, particularly Mr. David Trimble and Dr. lan Paisley, increased the tension at that time with some outlandish statements. Mr. Ken Magennis, MP, also made scaremongering, unhelpful statements. It is important that all politicians on this island, particularly those from the northern constitutional parties, sit around the table and look to the future.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to the Taoiseach's remarks this morning.  In common with many others, I am disappointed at the outcome of the meeting between the Tánaiste and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, on Monday.  Our expectations were raised and phrases such as &ldquo;very good authority&rdquo; were used.  We were told it was a &ldquo;very positive&rdquo; meeting but now it was merely a &ldquo;good&rdquo; meeting; its results were toned down.  Given the Taoiseach's remarks this morning, is the Government isolating decommissioning from other aspects of the peace process? I would be concerned if that happened <Col N="1789" /> because everything must be considered in tandem.</P>
    <P>Decommissioning is important but other issues are equally important, such as policing and prisoners.  Regardless of the decisions made by the British and Irish Governments, I urge the Taoiseach to ensure that they have the support of the majority of the representatives of the nationalist population.  It would be unheard of if an Irish Government went ahead and agreed to something with which the constitutional representatives of nationalists disagreed.  I urge the Taoiseach to bear this in mind in terms of whatever action is taken because it would not be progress if he did not have the agreement of the representatives of nationalists in the North.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I ask everybody who has influence to ensure that all-party talks are started without delay.  The worst possible situation is a continuing political vacuum.  It is in the interests of the Nationalists, the Unionists and of the British and Irish Governments to start round-table talks and to make some progress.  None of us knows what dangers might arise from a continuing political vacuum.  In the last 25 years we have seen examples of major blunders by the British Government.  Internment was a major blunder, the way the H-block issue was handled was a major blunder, and it is important that another major blunder is not made now.</P>

It is important to realise that even though this convention has the full backing of the House a cost is involved and it is impossible to accurately assess what that cost will be.  It costs about £40,000 per year to keep a prisoner in jail.  How can we assess the extent of the applications to transfer to Irish prisons?  At the moment, there are 180 non-nationals in Irish jails and they are welcome to apply for transfers.  This would make extra space available and relieve the charge on public money.  Not all of them will apply for a transfer <Col N="1790" /> however.  Some 600 Irish nationals are prisoners abroad and about 400 of them are in prison in the United Kingdom; I gather that about 35 of those in Britain are in jail for paramilitary and related offences.</P>
      <P>The question arises as to how many of those prisoners will apply to transfer to Ireland.  It cannot be assumed that all will do so.  The prospect of the reintroduction of the 50 per cent remission rate in the United Kingdom &mdash; twice the remission rate here &mdash; will be a restraining factor.  Another possible factor to weigh in the balance is the fact that the families of many of those Irish prisoners are living in the United Kingdom.  However if they come here they can, as have other paramilitary prisoners, apply for early release.  I cannot say what decision those prisoners will make, but we must accept that there will be some cost involved.  Despite that, it is correct to approve this convention and accept such a charge.</P>
      <P>We signed this convention when Fine Gael was last in Government in 1986, and it is time the necessary provisions were put in place to give effect to it. Now is a good time to put such provisions in place because of the possible impact of such legislation on the peace process in Northern Ireland.  It will not have a major bearing on the peace process but it is another instrument which could, in the future, be used to maintain the momentum of the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been a number of references to the current state of the peace process.  We all share a great impatience at the delay in getting all party talks under way.  There are hopeful signs, however and I am more optimistic about the situation than many of my colleagues.  Having said that, one of the dangers to the peace process is the desire to find instant solutions.  It will be a long time before we come to a political solution agreed to by all sides.  It will take years rather than weeks or months. When looking at the peace process we must restrain our impatience and our natural desire to have a solution in place immediately; this is not possible.  There <Col N="1791" /> will inevitably be times when it appears that the process is moving with great momentum and times when it is moving very slowly but the most important thing is it keeps moving.</P>
    <P>The major factor underlying the peace process is the continuation of the ceasefire.  A continuing commitment to that makes it possible to work towards putting a political solution in place. How best can we work towards that political solution?  There is a natural tendency to seek scapegoats when progress is not immediately obvious.  The most important contribution anyone with an interest in Northern Ireland can make is to ensure that all comments are moderate and that one is careful in selecting scapegoats.</P>
    <P>I accept that there is an apparent paralysis in political movement in Northern Ireland at present.  There are a number of reasons for that.  This paralysis is not total.  I believe the personalities involved are assessing their positions and prospects and that this may be part of the reason for this apparent paralysis. It is clear that the British Government has not been making any great contribution towards maintaining the necessary momentum recently.  I, like many others, was very concerned at what seemed to be a mistake in the manner in which the case of Private Lee Clegg was dealt with.  It was not dealt with in the context of the Northern Ireland situation or the Irish situation generally.  I am concerned that the decision was taken in a way and at a time that had more to do with the internal United Kingdom politics than with the Northern Ireland peace process.</P>
    <P>This subject is so broad that we can only touch on it.  I hope the convention which we are approving under Article 29 of the Constitution today will make some contribution to the development of the peace process.  In relation to the peace process generally, I encourage all people of goodwill to continue their efforts and be moderate in their comments. If that is done I believe we will <Col N="1792" /> see positive progress towards the political solution we all seek in the months ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion.  Most Deputies with an interest in this area have spoken on this issue during the last year.  I thank the Minister for a comprehensive explanation of how the procedure for the transfer of prisoners would work.  We all had our own ideas but we were not quite certain how it would be dealt with legislatively. Despite the fact that this issue has been on the backboiler since 1983, it is now more relevant than ever.</P>
      <P>It will shortly be 12 months since the Provisional IRA and the loyalist paramilitaries laid down their arms. However, peace is not merely the absence of war.  Recent events in Northern Ireland have demonstrated the fragility of the peace process and it behoves us all to be moderate and tolerant so that what we have continues.  We must also accept how difficult it was to bring it about.</P>
      <P>Last night I read a speech by the late John Kelly.  I always admired him because he was such a great contributor. His remarks addressed the first ceasefire and brought into stark reality the fact that it only lasted a year and floundered because of lack of initiative, nothing was offered and matters did not proceed quickly enough.  This is why the legislation facilitating the transfer of prisoners is so important.  We must continue to realise that we would not have peace if it had not been for the input of prisoners in bringing it about.  Those who had nothing left to lose gave so much and were prepared to make a sacrifice.</P>
      <P>Over the past few weeks we have witnessed appalling scenes of sectarian violence and hatred.  Orange halls were burnt, street confrontations were orchestrated and neither side lost any opportunity to provoke the other.  It is difficult to explain why we do not understand the situation in Bosnia when we see a similar situation so close to home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1793" /> Since last August punishment beatings, which are almost a weekly occurrence, have ensured that there is still fear on the streets in Northern Ireland.  However, in recent weeks the fear has been intensified as each side eyes the other warily and ordinary people look to us, the politicians, to avert a return to the violence which has claimed over 3,000 lives.  We keep saying it must never happen again, but violence continues.</P>
    <P>Against this background, the blunt refusal by the British Home Secretary to contemplate changing the legislation regarding prisoner transfers is deeply disappointing.  It is regrettable that the British Government has not responded more generously to the paramilitary ceasefires, especially with regard to the prisoner issue.  A flexible attitude by the British Government would do much to get the peace process back on track.  It is the one issue which would show good faith and ensure that people remain focused and committed to the very fragile peace we now have.</P>
    <P>However, neither the Irish nor the British Governments, nor indeed any one party bears sole or even the main responsibility for the peace process.  The paramilitaries, ourselves, the British and all sections of society are involved.  We must all clearly demonstrate that we are committed to the path laid before us, the path of democracy.  We must also continue to reassure those involved that we are all committed to this path.</P>
    <P>Peace is not merely the absence of war; it also implies an acceptance of democratic principles.  The first and foremost of these principles is consent. In this respect I would welcome an unequivocal commitment by Sinn Féin to the principle of consent enshrined in the Downing Street Declaration and the Framework Document.  I also urge Sinn Féin to abandon the tactics of street protest and to use its enormous influence. It must not exploit the sectarian tensions but use its influence to defuse them.  We must continue to assure Sinn Féin that we are all, including the <Col N="1794" /> British Government, on the same path and agree on what needs to be done.</P>
    <P>A democratic mandate brings responsibility with it.  However, this has been sadly absent during the past few weeks by all concerned.  Democratic Left supports the Government's efforts to move the peace process forward and to address all the relevant issues.  I hope the British Government will match the effort being made in this jurisdiction and that it will start doing so by adopting a more flexible approach to the transfer of sentenced prisoners.</P>
    <P>However, the convention on the transfer of sentenced persons must be viewed not only in the context of Northern Ireland, but in the broader context. The Council of Europe Convention and the supplementary EU agreement date back to 1983.  As in so many other cases, we were unable to ratify the convention because of absence of relevant domestic legislation.  The transfer of sentenced prisoners legislation, debated in the House earlier this year, brought us closer into line with internationally accepted human rights practice.</P>
    <P>Despite the immediate relevance to the situation in Northern Ireland, the purpose of the legislation is primarily humanitarian, rather than political. Civilised standards demand that prisoners should be able to serve their sentences as close to their homes and families as possible, for the sake of the families, if not of the prisoners.  Families of prisoners are often the hidden victims. Many families do not want the glare of publicity that comes from having to travel long distances, and from having to go public to make known the plight of a family member or friend.  As a nation we pride ourselves in placing great store by the family.  However, we appear to have no regard for the families of prisoners and the legislation will help.</P>
    <P>Families of prisoners are often forced to undertake long journeys at considerable if not prohibitive expense to visit them.  Quite apart from the consolidation of the peace process, for this <Col N="1795" /> reason I would welcome increased flexibility on the part of the British Government with regard to the prisoners' issue. I hope Mr. Howard will reconsider the issue and will not allow his Government's stance to be influenced by purely domestic politics.  It is far too serious for any of us to allow the opportunity to slip, an opportunity which could give us the time, flexibility and understanding to create a trust between all parties involved to bring this fragile peace one step further.  It appears to be stagnant at present and we are all worried about this.  We are all being tolerant and understanding, but I sometimes wonder how far this can go.</P>

      <P>I dtosach báire cuireann sé áthas orm labhairt uair amháin eile ar an ábhar seo.  I compliment the Minister on introducing the motion.  If she had not done so it would not have been introduced until September at the earliest.  We would then have had to wait three months from that date for ratification.  However, the motion allows her to proceed and lodge the document of ratification.  Anybody concerned with this matter will appreciate that the Minister has brought forward the motion, introduced the legislation and acted with all speed in ensuring that the legislation becomes operable at the earliest date.</P>
      <P>This is an important convention in its own right and as a humanitarian convention. It is something that, as a civilised State, we were perhaps remiss in not introducing sooner.  However, better late than never.  Not only does it allow us bring home our nationals, it also facilitates those who are in prison here from other countries to seek transfers to their own countries.  As the Minister said, prison sentences should not be longer because a person is from a different country.  The legislation, and this convention, represent a breath of fresh air, particularly for the families of prisoners. I hope that in the three months there will be action on the question of transfers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1796" /> Unlike a previous speaker, I am not concerned about numbers.  I do not believe there will be a large number of requests for transfers, although there will be a reasonable demand.  The Minister has provided for that and she will be able to deal with the demand.  We must ensure that this process is up and running as soon as the convention is operable.  I hope countries from which requests for transfers come &mdash; for example, Irish prisoners in Britain &mdash; will reciprocate by dealing quickly with transfers and that an efficient and speedy transfer system will be put in place.</P>
    <P>As somebody who has visited prisons in Britain on two occasions and made three journeys there on that subject in recent months, I could not speak in the House without mentioning the republican and the few loyalist prisoners in Britain.  There are approximately 33 such prisoners there some of whom come from Northern Ireland, while the remainder come from the Republic.  The number, therefore, seeking a possible transfer to the Republic will not be significant. However, it is of great significance in terms of the peace process.  The numbers should and could be reduced by the British if they acted in a humane way towards prisoners in their custody.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention five prisoners about whom I have spoken before.  Prisoners Gibson, Kinsella, Norney, Nordonne and Dowd should not be transferred anywhere because they have already served 20 years and were the subject of a recommendation last February by the Lord Chief Justice that they should be released.  Those prisoners should be released by the British Home Secretary.  A previous speaker said there was an attempt to look for scapegoats. I have never operated on that basis in politics.  However, as I became more involved in the prisoners issue, I saw the way they were treated.  The more legal cases of which I became informed, the more I realised that the transfers which have taken place to the North to date were on foot of court warrants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1797" /> There is an obduracy in Britain to recognise the problems and the solutions needed in the North which I found starting.  I was disappointed to discover that because like many people I had hoped we had entered a new phase of Anglo-Irish understanding at office level, at ministerial and Civil Service level, of the dynamic of Irish politics in its broadest sense and of the strained relations which often exist between British and Irish people, particularly between Irish people and their relations with British institutions.</P>
    <P>Having visited Britain in the past few months my faith in that progress has been somewhat diminished.  I am not that sure that there has been a sea change in British attitudes to Irish people, particularly to Irish prisoners. We must ensure they realise that the consolidation of the peace will be based on trust and that trust with prisoners and their families is an important part of this process.  By passing the legislation and this motion, we will be showing that we are willing to move forward and face the problems of many of these prisoners.  That is not to take away from the wider aspects of the Bill which I welcome. However, it is of immediate importance to the ongoing peace process.</P>
    <P>We have put the necessary administrative and legislative programmes in place so nobody can point a finger at us and say that we have not done everything to humanely deal with this problem which resulted from the political vacuum in Northern Ireland for 70 years.  We have initiated the early release of prisoners and have introduced the legislation and this motion to the House.  I hope the British Government will look at the positive effects of such forward thinking in this jurisdiction. Those who are interested in building confidence will see this as a positive building block for the future. They should follow our example and take a positive attitude to ensuring peace and deal with the political situation.</P>
    <P>Those of us who visited the prisons, <Col N="1798" /> including members of the Labour Party who did so recently, will know that the regime under which the prisoners are kept is unnecessarily repressive in view of the ongoing peace process.  There is no justification for the type of security measures in force 11 months after the ceasefire.  It shows a lack of understanding of the dynamic of the paramilitaries to believe that there is a high risk.  We must continue to highlight this issue and to move forward.  Without progress on the prisoners issue, we will find it difficult to make progress on the peace issue.  I recognise that there are other factors in this process.  However, given the negative attitude to the prisoners issue, there is a danger that the peace process might get sidelined into that issue or get stuck in that rut because it is the most immediate matter to be dealt with.  We should deal with that issue in a positive way so we can get back to the peace process, which is a multifaceted one with each side being prepared to give and take.</P>
    <P>If a prisoner is transferred here in six months and subsequently the House of Commons, or another parliament, introduces extra remission &mdash; for example, 75 per cent, which would affect the prisoner &mdash; would that automatically apply to that prisoner?  That is an important issue because prisoners will consider the attractions of being transferred here against the possible disadvantage of awaiting legislation which might be introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bree</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Government motion which I support.  Over recent days I, and three colleagues from the Parliamentary Labour Party, visited a number of prisons in England where we had an opportunity to speak with some of the Irish prisoners detained there.  While the conditions of imprisonment for Irish <Col N="1799" /> prisoners convicted in the UK of politically related charges have always been harsh, in recent times the conditions have deteriorated alarmingly.  This is a cause of concern for all of us interested in the further development of the peace process.</P>
      <P>Eleven of these prisoners are now serving their twentieth year in prison and none has been given any indication of a release date.  The youngest was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1975 for using a firearm to resist arrest; he was 17 years old at the time.  Twenty years later, with half of his young life spent behind bars, the British Home Office will not give him any indication when he might be considered for release.</P>
      <P>If we contrast that with the case of Private Lee Clegg we begin to see how British justice works.  Private Clegg was convicted in a court of law of murdering a young Irish girl in Belfast.  However, after serving only four years he was released.  This confirms &mdash; if confirmation were ever needed &mdash; that there is one law for the Irish and another for members of the British security forces.</P>
      <P>Another example is the case of Seán Kinsella whom I met in Full Sutton Prison. He is the eldest of four children. He has served nearly 20 years in prison. His 76 year old mother is suffering from Alzheimer's disease and has not seen him for the past eight years.  A letter from the British Home Office sent in February indicated that the British Lord Chief Justice stated he was satisfied that Seán Kinsella and four other named Irish prisoners had served long enough, and if they were to be released some months short of the 20 years recommended at their trials, he would have no problem with that.  Six months later, despite this, there is still no sign of any release.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the Irish prisoners convicted of politically related offences are held in what are called special secure units or SSUs.  These are prisons within prisons and people held in them have no contact with the general prison population. The units are small, usually holding <Col N="1800" /> eight to ten prisoners, with limited facilities.  Prisoners are monitored at all times by prison officers and by cameras. Prisoners held in SSUs are confined all day; they are not allowed to participate in any of the normal jail activities, such as going to the library, the main gym or playing fields.  A number of observers have expressed concern about the oppressive nature of SSUs.  Many believe that prolonged detention in such facilities can only be detrimental to a person's health and wellbeing.</P>
    <P>Two of the prisoners we met in Whitemoor Prison came off the &ldquo;dirty protest&rdquo; specifically to speak to us. They told us of the terrible conditions in the segregation unit in which they were held and also conditions in the special secure unit in the prison.  They complained of 24 hour confinement without seeing daylight, food deliberately left to go cold before being given to them and the water supply to their cells being cut off regularly.  They told us they were refused a knife and fork with which to eat thereby forcing them to eat with their bare hands.  They were refused letters and other forms of outside communication and were denied books and newspapers.  They told us that during the night prison warders constantly banged the metal flaps on the doors and switched the cell lights on and off.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that Irish prisoners being held in Whitemoor and Belmarsh Prisons are being subjected to a savage regime that would not be accepted in any other civilised country.  Gareth Pierce, the solicitor who has done so much for Irish prisoners over the years, told me that when I met her on Saturday last that conditions for Irish prisoners in England today were appalling and unacceptable.  It is common knowledge that the conditions of imprisonment of Irish prisoners convicted of politically related offences in Britain have always been harsh.  However, with the development of the peace process it was hoped that this issue, with others stemming from the conflict in the North, <Col N="1801" /> would be resolved.  It is most unfortunate that the response to date from the British Government on this issue has been negative in the extreme.</P>
    <P>Having had the opportunity to speak to prisoners, their families and legal advisers it is clear the prisoners have shown great restraint in the face of provocation, and a great majority of them are seeking to resolve the issues so far as possible without engaging in prison protest.  If they are to resolve the issues they will need the continued assistance and intervention of all who wish to see the peace process further developed at this crucial stage.</P>
    <P>In that context I wish to pay tribute to the Tánaiste for the time, attention and effort he has devoted to the prisoners issue.  I also wish to thank the Ambassador and his staff in the Irish Embassy in London.  Their work is much appeciated by the prisoners and their families.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and his colleagues in Cabinet will be aware of the growing frustration regarding this matter.  The Transfer of Sentenced Persons Bill has already been passed and this motion demonstrates the Government's determination to have the issue resolved.  The adoption of this motion will allow for the transfer of Irish prisoners, political and others, from the UK to Ireland and I have no doubt this will assist in lessening tension here and in the UK.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion to ratify the convention.  I compliment all who have been involved in passing the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Bill so quickly after the formation of this Government.  The Minister was very helpful and understanding with amendments to the Bill.  The Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas campaigned on this issue for a long time.  A number of people here and abroad have devoted many years to try to get the transfer of sentenced prisoners legislation on the agenda and enacted.  When we spoke about the transfer of prisoners to Northern Ireland questions were raised about the lack of legislation for the transfer of <Col N="1802" /> prisoners to the South.  Thankfully that will be a possibility when the legislation comes into effect from 1 November.</P>
      <P>Approximately 50 per cent of the Irish prisoners serving in English jails &mdash; approximately 33 republican prisoners and four loyalist prisoners &mdash; would be eligible under the legislation to apply for transfers.  Quite a number of the prisoners applied for transfer to Northern Ireland but were refused.  The six prisoners we met in Full Sutton Prison had applied for transfer to the North but were refused, and they have now applied to the Home Office and the Minister for Justice for transfer to the South under this legislation.  We hope their applications will be received sympathetically.</P>
      <P>In addition to the political prisoners, this legislation applies to about 600 other prisoners who would be eligible to apply for transfer to this country.  There are about 180 prisoners in this country who are non-nationals and would be eligible to apply for transfer out of the country.</P>
      <P>The treatment and conditions of prisoners held in British prisons is an issue of concern at present.  Four Members of the Labour Party &mdash; Deputy Bree, Deputy Broughan, Senator Maloney and I &mdash; visited three prisons over the past few days and we were concerned about the descriptions given to us by the prisoners we met.  Deputy Bree has outlined in graphic detail the conditions in which the two prisoners who came off the dirty protest were detained.</P>
      <P>The prisoners were kept in 24 hour solitary confinement.  The food was cold, meat was provided with every dish for one prisoner who was a long standing vegetarian and no cutlery was provided to eat the food.  Letters and other forms of communication were not available to them.  Doors were banged and lights were left on day and night.  The prisoners' light was artificial and the lights would be flickered from time to time to ensure the prisoners got no opportunity to sleep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were given this appalling list of <Col N="1803" /> conditions of detention by the two prisoners who came off the dirty protest to speak to us.  The Home Secretary has agreed to examine those conditions but what is really needed is a solution to the problem.  There is no reason the prisoners could not be transferred to Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The prisoners transferred to Northern Ireland would remain in the jurisdiction of the British Government and those transferred here would come under the terms of the legislation recently passed.</P>
    <P>We must expedite this matter in the interests of the peace process.  We cannot view these conditions of detention simply in terms of British prison policy; rather they must be seen in the broader context of their policy in relation to the peace process and the future of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like the Minister to look at one issue.  In Ireland we have a one quarter remission of sentence whereas in Britain it is a one-third remission.  Considering that a one-third remission is pretty much the norm both in Britain and other European countries, this would be the appropriate time to synchronise and standardise the period so that remission for the ordinary prisoner being transferred here would be increased from one quarter to one third.  In relation to Northern Ireland, the 50 per cent remission which was the norm up to 1989 should be restored.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the support which Members on all sides of the House have extended to this motion and I thank the Opposition for their co-operation in allowing it to be taken in this session. The Government made clear in its programme on taking office the importance it attached to proceeding to ratification of the European Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.  With the adoption of this motion by the House, following the signing into law by the President on 17 July of the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act. 1995, the way is <Col N="1804" /> now clear for this country to become a party to the convention.</P>
      <P>The Government intends that the convention will be ratified without delay and, as provided in the convention, it will come into effect three months after the date of ratification.  As was made clear in the debate on the transfer Bill, the Government intends to ensure that preparatory work to facilitate the operation of the convention is put in hand straightaway without waiting for the convention formally to come into effect. This reflects the Government's determination to ensure that there are no unnecessary delays once the terms of the convention become fully operable.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice has provided a detailed account of the provisions of the convention.  Its intent is to ensure, subject to the agreement of the two Governments concerned and of the individual prisoner, that prisoners can serve their sentences close to their family and local communities.  This reflects the conviction that the punishment imposed by custodial sentence should not be compounded by additional hardship on the families and relatives of those in custody.</P>
      <P>I was struck, as were others, by the excellent and well informed debate which preceded the adoption of the transfer legislation.  The Government was pleased to be able to accept a number of amendments to the Bill, many of them put forward with the support of the excellent voluntary organisations active in the field of prison welfare and I believe the Act is significantly better as a result.  This illustrates the progress which can be made when the temptation for political point-scoring is resisted and all sides of the House work together in the common interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ratification of the convention is, of course, a significant element in the Government's response to the peace process.  We have stressed from the outset the importance of dealing with prisons issues in a positive and forward-looking manner, the ending of the paramilitary campaigns has created an entirely new context, most particularly <Col N="1805" /> because, self-evidently, the level of threat to the community has been significantly reduced.</P>
    <P>It is against that background that the Government agreed to the early release of 20 prisoners in this jurisdiction.  This was in keeping with the Government's view of the contribution which a visible response to the new situation could make to the strengthening of community confidence and to the consolidation of the peace process itself.</P>
    <P>It is precisely because of the very real and immediate impact on local communities, on both sides of the divide, that the Government has paid particular attention to developments in the prisons in their continuing dialogue with the British Government.</P>
    <P>We have followed closely the situation in prisons in England.  I know that Members of this House on all sides &mdash; including the members of the Labour Party parliamentary party who have just returned from a visit to the prisons, Deputies Costello, Broughan, Bree and Senator Maloney, as well as Deputy Ó Cuív who has also taken a close interest in prisons issues &mdash; have also been monitoring the situation carefully.</P>
    <P>Their contributions to this afternoon's debate have been particularly valuable, based as they are on direct experience of the situation at first hand.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that I have given particular priority to prisons' issues in all my contacts with the British Government, including at recent meetings of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and at my meeting with the Secretary of State, Sir Patrick Mayhew, which took place on Monday of this week.</P>
    <P>As Deputies have indicated, it is clear that in some respects the situation for a number of prisoners in Britain has worsened in recent weeks.  This is a regrettable development, and one which cannot be helpful in terms of the strengthening of the peace process.  The prisoners played a key role in the ceasefires and they continue to do so.  It is essential that the issues which have <Col N="1806" /> arisen be speedily addressed and resolved.</P>
    <P>The Government's views on this and on the other issues have been conveyed clearly and comprehensively to the British authorities in recent days.  We expect that steps will be taken to resolve the situation which has arisen at Whitemoor Prison.  Because of the importance we attach to ensuring appropriate arrangements for visits by family and others we will continue to press for a flexible approach which will permit proper visiting arrangements to be resumed for all the prisoners as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Officials of the London Embassy have closely monitored developments in the prisons and have carried out a comprehensive programme of visits to the prisoners concerned over recent months.  I am pleased that difficulties which arose over arrangements for visits by the embassy to protesting prisoners at Belmarsh and Whitemoor have now been overcome.  Officials of the embassy had open visits with prisoners in both locations within the past 48 hours. These meetings facilitated extensive and detailed discussions with all the prisoners about whom concern has been expressed.</P>
    <P>On foot of these meetings and the close contacts which the Department and the embassy maintain with the families of the prisoners and their legal representatives, we will be continuing to explore actively with the British authorities how the situation can most effectively and speedily be defused.  In that context we will be addressing, as we have consistently done in our contacts with the British authorities in this area, the range of issues to which Deputies have drawn attention, including visiting arrangements, conditions in the cells, access to exercise, medical provision and, of course, the issue of transfers.</P>
    <P>As regards transfers, some of those who have been involved in the protests at Whitemoor were told in April that their transfers had been approved.  I think it is important to say that what is at issue is not a change of rules, rather an implementation of the policy on <Col N="1807" /> transfers which began last year.  If this is done in a manner which reflects the urgency of the situation as far as the prisoners and their families are concerned, there is no reason to expect anything other than the full co-operation of the prisoners themselves.  We have strongly urged this course of action on the British authorities and will continue to do so.  I am certain that sensitive handling of the situation in the prisons concerned will have positive results.  We would like to see in addition every effort made to avoid anything in the nature of harsher treatment of prisoners who are already held in highly secure conditions.</P>
    <P>The other delay about which concern has been expressed at this time is that of the referral of five cases to the Parole Board.  I understand the High Court in London recently gave permission for court action in this matter.  I hope, therefore, that these cases, involving prisoners who have been in jail for over 20 years, will be taken up as a matter of urgency and an early date set for their release as the Lord Chief Justice recommended last February.</P>
    <P>There has been some comment with regard to the recent reported remarks of the British Home Secretary.  I would simply make the point that the issue of prisoners figured prominently in discussions which we have had with the British Government at all levels, including those involving the Taoiseach and myself as Joint Chairman of the Anglo-Irish Conference.  Referring to the prison regime in Britain, he indicated that it was not proposed to change the rules regarding transfers.  Our concern, which we have made clear to the British Government, is that the existing rules should be applied in a flexible and forward-looking manner.</P>
    <P>It was also indicated that the existing parole system for prisoners in England and Wales, for which the Home Secretary is responsible, would be maintained. Here again our concern is to ensure flexibility in operation.  We have, of course, as the House is aware, made <Col N="1808" /> clear our view that the remission regime in Northern Ireland, which is quite distinct from the parole system in Britain and for which the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is responsible, should be revised to restore 50 per cent remission.  We will continue to press strongly for change in this area.</P>
    <P>It is recognised on all sides that the situation with regard to prisons in Northern Ireland is a central element in the peace process.  The attitude of both republican and loyalist prisoners in the run-up to the ceasefires was of considerable importance and the view is strongly held in both communities that there should be movement on prisoner releases.  For our part, we have kept this issue firmly and centrally on the agenda of our meetings with the British Government at every level.</P>
    <P>I have argued in detail for a more flexible use of life sentence review mechanisms for paramilitary prisoners, the kind of flexibility that was used in the case of Private Clegg.  It is crucial that all cases should be dealt with equally under the law.  Special treatment for any one individual, particularly in isolation from the broader question of paramilitary prisoners, is undesirable and unhelpful.</P>
    <P>Similarly, an increase of remission for long term determinate sentence prisoners would generate goodwill and would be no more than a reversion to the situation that existed from 1976 to 1989.  We will continue to press the case for movement in these areas.</P>
    <P>The day to day regime of prisoners in Northern Ireland has also been an issue which I have kept under close and continuing review.  I am glad that the Secretary of State relaxed the rules governing compassionate parole.  This is a modest step, but it is in the right direction.</P>
    <P>We have consistently and vigorously used the mechanisms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement to discuss with the British Government the importance of sustained, visible and rapid de-escalation of the posture and level of the security <Col N="1809" /> forces in response to the ceasefire.  The House will be aware that for some months now the British Army no longer routinely operates on the streets in much of Northern Ireland.  There have been limited troop withdrawals.  Cross-Border roads are being brought back to full standard following the decision last year by the British Government to reopen them.  Problems of harassment by the security force have already diminished.</P>
    <P>In sum, therefore, a number of adjustments have been made to the security presence since the ceasefire, the progressive withdrawal of troops from the streets, the removal of some of the infrastructure of the conflict and the withdrawal of some units from Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We wish to see further speedy progress in each of these areas.  The progress of de-escalation by the security forces is an essential element in the continuing response to the new realities brought about by the ceasefire.  The key point for the Government is that the primary benefits of peace should be seen by people going about their daily business and it is my wish to see that all people and areas in Northern Ireland have equal access to the benefits of peace.</P>
    <P>I have spoken at some length on prisons and related matters and of the efforts being made by the Government to move ahead on a number of difficult but vital issues.  The Government's commitment to progress in these areas and its determination to act with direction and vigour fully reflects its approach to the peace process as a whole.</P>
    <P>There is now a unique opportunity to build a secure future for all the people of this island, North and South.  The Government is determined to ensure that this opportunity is fully exploited. It will continue to accord the advancement of the peace process the highest priority and to work unflinchingly for the lasting agreement on which a true peace will be built.</P>
    <P>The guns have been silent for almost 11 months.  The challenge now facing all <Col N="1810" /> of us is to translate the absence of violence into a lasting and just peace.  The Government believes this can best be achieved by early movement to inclusive political dialogue.  Such a dialogue threatens no legitimate interests.  On the contrary, it offers the prospect, one might say the only prospect, of real stability and security for all the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I had an opportunity to review progress in this area at my meeting last Monday with Sir Patrick Mayhew.  We considered in some detail how comprehensive discussions involving all the relevant parties, including Sinn Féin, might be initiated.  I emphasised the primary importance which the Government attaches to getting such discussions under way at the earliest opportunity.  I believe our discussions were helpful in expediting progress in this regard and we agreed that the two sides should remain in close touch in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>The meeting also provided an opportunity to consider how certain difficulties which have arisen might be overcome. The House will hardly need to be reminded that the peace process has confronted many difficulties in the past. Those difficulties have been faced and have been overcome.  This is due in no small measure to the absolute determination of people of all traditions in Northern Ireland to ensure the success of the peace process.  By proceeding in this spirit, current difficulties, including those in relation to decommissioning, can be overcome.</P>
    <P>It is self-evident that dealing with the paramilitary arsenals is an essential element in the peace process and crucial to the achievement of a lasting peace. We can draw encouragement, therefore, from the fact that there is agreement on all sides that this is one of the issues which must be addressed in the search for an overall agreement.  As I have said previously, we must avoid becoming entangled in a circular argument as to which comes first, political progress or decommissioning.  Neither can be solved <Col N="1811" /> in isolation; progress on one is more likely in tandem with the other.</P>
    <P>We have indicated that serious discussions on all these issues should get under way as quickly as possible.  We have also made clear our readiness to consider a range of options which may facilitate progress in particular areas. Precisely because it is important in these matters to proceed on the basis of the widest possible agreement, we have not come to firm conclusions in respect of any single line of approach.  We will continue, as we urge others, to maintain maximum flexibility.  The Government's objective has been to find solutions, bridge gaps and facilitate movement and we will continue to pursue this approach in a proactive fashion.</P>
    <P>There is now an unrivalled opportunity to build a lasting settlement.  Such a settlement will only be reached through open, inclusive negotiations in which each party puts forward its case with conviction but reaches out to others in a spirit of compromise.  The Government is determined to leave no stone unturned to advance that process. Our door remains open to all who wish to explore, without precondition, how best to move forward.  We hope that those, particularly in the Unionist community, who have found it difficult to join us in dialogue in the past, will reflect further on the opportunity which now beckons.  They have nothing to lose.  All of us on this island have a great deal to gain.  For our part the Government will do all in its power to ensure that the prize of a lasting peace does not go unclaimed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take the opportunity today to address the House on the issue of drug trafficking and the need to enforce our laws in this area in the most rigorous <Col N="1812" /> manner possible.  As Deputies on all sides are aware, I have made the issue of drugs a matter of the highest priority and devoted a great deal of my time and energy since becoming Minister to tackling this most pressing problem.</P>
      <P>The reasons the drugs problem must be at the top of the national agenda are obvious.  Drug traffickers are waging war on society and the casualties are there to be seen.  In recent weeks, a number of young lives have been cruelly extinguished by drug abuse.  Such deaths, however, mean nothing to the evil people who control and organise this despicable trade.  For them, the only thing that matters is how much they can make from such suffering.  Their only interest is in money and it is matter of indifference to them how they obtain it.</P>
      <P>Because such vast profits can be made from drug trafficking, the groups who seek to control this evil trade are quick to use whatever means are at their disposal to defend and safeguard their lucrative earnings.  In this regard, such groups represent &mdash; let us be clear about it &mdash; a real, serious and organised threat to the well being of our citizens.  They have caused nothing but misery in the furtherance of their criminal aims.  They respect no values, no moral code and treat human life with contempt.</P>
      <P>In dealing with these people, we must be determined to enforce the law in a strict and sustained manner, see to it that those we entrust with that job, the Garda, Customs and the Defence Forces, have the required resources and the necessary powers.  There cannot be any halfway house when it comes to these drugs terrorists.  Either we as a society are serious about dealing with them or we are not.  To put it simply, these people must be confronted and put out of business, for all our sakes and especially that of our children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scale of the problem can best be judged by the record amounts of drugs seized by the law enforcement agencies. For instance, as regards the drug commonly referred to as ecstasy, 2,000 tablets were seized in 1993 and 12,000 tablets were seized in 1994.  However, so <Col N="1813" /> far this year, 160,000 tablets have been seized, and the figure continues to rise. This puts the problem in stark perspective. As regards heroin, 1,284 kilogrammes were seized in 1993, by the following year, this had jumped to 3,368 kilogrammes and so far this year, nearly 1,500 kilogrammes have been seized.  I should point out that the last figure takes into account only the amount which has been analysed in the Forensic Science Laboratory to date.  When all the seizures have been analysed, this figure will undoubtedly be greater.</P>
    <P>In the first six months of this year, the Garda made 2,835 drug seizures, which is a 9 per cent increase over the same period last year.  This is in line with the upward trend in drug seizures witnessed in recent years.  In 1992, the number of seizures increased by 20 per cent.  In 1993, the number increased by 15 per cent and last year, the number increased by 9.5 per cent and the number of seizures has increased by 9 per cent this year.  These are damning statistics which call for action and that is precisely what I am doing.</P>
    <P>Last Wednesday, I received the approval of the Government for a series of legislative, financial, opperational and organisational measures designed to reduce the supply of drugs into the country.  Measures to tackle the demand for drugs are also included in the package.</P>
    <P>The measures represent the most radical, far-reaching and significant steps ever taken in the history of the State to deal with the drugs problem.  In this regard, it would be useful if I were to set out, in detail, the background to these measures.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that these measures are not a knee-jerk response to the drugs problem, on the contray they are the result of a painstaking and detailed analysis.  What I announced last week, was a serious response to a serious problem.</P>
    <P>As many Members will, no doubt, recall, there were a number of large seizures of illegal drugs at various locations on the south west coast during <Col N="1814" /> the summer of 1993.  Certain incidents associated with some of the seizures suggested that a lack of co-operation existed between the Garda Síochána and the customs service, which could work against the success of operations aimed at countering drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the then Minister for Justice was asked by the then Taoiseach to carry out a general study of the problem. The study was directed mainly at the issue of optimum co-operation between the two law enforcement agencies involved.  However, as work commenced on the study, it became apparent that a wider focus was needed, in view of the spread of responsibilities among a wider range of Departments and agencies for policies that have a significant impact on law enforcement in this area.</P>
    <P>Also, current international experience indicates that the drugs problem cannot be solved through law enforcement measures alone and increasingly stresses the importance of tackling the problem from the educational and health perspectives, that is through demand reduction policies.</P>
    <P>The report concluded that, while Ireland has a serious drugs problem, it is not yet on the scale experienced in other urban areas in mainland Europe. In effect, this gives us a window of opportunity to take effective steps to counter and limit the effect of the drugs problem here.  In this regard, time is of the essence.</P>
    <P>The study also concludes that there is a need for a new approach to tackle the drugs problem on a multi-agency basis, With all Departments and agencies playing a full part in seeking solutions through close co-operation and co-ordination of policies and strategies.  The need for multi-agency co-operation also exists at local level in the larger urban areas where the drugs problem is most acute.  The need to reorient overall strategy in this way reflects the broad acceptance that the drugs problem cannot be solved through law enforcement measures alone.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1815" /> I would now like to deal with the various measures agreed by the Government. The first set of measures concern the issue of inter-agency co-operation,. The measures seek to put the interaction and relationship of the law enforcement agencies concerned into a formal structure in order to ensure a cohesive and co-ordinated fight against drugs trafficking.  This will be done by the introduction of general guidelines to distinguish the functions of gardaí and Customs and Excise officers in relation to drug law enforcement and the introduction of a memorandum of understanding on relations between the Garda Síochána and the Customs and Excise service.  This will ensure that each agency will know precisely what its role is in the fight against drugs and how that role fits in with the role of the other agency.</P>
    <P>There will be closer working arrangements between Customs, gardaí and the Naval Service, including the introduction of a joint task force to combat drugs smuggling and importation; the exchange of liaison officers at national level; joint training courses and improved liaison arrangements at local level.  This will ensure optimum cohesion and co-ordination in the fight against drugs.  In particular, the joint task force will provide for a formal structure bringing the gardaí, the Customs and the Naval Service together.</P>
    <P>A review will be carried out by the Departments of Foreign Affairs and the Marine and the Revenue Commissioners of certain legal provisions to assist in combating drug trafficking and taking successful action against drug traffickers at sea.  This provides for a review by the Department of Foreign Affairs of certain legal provisions to assist in taking successful action against drug traffickers at sea &mdash; by streamlining the prosecution procedures of foreign nationals arrested at sea &mdash; and a review by the Department of the Marine of certain measures to assist in combating drug trafficking, for example, improved information in respect of <Col N="1816" /> pleasure craft operating within our territorial waters.</P>
    <P>In addition, a joint review will be carried out by the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda authorities of certain recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission as regards co-operation between the two agencies. The report of the review is to be submitted within four months and the recommendations of the report, where relevant, will be incorporated in the 1996 Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The report on which my proposals are based also identified certain deficiencies in the law as regards the powers of the law enforcement agencies to take effective action against drug traffickers.  To overcome these deficiencies, a number of measures have been agreed.  There will be certain increases in the powers of detention of gardaí and the courts in relation to persons suspected of drug trafficking offences and, as there has been a great deal of comment about these powers, I will spell out what is involved.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1984, will be amended to allow the gardaí, on the certification of a Chief Superintendent, to detain a person suspected of drug trafficking for a period of 24 hours initially and, if necessary, for a further period of 24 hours.  On request, a judge may permit the extension of the detention period up to a maximum of 72 hours if satisfied that this is necessary and, upon further request may permit a final extension of the detention period for up to a maximum of a further 48 hours, if satisfied that this is necessary. Furthermore, the legislation introducing these measures will be reviewed after 12 months in operation and the detention provisions will lapse after 12 months unless renewed by motion in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I strongly believe that these new powers, together with the safeguards which I have set out above, represent a balanced and proportionate response to the drug trafficking problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1817" /> These powers of detention are especially required to deal with socalled `stuffers and swallowers' who may be able to retain drugs within their bodies for at least a week.  In addition, the report found that the present periods of detention permitted by law are inadequate in certain other cases.  For instance, due to the international dimension which often exists in such cases, it may be necessary for the gardaí to make extensive inquiries in other countries when a person has been detained in connection with a suspected offence of illegal importation of drugs. Without additional powers, it is feared that many persons who will be detained in connection with serious offences may have to be released before investigations are sufficiently advanced.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the issue of search warrants in drugs-related cases will be extended to a garda, not below the rank of superintendent and I will set out the reasons for seeking such a change.  I am sure all Members will agree that it is vital that the gardaí are in a position to intervene as quickly as possible in situations where they suspect that drug dealing is going on.  The extension of responsibility for the issue of search warrants in drugs-related cases to a garda, not below the rank of superintendent, will allow the gardaí to speedily intervene in such situations.</P>
    <P>There will be an increase in the powers of Customs officers in relation to the questioning of persons detained on suspicion of importing illegal drugs. This will allow Customs officers to participate, to the extent of their legitimate concerns, in the questioning of suspects who are detained or arrested by them in connection with suspected drugs offences and subsequently transferred into Garda custody.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to designate naval officers as enforcement officers for the purpose of Part V of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 in connection with drug trafficking offences at sea.  The present legal situation whereby Naval Service personnel do not have powers of arrest <Col N="1818" /> is a serious defect and must be remedied. As enforcement officers, the Naval Service personnel &mdash; petty officers and above &mdash; will have a power to stop, board and search a ship and anyone on it; to arrest without warrant anyone suspected of a drug trafficking offence and to seize and detain anything found on a ship which appears to be evidence of such an offence.</P>
    <P>The measures agreed by Government also put in place new structures to fight the drugs problem.  This is a recognition of the changing nature of the problem and the need for a dynamic ongoing response on the part of the State agencies which have responsibility for dealing with drug abuse.  Maximum co-ordination is required between all of the agencies that are involved in the fight against drugs.</P>
    <P>The measures agreed include the creation of a Garda national drugs unit under the operational control of a Deputy Commissioner, with overall responsibility for drugs law enforcement in the Garda Síochána.  This new unit will subsume the existing Garda National Drugs Administration Office.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are of the view that changes should be made in the organisational structure for drugs law enforcement to gear the force to the changing pattern and scale of the problem. In this regard, they agree with the report's recommendation that a national drugs unit, having an overall national remit, and responsible for all Garda operational matters in the fight against drugs, should be established. Furthermore, in view of the importance of the issue, the unit will come under the operational control of a Deputy Commissioner.</P>
    <P>The measures will also include the reconstitution of the national co-ordinating committee under the chairmanship of a Minister of State and the establishment of two new sub-committees to look at the demand and supply sides of the problem with appropriate liaison between them and overlapping membership on both.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1819" /> There are two sides to the drugs problem and they must be tackled together. In reducing the supply of drugs into the country we must also reduce the demand for drugs.  This can only be done by a co-ordinated and integrated approach which harnesses all these State agencies with a role to play.  The reconstitution of the national co-ordinating committee and the establishment of two new sub-committees to look at the demand and supply sides of the problem will achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>The measures will further include the introduction of drugs strategy teams in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford comprising representatives of the Garda, the probation and welfare service, the prison service, the health boards, the Department of Education, the local authorities and the local community. These teams will assess the drugs problem in these urban areas and draw up action plans to deal with it having regard to local circumstances.  There is a recognition that the drugs problem can differ from area to area as experience has shown.  The drugs strategy teams will ensure that effective local arrangements are put in place to develop and co-ordinate action against drugs in those areas.  A critical aim in establishing these teams will be to ensure not only that the relevant agencies come together, but that local community representatives also have a say.</P>
    <P>I am taking a number of other measures.  I will review the law in relation to the renewal of licences on premises, be they dance halls or public houses, where the sale or misuse of drugs is suspected and submit a report to the Government in the matter.  My review will extend to an examination of systems of control for unlicensed premises where the sale or misuse of drugs is suspected.</P>
    <P>I will also review the issue of drugs in prisons, to include the question of methadone treatment, and prepare a report on the problem for submission to the Government within three months. Since taking office a number of changes <Col N="1820" /> have been made in our prisons, particularly Mountjoy.  I have further proposals which I will submit to the Government in three months on which action will have been taken or will be taken in the near future.</P>
    <P>There are two sides to the drugs problem, supply and demand.  The measures agreed by the Government fully recognise this.  Measures have also been agreed to specifically deal with the health and education aspects of the problem.  In this regard the Government has agreed to the introduction of a substance abuse programme at primary school level at an estimated cost of £450,000 over three years.  The Government has also agreed that the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, should, in consultation with the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, and other appropriate Ministers, submit separate proposals to it by the end of the year in relation to demand reduction policies and that in the meantime drug treatment facilities should be expanded.</P>
    <P>I have set out in detail the measures agreed by the Government to deal with the drugs problem &mdash; measures which show that we are serious about tackling the problem.  I ask the House for its full support in implementing these measures.  I pay tribute to those who have supported these proposals publicly on the airwaves and see the need for such measures, including Deputy O'Donoghue, Deputy Gregory and the former Minister for Justice who commenced work on the report in the Department.</P>
    <P>This is one of the most serious problems facing us and we must build a consensus throughout the country on how to fight it.  The measures announced last week provide a basis on which that consensus can be built.  I do not under-estimate the problem facing us.  I can, however, give the House this guarantee: the drugs problem is the number one priority for me and my Department and will remain so.</P>

      <P>A short number of years ago the idea that a Minister for Justice would have to introduce a package of measures in this House to combat drug importation, consumption and addiction would have been unthinkable. The problems we now face have developed during the past 25 years and have grown from being virtually nonexistent to represent the primary threat to our future well being.  Drugs represent a greater threat to the social fabric of society than unemployment; they result in more deaths and serious injuries than terrorism ever did.  They are no longer a minority problem or an inner city problem only, they represent a threat to every village, town and city.</P>
      <P>The insatiable desire for drugs has driven addicts to commit crimes of inexplicable cruelty, often for relatively modest sums of money.  Last year there were over 3,800 detected drug offences, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. The statistics do not show what percentage of the £46 million stolen last year is accounted for by drug related crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Addicts need money which they obtain by larceny, burglary and robbery. An addict with a modest drug habit will need between £50 and £100 per day to fund his addiction.  Many will consume up to £200 worth of heroin per day. Invariably, this money is acquired by crime.  An addict stealing cash by robberies and muggings will need to steal between £18,000 and £40,000 each year just to feed his habit.  In many instances the amount required will be greater, in some cases as much as £75,000.  If an addict tries to fund his drug habit through the theft of goods from houses or shops the value of the goods which it is necessary for him to steal will increase dramatically.  Stolen goods are frequently sold at a small fraction of their true value.  An addict who wants to obtain £20 in cash has to steal goods <Col N="1822" /> worth £100 or more.  The harsh reality is that each serious drug addict is a one man crime wave.</P>
    <P>Drug addiction is an illness and drug addicts, although entitled to our sympathy and assistance, are not entitled to an ongoing licence to plunder and terrorise.  If, through addiction, addicts cannot remain on our streets without constant recourse to theft and robbery they must be removed.  It is necessary to use every weapon legitimately available in a constitutional democracy to combat the evil of drugs.</P>
    <P>The package introduced by the Minister represents a step in the right direction. I welcome it for that reason.  I welcome the fact that it will pose a difficulty for drug traffickers as well as the additional powers of search, arrest and detention which will assist in the battle against drug importation.  I also welcome the establishment of a task force which will combine and focus the efforts of the various State agencies against known drug dealers.  These measures represent a step in the right direction.  I congratulate the Minister on their introduction.</P>
    <P>I also congratulate the Minister on her spectacular victory in the latest bout of Cabinet guerrilla warfare.  The relentless pressure from Fianna Fáil on this issue spurred the Minister into action but that does not mean I should not congratulate her.  Our immediate support for the leaked proposals melted the cold fury of the Labour Party and dispelled the renowned reservations of Democratic Left.  We ensured, and were pleased to do so, that the Minister's old adversary, the Tánaiste, was comprehensively outmanoeuvred and shown to have the political agility of an elephant in traction.</P>
    <P>It is, however, regrettable that the area of criminal justice policy has now become a Cabinet battlefield.  Leaks, ambush and attempted political assassination have become the currency of policy advancement.  The days of discussion and debate appear to be over. The Minister brought her fight with the <Col N="1823" /> Tánaiste to the front pages of the newspapers and together we taught the Cabinet bully a lesson he is unlikely to forget.</P>
    <P>I hope the policy on drug traffickers today will not be rendered impotent by being starved of resources by another of the Minister's old adversaries, the Minister for Finance.  The abandonment of the prisons projects at Castlerea and Mountjoy shows that the Minister for Finance has little or no understanding of the requirements of a proper criminal justice policy.  These measures will fail unless they are properly funded.  The responsibility for securing that funding rests with the Minister for Justice.  She can be guaranteed that retaliation is being planned by at least one of her Government partners.  The Minister for Finance has wielded the political slashhook on the proposals of the Minister for Justice before and he will not be slow to do so again.</P>
    <P>Welcome though these measures are it would be a mistake to think that no other measures are necessary.  Radical action is needed as many of the steps taken to date have proved well intentioned but, essentially, ineffective.</P>
    <P>The history of prohibition and attempts to control the use of drugs dates back to the middle of the last century when the sale of opium and morphine was confined to pharmacists. Since then increasingly severe laws have been enacted throughout the world and 13 Third World countries impose the death penalty for trafficking offences. Others, including Ireland, impose maximum sentences of life imprisonment for the same offences although an examination of sentences imposed by our courts reveals that it is never imposed, those imposed are frequently in the three to six year bracket.  There is an argument against mandatory sentencing and minimum sentences, but is it right that our courts frequently sentence those offenders to three to six years imprisonment?  The Government will have to consider minimum sentencing for individuals convicted of that gross <Col N="1824" /> offence.  A study needs to be undertaken to ascertain the true level of the sentences being imposed by our courts for drug trafficking offences.  The Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977 and 1984, are aimed at preventing the possession and distribution of controlled drugs, but they have not succeeded in that regard and need to be radically reappraised.</P>
    <P>Existing law loses interest in the addict the moment he or she consumes a controlled drug and yet that is the precise moment the potential for crime is highest.  That needs to be rectified. Recent developments in the distribution of drugs gives the Minister an opportunity to develop new prevention measures.  Traditionally, drug consumption was carried out in private but the proliferation of the drug ecstasy publicly consumed in clubs, discos and pubs needs to be curbed.  What type of morality is displayed by managers and owners of pubs, clubs and discos who sell bottled water to young people who consume drugs?  That represents the morals of an alley cat and must be dealt with by the Government.  I assure the Minister that, irrespective of whatever tough measures are required to deal with those people, Fianna Fáil will support her as we strongly supported the leaked proposals to ensure that Labour and Democratic Left did not again get their way.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister to introduce legislation which would result in the mandatory closure for a specified period of any club, pub or disco in which controlled drugs are permitted to be sold. A simple amendment of section 19 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts could achieve that end and send a clear message to those who promote and profit from what I can only describe as the ecstasy culture.</P>
    <P>It would be a mistake to consider that those measures can succeed in isolation. They need to be part of a wider approach.  If drug traffickers must be released on bail as soon as they are charged, giving the Garda increased powers of detention is next to useless. It would be ironic if a greater power of <Col N="1825" /> detention existed before rather than after the charging of an alleged drugs offender.  Irrespective of whatever Labour or Democratic Left say about bail, action is needed in that regard now as is the case regarding the proposed Castlerea prison and the women's prison in Mountjoy.  Events in Mountjoy Prison during the week proved, if proof were needed, that the system there is on the verge of breakdown and that something must be done about it.</P>
    <P>The actions of the Minister for Finance in cancelling the proposed prisons at Castlerea and Mountjoy were little short of disgraceful.  Public expenditure must be contained, but it is the Government's responsibility to prioritise public spending and it cannot be denied that the Government and the Minister for Finance have their priorities wrong.  I urge the Minister to bring the same spirit of determination to bear on the bail issue as she brought to bear on her drugs package. If she cannot win the war at Cabinet in the course of the Cabinet guerilla warfare, I encourage her to bring it into this House and to the people.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will guarantee its support for any effective measure which will hinder and harass those who participate in crime.  It is time for Members, particularly those in the rainbow coalition Government, to make a clear statement as to where they stand on crime.  The time for handwringing and whimpering about the civil liberties of a minority of wrongdoers is long past.  The civil liberty in which Fianna Fáil and I are interested is the right to live in safety without being a prisoner in one's home.  The pendulum has swung too far.  The flourishing body of jurisprudence on the rights of suspects now eclipses the rights of victims.  The scales of justice need to be balanced so that they serve the needs of ordinary people.  Bail, court procedures and delays need to be examined and reforms introduced.  The criminal justice system does not serve us well and must be reformed.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a start in the battle against drugs but if her proposals <Col N="1826" /> are to have any success, they need to be properly funded and augmented with tough legislation which will take pushers and addicts off the streets.  Irrespective of the reservations of certain members of Democratic Left and the Labour Party, I strongly urge the Minister to take the necessary action in the interests of the people.  In that regard she will have the support of Fianna Fáil as is the case in regard to this important measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this package and I believe it will have the support of the House.  We must hit the drug dealers hard and I welcome that the Minister is setting about that task now. We, on this side of the House, have called for it for some time, I made numerous statements calling for urgent action earlier this year.  We welcome the recognition of drug dealers as subversives. Drug dealing, which undermines our youth, is the most subversive activity in which one can be involved.  I welcome the Government's action, even at this late stage.</P>
      <P>This issue is above party politics and one on which all sides of the House must give immediate support to the Minister.  The proposed new powers require legislation and the Minister clearly spelled out the legislation required.  We would welcome the introduction of additional legislation covering search and arrest powers for the Garda, Customs officers and other legislative measures.  However, it will not be possible to introduce it until Christmas, although it is needed now.  Perhaps some powers can be extended under existing legislation.  As we will resume on 11 October, we do not want the introduction of legislation postponed until Christmas.  This issue deserves emergency action and I advise the Minister not to delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need a much wider package to cover treatment, rehabilitation, education, additional prison spaces, Garda resources and the deployment of gardaí where they are needed.  We need to deal with the issue of assets and other <Col N="1827" /> matters.  The Minister has dealt with some of those today but what is needed immediately is a total, comprehensive combative package.</P>
    <P>Last Christmas the overall issue of ecstasy exploded here and has continued since, its price having reached rock bottom, in the meantime, thus ensuring it would become an even greater problem.  There is need to have implemented immediately a major information/education programme on the harmful effects of this drug.  While the Garda are endeavouring to engage in such exercise by way of community relations, a massive programme is now required to tackle the problem.  This must be done by the Minister in conjunction with her Cabinet colleagues. Young people must have fun, must be able to attend dances and enjoy music but they must be made aware of the very harmful effects of ecstasy, of what is happening behind the scenes occasioned by its price having been lowered enormously and by its being mixed with heroin.</P>
    <P>We cannot allow families and communities to be destroyed.  I welcome the crackdown on pubs, clubs and discos where illegal drugs are sold and/or their abuse allowed.  That is a timely move in which the Minister will have our full support.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the establishment of new units within the Garda Síochána to tackle the drugs problem, but did not refer to the question of the allocation of resources to such units. Special Garda surveillance units &mdash; comprised of members of the force with the requisite experience &mdash; will obtain results but we must provide them with adequate resources.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have the support of all Members in her proposals to tackle this enormous problem on which immediate action is needed if it is not to be allowed worsen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>A very serious drugs problem now obtains within this State. It is not a cliché to say it threatens the <Col N="1828" /> very fabric of our society, involving every city, town and village.</P>
      <P>Recently I attended a community meeting on drugs in Dublin's inner city which was attended also by Deputies O'Donoghue and Gregory and at which outrage and anger was expressed at the lack of action on the part of Government and authority generally in relation to drugs and their abuse.  Drugs-related crime is rampant nationwide.  There is now a groundswell of public opinion, particularly on the part of parents, in favour of tough, decisive, political action to counter this problem.  This new community-based, political awareness must be encouraged and supported.  It is a new phenomenon in Irish politics, in community politics, that parents now demand action and are prepared to back political action in tackling this huge problem.</P>
      <P>I suppose the first commandment in Irish politics today is: &ldquo;Thou shalt not cross Dick Spring&rdquo;.  The Minister for Justice crossed him, I congratulate her on having won and on introducing her drugs-countering package.</P>
      <P>The most controversial of her provisions were the seven days' detention of suspected drug pushers and increased Garda powers in relation to search warrants. I suggest that the civil liberties of drug pushers should not be the greatest priority.  Rather we should be concerned principally with the civil liberties of parents endeavouring to rear children, those of the victims of drug-related crimes and those of drug addicts. Although such safeguards are built into the Minister's proposals, she could do more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, the question of bail and the right to silence must be addressed, the Garda themselves having pointed to those two areas as being in need of greatest reform.  The matter of resources for the effective implementation of this package also warrants attention, particularly resources for the Garda and relevant health authorities.  I have no doubt the Minister will return with her proposals in that regard.  As Deputy O'Donoghue said, these are difficult <Col N="1829" /> times in the distribution of public finances.  I hope the Minister will fight her corner there also, ensuring that adequate resources are allocated to this drugs-countering package.</P>
    <P>The treatment of drug addicts warrants immediate attention, there being huge waiting lists for detoxification both in Dublin and throughout the country with a serious dearth of places on such programmes.  My party has put forward very radical proposals, on which Deputy O'Donoghue in particular is to be congratulated, compelling drug addicts to undergo treatment, a central strategy in ridding this country of drugs once and for all.</P>
    <P>The general public is very concerned about the availability of drugs in our prisons, particularly in Mountjoy Jail, many simply unable to comprehend why drugs are so widely available there.  We need to address immediately the treatment of drug addicts within our prisons in which respect I welcome the Minister's proposals and look forward to their yielding positive results.  I suggest that detoxification wings are a priority within our prisons if we are to tackle this problem effectively once and for all.</P>
    <P>The importance of education and information in this area has been mentioned by other Members.  This aspect is particularly important for children in our schools but also for parents, many of whom grew up without having had any exposure whatever to drugs or their attendant problems, and need to be fully informed of the issues involved and their inherent dangers.</P>
    <P>Other Members have mentioned places such as dance halls where suspected drug abuse takes place, recent events in that regard have shocked many.  I welcome the Minister's proposal that the licensing arrangements will be reviewed because what is alleged to have happened recently is a disgrace and must also be seriously addressed within the context of overall reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Members in congratulating the Minister on her political victory, one she deserved having <Col N="1830" /> shown such commitment to this issue since assuming office.  I agree with her that the drugs problem cannot be dealt with by way of law enforcement alone. It requires a much more comprehensive, multi-disciplinary approach.  Serious and all as the problem is and the threat it poses to the fabric of our society we must ensure we keep the problem in perspective.  In that respect I appeal to the media to be sensitive and practical in the manner in which they might seek to exploit and explore the problem within this city.  In particular they must be sensitive in regard to families, some of whose members may have been the victims of drug abuse or who have experienced tragedies as a result of the vicious drugs problem.  Such families often feel their privacy is invaded in a manner that is very unreasonable.  I caution this House, and the media in particular, to be careful, to ensure that we do not in any sense seek to sensationalise what is a very serious problem and threat to our society.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister's proposed package will be successful but I do have reservations in that respect.  However, I want to deal first with its positive elements.  It is indeed good that the Minister is addressing the matter in a more comprehensive way than any of her predecessors.  Although one commentator asked today why some such things had not already happened, we could all pose that question.  The fact is that many obvious deterrents have not been put in place, such as co-ordination between different State or statutory bodies, so obvious one cannot help but wonder why it has not already taken place.</P>
      <P>The Chairman's introduction to the report of the Lord Mayor's Commission, published in December 1994 contained the following observation: &ldquo;Despite an interdepartmental group into urban crime and disorder published in November 1992, we have continued to encounter a disturbing incidence of overlap, duplication and occasional downright clashes between agencies.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is very prevalent right across our <Col N="1831" /> society, particularly in matters to do with criminal justice.</P>
    <P>At the outset I said the drugs problem must not be dealt with in a purely criminal justice context &mdash; I feel very strongly about that &mdash; it has a very wide focus and dimension, one that must be targeted strenuously at the education of students, of young people and of parents. Indeed I have discovered that many of us, expected as we are to deal with this issue as policy makers, know or understand very little of the problem. Despite the fact that we live in a society in which there is a high level of drug dependency, whether on alcohol or other substances, there is a lack of knowledge and awareness of the harmful effects involved.  All of us in society charged with responsibility in this area owe it to ourselves and those for whom we legislate to be better informed. Obviously, there is involved in this issue, in addition to a medical and pharmaceutical dimension, a social, police and community dimension.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that there are between 5,000 and 6,000 drug addicts in this city yet only 400 of them are receiving any treatment.  That is a clear indication of where the problem lies.  Our focus heretofore seems to have been to identify and detain the addicts.  The recent report of the Lord Mayor's commission on crime referred to statistics that were drawn to our attention by Dr. Paul O'Mahony who examined the profile of prisoners in Mountjoy Jail.  It was chilling to read some of those statistics.  For example, prisoners in Mountjoy had received on average 10.4 separate sentences. The most common age for first imprisonment was 16; close to 10 per cent had received a first conviction before their twelfth birthday; 40 per cent had a first degree relative in prison; 32 per cent were on prescribed drugs; 41 per cent had experienced some form of psychiatric attention and 80 per cent were unemployed immediately prior to committal.</P>
    <P>If we are to deal with this problem honestly and radically, as the Minister <Col N="1832" /> suggested she would, we have to deal with its causes and symptoms in addition to the question of access to drugs.  If the criminal justice system is to be effective, it must concentrate almost exclusively on that small but vicious group of people known as the drug barons.  My colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, once referred to them in this House as the lowest form of life.  I share that view.  These people are vicious and dangerous.  Some of them are involved in organised armed gangs.  The criminal justice system must put all its weight behind finding out who these people are and, through good police work, ensuring that we effectively bring them to justice and put them behind bars.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question of extra powers for the Garda Síochána. As a liberal, I am committed to ensuring that every citizen has the basic liberty of being able to feel safe in their own house, walk safely in their own street or anywhere in their country.  Anyone who wants to protect civil liberties must be tough on crime.  I would support any measures, no matter how tough, if I believed they were necessary and could be effective.  In examining the question of extra powers of detention I ask the question: what is the purpose of detention? The purpose of detention is to charge people with a view to having them prosecuted.  I would like the Minister to tell us, if she has statistics at her disposal, the percentage of people detained, subsequently charged and prosecuted.  I wonder what is the success rate.  I would be interested in statistics relating to that matter.</P>
    <P>It is obviously assumed &mdash; the Garda Síochána would not have sought the power in the first place &mdash; that a longer detention period will lead to confessions. We in this jurisdiction must understand that miscarriages of justice have ocurred &mdash; thankfully not many &mdash; as a result of confessions obtained under duress.  The courts, given the supervisory powers they will have under these new measures, will ensure the new <Col N="1833" /> measures are carefully policed and scrutinised. Any confession obtained under duress will not be admissible.</P>
    <P>I make that point for the following reason.  If the Minister is putting all her eggs in one basket for the extra detention period&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I wonder how successful these measures will be.  We cannot replace what is commonly called good police work and we must seriously examine the organisation of our police force.  We must examine its management structure and the possibility of having an independent police authority. We must consider bringing in additional civilian expertise to help the Garda Síochána because the expertise currently available is not sufficient.  I am not blaming the Garda, I am blaming the structure, the regime under which they have had to labour and their successive political masters.  The Garda needs additional civilian expertise if it is to engage in good police work.</P>
      <P>I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments about the Drugs Squad.  I am aware there have been many disputes within the Garda Síochána as to whether a separate squad is needed or whether every garda should have basic training on drugs issue.  That seems to be the norm at present but I understand the number of people in the Drugs Squad has halved since 1985.  I believe the number is approximately 17; it was close to 30 in 1985.  If we are serious about dealing with this major problem in our society, is it wise to halve the expertise in that specialised squad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On legislation, the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 gave the Director of Public Prosecutions the power to apply for an order to seize the assets of those convicted of drug dealing or other serious crimes.  I understand from a reply to a parliamentary question by the Minister recently that the DPP has made only two such applications but the Act gives the DPP further powers.  The DPP can <Col N="1834" /> apply, in advance of somebody being arrested or charged, for what is called a restraint order to freeze the assets of those suspected of being involved in drug dealing.  The Minister referred to the impressive list of seizures this year by the Garda Síochána.  The figure had increased to 2,800 seizures worth in excess of £30 million.  Will the Minister indicate the number of applications for restraint orders the DPP has made to freeze the assets of drug dealers?  He cannot seize the assets but he can freeze them and subsequently realise a seizure when a conviction is obtained.</P>
    <P>For as long as drug dealing pays, those criminals who are anxious to make money out of it will continue to do so.  I suggest &mdash; this would not be an infringement on anybody's civil liberties &mdash; that where the gardaí have reasonable evidence to believe that people are involved in drug dealing, even though they may be unable to obtain a prosecution immediately, the DPP should be asked to apply for a restraint order in those circumstances.  I will probably be told the DPP is independent but it is not good enough in a society such as ours, where serious measures are being contemplated and where enormous public resources are required to deal with this problem comprehensively, to simply accept an answer of that kind.</P>
    <P>In regard to the 5,000 drug addicts to which I referred, I believe that prison is not the place to deal with somebody who has an addiction problem.  The statistics I referred to earlier, of the average prisoner in Mountjoy having had 10.4 separate convictions and of 50 per cent of the prisoners being IV heroine abusers, clearly show that prison is not successful in dealing with drug addiction.  The only effective way of dealing with drug or alcohol addiction is through the provision of intensive therapeutic or detoxification facilities.</P>
    <P>Many Members are familiar with the Coolmine and Rutland Street Centres, mainly in relation to alcohol abuse. Those centres have been extremely successful in weaning people away from what was a basic addiction.  Therapy is <Col N="1835" /> the most expensive form of medical care but it is equally the most successful, with a success rate of between 80 and 90 per cent.  We need to take a two-pronged approach to the problem.  We must take some of the serious fire brigade measures the Minister is contemplating to deal with the immediate problem but we must also begin, through intervention at an early stage, to look at those young people most at risk, the kind of people that have the profile of the prisoners in Mountjoy.  We must have comprehensive intervention programmes in the community and detoxification and therapeutic facilities available on a voluntary basis.  If those convicted of a criminal offence want to come off drugs they should be given the option of attending a centre such as Coolmine or Rutland Street rather than serving out their sentence in prison.  If they are continuing with their therapy programme that should be acceptable and we should put the kind of resources that are required in that direction.  That will be much cheaper, in the medium term, for society.</P>
    <P>I cannot over-emphasise the importance I place on education and awareness. I know many people who have had to deal with children who have become serious addicts.  The signs would have been obvious for perhaps six months and yet the parents were not aware of the symptoms and were not in a position to know at an early stage, therefore, that they had a young person in their family with a serious problem.  That is not necessarily a matter for this Minister but it is a matter not just for our education and health systems but for our society generally.  It is a matter we would be foolish to ignore because some young people become addicted to drugs at 12, 13 and 14 years of age.  When children can become addicts at that age society is not taking parenting seriously.  Sometimes parents do not know and I believe they would wish to know.</P>

      <P>I wish to share the remainder of my time with Deputy Gregory.</P>
      <P>There has been much discussion inside and outside the House about the amount of drugs in circulation in Mountjoy Prison.  As many people said, if the Minister cannot deal with the drug problem in Mountjoy Prison which is under the authority of her Department then how can she seriously deal with it in open society?  It is estimated that 50 per cent of the prisoners, including those on methadone maintenance, have access to drugs.  This means that the medical programmes are futile.  Apparently prisoners in isolation units have access to drugs.  Are drugs becoming a substitute for the management of the prison?  How can drugs be widespread in a prison which is so well policed and where the average cost of keeping a prisoner is approximately £40,000 per year?  There must be independent drug testing of the prisoners in Mountjoy Prison so that we have independent evidence on which to base the solution we decide to apply.</P>
      <P>I say to those Deputies who are concerned about civil liberties that it is a fallacy to suggest that the choice is between incarcerating the innocent or allowing the guilty to walk free.  If that is the choice then like many people in society I would prefer to see some guilty people walk free rather than incarcerate innocent people.  That is not the choice and we must not allow it.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister well in her efforts to deal with this problem although I will reserve my judgment on the proposals. The other proposals such as the provision of therapeutic facilities for addicts and a wider response by the police force, including a new management structure and bringing in civilian expertise, are necessary if we are to deal successfully with a problem which has been acknowledged by all as a threat to the fabric of our society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the strong words of the Minister for Justice on this issue, strong action is also <Col N="1837" /> required.  Unfortunately, the strong words of previous Ministers were not translated into strong action.  I am happy that the Minister is making a concerted effort to confront this problem but I am not confident that Garda management or the Garda Commissioner will translate this package into action. Why has this strategy not been put forward by the Garda in so far as it relates to law enforcement?  Why did we have to wait for the ecstasy problem to spread to areas outside Dublin and middle class areas before politicians responded?  Why was the heroin crisis allowed to spiral out of control in poor inner city and working class areas while Garda management at Commissioner level appeared to take no initiative whatever?  These questions are fundamental in terms of the law enforcement aspect of the drugs problem.</P>
      <P>Last Saturday afternoon in North Earl Street I saw plain clothes gardaí follow street traders, yet there were no gardaí to take action five minutes down the road in the north inner city where heroin was openly being sold.  This makes me wonder how the Minister, the Government or anybody else can translate the words we have heard here today into decisive action.</P>
      <P>It is fundamental that treatment facilities are available to addicts. However, these facilities are non-existent in most areas and are inadequate in the worst affected areas.  The only way many addicts in the north inner city of Dublin can get methadone is on the black market.  In some cases parents who do not have the necessary knowledge have been forced to treat their children with methadone acquired on the black market.  This requires a response by the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>The Minister's intervention in this matter is very welcome but a parallel intervention by the Minister for Health is required if we are to deal with the crisis in regard to treatment facilities and the lack of treatment.  If this does not happen then this package will be a waste of time.  If I had more time I would make many more points.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Justice on her decisive action to tackle the drugs crisis.  At long last the major plague of drug abuse is being given the kind of political attention it requires.  While the incidence of drug abuse of all kinds has escalated over the past two or three years, there has been an incredible level of buck passing between all the relevant agencies.  The problem is now of such magnitude that decisive political action by the Government to tackle it is essential.  While I welcome the Minister's initiative in this area, the efforts to deal with the drugs problem must be politically driven by the entire Cabinet, particularly the Ministers for Justice, Health and Education.</P>
      <P>I welcome the new powers being given to the Garda and note the safeguards in the Minister's proposals. While there must be a multi-agency approach to this problem I strongly believe that stemming the supply of illegal drugs must be the primary aim. We need a comprehensive life skills programme in school to build up self-confidence and self-esteem among young people who, in certain parts of my constituency, find it difficult to avoid being sucked into the drugs culture because of the widespread availability of illegal drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was with great disappointment and incredulity that I learnt of the Garda Commissioner's refusal to attend a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on the Family.  In the absence of legislation to compel witnesses to attend <Col N="1839" /> Oireachtas committees I hope the Minister will use all the means at her disposal to persuade the Commissioner to attend an early meeting of the committee. His refusal to attend and his statement that the availability of illegal drugs to young people is a matter more appropriate to education are indicative of the serious attitude problem among the Garda.  In parts of my constituency illegal drugs are available at all hours of the day and most children over the age of seven or eight know where to obtain them.  I have experienced great difficulty in setting up meetings with senior members of the Garda who do not seem to be dealing with this serious problem with the required urgency.  I am not sure how the Minister will tackle this problem which relates to attitude and morale within the force.  Those problems need to be tackled as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>When local public representatives approach senior gardaí in an effort to get them to take a more proactive or hands-on approach to the drugs problem very often they are told they do not want to move in on local dealers because they are waiting to catch the big dealers.  This argument does not hold much water with people living next door to a flat where drug dealing is ongoing. In some streets in my constituency three or four families are dealing with drugs and there are queues of people, waiting to buy their fixes, in the front gardens in the evening.  The Garda are aware of this and local people have approached them on a number of occasions and given details but there is no evidence of action.  The excuse given is that they are waiting to catch the big dealers and there is no point tackling the smaller dealers.</P>
    <P>In this respect, I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to setting up a joint task force involving the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda.  As most commentators have said, the number of very large drug dealers in Dublin city is quite small.  The general view is that there are perhaps ten or 12 major godfathers. I ask the Minister to give <Col N="1840" /> serious consideration to putting in place a high level task force, providing round the clock protection, which would set about picking off each of the main drug dealers who are swanning around the city and living very high lifestyles.  They are basically thumbing their noses at the authorities and there is a great need to establish such a task force quickly.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that there is little or no co-ordination in this area.  The national co-ordinating committee has met on few occasions and the situation in the prisons is a scandal.  While I welcome the Minister's initiative, there is a need for much more action.</P>

I previously outlined the gravity of the problem in my constituency, particularly in two of the most deprived communities which are utterly devastated by drug abuse, drug dealing and the mayhem associated with crime.  One can visit certain areas between 4 p.m. and 2 a.m. and witness mayhem and drug related crime which involves significant intimidation of community leaders.</P>
      <P>Three or four of the best leaders in the communities I referred to earlier were forced to leave their homes in recent months as a result of the intense and brutal pressure brought to bear on them by minor drug barons.  As the Minister is aware, the mayhem in one area culminated in a dastardly attack on the home of a senior Garda officer. There was a need for strong measures and I am grateful to the Minister for her response to the concerns expressed by Labour Party backbenchers.</P>

      <P>One of the biggest problems facing the Garda is manpower. In my area, only one Garda from a station in the J district was available to go on the beat this morning.  I utterly reject the comments made recently by Mr. Ferry of the Garda representative <Col N="1841" /> body in relation to transfers.  The Garda is a national body or it is nothing.  If Mr. Ferry wishes to take the road he appears anxious to take, the Minister should consider recreating the Dublin Metropolitan Police.  This would ensure a properly staffed Dublin police force. At least 50 extra gardaí are urgently needed in my constituency because there are only 200 gardaí for 85,000 people at present.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners recently appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts and I was most unhappy with the responses I received.  There still seems to be fear and intimidation within the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners in relation to dealing with drug barons.  The Minister has taken measures in this package but a major initiative is required in that regard.</P>
      <P>Various Department were mentioned and I agree with Deputy Gregory and Deputy Harney in relation to treatment and education.  However, the Department of the Environment is very much involved in Dublin city.  One problem is that the management team in Dublin has not felt it necessary to properly manage flat complexes in the city. Unfortunately, they have allowed widespread crime throughout the day.  They do not get other agencies involved or take responsibility for the property which belongs to the city.</P>

      <P>I provided Members who wished to contribute to this debate with an opportunity to speak because it is important to hear their views on this balanced package agreed by Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue is not in the House but I assure him and his colleague, Deputy Haughey, that there are no difficulties with my Cabinet colleagues regarding this package.  It has received total Government approval.  I realise Deputy O'Donoghue uses these debates to hone his literacy analogies and that he uses the most colourful expressions he can find.  This may be <Col N="1842" /> quite interesting from the point of view of his literary skills, given that people from Kerry are renowned for such skills. However, he need have no fears or concerns for the well-being of my Cabinet colleagues or about the agreement by the Cabinet and the Government on these proposals.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Members who contributed for their support for these proposals. They are balanced and proportionate to the level of threat I perceive exists to society from drugs.  A number of issues were raised but I will not be able to respond to them all given the time available.  However, I wish to put the record straight in relation to an issue raised by Deputy Harney.  I keep hearing the comment that fewer gardaí are working in the drugs squad as compared with ten years ago.  There is a smaller number of gardaí in the central drugs unit but more than double the number is working in the drugs area throughout the country.  Originally, there was just one unit but there is now widespread training of gardaí.  There is a full-time drugs unit in every division in the Dublin Metropolitian Area and in Cork, Limerick and Galway.  Twice as many gardaí are working in the drugs area.</P>
    <P>The level of threat from drugs, to which Members referred, requires a serious and ongoing review of the deployment of gardaí.  At the height of the violence, I understand approximately 2,000 gardaí were involved in some way with the threat posed to society by terrorism.  The threat from drugs is such that we must examine the deployment of gardaí to ensure as many as possible are trained to deal with it in every parish and village.  It is no longer just an urban problem and I wish to put a stop to the comment which is constantly made that the drugs unit is less efficient or contains a smaller number of gardaí than it did ten years ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health has given major priority to this area.  This is a balanced package and Members are correct to point out the need for the involvement of the Departments of Health, <Col N="1843" /> Education and others.  The Minister for Health has already taken significant steps, which flowed from the priorisation of the need to provide more drug treatment facilities.  The number of detoxification beds in the Eastern Health Board region had doubled from ten to 20 and the Beaumont unit has been augmented by a new unit of equal size at Cherry Orchard.  There has also been a significant increase in the drug addict outreach programmes, including the methadone maintenance programmes at the three clinics.</P>
    <P>A number of other issues were raised by Members with regard to drugs in prisons. I hope I will have a chance over the next three months to put forward my proposals in this regard but they will not come about through off the head type reactions to interviews which are being carried out now.  I have been working on changes required in the prison system since coming into office and the plans are coming to fruition.  It is complex in terms of bringing the staff along and bringing the physical structures of the prisons up-to-date to maintain the new aspects.  When I bring the report to Government, I hope people will see that a concerted effort is being made to keep as many drugs as possible out of the prisons and to give prisoners a chance to undergo treatment while they are serving their sentences.</P>

      <P>In a statement last Friday, I welcomed that day's international conference on Bosnia and insisted that it was imperative that the London Conference be constructive, as the so-called safe areas depended upon it.</P>
      <P>The British Prime Minister opened the Bosnia Conference with a &ldquo;strong warning&rdquo; to Serb forces not to attack UN &ldquo;safe areas&rdquo;.  As he uttered those words mortar fire rained down on the people of Sarajevo.  His words; and those of other leaders who attended the conference, clearly demonstrate to us all the dreadfully inept and inadequate response of the international community to the murderous mayhem that is plaguing Bosnia.</P>
      <P>For world leaders to issue strong warnings is just not good enough.  World leaders should hang their heads in shame.  Warnings, words, waiting and inaction are of little use.  The horrible reality of events in Bosnia demands urgent action.  The hand-wringing helpnesses and utter inaction of the UN and the EU is disgraceful in the light of the latest affronts to humanity by the murderous Serbs.  The situation in Bosnia, perpetrated by the Serbs whilst the world stands by and watches, is deplorable and shameful.  Without doubt, the future of the UN and Europe to prevent the aggression of the Serbs is something that will never be forgotten or rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland, through the ineffectiveness of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dick Spring, and the Government will remain guilty by association so <Col N="1846" /> long as the Irish Government stands by and shuts its eyes to the horrendous atrocities, including murder, rape and their inhuman behaviour.  Ireland must step out from the dithering crowd of world governments.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to at least take the lead in securing the effective implementation of the 1993 UN mandate, or give back to the Bosnian people the fundamental right to defend themselves, the fundamental right to exist.  Resolution 836 (1993), June 4 1993, clearly outlines that UN policy is to protect the safe areas by using force.</P>
    <P>The Council decides to extend the mandate of UNPROFOR to enable it to protect the safe areas of Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zepa, Gorazde, Bihac and Srebrenica, and to use force in self-defence or in deterring attacks against the safe areas ... to promote the withdrawal of military and paramilitary units other than those of the Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina.</P>
    <P>Hundreds of thousands of Bosnians are being hunted from their homes into safe areas and then subjected to the daily terror of bombardment from Bosnian Serb artillery, unprotected by the UN and crippled by an arms embargo.  How do the UN respond? They dispatch additional troops to protect the troops that are supposedly protecting the enclaves.  The Tánaiste, who has taken the credit for his involvement in establishing the safe areas, is emphatic that the arms embargo should not be lifted.  However, Deputy Spring has never lobbied or called for the essential political protection of these safe areas.  The Tánaiste's complete lack of action on this issue is disgraceful.  He must come out from behind the skirts of his EU colleagues and make a clear decisive stance on behalf of Ireland. Currently we observe while the major world powers, the US and Europe, are strangling the UN.</P>
    <P>We should observe no longer.  Only yesterday, Serb troops stormed into the Bosnian safe haven of Zepa forcing thousands of women, children and <Col N="1847" /> Bosnian Government soldiers to flee. The fall of Zepa came as the Yugoslavian War Crimes Trinbunal indicted Serb commander Mladic and his political leader Karadzic for genocide and crimes against humanity.  The UN stood helplessly by while Mladic swept into the deserted city after a week-long bombardment hammered it into submission.</P>
    <P>This barbaric behaviour must be halted.  Ireland must act.  I call today for the Tánaiste to act.  We have no political axe to grind and therefore cannot afford to be guilty by association.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has been involved since 1991 in efforts to bring peace to the former Yugolslavia. I want to set out the three essential aims in terms of our foreign policy.  The first is to maintain and develop the search for a peaceful resolution of the conflict on the basis of the Contact Group's peace plan.  The core of the plan is a settlement involving the preservation of Bosnia as a single union within its internationally recognised border and the continuation of Bosnia's international legal personality, the allocation of territory within these borders on the basis of 51 per cent for the Muslim and Croat communities and 49 per cent for the Bosnian Serbs and the right of refugees and displaced persons to return freely and safely to their homes of origin.</P>
      <P>The second objective is to prevent the spread of the conflict and the third is to ensure the supply and delivery of humanitarian assistance to the victims. The international aid operation in Bosnia is one of the largest in the world, supported by nearly 26,000 UN troops. Over 2.7 million displaced people benefit from its assistance.  There is no doubt that many thousands of Bosnians would have died over the past four winters were it not for this international aid effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the essential aims of Irish and European Union policy.  However, it is difficult to sustain progress toward <Col N="1848" /> these objectives faced with the situation on the ground.  The Bosnian Serb capture of Srebrenica and Zepa and their offensives and threats against the other enclaves mark a new low point in the deteriorating situation in Bosnia.</P>
    <P>With regard to Ireland's humanitarian response, which has been of special significance, the immediate priority is the tragic situation of the displaced population.  Yesterday I had round table discussions with representatives of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the main Irish humanitarian aid organisations active in Bosnia.  We are in a state of readiness to respond immediately to needs as they arise and we are also consious of the need for building up stocks of food and other essential aid for the coming months.  We have also informed UNHCR that we are ready to receive further refugees when and if requested. This afternoon, the Government agreed to accept a further ten medical evacuees who are currently in a field hospital near Tuzla.  All the necessary preparations to accept and care for such refugees are in hand.  It should be noted in this context that over 178 visas for Bosnians who have relatives in Ireland have been approved but have not been availed of.  In many cases the military situation has prevented these people from taking up their visas.</P>
    <P>While the humanitarian agencies are meeting the immediate needs from existing stocks, they stress that in a deteriorating situation it is essential that new stocks, are built up for the coming winter.  Communications and transport are already difficult because of the military situation and local restrictions.  This situation would of course be exacerbated seriously in the event of lifting the arms embargo and the consequent worsening of the conflict.  We remain in close contact with the aid agencies with regard to ongoing requirements.  Ireland is working closely with the international humanitarian aid agencies to ensure that requirements are met.  The Government has already made an additional allocation of £250,000 to the UNHCR, <Col N="1849" /> Oxfam and other NGOs to provide water, shelter, blankets and hygiene items.  This brings to over £2.5 million Ireland's humanitarian assistance since the beginning of the conflict.</P>
    <P>The Government condemns unequivocally in the strongest possible terms the reprehensible military actions of the Bosnian Serbs, which are in flagrant violation of international law.  It has strongly supported the International War Crimes Tribunal since its inception and consistently argued that the tribunal must have sufficient resources for its investigative and judicial functions.  In 1994 Ireland was among only a small number of member states which made a voluntary contribution to its work.  The financial arrangements for the tribunal have now been agreed and Ireland is awaiting formal notification of its assessed contribution.  This will be paid in time and in full in the next few weeks. The Government welcomes the start which has been made by the tribunal to ensuring that those responsible for the atrocities committed in Bosnia will be held accountable in international law.</P>
    <P>With regard to the latest developments, the Government welcomed the convening of the meeting in London on 21 July of representatives of the United Nations, Contact Group members and major troop contributing countries.  It was not to be expected that this meeting alone would instantly result in an immediate end to the Bosnian Serb aggression in Bosnia.  The aim was to continue with a co-ordinated international response to the grave situation.</P>
    <P>A number of important conclusions emerged from the London meeting. First, the meeting agreed there could be no permanent military solution to the situation in Bosnia and that diplomatic efforts towards a political settlement must be maintained.</P>
    <P>Second, the meeting agreed to support UNPROFOR continuing its role in Bosnia despite the difficulties it faces. The withdrawal of UNPROFOR however would have the most tragic consequences for the local civilian population.  Since the arrival of <Col N="1850" /> UNPROFOR in Bosnia in 1992, the death toll in the conflict has fallen from the hundreds of thousands to between three and four thousand.  Millions of people have benefited from the humanitarian aid delivered with UNPROFOR's assistance.  Over 700 UNPROFOR troops have put their lives at risk in support of this mission.</P>
    <P>The Deputy must be aware of the consequences, in terms of war, casualties, displaced persons and refugees, the lifting of the embargo will bring about. The Deputy will have to carefully weigh the consequences of his recommendation, and its effects on people in the region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise this issue and I thank the Minister for attending.  We welcome the new national dental scheme, but there are some problems with it.  It is a regional scheme run by the board at central level, rather than the individual community care scheme that was previously in place.  In addition, the emergency treatment, which was not as broad as in the past, is using a significant amount of the resources available for the scheme.  For example, people requiring dentures must still wait an inordinate length of time.</P>
      <P>With regard to social welfare recipients who are also medical card holders, formerly, such person who had paid contributions, whether they were still working, or pensioners over the age of 65 years who had contributed during their working years, were entitled to apply to their own dentists and avail of services.  The Department of Social Welfare paid 50 per cent of the cost of the supply of dentures and the health boards made a payment towards the other 50 per cent.  Recipients were, therefore, at no loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health board contribution is no longer paid in such circumstances.  Part of the problem is not only that the <Col N="1851" /> schemes differ fundamentally in certain respects, but that payments are now made to the private dentists through the payments board, and not directly by the health boards.  Will the Minister ensure that the disadvantage which social welfare recipients who are medical card holders now find themselves at will be removed?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister also discuss with his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, the question of running two parallel dental services and perhaps agree on an integrated unified dental service? The same applies to the ophthalmic service, where there are two separate schemes in operation, and to the ear, nose and throat service.  At a time when the Department of Social Welfare is assuming responsibility for income allowances from the Department of Health, there is a good case for transfering the medical services provided through the Department of Social Welfare to the health boards under the aegis of the Minister for Health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I thank Deputy O'Hanlon for raising this important matter and for giving me the opportunity to reply.  The provision of dental services for eligible persons is a matter for each health board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Regarding the background to what the Deputy describes as the payment by health boards of grants towards the cost of dental treatment for Social Welfare contributors who are medical card holders, the limited resources available to health boards for the provision of dental services were mainly directed at the improvement of the health board children's dental services.  Many health boards could provide only a limited service for adults.  In most cases the adult service provided amounted to an emergency service for the relief of pain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ensure that as many treatments as possible were provided with the resources available, some health boards <Col N="1852" /> in recent years introduced <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements under which persons with dual eligibility &mdash; persons who were entitled to treatment under the Department of Social Welfare dental treatment benefit scheme and who also had medical card entitlement &mdash; could obtain the required treatment from private dental practitioners under the dental treatment benefit scheme.  Such treatment would be provided on a priority need basis. The health board involved met the cost of the patient contribution payable under the scheme.  In this way the health board considered that it could obtain the maximum amount of treatments while targeting its own resources at those with medical card eligibility only.</P>
    <P>These arrangements were as, I say, entered into on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis by a small number of health boards.  It was a pragmatic response to the needs in particular areas.  The arrangements are, I believe, still in operation in some areas. They were not general to all health boards.  Following the introduction by my Department in November 1994 of the dental treatment services scheme as part of the dental health action plan, a comprehensive range of routine dental services for all adults with medical card eligibility will be phased in over the period of the plan.  Private practitioners under contract to the health boards will be significant providers of adult dental services.  In the initial phase of the dental treatment services scheme persons of 65 years and over in need of routine or full denture treatment have been identified as the priority group.  The plan provides for the extension of the dental treatment services scheme to other identified age groups on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>As treatment for all eligible adults is progressively phased in under the dental treatment services scheme the need for <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements of this nature brought to our attention by the Deputy, should no longer arise.  If, however, the Deputy has in mind a specific case, perhaps he could furnish me with details and I will refer them to the health board for investigation and for direct reply to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, for listening to my please over the past number of weeks about the difficulties which signing the health regulations would have caused, particularly for those in psychiatric care.  I am pleased to welcome the climb-down in relation to the regulations.</P>
      <P>We must look at the latest controversy about hepatitis C in the same way as the original controversy about Anti D.  There is, however, one significant difference.  The women who received Anti D were in good health in contrast to those who received blood transfusions because, as we all know, one only gets a blood transfusion if one is seriously ill.  That is the first major difference between the two groups.</P>
      <P>The contaminated blood was supplied to the second group from the same source, namely the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  They suffer the same uncertainties as Anti D sufferers and, in many cases, the prognosis appears to be worse.  It is important that the hospitals concerned with the treatment of the transfusion hepatitis C sufferers should be willing to provide all their medical records.  As the Minister said, they are entitled to that.  However, not all the sufferers have been provided with their full medical records.  It is important that the Department and the Minister give a lead to ensure that this becomes the norm in every health board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that this second group of hepatitis C sufferers includes not only women; but men and children.  The services which have already been provided to the Anti D women should be provided to the transfusion hepatitis C sufferers and I include, in particular, out of pocket expenses.  I wrote to the Minister earlier this week about one of my constituents. While I will not mention the person's name, I would like to explain the circumstances of the case.  This woman has been refused travel and subsistence expenses for hepatitis C testing by the <Col N="1854" /> Blood Transfusion Service Board.  Her hospital bills, which were not fully covered by the VHI, and which she sent to the Blood Transfusion Service Board for a refund of the outstanding amount have been returned.  It said it would only include this group in out of pocket expenses in hardship cases.  Many of the people I deal with live in remote areas and must travel some distance for treatment. Often they must get somebody to look after the home and their partner must drive them to the hospital or unit for treatment.  It is important that out of pocket expenses are available to them in the same way as it is to Anti D sufferers.</P>
    <P>In the light of what we have now discovered, it is important that the Minister implements what he said he would consider two months ago and give them equal access to the tribunal.  The Minister has admitted, through the Blood Transfusion Service Board, that there are at least 500 people in this category of which 100 cannot be traced and I would like the Minister to explain why. This creates a difficulty for the Blood Transfusion Service Board in terms of confidence.  Each time I spoke on this issue I said that my first concern is for those who have contracted hepatitis C and that my second concern, which is an equal one, is that confidence in the Blood Transfusion Service Board's services and the level of donations should be maintained.  That is important because blood is a vital part of the health care system.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to initiate not only a Lookback study, but an independently chaired study of those infected by contaminated blood through transfusions. That is the only ethical way in which the Minister can restore the confidence in the Blood Transfusion Service Board which has been damaged to some extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I thank Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn for raising this matter.  The health insurance regulations are draft regulations and extensive consultations are now complete.  I will take the views <Col N="1855" /> of the 23 interest groups we consulted into account, including the representatives of the psychiatric hospitals.  I do not know how much I will be able to enhance the terms for psychiatric patients, but I will be able to do so to some extent.  I am not a free agent and, as Deputy Brennan knows, I must check this out with the Commission in Brussels. I will not be dealing with the health Commissioner, our former esteemed colleague, Padraig Flynn, but with the competition Commissioner.  Insurance industry regulations rather than health provision regulations are the problem.  I am not up against a deadline to sign the regulations by the end of July, but I hope they will be ready and signed to submit to the Houses of the Oireachtas in October.</P>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn raised the issue of hepatitis C.  I will first deal with screening and the establishment of who has hepatitis C as a result of a blood transfusion as distinct from an Anti D product.  I will then deal with what has been described as the unequal treatment of different people infected with hepatitis C, especially in respect of travelling expenses, which the Deputy stressed and with which I agree.</P>
      <P>I wish to clarify the position in relation to offering screening to people who have received blood transfusions prior to 1991, when the screening of blood donations for hepatitis C commenced. My overall objective is to identify all persons who have contracted hepatitis C from infected blood transfusions. I am approaching this objective in a comprehensive and structured manner. The target Lookback programme which is well under way is the first step in achieving my overall objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make it clear that I have not ruled out the possibility that it may be necessary to offer screening to blood transfusion recipients.  I am awaiting detailed information from the targeted Lookback programme which is currently being undertaken by the Blood Transfusion Service Board. <Col N="1856" /> before I am in a position to make an announcement on this matter.</P>
    <P>The hepatitis C Lookback programme currently being undertaken by the BTSB is targeting recipients of blood transfusion, prior to 1991, by tracing the past donations of donors now identified with evidence of hepatitis C virus infection.  These donors include a number of women who were infected with the hepatitis C virus, following the administration of Anti D and who subsequently became blood donors.  The Lookback programme also includes donations given prior to 1991 by donors who were identified hepatitis C positive following the introduction of routine screening of blood donations in 1991.</P>
    <P>The targeted Lookback programme has two phases, the first phase will identify donors who have tested positive for hepatitis C, the product &mdash; whole blood, red blood cells, platelets or plasma &mdash; the hospital to which the product was issued and the recipients.  The second phase will trace the recipients with a view to offering screening.  Phase two of the programme is now under way.  Contact is being made with recipients through their general practitioners, with a view to assessment and obtaining blood samples for testing for hepatitis C The targeted Lookback programme will identify those people who are known to have received a potentially infected blood transfusion.</P>
    <P>At present there is not enough information available to me to advise blood transfusion recipients to be screened. Important information for blood transfusion recipients will be available to me from the target Lookback programme in the coming weeks.  This information will include <i>inter alia,</i> the risks to blood transfusion recipients of having received potentially infectious blood, the transmission risks to those recipients and a firmer indication of the number of recipients who cannot be traced under the targeted Lookback programme. Such information will enable blood transfusion recipients to make fully informed decisions in relation to screening. I hope I will be in a position to fully <Col N="1857" /> inform the public in this matter in September, not December as quoted in some newspapers.</P>
    <P>I have every confidence that the personnel in the BTSB undertaking the targeted Lookback programme are competent to do so and are in the best position to trace those blood transfusion recipients who are at risk of having contracted hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>A new chief medical officer and a chief executive have been appointed to the Blood Transfusion Board.  I would like to deal with the issue to which Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn referred, that women represented by Positive Action are treated more favourably than those who contracted hepatitis C from blood transfusions.  They all receive the same medical treatment. Anyone with hepatitis C is entitled to full free medical treatment for life.  They are also entitled to national counselling which has been put in place.</P>
    <P>Interferon is a modern drug which is effective in some cases.  A minority of women are being treated with Interferon and it is available free to all persons infected, regardless of which cohort they are in.</P>
    <P>There are two areas outstanding where there is a difference in treatment. One is in relation to <i>ex gratia</i> payments. Out of pocket expenses are paid to the women infected through Anti D.  The people infected with hepatitis C as a result of blood transfusions were not getting out of pocket expenses, except in hardship cases.  A legal difficulty was brought to my attention and I had to get legal advice.  I have taken that advice and I wish to announce that I can extend this payment.  I am glad Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn brought this to my attention over the past few months.  The <i>ex gratia</i> payment is now being extended to that group.</P>
    <P>The outstanding matter is the question of the tribunal.  The Government has decided the tribunal will deal in the first instance with the persons who have contracted hepatitis C from Anti D products.  There is also provision within <Col N="1858" /> the terms of the tribunal to extend it to other groups.  I have indicated that I feel there is a moral obligation in this regard.  However, I have not got all the information to be able to decide where I can draw a line on extending it to other cohorts.  It is not an open ended tribunal; it has to deal with the legitimate difficulties of targeted groups.  I am not saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;, but eligibility for the tribunal is a matter I have to decide later in the autumn.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn for raising the issue today and for being constructive in bringing these matters to public attention.  Now that I have extended the scheme perhaps the Deputy's constituent would resubmit her application.  I do not know if I can legally backdate the provision but if she resubmits her case I will have it dealt with by my officials within the legal constraints.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Future of Telecom Éireann.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will have some news for the House on the proposed part-privatisation of Telecom Éireann by the Government.  Telecom Éireann is Ireland's most successful and largest State-owned company.  If it is the Government's intention to privatise a large part of it this House should be informed at an early date.  I hope the differences between the parties were resolved at today's Cabinet meeting and the Minister can announce the Government's privatisation programme for a large part of Telecom Éireann through a sale to foreign investors, if that is the Government's policy.  I raise this matter to seek that information.</P>
      <P>On 4 May, almost three months ago, the Minister told a conference in Galway that in two weeks' time he would announce the mandate.  If he announces it today it will be three months from the date of the conference.  I will be glad to get the information whenever it comes, but that is a considerable delay over the Minister's timetable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may remind me again of my own ducking and weaving but that <Col N="1859" /> public relations script has been used in the House on several occasions and I recommend the Minister have his public relations advisers freshen it up.  Let him not tell me he is decisive and that I have been ducking and weaving.  I hope we can leave that act behind us and deal with the issue in hand.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell me what the destination of the proceeds of the sale will be?  If he sells 35 per cent of Telecom Éireann will the money be used to reduce the company's debt?  If not, what is the logic behind the sale?  Will the proceeds be used to reduce the national debt or for the company's benefit?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister release the secret reports he has commissioned and the reports he has received from the company? I suggested previously that the commercially sensitive information could be omitted.  However, it is a disgrace that over one third of Ireland's largest State company may be sold to foreigners without a proper debate, without the House being fully briefed and without the necessary reports in the Minister's possession being made available. Such secrecy is regrettable.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister considered the comments of Dr. Michael Smurfit who suggested that the type of sale envisaged of 35 per cent of the company to overseas investors was a defensive strategy?  Has the Minister considered an offensive strategy; for example, Telecom Éireann taking a stake in other companies or moving into Northern Ireland or the UK?  Is the sale being envisaged a distress sale and a defensive strategy?  Has the Minister considered the unions' point that a share swap between Telecom Éireann and British Telecom, for example, would be a fairer way to raise a few hundred million pounds than a cash sale?  Telecom Éireann could do with such funds but does not urgently need them.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister think it is too early to do what he proposes?  The Minister has had considerable success in business and I could not imagine him selling off one third of a company before putting <Col N="1860" /> its house in order rather than letting the buyers do so after the sale.  If Telecom Éireann needs to be restructured and redundancies and cost reductions are to be brought about, why does the company not do that now under the Minister's instructions rather than look to a foreign investor to do the dirty work that neither Telecom Éireann nor the Minister seem able or wish to do?  It would be normal commercial practice to sort out a company's difficulties before selling off a part of it to other investors and hope they will do so.</P>
    <P>I have been asking for the various reports because I wonder if this House and the public are entitled to debate any alternatives.  Is the sale of a part of Telecom Éireann to overseas investors a proposal cast in stone that cannot be debated?  Most other countries considered the stock exchange or financial institutions when fresh investment was sought.  Has the Minister taken a definite decision not to permit the financial institutions in Ireland and Irish pension funds to invest?  Why are foreign concerns only allowed to invest in Telecom Éireann at this stage?  Why are Irish investors specifically excluded from the mandate if that is the case?  Will the Minister tell the House if investment from financial institutions was considered?</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to debate this matter at short notice.  I remind him that Telecom Éireann is the jewel in the semi-State crown; it is not the fiefdom of any Government.  Its business should be done in public.  I ask for a public debate on the future of Telecom Éireann.  The company is not in distress; it has a turnover of £900 million and profits of nearly £100 million.  It has a debt equity ratio of 2:1, which is not bad when compared with many private companies and it is getting a 10 per cent return on its capital.  There is no panic or rush to obtain £400 million to boost next year's budget.  What is needed is a debate on the options facing Telecom Éireann, including the possibility of Irish investors taking a share in the company <Col N="1861" /> rather than selling it to overseas investors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry) Michael Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Brennan for raising this issue. He asked relevant and pertinent questions as well as pointing out that fundamental and important decisions remain to be taken.  For that very reason I have been studying this matter extremely carefully with my Department and Telecom Éireann and we have made substantial progress.  The process is at an advanced stage and we will shortly be in a position to make final decisions.  A number of the points raised by Deputy Brennan are relevant in that context and I will take them into consideration.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of what speculation there may be, we will not be rushed into making a decision.  When we do it will be an informed one and in the best interests of the future of Telecom Éireann, its workforce and those who depend on the company for vital services.</P>
      <P>It is nonsense to suggest that there is any division in Government on the question of the strategic alliance as it is at one on this issue.  The strategic alliance is a key element of building a telecommunications sector which will offer consumers world class services. Anything else risks compromising our capacity to compete in the global marketplace.</P>
      <P>I want to state in practical terms why telecommunications is so important to employment.  Between 1983 and 1994, the overall level of employment here grew by 3 per cent.  At the same time, employment in agriculture fell by almost 20 per cent.  Employment in industry declined by 4 per cent.  Alone of all the sectors, employment in services grew by 13 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is primarily the services sector which is providing employment growth not just in Ireland but in the OECD as a whole.  The average service job is over six times as dependent on telecommunications as a job in industry.  These <Col N="1862" /> service jobs have come and will continue to be created in Ireland in ever increasing numbers.  We have the skilled workforce, the infrastructure and the technological capacity necessary for success. The drive for alliances and the increased competitive thrust in telecommunications generally is being accelerated by actions taken at EU level where each month brings new proposals and initiatives for sectoral liberalisation. Voice telephony services will be liberalised in most of the Union on 1 January 1998.  Infrastructure will be liberalised on the same date.  Rules for licensing, regulation and the provision of universal service are being drawn up by the Commission at present.</P>
    <P>Put simply, the Commission is no longer prepared to sit and wait for the member states to take the necessary action.  It is taking a lead role in systematically opening up every aspect of the sector to competition.  Equally it is increasingly vigilant in policing the operation of the sector to ensure against the abuse of dominant positions by incumbent monopolies.</P>
    <P>My point is simple.  The days in which national economies could determine the shape of their telecommunications sectors in every respect are drawing to a close.  There is an international consensus that the fragmented and monopolistic structure of the sector is now rendered obsolete, unnecessary and undesirable.  Our task is to recognise and adapt quickly to these trends and to make the best of the emerging situation which holds so much promise for the economy generally.</P>
    <P>Ireland will not stand alone and ignore the major trends in world telecommunications. Customer expectations are setting the agenda for providers of telecommunications services. Irish business and consumers deserve no less than their counterparts in the rest of the developed world.  The new world of communications can, I am convinced, compensate for the physical disadvantage of our peripherality.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the need for an alliance is without question at this stage.  Nor can <Col N="1863" /> there can be any question of a delay or a lack of commitment by the Government to the business of finding a suitable partner for Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>The first steps have already been taken in this process.  These have included the canvassing of initial expressions of interest by relevant companies and the preparation of strategy positions by the company and my own Department.  Currently, the Government is recruiting consultants to advise it on the conduct of negotiations and conclusion of agreement on the alliance issue.  Telecom Éireann likewise is separately recruiting consultants to assist the company in that area.</P>
    <P>We are now on the threshold of decisions which will dictate the future of telecommunications and indeed have a major impact on our future economic growth.  Firstly we must decide in the context of the critical importance of telecommunications what our requirements of a strategic partner are.  Any future partner must be able to demonstrate a long term commitment to the Irish market.  They must also be able to contribute to our overall national policy goals and in addition assist in enabling Telecom Éireann to become a major player in a new liberalised market.  The capacity of a partner to generate additional job opportunities will also be extremely important.</P>
    <P>In addition we must address the key issues of liberalisation, regulation and the alliance structure.  I have already stated that an alliance must be equity based and it is my intention that the requirements of Telecom Éireann's balance sheet will have first call on any <Col N="1864" /> proceeds arising from equity sale.  But it will be made clear to all of the interested parties that Telecom Éireann will remain in majority public ownership.</P>
    <P>All of these issues are being addressed in a mandate for negotiations which will emanate from my Department. This mandate was not on today's Government agenda but a worthwhile discussion took place on all of these issues.  Clearly both the principle of the strategic alliance and the broad parameters of our policy stance have been agreed by Government.  Work on a few remaining details will in no way prejudice the success of the broader process. A formal position will be agreed by Government very shortly enabling the release of the mandate.</P>
    <P>A huge amount of work has gone into the preparation of the mandate.  What is going on at present is a matter of fine tuning the agreement.  We are doing this to make sure that we get it right first time.  There will be no delay in the overall process as the necessary background work currently ongoing in Telecom and my Department on the preparation of an information memorandum for interested parties will in any case take a number of weeks to complete.  I am satisfied that the way can be cleared for the process of negotiation with interested parties to begin in earnest very shortly.  Equally I am happy, based on my contacts with the interested parties, that these companies are comfortable with the timetable emerging with respect to the alliance.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 6.10 p.m. until 11 a.m. on Wednesday, 20 September 1995.</P>
