      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach noted Jacques Santer's detailed statement yesterday regarding the reform of the European institutions. Effectively, he stated that enlargement will have to be paid for by reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and the regional and social funds, which would mean a major decrease in the resources we receive.  Does the Taoiseach intend to make an input to the conclusions drawn up by President Santer?  From an Irish perspective, he stated for the first time yesterday that he intends to have his final document completed before Christmas.  We must have an input to that document as it will radically affect, <Col N="294" /> in particular, the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>

      <P>If the Taoiseach cannot reply, I wish to make the point that this matter is crucial for Irish farmers, particularly in the context of the social and regional funds.  Will the Taoiseach take on board in some other way what I have stated?  If we do not have an input to that document it will have adverse effects for our economy.</P>

      <P>I made my case for this amendment on Committee Stage when the Minister said he would reconsider it, possibly with a view to accepting it.  We have quite a few amendments to get through today and I would like to speed up matters in order to deal with the more important amendments. If the Minister has considered the matter, perhaps he will give me his view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude of myself and the Department has not changed since Committee Stage in relation to this amendment.  I am aware that ICOS has made representations claiming that it is qualifying for the 10 per cent corporation profits tax on the basis that the process is a manufacturing one.  That is a frail argument as far as we are concerned.  The claim was turned down by the Revenue Commissioners, who are the ultimate interpreters in this instance, and it is not possible to acquiesce to the Deputy's request.  In the circumstances, I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 59:</P>
      <P>In page 103, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;61.&mdash;Section 39 of the Finance Act, 1980 is hereby amended by the insertion of the following:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;In this subsection &ldquo;wood pulp substitute&rdquo; means wood pulp substitute which is produced in the State&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  on a commercial basis with a view to the realisation of profit, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  wholly or principally from a process of decontamination and compaction of recyclable waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following provisions shall apply for the purposes of relief <Col N="300" /> under this Chapter in relation to a company carrying on a trade which consists of or includes the production of wood pulp substitute&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the production of the wood pulp substitute by the company claiming the said relief shall be regarded as the manufacture within the State of goods,</P>
    <P>(ii)  any amount receivable for the said production shall be regarded as the amount receivable from the sale of goods, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  subsection (1) (d) shall have effect as respects the company in relation to a claim by it for relief from tax by virtue of this subsection as it has effect as respects a company in relation to a claim by it for relief from tax by virtue of subsection 1 (b) or subsection (1) (c).&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment, dealing with wood pulp substitute, was tabled by myself and other Deputies on Committee Stage and the Minister indicated he would prefer &mdash; he was obviously correct in this &mdash; that the issue be dealt with if possible by way of a Revenue ruling to the effect that the activity in question constituted manufacturing.  If that were possible, I would withdraw the amendment but Deputy McGahon has shown me a letter from the company to the effect that Revenue has decided that this does not constitute manufacturing within the law.  We are now faced with a problem of whether we classify this particular activity as manufacturing. The implications of this are serious because a new enterprise in a low employment area of Dublin will be threatened if the decision is not made either by legislation or administrative ruling in the Revenue Commissioners. Now that it appears the administrative ruling will not be made in favour of the company, the legislative route would seem to be the only way forward.</P>
    <P>In general terms, this company is engaged in a manufacturing process but the Revenue Commissioners interpret <Col N="301" /> the law differently as matters stand. This company needs the assistance of this House in categorising its activities as manufacturing.  The enterprise is a good one and its activities are particularly worth while in that they are not merely environmentally desirable but essential.  In all the circumstances, the case for this amendment, which the Minister hoped to circumvent by an administrative ruling, has become stronger in the past few days because of the attitude taken by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express grave disappointment at the failure of Revenue to rule in favour of this company. Its ruling affects a Dundalk company.  In recent years, there have been some successes in Dundalk but this company has been an outstanding one.  In less than a year, 33 young people who were long term unemployed were given employment by this company.  Its success augurs well for the future if we can assist it.</P>
      <P>The refusal of the Revenue is disappointing, particularly when it draws a fine distinction between what is classified as manufacturing and, as is the case in this company, unprocessed waste paper.  In the opinion of Revenue, there is no difference between the waste paper that goes into the presses and the wood pulp substitute that is produced at the end of the process.  However, unprocessed waste paper is valueless whereas wood pulp substitute ranges in value from £115 to £400 per tonne.  Paper mills pay £400 for one type of wood pulp substitute and £115 for another.  This material has undergone substantial change because basic waste paper is virtually valueless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mill owners are not philanthropists and for them to pay £400 per tonne for a product, it must have undergone significant change.  Being turned down for the 10 per cent corporation profits tax has major implications for this company, for which there are great hopes in Dundalk. The company has opened another depot in East Wall in Dublin and it has further plans to open depots in Cork <Col N="302" /> and Belfast.  This company exports approximately 20,000 tonnes of wood pulp substitute.  If it were affiliated to the Smurfit group or some other high-flying company would a niche have been found for it?  The company provides employment for 33 people for whom the future was very bleak.  The Revenue Commissioners are nit picking to such an extent that they are drawing a fine distinction between ordinary waste paper and the finished product, an environmentally friendly wood pulp substitute which exceeds the Government standard for such products.  Being turned down for the 10 per cent corporation tax has major implications for the development and further growth of this company.  The company's growth is dependent on reinvesting profits as it does not qualify for any State backed assistance, is too big for county enterprise funding and is specifically excluded by the criteria applied by Forbairt. Without manufacturing status the company is not eligible for BES funding. As a direct result of the Revenue Commissioners' decision the company will have to reconsider its planned Dublin expansion at East Wall and the creation of 15 jobs for the long term unemployed.  It also places some of the existing 33 jobs in Dundalk in jeopardy. The loss of manufacturing status represents the loss of £60,000 to a company at its very early stages when funding is badly needed.</P>
    <P>I lobbied the Minister on behalf of this company and I thank him for the very sympathetic hearing he gave to the company's case.  He met with members of this company and went to extraordinary lengths to try to accommodate them.  He arranged a meeting with the Revenue Commissioners at very short notice.  I know the Minister is sympathetic but I wonder who is running the country &mdash; is it Ministers or the Revenue Commissioners?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McGahon that we had a good Committee Stage discussion on this amendment and it has now been resubmitted by Deputy McDowell.  The amendment was carefully crafted by experts in this area who would have advised the company that this was the proper approach. The Minister says he is sympathetic towards the company but I appreciate that he would have difficulty in extending the 10 per cent corporation tax rate.</P>

    <P>Before the activities that qualify for corporation tax at the 10 per cent manufacturing rate were redefined, it gave rise to some ridiculous interpretations of manufacturing activity, for example, banana ripening and moving coal around at the port were so classified.  I <Col N="304" /> speak as someone who benefited from interpreting the law as it was.  I have no quibble with the Minister about bringing in changes in that regard as to deem those activities as manufacturing was a bit extreme.  That is the dilemma in which the Minister is now caught.  I think there is a case, however, for identifying companies in certain sectors and giving them a low rate of corporation tax.  Deputy McGahon outlined the background to this company which is one of the successes of the 12 Government-sponsored <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> areas.  This initiative was much derided &mdash; in fact, I may have said in Opposition that I did not see how it would work but this company was created under that initiative. The person who runs the company had the guts to go ahead with his idea which has worked successfully and he is employing many people.  This company is processing waste in an environmentally friendly way, in line with Government policy on waste.</P>
    <P>The case I am making is not that the company should qualify for manufacturing tax relief but that the type of activity it is engaged in should benefit from a lower tax rate.  The only device open to the Minister to achieve this is by amending this section, and we all tabled similar amendments on Committee Stage.  Will the Minister devise a method whereby a company such as this engaged in environmentally friendly activities will benefit from a lower tax rate?  In fairness to the Revenue Commissioners, we should have a lower tax rate for specific activities because we cannot start interpreting the law to suit companies in our own constituencies.  Companies deserve to be in a lower tax band on the basis of the type of business they are engaged in.  The only device open is to have the amendment written into the section in order that the company will qualify as a manufacturing company.</P>

      <P>I join with the two previous speakers in lending support to this unique company, which was one of the successes of the Dundalk employment <Col N="305" /> partnership.  Early in the partnership there were not too many successes and people wondered if the initiative would be successful.  In the past two to three years there has been a growth of activity in the partnership.  When times were tough Secure Shred was started by one person with an idea and he got backing from the employment partnership and a number of business people in the town who were requested to participate.</P>
      <P>The company found a niche in the market.  We should encourage people to forage for opportunities and give them every assistance. The company has a statable case to make about whether this type of process is &ldquo;manufacturing&rdquo;, should it wish to go to court.  Look at what happened to the ripening of bananas which is close to our hearts in Dundalk.  I know that the company was closed but it is a grey area.  Secure Shred has shown the way and should be encouraged otherwise it will not grow. It has the potential to grow into a large company and create jobs not only in my constituency but in Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">

      <P>As my constituency colleague, Deputy Ahern, stated this company grew from an employment partnership arrangement in Dundalk.  While the performance of employment partnerships generally has been somewhat erratic this development was worth while.  It has changed hands and those involved in its management feel that the tax treatment they seek will be the catalyst for further growth.</P>
      <P>This provision in the tax code has played an important role in the development of sectors which might not otherwise have developed.  I have in mind the mushroom industry which has grown over the last ten or 12 years.  The special tax provision gave it the impetus to grow.  Such growth has been concentrated mainly in the north eastern part of the country and is of great importance to the local economy and job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently the Small Firms Association made a comparison between a service <Col N="306" /> company here and one in the North.  Its conclusions make ominous reading.  The indicators are that we might not get the investment we need in Border counties such as Louth which has suffered during the last 25 years through lack of investment. While the position has been turning around in the last four or five years, the reality is that for those with money to invest the determining factor is the amount of profit they make.  A reputable accountancy firm was asked to make the calculation.  It is freely available and I am sure the Minister and his officials are aware of it.  It indicates that underlying costs show a clear advantage in favour of a company establishing in Newry.  We must address this if we are to encourage investment in the six Border counties and in the six counties.</P>
    <P>This issue is so important that we should mention it at every opportunity particularly when the Minister for Finance is within earshot.  I will raise it again when those who are heading off to the investment conference in Washington come home and tell us about the possibilities which they hope will flow from that.  I support the Deputies who advocated the cause of Secure Shred in Dundalk.  It is a worth while project and if the Minister accedes to our request he will do a good day's work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a serious point of principle involved.  While the employment which the company have created is laudable and should be put on record there are umpteen other companies creating employment.  That is not to take from the case being made by Deputies Kirk, Ahern and McGahon. This is a new area of development in that the company is involved in an environmental issue.  Such issues are coming on the agenda and the Minister must take that on board.  Are we committed to the environment?  If so, what taxation policy decisions can the Minister take to ensure that companies such as the one in Dundalk will develop?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfair and incorrect to compare the radical transformation which occurs there to ripening bananas and moving <Col N="307" /> coal around.  That was a nonsense and when the 10 per cent tax regime was reformed it was rightly done away with. In this case, however, a substantial change occurs and it deserves consideration on that basis and also on an environmental basis.</P>
    <P>We are often told by domestic firms that if they were multinational companies doors would open and grants would be pushed their way.  If a multinational company came to the Minister with this project I suggest there would not have been any question about the 10 per cent manufacturing rate.  Rather all the benefits under various taxation headings would have been available to it.  If this could not be done under existing provisions I have no doubt but that we would ensure, under this Bill, that such a development would be granted the 10 per cent manufacturing rate in order to encourage the company into the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a decision to make which will receive all party support.  We must be seen to encourage this kind of development particularly where recycling of waste paper is involved. This project stands on its own merits irrespective of its location and the number of jobs created.  The criteria to which the Minister must have regard are whether it undergoes a radical process in the widest definition of manufacturing, which it does; whether this is a new departure, which it is; and whether a new policy is needed in this area, which there is.  He is making a fundamental policy decision on these matters and he will be applauded by Members on all sides of the House if he directs revenue towards this area.  I ask him to bear in mind the legitimate argument I have put forward.  If a multinational company which proposed to set up here put forward this proposal to IDA Ireland we would fall over ourselves to ensure that the 10 per cent manufacturing rate applied to it.  If the Minister makes a definitive policy statement in regard to indigenous, innovative, new and export <Col N="308" /> orientated industry it will be supported by all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>There are two issues involved here, one of which relates to the company, the merits of which have been put on the record and which I support. We cannot make law for individual companies, and I think everyone knows that.  We live in a republic which is ruled by law and where everybody is treated equally before the law and by those people, including the Revenue Commissioners, who are statutorily charged with administering it.  Deputy McGahon in his characteristically colourful phraseology said that one might be treated differently from someone else by virtue of who they were.  That belonged to the regime which we got rid of in 1921-22.</P>

      <P>This is a different state, and long may it remain so.</P>
      <P>As a member of the European Union there are constraints on us in relation to the operation of the internal market, specifically with regard to competition. Deputy Kirk referred to the 10 per cent regime as it applied to the very welcome growth in the mushroom industry in Monaghan and the north east.  The competitors in the internal market located in the United Kingdom who took an action through the legal process open to them as fellow citizens of the EU were successful in convincing the authorities that there was unfair competition in treatment under the taxation system. We cannot make a law in this respect without having regard to that reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This company has already met with the Revenue Commissioners and it has received a very sympathetic hearing.  It would be useful to put on the record some comments on the evaluation of the process.  The nub of the issue is whether the activities of the company taken <Col N="309" /> together constitute manufacturing for the purposes of the Act, which ultimately has to be determined by the Revenue Commissioners.  The company has not yet made an appeal to the appeals commissioner and it may do so if it wishes.  The company did not come through the first round with the Revenue Commissioners for the following reasons:</P>
    <P>Basically what is involved is the manual sorting of the waste paper into various grades, the removal of paper clips, binders, contaminants etc. The paper is, then, compressed and baled.  The baled secondary fibre must conform to certain standards, for example, a bale of &ldquo;High Grade&rdquo; must contain at least 80 per cent of a certain type of fibre and must have no contaminants.  However, this standard is achieved by a manual sorting and removal of items as the waste paper passes on a conveyor belt rather than by any process which could be regarded as manufacturing.  Before compression the paper passes through a ruffler which basically &ldquo;whirls&rdquo; and mixes, to a limited extent, the paper. Thus, at the ruffling stage, any remaining paper of a different grade is mixed with the main grade of paper being worked on.  The action of the ruffler also breaks down (i.e. tears) the paper prior to bailing.  Nothing is added to the paper in this process.</P>
    <P>The waste paper acquired by the company is not suitable for use in paper or plasterboard production. The process adds value by sorting and decontaminating the product. However, at the end of the day, there is no change in the character of the product.  In Revenue's view manufacturing relief would be denied by section 39 (5) (IV) of the Finance Act, 1980 introduced in 1990&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I do not propose to give the legal reasons for this.  The law was reformed in 1990 by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government following various cases, for example, the infamous banana ripening case, and this had the <Col N="310" /> broad support of everyone.  The company did not overcome the hurdle in terms of the definition of that law.  In terms of taxation law, the company has the right to take its case to the appeal commissioners, which would seem to be the next logical step.</P>
    <P>On the wider issue, for which I have full sympathy, we need to treat waste recycling and that type of industry more favourably than we are doing at present. For example, according to the documentation Deputy McGahon showed me last night for reasons of policy Forbairt has excluded itself from assisting this kind of activity.  Next week the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, will publish the Waste Bill which will attempt to introduce some degree of commerciality into waste activity, reprocessing and recycling.</P>
    <P>There is no denying the benefit of the company and the need to do the sort of things to which Deputy Cullen referred. However, changing the law in this section is not the way to do this.  For those reasons I cannot accept the amendment.  I will continue to give whatever help I can to this company which should avail of the procedures open to it.  I formally undertake to raise the matter with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to see if Forbairt can provide the company with the kind of grant assistance which would otherwise be available to it as an indigenous company.</P>
    <P>On the inference that foreigners coming into the country got a better deal in terms of treatment by State agencies&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a perception, however erroneously formed, and it was widespread.  However, we have dealt with this by designating the IDA as an international division for inward investment and giving Forbairt responsibility for promoting and facilitating domestic industry.  Clearly the waste area should be seen as an indigenous part of industry with considerable potential.  Proper <Col N="311" /> supports are not in place at present and I undertake to raise the matter with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment. Regrettably, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deeply disappointed at the attitude taken by the Minister.  If this industry takes off there is nothing to be lost and everything to be gained from the point of view of the Exchequer, the environment and exports.  If this company is denied BES status and the lower rate of taxation, all we will do is stunt in its infancy an industry which would be of huge value to the country.  We have nothing to lose in this matter, yet despite this the Minister is taking an abdurate stance.</P>
      <P>I accept that the Revenue Commissioners behaved impartially and fairly in their approach to this company's activities and, because of that, the amendment was tabled.  The reason the Revenue Commissioners rejected the application of this company to be treated as manufacturing, in the absence of this legislation, is not a reason to argue against the legislation.  If it was not necessary to amend the legislation I was the first to agree on Committee Stage that it would be preferable to go along that road.  We now know that the Revenue Commissioners take the view that this is not manufacturing under the law as it stands, and, therefore, as politicians we have to make a policy decision on whether it should be included in manufacturing by way of a special exception for all the reasons which have been advanced and which I will not repeat because I am merely replying to the debate.  Very definitely this activity is one which deserves support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he thinks it appropriate it appeals to the Appeal Commissioners if dissatisfied.  With respect, the Minister is effectively saying that if there is something wrong with the reasoning he read out as to why the existing law prohibits the company from being treated as manufacturers it should <Col N="312" /> appeal to the Appeal Commissioners, who might take a different view.  In all probability, based on the reasoning we have just heard from the Minister which came from the Revenue, the Appeal Commissioners would take the same view as the Revenue Commissioners. We would then be back to square one and no further progress would be possible.</P>
    <P>I am talking about industry which will be established if there is a BES scheme underpinning this particular activity.  I can well imagine that not alone would the project in Sheriff Street go ahead but that regional businesses in Cork, Limerick and other places would be established as part of Secure Shred Limited. This is a prime example of taking a stance on principle when the principle is not worth the candle because nothing would be lost by assisting this company. Would there be a revenue loss if this change was made in the law?  I suggest there would not.</P>
    <P>I make this point as strongly as I can and it is a pity this is not a Committee Stage debate.  Deputy McGahon, somewhat colourfully, contrasted the treatment of this company with what other larger companies, by name, might receive.  If this activity was carried on as part of the premises of the paper mill company to which he referred, nobody would come from the Revenue and say: &ldquo;ignore this activity of shredding and baling which you are carrying on here as it is not part of the process&rdquo;.  They would say it is a very definite part of the process, it is the preliminary stage in the manufacturing process.  Nobody would say this has nothing to do with manufacturing paper.  We will discount all that aspect of the plant's activity because it has nothing to do with the final product. What the Minister is saying &mdash; and I can see it clearly now &mdash; is that if I was like the gentleman named by Deputy McGahon, a large paper producing entrepreneur, I could carry on this activity in my plant, get BES scheme approval for the whole plant and 10 per cent corporation tax rates arising out of the activities of the whole plant and the <Col N="313" /> Revenue Commissioners would come sniffing around and say: &ldquo;this group of people are merely baling, compacting, sorting, decontaminating and so on&rdquo;. Nobody would dare say they should be excluded from the whole arrangement. The net effect of not acceding to this amendment is that a person can obtain the 10 per cent rate provided they combine this activity with another stage in the manufacturing process, but not if it is kept separate.  As Deputy Cullen said, that defies logic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It fulfils logic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not.  It defies logic.  In the last analysis where there is a young company which is a preliminary part of the manufacturing process of recycled paper, the Minister is saying that if its activities were carried on in conjunction with others it would attract the 10 per cent rate but because it is not the full manufacturing process, merely a preliminary part of it, it will not attract the 10 per cent rate.  I implore the Minister to take the view that this ought to be seen as a manufacturing process by changing the law.  I fully respect the ruling of the Revenue Commissioners.  It is a political matter now and not one for the Revenue Commissioners. There will not be an Exchequer loss.  There is nothing to be lost and everything to be gained by being flexible on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why would this company not locate in Newry now?  Why bother remaining in Dundalk?  There are no restrictions on movement of the paper north of the Border.  Why not go to somewhere north of the Border and carry on the business there where they would get a slightly more sane tax regime in relation to employment taxes and levies?  I fully accept the arguments made by the Revenue Commissioners as the law stands. This amendment was tabled because we thought that argument was relevant.  I ask the Minister, even at the eleventh hour, to reverse his decision and to allow this company to grow because <Col N="314" /> there is nothing to be lost and everything to be gained.</P>

    <P>The purpose of the provision contained in the Bill is to amend section 55 of the Finance Act, 1992, which restricts certain relief in the case of companies not filing their returns on time.  The objective of the measure was to grade the restrictions by reference to the length of the delay in filing and to place a cap on the level of each restriction. The amendment is necessary because the provision contained in the Bill fails to achieve the objective of grading restrictions by reference to the length of the delay in filing.  It would have had the unintended effect, in some cases, of making the restrictions more severe than those filing within two months of the filing date than for those filing later. The amendment corrects this and makes sure that the proposals put forward by TALC in this area are given effect.</P>

      <P>Section 114 provides that, subject to the conditions set out in the section, existing or temporary excise licences will continue in force up to the date of issue of a tax clearance certificate in cases where the grant or renewal of an excise licence is held up because of tax clearance delays.  The amendment now proposed is designed to meet a concern raised by the vintners trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="319" /> I referred to this matter on Committee Stage and Deputies agreed that the amendment on the lines requested was a good one.  In the normal course when a tax clearance certificate is issued the grant of an excise licence should follow almost immediately.  However, to avoid any difficulties arising from a delay between the issuing of a tax clearance certificate and the granting of a licence the trade requested that the section be amended to allow continuation of existing and temporary licences up to the date of the grant of a normal licence.  In this way the possibility, however unlikely, of a licensee being prosecuted for operating without a licence is removed in circumstances where there is compliance with the requirements of the section.</P>

      <P>In page 160, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;130.&mdash; As and from 1st July, 1995 the rate of VAT on newspapers and magazines shall be 5 per cent.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This was dealt with <i>in extenso</i> on Committee Stage.  First, I am not happy that the State should pour money even into a new centralised printing press because, on reflection, it would be a prime example of the State pouring money into getting rid of many jobs and we would be far worse off when the VAT and the PRSI is added.  Second, the 12.5 per cent rate of VAT on newspapers in Ireland is the highest in the European Union, and, with the sickest newspaper industry in the European Union, we should not have the highest rate of tax in the European Union on our newspapers.</P>

      <P>This is a matter of cost. The comments made about the newspaper industry on Committee Stage attracted much interest.  People should read the record before defining Government policy.  The opinions offered were subject to a caveat in a very clear way. I readily accept that we need to do something for the newspaper industry. I am informed in part by my previous experience as Minister for Enterprise and Employment, and my colleague, the present Minister for Enterprise and Employment has attempted to respond to the problems.  However, removing VAT from newspapers, even if magazines were excluded, would cost about £13 million, and it would be removed from all newspapers so the relative competitive difference, although it would not be equal across the board, would still have a knock-on effect on newspapers coming from the UK.</P>
      <P>Reducing VAT is not part of the solution. It may well have to be examined in the context of proposals brought forward by the industry and I would like to see that happen soon.  I accept Deputy McDowell's point that the newspaper industry is in trouble, and there are unique circumstances in Ireland, both commercial and cultural, that require a unique response.  I was merely indicating my willingness in principle to contemplate a unique response, provided there is agreement on all sides. However, I am not prepared to recommend the loss of £13 million for little or no tangible benefit on the other side.</P>

      <Col N="321" /> In page 162, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;139.&mdash;The rate of VAT on the golf facilities referred to in paragraph (a) of section 139 shall be 5 per cent.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I made the arguments for this on Committee Stage and I will not go through them at length now.  I accept the Minister cannot remove VAT from commercial golf courses.  I emphasise that huge amounts of money, particularly European Union Structural Funds, have been poured into these developments.  Very few are a big success.  Many are at an embryonic stage and are struggling.  In time they may be successful, but now is not the time to load on charges and level the playing pitch by imposing VAT on members' clubs, because many of them are struggling to compete.  Given that there has to be VAT on commercial golf clubs, I suggest a rate of 5 per cent if the Minister wants to level the playing field.  According to a survey carried out by the Revenue Commissioners, the return to the State is marginal. Certainly in four or five years time if these facilities are doing exceptionally well I would have no difficulty about charging higher rates of VAT.  It is at this stage when they are only trying to get established that I would argue against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a golfer but I have become very well educated on the extent to which golfing is a substantial industry here both from the point of view of the commercial courses and the people who play golf and are prepared to pay considerable amounts of money to enjoy the game.  We have a large number of golf courses, some of which are very old and have long since discharged their capital development costs and others which are still in the process of trying to recoup their investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure is a response to a legitimate request from commercial investors who came together to provide an infrastructure for tourism of which this would be part.  Yesterday Deputy <Col N="322" /> McDowell said, accurately, that the traditional seaside bucket-and-spade resort activity would have to be complemented by something else in this day and age, and golf is one of the most obvious activities.  This is to ensure that there would be no unfair competition between private members' clubs operating commercially by accepting green fees from visitors and not charging VAT on the fees in the way the commercial club down the road would have to charge it.  This is not a revenue-gathering measure <i>per se</i> but an equalisation of competition.  It must be seen in that context and it is fair.</P>
    <P>There is no need to reduce VAT from 12.5 per cent to 5 per cent.  It would simply open pressure on whoever happened to be Minister for Finance to transfer other categories in the 12.5 per cent bracket to the 5 per cent bracket.  We could all make a convincing case as to why certain activities should be charged VAT at a lower rate.  If we could lower the rates of taxation, we would do so, but there are competing demands for the provision of extra services.  I am not prepared to reduce the rate to 5 per cent, not because the cost would be minuscule but because it would lead inexorably to demands for the transfer of other categories of activity from the 12.5 per cent bracket to 5 per cent.</P>

    <P>150.&mdash;Part VI of the Finance Act, <Col N="323" /> 1983 is hereby repealed with effect from the 5th day of April, 1995.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The arguments against the residential property tax have been rehearsed on many occasions and I do not intend to rehearse them yet again today but in summary this tax is ideological, wasteful, ineffectual, does not widen the tax base and wastes many people's time and money in collecting it, assessing houses and the like.  In other words, it is not worth the candle.  It is also unfair and does not take into account many factors which ought to be taken into account.  It does not fund local government and makes no significant contribution to the Exchequer.  If we were to measure it in terms of the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach's White Paper it would only keep her going in publications for a few weeks.  Now is the time to get rid of it.  After the next election it most certainly will be dropped.  Those who support it are only building a scaffold and putting a noose around their necks in electoral terms if they persist with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled an amendment to repeal the residential property tax which was put to a vote on Committee Stage.  I was happy to be in a position on budget day to give a commitment that my party will repeal this tax when it returns to office.  On the first day it was introduced in 1983 or 1984 I said it was a nonsense of a tax, that it was not a property tax and did not widen the tax base.  It was a mickey mouse type arrangement; it was neither one thing or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Quinn, and I were members of the last Government and had to suffer political haranguing for making minimal changes last year.  If one is to get involved in a big political row one should make sure to get a big slice of money.  Let me give some free advice to the Minister: that is the basis on which he should operate.  The little change made last year upset all those who were preaching about tax reform <Col N="324" /> and the need to widen the tax base.  We all knew the reason changes were made: a small group of people with a large voice in political life had been affected. This was reflected in editorial comment. It did however bring home to many people &mdash; I did not need to be convinced as I said on the first day it was introduced in 1983 that it was a nonsense of a tax &mdash; that introducing a residential property tax was not the way to deal with the matter.  My party will repeal it when it returns to office after the next election.</P>
    <P>The reason I tabled amendment No. 70 is to increase the threshold to ensure that only a few houses will be caught in the net.  Having been defeated on Committee Stage I was told I would not be able to table it on Report Stage. The Minister would do himself and the rest of us a great service if he makes the changes I have outlined in next year's budget.</P>

      <P>I hope it will not be seen that I am being politically opportunistic. People do not like paying tax, but some taxes are perceived to be more onerous or unjust than others.  There is a lesson that we should learn from the disastrous 1977 election campaign.  People on all sides of the House are now that bit wiser.  Once one abolishes a tax base it becomes very difficult to reinstate it. With the benefit of hindsight, which is a wonderful commodity, we would all adopt a slightly different attitude to eliminating a tax base entirely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a number of occasions Deputy McDowell spoke about the need to reduce taxes on labour &mdash; employment taxes as they may be more accurately described &mdash; and I agree with him, but if one looks at the OECD countries and the countries with whom we are mostly in competition our tax as a percentage <Col N="325" /> of GNP falls within the middle range.  It is skewed because our tax base is distorted by our three traditional taxes &mdash; a sales tax, either excise duty or VAT, income and corporation taxes and a property related tax.  Those who talk about the low rates of taxation in Britain and Northern Ireland never say that the workers on those rates have to pay substantial rates on the property in which they live.  The rates are lower in Northern Ireland than in parts of the rest of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to accept this amendment because I cannot afford to lose any additional revenue from this reformed tax.  What incensed the burghers of Dublin South East was not the changes in the property tax but the fact that the extra sum to be lifted approximated to the sum of £5 million which was to be given to a stadium on the north side of the city.  The fact that the two measures were announced virtually in the same breath agitated more of Deputy McDowell's supporters than mine.</P>

As the Minister is aware, <Col N="326" /> it was the policy of every party in 1977 to abolish rates.  Prior to 1977 the Minister's party had helped to reduce the rate by 25 per cent.</P>

If they want to set up an all-party committee to discuss the matter our party will be prepared to participate in it.  We have always adopted that attitude because we believe that should be done.</P>
      <P>There is a brutal tax on household property.  A 6 per cent stamp duty is arbitrarily imposed on the value of houses every ten or 20 years, or whenever they are sold &mdash; I do not know the average time-span for selling a house but I presume it is every generation. Sometimes a property may be sold three or four times and in those circumstances one-quarter of its value is confiscated by the State.  I am not impressed by the arguments that this is a tax widening measure or that it in any way assists in reducing tax on employment.  I would be much more impressed by it if it were a general tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arguments for repeal of the residential property tax are clear.  It is a bad, ineffectual, ideological tax and it must go.  If the Government has not the ideological unity and sense of purpose to get rid of this tax, the next <Col N="327" /> Government will have to do so, and the sooner that happens the better.</P>

      <P>In page 177, line 31, to delete &ldquo;that section.&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;that section:</P>
      <P>Provided that the rate at which interest is payable upon any overdue instalment of that whole or part of the tax, or upon such part of the tax as would represent any such overdue instalment if that whole or part of the tax were being paid by instalments, shall continue to be at the rate specified in section 41 of the Principal Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 163 gives a person accounting for CAT on business and agricultural assets the option to pay CAT by five yearly instalments subject to interest at 9 per cent.  Interest on outstanding taxes is normally payable at 15 per cent per annum.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that instalments not paid on time will lose the benefit of the 9 per cent interest rate.  The amendment provides that interest on overdue instalments will be charged at 15 per cent and it would not be appropriate for those who indefinitely delay payment of taxes to be allowed the 9 per cent rate.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that during the debate on the Finance Bill and the budget I introduced a change in the general operation of CAT to make it more favourable, but it will apply only to those who are tax compliant.  We cannot allow people who now enjoy a more tax favourable regime to delay payment of moneys and not to attract the normal penalties associated with such delay.  I am making a distinction in law that those who pay their CAT obligations on time will be entitled to a reduced rate of 9 per cent, effectively the commercial rate, but if they do not pay them on time for whatever reason they will be subject to a penalty of a 15 per cent interest rate.  I consider that a reasonable proposal.</P>

Section 146 of the Finance Act, 1994, was designed to ensure that establishing title by that alternative method would likewise entail the disclosure to the Revenue of relevant gifts and inheritances.  The section achieved the desired result by requiring applications for registration of title based on long possession to be accompanied by a Revenue clearance certificate.</P>
      <P>What part (A) of the amendment tabled by Deputies McCreevy and Ahern proposes is that the Land Registry should not require production of a Revenue clearance certificate where it is satisfied there was no relevant taxable gift or inheritance or where the value of lands of less than one hectare does not exceed £11,880 &mdash; the current Class III threshold.</P>
      <P>Part (A) may also propose that the Land Registry should not require production of a Revenue clearance certificate where the applicant for registration based on possession is a bona fide purchaser who acquired the property for full consideration prior to 11 April 1994, the operative date mentioned in section 146.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed amendment would <Col N="333" /> place additional burdens and responsibilities on the Land Registry and therefore runs counter to one of the aims of section 146, which was to achieve the desired objective with as little additional strain as possible on the already over-stretched resources of the Land Registry. Apart from that, it is not considered that it would be appropriate, desirable or conducive to the efficient administration of section 146 to transfer from an area of tax expertise to an area without tax expertise such tax-related questions as the definition of a gift or inheritance, the value of land, and the question of whether a disposition of land was a bona fide sale for full consideration.</P>
    <P>It is clear &mdash; even from the amendment itself &mdash; that the changes proposed would introduce a level of efficiency by requiring that values in small cases &mdash; less than £11,880 &mdash; should be substantiated where the area is less than one hectare.  At present there is no automatic requirement of this kind, since processing by the Revenue tends to ensure the ready availability of a large number of other &ldquo;exempting&rdquo; criteria including, for example, a tax-free threshold, before agricultural relief, of £178,200 in Class I relationships</P>
    <P>While the necessity to apply for a Revenue clearance certificate could not be introduced without imposing some additional burden on persons who, for one reason or another, seek to establish title by long possession, the Revenue believes it has been extremely successful in keeping that burden to a minimum in the close on 1,800 applications which it has received to date.  This result has been achieved by the Revenue in three ways: by providing an application form which is short, simple and easy to complete; by issuing clear guidance notes to all practitioners; and by fulfulling an undertaking given after the passing of the Finance Act, 1994, to monitor closely the operation of the new section with a view to the achievement of its objectives in a manner that would keep both compliance costs and any element <Col N="334" /> of delay to a minimum.  That undertaking acknowledged that many applications for title based on possession are in respect of relatively small acreages of very limited value, and that the Revenue would deal pragmatically with such small cases.</P>
    <P>One further point in relation to part (A) of this amendment, given that one of the objectives of section 146 is to elicit information about undeclared gifts and inheritances, it cannot be accepted that a clearance certificate should not be required where a person who purchased land prior to 11 April 1994 is applying for registration after that date.  Such purchasers are expected to be in a position to provide relevant CAT information and there is no reason they should be treated any differently in this respect from a person whose purchase did not occur until after 11 April 1994. Admittedly, since they concluded their sales prior to the introduction of the clearance certificate requirement, they will not be in a position to make it a condition of sale that the vendor should discharge his CAT liabilities and obtain a certificate of clearance under section 146.  They will be able to obtain such a certificate on their own application, provided they furnish the title information which they have at their disposal. Section 146 (3) already provides for this situation by enabling the Revenue to issue a qualified clearance certificate. Consequently, no new legislation is needed for purchases which occurred prior to 11 April 1994.</P>
    <P>Part (B) of the amendment appears to propose that where an applicant for registration of title based on possession acquired his title &mdash; by purchase or by squatting &mdash; from a person to whom he or she is unrelated the applicant should be issued with a clearance certificate without having to satisfy the Revenue that the conditions of section 146 (1) with regard to payment of any outstanding CAT have been complied with.</P>
    <P>What has already been stated with regard to the position of applicants who purchased land prior to 11 April 1994 applies equally to the applicants <Col N="335" /> referred to in part (B) of the amendment. Being applicants for registration of title they are expected to be in possession of information which is relevant for CAT purposes and which should be furnished to the Revenue before registration takes place.  If they also happen to be persons who purchased the property after 11 April 1994, they will, in addition, by an appropriate condition of sale or by requiring the vendor to register his or her title, be able to ensure that any outstanding CAT charges will be discharged by the vendor before the sale is completed.</P>
    <P>The Revenue, while satisfied that compliance costs and any element of delay are being kept to a minimum, will continue to monitor the situation and to examine carefully each new proposal aimed at administrative or legislative improvement in this area.  In addition, should there be residual areas of difficulty which are causing problems, the Revenue is prepared to enter into discussions with practitioners with a view to issuing any statement of practice which may be needed to supplement the guidance notes already issued.</P>
    <P>I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputies as I cannot accept the amendment.  I will submit to the movers of the amendment the technical information I have just read.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 74:</P>
      <P>In page 179, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;166.&mdash;The Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976 is hereby amended by the inclusion of the spouses of beneficiaries for all transactions under this Act, who will have an equal threshold, and this provision hereby includes all applications currently and in the future before the Revenue Commissioners.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A similar amendment was tabled on <Col N="336" /> Committee Stage about which my colleague, Deputy Noel Treacy, put forward a strong argument.  When a person bequeaths a gift to a son and daughter-in-law, as the daughter-in-law is not a blood relation of the disponer, difficulties may arise regarding the amount of tax to be paid.  If the son dies and the property is given to the daughter-in-law, the threshold of £178,000 applies, but if, for particular reasons, a disponer wishes to bequeath a gift in joint names to a son and daughter-in-law, an anomaly exists regarding the threshold.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that an equal threshold applies.  On Committee Stage Deputy Treacy instanced a case where, for good reasons, a disponer bequeathed his property jointly to his son and daughter-in-law and this anomaly is causing a great deal of hardship in that case.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Our position has not changed since we last spoke about this matter.  I am aware that Deputy Treacy is relating his amendment to an agricultural experience but the law extends right across the CAT provisions.  If Deputy Treacy has identified a particular category of hardship, I suggest he, with the assistance of the excellent accountancy and revenue skills which Deputy McCreevy clearly possesses, should make cases on hardship grounds to the Revenue Commissioners.  For the following reasons I am not prepared to accept the amendment.  First, it would facilitate avoidance of CAT by encouraging gift splitting and would further reduce an already narrow CAT base. The cost could be anything up to £5 million per annum but that is only an estimate.  Second, a son-in-law or a daughter-in-law has no claim to greater equity than a brother, sister, nephew or niece.  The existing differentials in the CAT thresholds follow a logical pattern and it is difficult to envisage a change for one relationship without corresponding changes for others.  In this connection, it is worth noting that the Succession Act does not recognise any <Col N="337" /> moral claim by a son-in-law or daughter-in-law against a deceased person's estate.  That fundamental point should be borne in mind.  If we were to interfere through this legislation with relationships of a familial nature, it would have consequences in other aspects of legislation &mdash; although I do not wish to anticipate what those relationships might be if the people decide to change the Constitution in respect of divorce.  Finally, under the existing CAT code, where the spouse of a son-in-law or a daughter-in-law is deceased, that son-in-law or daughter-in-law is entitled to the higher threshold belonging to the deceased spouse.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 75:</P>
      <P>In page 180, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;170.&mdash;Section 154 of the Finance Act, 1994 is hereby amended in so far as it has application to an employment situated in Northern Ireland:</P>
      <P>
        <i>(a)</i>  (i) by the substitution of &ldquo;5 consecutive days&rdquo; for &ldquo;14 consecutive days&rdquo; in paragraph (a) of subsection (2),</P>
      <P>(ii)  by the substitution of the following paragraph for paragraph (b) of subsection (2): </P>
      <P>&lsquo;(b)  one of which the individual concerned is absent from the State, and present in Northern Ireland for at least eight consecutive hours during the day.&rsquo;, and</P>
      <P>(b)  by the insertion of the following proviso after paragraph (c) of the proviso to subsection 3:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;Provided that paragraph (b) (i) shall not apply to an employment which is subject to the provisions of part III of <Col N="338" /> Schedule 6 to the Income Tax Act, 1967, solely by reason of the employment being situated or exercised solely in Northern Ireland.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment, in my name and that of Deputy McCreevy, was put down on the suggestion of a committee of my party whose members are Border Deputies.  For the past number of weeks, we have examined this issue with a number of experts in the field of taxation to come up with a solution which will address the particular problem relevant to Deputies who represent Border constituencies.  Approximately 12,000 people who live in the Republic work in Northern Ireland.  This issue mainly concerns workers but a sizeable number of pensioners, who may have worked abroad, in the UK or in Northern Ireland are affected also.  If we were to include them in the figures, it would bring the total number of people affected to approximately 50,000.</P>
    <P>The ongoing peace process has changed the landscape of the Border in terms of the economy and from a taxation point of view.  People can now travel back and forth across the Border more freely but that will cause its own particular difficulties.  People to whom I have spoken in relation to this issue have said they are considering leaving the State to take up residence in the North.</P>
    <P>The effect of this amendment would be to disregard for Irish tax purposes a portion of the employment income from the North.  The amount disregarded is broadly proportionate to the number of days worked abroad in the year.  For instance, if somebody was working in the North for 265 days out a total of 365 days, they would be taxed on a proportionate amount of the income they earned in the North.</P>
    <P>When the Tánaiste visited Letterkenny recently, he met the cross-Border workers' group.  I understand he agreed that this problem should be addressed and he gave an undertaking that it must be resolved.  When the Taoiseach was in Opposition he also met a <Col N="339" /> number of representatives from the group and he suggested that the existing measure was probably in breach of human law rights.  He also gave a commitment that if Fine Gael was in Government, it would address this matter. I know the Minister for Finance met the group and has given its members certain commitments in this regard.  I ask him to look favourably on this amendment because it has been well drafted with expert advice and meets the needs of many of the people involved.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment which is of crucial importance in regard to the Border areas.  Fortunately, we have considerable mobility in relation to employment opportunities within all the counties of Ulster.  The present tax position, if left unamended, will discourage people from living on the southern side of the Border.  Many of my constituents, particularly people from the west Cavan area, are employed in Fermanagh and I want those people to continue to live in County Cavan. The present tax regime imposes an unfair burden on people who are introducing purchasing power into our economy. This is the appropriate time to encourage more cross-Border movement of people.</P>

      <P>I too support this amendment. This issue has become one of political significance in the Border counties. As Deputy Ahern outlined, many people are caught up in this double taxation measure as a result of the 1976 Act.  There is a significant differential between the level of taxation north of the Border and here, and that is the core of this issue.  Many people who work in the North but who live on this side of the Border are helping to boost our economy and there is a case to be made for special consideration of their individual circumstances.  The amendment is framed to allow the Minister to introduce the necessary changes that will alleviate the problems experienced by <Col N="340" /> these people.  I urge the Minister to give the amendment due consideration.</P>

      <P>The public representatives will ensure that they keep their voters.  One of the problems for these people is that they are regarded as self-employed and required to send in their self-assessment forms to the Revenue Commissioners.  They must pay preliminary tax, if they do not pay the 90 per cent, they are fined and that is one of the main problems.  These people must make a concerted effort to put aside £2,000 or £3,000 to pay the Revenue Commissioners at the end of the tax year whereas if they were paying tax every week or every month, it would be easier.  A suggestion was made to the Revenue Commissioners that it should work with the PAYE system here but apparently that is not feasible.  People are aggrieved, and think they should not be taxed on their full income on which they have already paid tax under the British system.  We have done our utmost to introduce new legislation to deal with this.  Will the Minister advise us on the cost implications of this amendment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The double taxation arrangement with Britain is full of anomalies. Tax is based on domicile: people living in the North and working in the South pay tax in this State and do not get a rebate by virtue of living in the North; people domiciled in the South <Col N="341" /> and working in the North pay the British rate of tax and subsequently have to pay the difference between the rate of tax in the North and the South to the Revenue Commissioners.  A much more serious anomaly is that people domiciled in the South who work in the public service in the North only pay the British rate of tax.  Let us take the example of a civil servant and a bank clerk in Monaghan town who travel together to work in Armagh.  The civil servant pays the British rate of tax and nothing more, whereas the bank clerk pays the British rate of tax in the Six Counties and then has to pay the difference between the Northern and Southern rate on this side of the Border.  This is a major anomaly.  Will the Minister have it examined?  We need to address the rate of tax people pay in the context of the European Union.</P>
      <P>In the light of the peace process and the ease of movement of peoples North and South it is appropriate that this issue be addressed.  I support my colleagues in asking the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

The previous speaker referred to the anomaly between those working in the private and public sector in the North and I have been making representations on such a case for years.  Two people, practically the same age living in the same street of a Border town travel together to their public service jobs in the North, one, who was born in the North is clear but the other who was born in this State has to pay additional tax.  He refused to pay, the arrears built up and he eventually had to pay up.  It was a very controversial point between these men for many years.  I hope this issue can be resolved.  It would be a good day's work if the anomalies could be ironed out.</P>

      <P>This amendment gives us the opportunity to air this long running problem.  Deputy McDaid said it goes back 60 years or more.  The present campaign probably started in my constituency because many people throughout Donegal and in other Border counties are affected by this anomaly.  The Minister said it would cost in the region of £12 million to give this concession which is a considerable amount but if we do not do something positive the danger is that people living in the Border counties will take up residence in Northern Ireland.  I had a very interesting two-day visit to Northern Ireland last Monday and Tuesday.  The situation has changed completely, peace is obvious everywhere; men, women and families are out and about their everyday business and the country between Derry and the coast as far as Belfast would be very pleasant to live in.  I hope more people will go North to sample its beauty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had correspondence from the Minister on this matter and I understand an internal departmental committee is looking at this issue.  As far as I <Col N="343" /> know this is the first positive response we have had since I came to this House. There may be a European dimension.  I know people in France, Spain, Germany and Luxembourg travel from one country to the other and we must learn from them as they too have had as turbulent a history.  The people affected by the Northern troubles have been waiting for a long time and what we have over-looked for 60 years cannot be put right in six months but I hope it will be addressed in a meaningful way.</P>

      <P>In one sense I am more geographically remote from this problem than other speakers but it is not just confined to Border counties as people from counties Meath, Kildare and Dublin work in these circumstances and are dealt with in the way the law provides.  Inevitably there will be problems as long as our taxation system and that in Northern Ireland is radically different.  I do not want to repeat what I have said on many occasions but the peace process, as other speakers have said, has drawn the curtain on a situation which the threat of violence in some way kept obscure.  Now in clear daylight we can see the consequences of the radically different taxation systems North and South.  We have to deal with it.  It will get worse because it appears that the British Conservative Party in its drive to be re-elected will reduce taxation on work even further from 25 per cent to 20 per cent.</P>

      <P>They may do all those things and that is probably what will happen but the distortion along the Border in terms of taxation will get worse.  It should be possible to deal with the matter and doubtless, as Deputy McGinley said, there are all sorts of precedents in Europe as to how to deal with Border region workers.  As long as <Col N="344" /> the two tax systems are radically different people will migrate to escape our taxation system.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coughlan made an important point with which I agree.  If they go across the Border the net loser will be the southern economy.  We must be realistic about this.  People will move to where there is a better tax system.  I know professional people whose practices are south of the Border but who reside in the North to escape the Irish taxation system.  This trend will increase and the peace process is the catalyst which will facilitate it.  Apart from locating industry in Newry people will locate their homes there too.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for tabling this amendment which was more for the purpose of debate than having such a radical change.  I assure Deputy McDowell that the State, under different administrations, has learned the lesson of price distortion between different taxation regimes.  We need only recall the mid-1980s when there was a wide price differential between the cost of white goods and VAT rates north and south of the Border.  There has been some harmonisation and convergence of the rates driven as much by loss of trade across the Border as anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must address this, as Deputy McGinley said, in the context of the frontier workers regime which exists in other European countries within the EU.  It is imperative that we take this on board now and the peace process will raise the curtain on it as Deputy McDowell stated.  It is a fundamental principle of any tax treaty that one is not disadvantaged by working under one regime and living under another, that is, paying more tax than if you lived and worked under the same tax regime. People cannot have it both ways: live in the South and pay tax in the North <Col N="345" /> while enjoying the benefits of our system. That is not on offer.  What is on offer is fairness, equality and, hopefully in time, convergence of the rates in both jurisdictions to avoid the distortions in excise duty and VAT we experienced earlier regarding movement of goods. Anyone who thinks what is on offer is high salaries in the Republic and low UK tax rates in the North should forget it.</P>
    <P>The position has been aggravated by the fact that there are agreements between Governments that Government employees do not get a circular transfer.  Deputy O'Hanlon referred to this.  The categorisation for many workers in Northern Ireland was changed from being Government employees to being employees of one body or another.  This had a disastrous effect on their tax position and was an unforeseen consequence of the change in their categorisation.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGinley referred to a working party I met with my colleague <Col N="346" /> Senator Moloney.  An estimated 12,000 people are affected and the estimated revenue loss would be £12 million.  Pensioners are included in that number. Part of the problem is they thought they had signed off in 1926 in a document entitled: The Final Financial Settlement between His Majesty's Government and the Free State.  Obviously they did not get it right.</P>
    <P>I will try to resolve the matter on the clear understanding it will be based on fairness.</P>

      <P>We have now reached Report Stage and since there are no amendments on this Stage we will proceed to Fifth Stage.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reiterate all the arguments I made on Committee Stage on this Bill.  I cannot see why this Bill excludes a member of the stock exchange from being chairman of the <Col N="349" /> stock exchange.  While the Bill will obviously pass I wish to put on record again my objections to that provision which I consider unnecessary, ill advised and unduly dismissive of the integrity of the members of the stock exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is significant for the stock exchange that the Bill will pass.  It moves the Irish Stock Exchange to a state of independence and allows for it to stand on its own.  It is my wish and that of my party that the experience gained over several years will be put to good use by those who will operate the stock exchange.  It is an important instrument in the State and best practice is essential.  I hope the future of the Irish stock exchange will be good.  All who participate in it will be anxious to ensure the well being of those involved and that it will grow from strength to strength.  There is scope for the Irish stock exchange to expand.  Many changes are occurring within stock exchanges worldwide and new ideas and new mechanisms are coming to the fore all the time.  I hope the Irish stock exchange will be alert to that and will be innovative particularly in the operation of a stock exchange which by international standards is small.  All of those things will be monitored carefully to ensure we have got it right in terms of the contents of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on Committee Stage &mdash; a point reiterated by Deputy McDowell &mdash; the Minister has made one glaring mistake in not allowing a member of the stock exchange to hold the chairmanship of the board of the stock exchange. There is no benefit in taking that approach.  Indeed, it was not considered necessary in the original draft of the Bill.  It was taken on foot of a ministerial amendment on Committee Stage.  I do not know what sudden pressure, vested interest or reasoning came to the fore to make such an amendment necessary. The only argument the Minister put forward was that he wanted to confirm the perception that the stock exchange would be independent in every sense of <Col N="350" /> the word and that we could all point to the fact that the chairman of the stock exchange was a person who was independent.</P>
    <P>If that was the Minister's main concern, which it seemed to be on Committee Stage, given that this is a new operation he should have ensured that the chairman could be an independent member of the board.  The Minister could have insisted on that in legislation but he should not have tied his hands forever and a day whereby no member of the stock exchange can assume the chairmanship.  That is a fundamental mistake.</P>
    <P>We will have to come back to his issue.  It is not in the best interests of the stock exchange that such a final stand should be taken by the Minister with regard to the position of the chairman. We will have to revisit this issue and this section of the Bill.  I wished to give my wholehearted support to the Bill but the insertion of that section by the Minister on Committee Stage diminishes the legislation.  I regret the Minister has not seen fit to remove that amendment inserted on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Higgins) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Higgins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their constructive contributions on the Stock Exchange Bill whether on Second Stage when it was taken by the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, in Special Committee when it was taken by me and today in the House.</P>
      <P>The enactment of this Bill will mark the end of the old system established by the Stock Exchange (Dublin) Act, 1799 under which the Irish Stock Exchange was set up and regulated &mdash; Grattan's Parliament.  We will have a modern system of regulation more suited to the needs of our times and in line with modern international practice and the requirements of EU law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the most notable change will be the forthcoming separation of the Irish Stock Exchange from the International Stock Exchange of Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland, of <Col N="351" /> which it has been a part for just over 20 years.  That separation will take place once this Bill has been brought into operation, which, as I indicated on Committee Stage, I expect to happen on 1 July next.</P>
    <P>The Bill establishes the Central Bank as the regulator for stock exchanges and their member firms.  It sets up a detailed regulatory apparatus for this purpose which I believe will be flexible and effective.  It will, I trust, allow the Central Bank and the Irish Stock Exchange to establish a good working relationship which will allow the Irish Stock Exchange to develop its full potential within an effective regulatory framework which will strengthen its position with investors and the companies which look to it for their funding.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to respond briefly to one particular point made today by Deputies Michael McDowell and Cullen and which I promised to consider on Committee Stage.  A number of Deputies, including the two Deputies in question, indicated they did not agree with the amendment to section 9 requiring an approved stock exchange to have an independent chairperson.  I assure Deputy Cullen there was no pressure or any subtle leverage applied.  The decision was taken after due and mature consideration.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as amended on Committee Stage, now provides that the chairperson of a stock exchange must be independent of the member firms of that exchange and independent of the operation and management of the exchange.  I explained on Committee Stage that I was responding to views on the subject expressed in this House during the Second Stage debate on the Bill and that the amendment was very much to do with ensuring that the Stock Exchange will be seen to operate in an open, transparent and above-board way.</P>
    <P>The Stock Exchange is a small organisation, made up of only ten member firms, which plays a key role in the economy.  It will be relaunching itself <Col N="352" /> after it separates from the London Stock Exchange; it will, under this legislation, continue to have a regulatory role and it will continue to need the support and confidence of investors, quoted companies and companies considering a quotation.  I have considered all aspects of this issue carefully, as I undertook to do, and I am all the more convinced that the requirement that the chairperson of the Exchange must be independent is a valuable addition to the Bill and will bring benefits to the Irish Stock Exchange and its member firms.  I also believe that the Exchange and its member firms will come to share that view.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell raised a number of points on Committee Stage which I have considered.  None of them gives rise to an amendment and, rather than take up the House's time explaining them, I propose to write to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Central Bank for its contribution to the preparation of this Bill.  I would also like to thank the Irish Stock Exchange for its co-operation in the process.</P>
    <P>The Stock Exchange Bill, as I have mentioned before, is one part of the legislation which is required to transpose the EU Investment Services Directive. I expect to be back shortly with the other part, the Investment Intermediaries Bill.  This will implement the Directive in respect of investment intermediaries who are not member firms of a stock exchange and will regulate the investment activities of investment intermediaries generally in this country. I look forward to the co-operation of the House in dealing with it.  The pressure for this came from within this House on Second Stage.  I stress that the Stock Exchange is a very small body containing ten member firms, but it has a key role in the economy.  It is crucial that it should have an independent chairperson. That is essential from the point of view of ongoing confidence of investors, companies and the general public.</P>

      <P>There is need for a national alcohol policy.  We must, as individuals and as a community, address the role of alcohol in society.  As Minister for Health I established an advisory council on health promotion and a group to examine the question of drawing up a national alcohol policy, and Deputy Howlin, one of my successors as Minister for Health, continued the good work.  Like me, I am sure he would like to see that document published and up for discussion among the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During 25 years of the troubles in the North, 3,000 people were killed as a result of political violence.  In the same 25 years 10,000 were killed on the roads in the South, and an average of 10,000 <Col N="354" /> people a year were injured on the roads. Apart from the suffering of individuals who are injured and of their immediate families, friends and relatives, which is the most important element, there is the question of cost which, in 1988 was estimated at £585 million.</P>
    <P>The effects of drinking on driving behaviour are well documented both here and abroad.  Much worth-while research has been carried out by, among others, Blaney in 1973 in Ireland, Zador in the United States in 1989 and 1991 and Walsh <i>et al</i> in Dublin in 1977-81 who carried out a survey in Dublin and Kildare in which the coroners for Dublin city, Dublin county and Kildare were involved.  Their survey revealed that of all the people killed on the roads in their respective areas during a five year period, 67 per cent had a blood alcohol level above 100 milligrams per cent.</P>
    <P>I would support a tough line to deal with drunken driving and the abuse of drink by drivers.  However, there is an anomaly.  If a person who makes his living driving a public service vehicle is, during holiday time, caught over the limit but perhaps not very much so, that person will lose his licence and also his job.  That person is, effectively, losing his licence for a lifetime in the context of work.  I know a person who drove a public service vehicle.  He was not in the habit of drinking except, perhaps, a bottle of stout on a Sunday evening. However, during the holidays he happened to meet friends for a drink.  They were taken into the barracks on the way home and the blood alcohol was found to be above the permitted level.  He lost his licence for 12 months, which was mandatory, but he also lost his job and will not be taken back as a driver of a public service vehicle.  The new law will increase the 12 months, but this individual was, effectively, suspended from driving for his lifetime.  This issue should at some stage be addressed.  I take a tough line on drunken driving but there must be fair play in the administration of the law.</P>
    <P>There are complaints about the high cost of motor insurance; young people <Col N="355" /> in particular find it almost impossible to obtain cover, in some instances it costs more than the value of the car.  Part of the answer lies in their own hands. While there is an obligation on the State to examine the cost of motor insurance and claims to see how they can be reduced it is important that young people consider the reasons they have to pay higher rates than other age groups.  One of the reasons is that they are involved in more accidents.  Organisations such as Macra na Feirme and youth clubs should address this issue and bring peer pressure to bear to improve the driving habits of some young people.</P>
    <P>My experience as a medical doctor has influenced my attitude to the question of drink driving but over the years there have been tremendous changes for the better.  Young people now arrange that at least one of them does not drink on a night out.  They should be commended for adopting such a positive attitude to the question of drink driving. I welcome the changes in this legislation although I argue that the law will be more liberal in some instances than it was prior to the implementation of the 1994 Act.  While the changes are balanced and fair I ask the Minister to keep the legislation under review.  There is an obligation on all of us to examine the causes of road accidents.  I am not suggesting that drink is the sole contributory factor; I have listed a number of other factors which should be taken into account, including speed, the failure of people to wear seat belts, the condition of cars and the provision of wipers on the head lamps of cars to improve visibility at night.  There is a need to keep this legislation under review to ensure that we reduce the number of deaths on our roads to the minimum.  I would like to think that it will be possible in our lifetime to reduce the number to zero. Perhaps this is not possible but there is an obligation on all of us to ensure that the number is kept to the minimum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the Deputies <Col N="356" /> who vigorously opposed some of the provisions of the Road Traffic Act, 1994 I am glad to welcome the changes in this legislation.  The Minister has not made all of the changes that I would like to see but he has made progress.</P>
      <P>Under the 1994 Act a person with a blood alcohol level of slightly over 80 milligrammes was considered to be a criminal, even though they may not have been involved in an accident, and lost their licence for an extended period and, perhaps, their job.  That was a draconian provision and a most serious flaw.</P>
      <P>Many of us asked the then Minister for the Environment to introduce graduated penalties as we thought that would be sensible.  However &mdash; this was an outrageous and ridiculous excuse &mdash; he argued that graduated penalties would not work.  I welcome the fact that they have been introduced.</P>
      <P>It was felt at the time that the 1994 legislation would do serious damage to the business of the rural or cross-roads pub.  That is what materialised; we were told that there was a 40 per cent reduction in their business.  Thankfully there has since been a recovery.  The rural pub is of importance; very often the drinking is a secondary matter, for many people it is a meeting place where they can exchange views &mdash; a fountain of philosophy &mdash; and there is good craic. It is sold abroad by Bord Fáilte as a tourist attraction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we wish to reduce the number of road deaths the way to do it is by enforcing the law.  The law prior to the introduction of the 1994 Act would have been sufficient if it had been enforced. I am not talking here about the occasional blitz either before or after Christmas or during holiday periods but rather about constant enforcement.  The problem is that people are aware that there is relaxation.  I am convinced that the provisions contained in this legislation will not work if they are not implemented and there is the occasional blitz by the Garda at specific times of the year.  There is a need for a constant Garda presence.  The Minister for the <Col N="357" /> Environment should discuss this matter with his colleague, the Minister for Justice, to ensure that the law is enforced.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes which have been made.  Rather than impose a ban where the figure is between 80 and 100 milligrammes we should impose a substantial fine.  However, progress has been made.  The Minister acted swiftly and consulted widely with interested parties and has produced a balanced provision which is welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express a different point of view.  I express regret that the Minister has succumbed to the power of the publican's lobby.  Per head of population more people are killed on the roads here each year than in any other country in Europe.  Year after year County Louth heads the list of fatalities.  Because of its geographical location people from the North cross the Border to go on drinking binges and have killed people on our roads.  Often no prosecution was brought subsequently.</P>
      <P>Last January 44 people lost their lives on our roads.  If there was a castastrophe and 44 people were killed, perhaps as a result of a bomb explosion, it would have been on the public agenda, the country would have ground to a halt in horror and politicians would have made condemnatory comments.  Because the number of road deaths is fragmented no one cares except the bereaved families.</P>
      <P>We adopt a relaxed attitude to drinking. It is intertwined with our psyche. The glorification of drink is unacceptable.  People write ballads about drink and these songs go to the top of the hit parade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years Governments launched campaigns warning people about the dangers of cigarette smoking, yet there is no similar campaign about the horrors of drink, which are visited on every family.  Because of the lobbying of the drinks industry no Government has the courage to address that problem.  Cigarette advertising is banned from television, and rightly so, but young people are subjected to a <Col N="358" /> continual bombardment of television advertisements for Heineken, Guinness and so on.  Is it any wonder our youth are starting to drink at 12 years of age, as statistics verify, with horrendous social consequences?  How many families are left without food as a result of indulgence in alcohol?  How many children are sexually assaulted by people under the influence of drink?  Toleration and glorification of drink is totally unacceptable and the matter must be addressed by a responsible Government.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies suggested that social life would be adversely affected by the initial measures proposed in the Bill. Social life in towns and villages all over Ireland has been ruined by the public house culture and dependence on drink. It is a national disgrace to see young people sitting on bar stools on Sunday afternoon and summer evenings when the sun is shining.  Probably 90 per cent of social problems emanate from over-indulgence in drink.  Many unfortunate single parents, the fastest growing category, blame their predicament on drink, and they suffer the consequences for many years.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister yielded to the publicans' lobby and the drinks industry.  It is more important to keep people out of the graveyard than to have them sitting on bar stools.  Life is very precious and the Government has a responsibility to ensure people's safety.  More people per head of population are killed in Ireland from drink than in any other country in Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too far wrong.  If we were to implement the laws properly we would need a Garda breathalysing unit outside every public house.  I was told by a publican last week that the local sergeant arrived at 12.10 a.m. the previous morning and demanded a drink.  I will not go into that matter now, but our relaxed attitude to drink is a contributory factor to the <Col N="359" /> unacceptable level of death and mutilation on the roads.</P>
      <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to a stretch of road in my county from Dundalk to the Border, which has the highest ratio of road deaths.  In my previous occupation as a newspaper wholesaler and distributor I delivered newspapers late on Saturday nights and early Sunday mornings in a wide area of Counties Louth, Monaghan and Cavan. On the stretch of road I mentioned I had to stop making deliveries because of the actions of young people.  I saw young men on their way home from discos in local hotels racing one another with no lights on their cars, driving on footpaths and passing motorists on the wrong side.  I often wonder why there are not more deaths on the roads.</P>
      <P>The absence of a highway patrol is a contributory factor in the number of people killed.  On my way back from Belfast last Saturday evening four highway patrols were evident.  We need highway patrols similar to those in France.  In that country courts are set up on the side of the road.  Some years ago a very prominent Irish politician was tried on the side of the road there.  If a person does not pay the fine their car is impounded.  Prevention of death on our roads should be a priority, and I regret the Minister yielded in the face of the lobby by politicians.  However, I welcome the fact that he has graded the penalties.  In Sweden there is an open prison system which has proved very successful as a deterrent to drink driving. An ordinary Joe Soap or a successful businessman is imprisoned if caught driving over the limit.  Unless we introduce real deterrents the number of people who lose their lives on the roads will continue to rise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the changes in the regulations.  My uncle works in this business, and the public house, particularly in rural Ireland, is part of our culture. People go there for a social drink on Saturday and Sunday nights and after Mass on Sunday.  Publicans have a <Col N="360" /> difficult life and are expected to be solicitor, doctor and social worker.  They are always expected to have the answer. Many politicians hold their clinics in public houses.</P>
      <P>The effect of the legislation in rural Ireland last Christmas was enormous.  I agree that those who are over the limit should not drive and if they do, they should be dealt with by the law.  The Minister, having listened to the people, has struck a fair balance.  Those people are law abiding and did not want to risk breaking it last Christmas.  I saw the effect it had on rural towns last Christmas.  When families travelled to town to do their Christmas shopping husbands did not go into the pubs to have a drink because they were afraid that if they took one they would be over the limit and were not prepared to take that risk.  Those are not the people about whom gardaí or the Minister are concerned, they are concerned with those who continually break the law. This Bill will deal with them as effectively as the previous law and will also protect the rural job.  While publicans put on an impressive display when they protested outside the Dáil by high-lighting the weaknesses in the Act, I compliment the Minister, his officials and the Government for the correct decision they made in introducing this Bill to amend that Act.</P>
      <P>Publicans do an injustice to the soft drinks industry in relation to the prices they charge.  They treat non-drinkers like myself unjustly by charging £1.10 or £1.05 for a mineral and in some cases a higher price for a Ballygowan.  I challenge the drinks industry to demonstrate its commitment to the people. The Minister proved that he was willing to change by amending the regulations and I call on the drinks industry, particularly publicans, to reduce the price of mineral waters by 50 per cent.  That would still yield a good profit.  If the drinks industry were to do that, both it and the Government would have made a major gesture.  Deputy Foxe, who is a publican, may not agree with me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>An uncle of mine is in the business but, as a non-drinker, I consider the prices charged for mineral waters in pubs are ridiculous.  I am glad the Minister introduced this change as the rural pub is a way of life.  The advertising campaign during the Christmas season included the phrase &ldquo;use the DART&rdquo;, &ldquo;take a taxi&rdquo;, but there is no DART in Newport, Belmullet or Claremorris and in some rural areas there is no taxi service because some communities are not large enough to justify one. The Minister may not realise it, but he helped to create a new taxi service business in small towns.  I welcome that as it brought people into employment who would otherwise be unemployed.  I am glad the Minister introduced changes to the Act.  They will benefit the rural publicans in particular who provide a valuable service which is probably not appreciated.  They are somewhat like politicians in that no matter what they do they cannot win and yet they have to listen to all sorts of problems.  I am sure Deputy Foxe will confirm that they have to be a social worker, a doctor, a lawyer and be all things to all men, a bit like politicians.  I compliment the Minister for getting it right this time.</P>

      <P>The present profit margins of pubs are at their lowest in approximately 20 years.  While the changes the Minister introduced to the previous Act are welcome, I wish to refer to one aspect.  When this Bill is enacted persons who consume a pint and a glass of beer or a half one and a glass of beer could lose their driving licence for three months, a punitive penalty especially in the case of those who depend on driving for a livelihood.  In some parts of the Continent there are variations in the penalties for drink driving.  People may lose their licences for social activities, like driving during the weekend, but allowed to drive during working hours. Perhaps the Minister will consider introducing such a measure.  I intend to table <Col N="362" /> an amendment on Committee Stage to amend the section which provides that people will lose their licence if their blood alcohol level is between 80 and 100 milligrammes.  I admire the Minister for reviewing the Act so quickly.  It was a courageous move on his part, but I would like him to go one step further and introduce a monetary fine for the offenders to whom I referred.</P>
      <P>I accept the other provisions in the Bill, but judges presiding over drink driving cases should have greater discretion and it should not be compulsory that offenders lose their licences automaticallly. Judges should have greater discreation in this regard.  I am sure the Minister will agree that it is punitive that a person who takes a pint and a glass of beer could lose his or her licence for three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We tend to think that the people most affected by this Bill will be the publicans. They are affected to a degree and even though I am a publican publicans are not the section of the community about whom I am most concerned.  I am most concerned about people, mostly men, in their mid-50s to mid-70s who live a few miles outside a town and have been used to having two or three pints at night.  Those men have been doing that for the past 30 to 40 years.  If they abide by the law, all they can do is stay at home and look at the four walls.  I refer particularly to single people not in the happy state of married bliss.  That section of society is most hit by the new drink-driving laws.  If those men abide by the law and stay at home all night, we will have to increase the number of psychiatric hospitals within two to three years.  Those men go for a jar at night, not because they love alcohol or are alcoholics, for them the pub replaces the old rambling house or the céilís.  They go to town at night to have a chat, exchange stories, lies or truth, but probably mostly lies.  I am most concerned about that section of the community and I ask the Minister to consider them. Those men would stay at home rather than travel to town to only have a pint and a glass of beer and if they go into <Col N="363" /> town they will break the law.  I was serious when I said the psychiatric hospitals will be doing the business in about three years' time.  Will the Minister reconsider the penalties it is proposed to impose on people caught driving with less than 100 milligrammes of alcohol in their blood?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the amendments he made to the Bill, but he stopped short of making a worth-while change.  He failed to introduce a clause whereby a person caught driving with a blood alcohol count of between 81 and 100 milligrammes would be only liable to a fine and not a driving disqualification.  The mandatory loss of a licence for three months on a first conviction for such an offence is unacceptable.  Such a penalty is unnecessarily severe, especially as it applies even where there is not an injured party or victim.</P>
      <P>In addition to losing the licence, the driver will be subject to an even greater follow-on penalty imposed by the insurance industry which could have serious repercussions for the driver for up to five years.  Car insurance premia could be loaded against the victim to the tune of 250 per cent.  This will have disastrous consequences for the unfortunate people caught driving with a blood alcohol level of between 81 and 100 milligrammes.</P>
      <P>I am sure all Members would agree that drink has always been a custom of the human race.  Scripture illustrates that this was evident at the Wedding Feast of Cana in Galilee when Our Lord turned water into wine and the guests were impressed at the miracle.</P>

      <P>Life in rural Ireland is dull and lonely enough without making it worse.  Will bachelor farmers, widowers and others be denied the pleasure <Col N="364" /> of a couple of drinks following a hard day's work in the fields?  The person who goes out with the intention of getting drunk deserves to pay the full penalty, but many people would not pass a breathalyser test after having only one pint and this provision will have serious consequences for them.</P>
      <P>If that section of our community is denied the pleasure of having an alcoholic drink, their health will be affected and the demand for psychiatric services in rural areas will increase.  It may be acceptable to apply this measure in our cities and large towns, but the nearest hackney service to the little humble village of Goleen is 40 miles away and there is no bus service to take people home from the pub at night. Neither does it have a DART or rail or bus service enjoyed by those in the capital city who can travel by public transport from their nearest pub to their homes.  In rural Ireland on a desolate winter's night, with rain and wind howling many people must travel five miles of narrow mountainous boreens from the nearest pub to their homes.  Those people will not risk losing their licences. Rather they will stay at home in solitude, in solitary confinement.  Hospitals and other institutions will overflow with people if this provision is enacted without amendment.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister, who understands the fabric of rural life, to remove the driving disqualification clause for those caught driving with a blood alcohol level of less than 100 milligrammes. He could impose a fine of up to £100, but he should not deprive the unfortunate people who go to the pub for a social drink the right to drive.  I hope the Minister will consider those who live some miles from pubs and have nothing to live for but a drink at the end of the day.  He should let common sense prevail, remove this clause and make the Bill acceptable to all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>In keeping with the views of most Members, I welcome the change in the Bill and support its <Col N="365" /> thrust.  In regard to the driving disqualification penalty proposed for those caught driving with a blood alcohol level of between 81 and 100 milligrammes, I would prefer if, for a first offence, the clause did not apply, but for a second offence it should.  The substitution of this penalty with a fairly hefty fine would make this an excellent Bill. However, the new measures are balanced and most members of the public are grateful to the Minister for amending the Bill.  When the Oireachtas passes legislation it is usually not revised for a few years.  People in general now support the Bill.</P>
      <P>Like other Deputies I met many deputations last Christmas who were concerned about the effects of this Bill.  It made people realise the danger of drinking and driving, but it went a little too far.  I accept it is difficult to get the balance right.  Many people have no other social outlet but to have a couple of drinks in their local pub.  As Deputy Foxe would know, there is no place better for social entertainment than the local pub.  If people could not go to the pub at the weekend, life would be very dull for them.  However, there is another side to that coin.  Our laws must protect the people who use our roads.  Whether we are enacting laws dealing with the problem of drink driving or speeding, we must ensure that unsuspecting members of the public can travel safely on our roads.  We in this House have a responsibility to protect the public from serious injury and death on our roads.  I do not subscribe to the view that a person who drinks four or five pints can drive as safely under certain conditions as someone who drinks one pint.  All the evidence indicates that there is a certain limit above which people become a danger to themselves and others on the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the limit in the Bill of 80 milligrammes is appropriate.  Many people were of the opinion that the limit should not be below 100 milligrammes but this brings us into line with most other EU countries.  The main problem that I <Col N="366" /> became aware of in the past four or five months was the fear that people who had been disqualified from driving would be required to sit their test again. I am happy that will not now be so, except where a person is convicted for dangerous driving resulting in death or serious bodily harm or in the case of hit and run accidents.  No Member of either House of the Oireachtas would say that such people should be required to resit their driving test before having their licences reissued to them.  I compliment the Minister on retaining that provision.</P>
    <P>I believe this amending Bill will be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and it has general support among the public.  I compliment the publicans on the case they put forward. However, I was more concerned about the effects of the new legislation on the public than on the publicans.  I agree there were fewer people in pubs last Christmas but barriers can be broken down when measures have been in place for a long time.  The problem was that the penalties were too severe and that has been accepted on all sides.  That is why I believe there has been a general welcome for this Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to return to the important issue of enforcement.  I do not see the point in having a major Garda campaign to deal with drink driving during the Christmas period if the same is not done for the remaining 11 months of the year. Two nights ago I was driving from Loughrea to my home at a very late hour when I came across a Garda checkpoint.  The gardaí were using a breathalyser to check whether drivers had been drinking.  I was delighted to see that because it should be made known that the gardaí continue to monitor people for drink driving throughout the year.  There should be an evenhanded approach to this.  Where people are obviously not in control of their vehicles, there must be a mechanism in place whereby the gardaí can take them into custody.</P>
    <P>I have been told by some people that the attitude of public representatives to this issue is totally wrong.  A certain <Col N="367" /> section of the population believe that much more draconian measures should be implemented to deal with the problem of drink driving, but if we were to take that argument to its logical conclusion, we would have to have a garda outside every pub in the country to make sure that people getting into cars had not been drinking to excess.</P>
    <P>I believe parents have a great responsibility to ensure that their teenagers are aware of the dangers of drinking and driving.  We can enact legislation in the Dáil which hopefully will be enforced by the appropriate authorities, but unless there is a change of attitude on the part of parents towards drinking, what we do in this House will make little difference.  Parents are the primary educators but many of them seem to think that gardaí, teachers or legislators should deal with this problem.  If we are to achieve our objectives in dealing with this problem, parents will have to take more responsibility for dealing with the consequences of teenage drinking.  I do not wish to appear to be giving a sermon; I have my own responsibilities as a parent but much more will have to be done by parents to address this problem.</P>
    <P>I wanted to make some more points about the Bill but time does not allow for that.  On balance, I believe the Minister has got it right.  I am a little concerned about the issue of disqualification on the first offence and I wanted to put that on the record.</P>
    <P>I should have said at the outset that I wish to share my time with my colleagues, Deputies Boylan and Connor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for sharing his time with me. I compliment the Minister on bringing in these realistic amendments.  I was one of the few Deputies in this House who were strongly opposed to the original legislation which I knew would not have the effect the then Minister was hoping it would have in dealing with the problem of drinking and driving.  It adversely affected rural communities who had no <Col N="368" /> means of transport to get to their local pubs other than their cars or tractors. As a result of the original legislation the social lives of those people were gradually being destroyed.  On their behalf, I thank the Minister for bringing in this common-sense legislation to deal with the problem.  I fully support Deputy Connaughton's views in that regard also.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to examine the problem of speeding and reckless driving. I realise that is a completely different issue but speed has been the cause of a number of accidents recently resulting in the loss of young life.  I do not wish to point a finger at any particular group but we will have to come to grips with this problem.  We have a speed limit in this country &mdash; I believe it is 60 miles per hour &mdash; and it can have the effect of slowing down traffic that is already moving safely.  On the other hand, there are undeveloped stretches of road on which it is only safe to drive slowly.  Time and again I have seen cars overtake other cars on blind corners. Their drivers are hoping that oncoming cars will move out of their way to allow them pass.  Reckless driving causes many accidents.  The Minister has dealt sensibly with the problem of drink driving and 99 per cent of the people support him.  I compliment the Garda Síochána on the way they handled driving offences in the interim period.  Reckless driving must be tackled if we are to save lives.</P>
      <P>I am told the speed limit is 50 m.p.h. but juggernauts having to make time travel at higher speeds.  There is no point in a law that people will inevitably break.  We need to set speed limits at reasonable levels so that people will travel within it safely and I ask the Minister to re-examine this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment of the 1994 Road Traffic Act.  I congratulate the Minister for the courage he has shown in amending the law. While there was a great deal of protest about the draconian measures introduced by the former Minister for the <Col N="369" /> Environment, Deputy Michael Smith there was support for them.  I felt that these measures were draconian and were inappropriate especially in rural Ireland and Deputy Nealon was one of the first Deputies to draw attention to that during the Second Stage debate on the Road Traffic Bill, 1994.</P>
      <P>The Vintners' Federation of Ireland, a major interest group, lobbied me as well as every other Deputy in the House and I agree broadly with two paragraphs of its letter.  I hope I am not boring the House by reading the two relevant paragraphs:</P>
      <P>There remains now just one concern relating to the proposed amendment. That is the mandatory loss of licence for three months on first conviction with blood alcohol levels of 80 mg. or more.  This penalty is unnecessarily severe bearing in mind that it is mandatory and it applies even where there is no injured party or victim.</P>
      <P>In addition to the loss of licence, the driver will be subjected to an even greater follow-on penalty by the insurance industry &mdash; a penalty which will have serious repercussions for up to five years later.  Car insurance will be severely loaded.</P>
      <P>These are reasonable points and the Minister should take them on board. The car insurance industry should not have <i>carte blanche</i> to load insurance premia on car drivers convicted for driving under the influence of drink.  They may have been convicted for having a blood alcohol level between 80 and 100 milligrammes which is a relatively minor offence.  I do not know what the Minister can do about the problem but something can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will digress slightly from the Bill to refer briefly to the roadworks programme initiated under the Structural Fund which will be in operation until 1999.  I am not satisfied that the National Roads Authority now directing funds to our major roads is doing the best job.  We have a little more than 100 kilometres of seriously <Col N="370" /> deficient national roads which contribute to accidents and are the scenes of many of our worst accidents.  Deficient sections of national primary roads are found in every county but worst of all are the roads of County Roscommon. The Minister took the advice of the National Roads Authority in allocating funds for national roads 75 per cent of which comes from European Union funding.  However, the National Roads Authority should be more accessible to public representatives and I hope it will be more open to advice from the Department.  I accept that many people at senior administrative level in the National Roads Authority transferred from the Department but having listened to its representatives at a conference recently in Bray I could not be convinced but that they saw themselves as something of an independent republic in their attitude to questions and towards policy.  That National Roads Authority was conferred with very important powers in relation to policy and funding and this should be looked at.  In principle it sounded good at the time but it certainly is not delivering the goods in its first year of operation and I ask the Minister to look seriously at this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  It is a short but very important Bill.  That so many Deputies spoke bears testimony to the interest this issue has engendered.  In responding to the debate I will direct my remarks to the main issues raised on disqualification and penalties for drink driving offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the remarks of the main Opposition spokespersons, Deputies Dempsey and Quill.  They supported the new measures and indicated they would not table amendments.  They also supported the decision of the Government not to revert to the limit of 100 milligrammes per 100 millilitres of blood. There was consensus that such a move would have had a negative impact on road safety.  The imposition of a single <Col N="371" /> minimum period of disqualification, irrespective of the level of alcohol has been the focus of much criticism during this debate.  I indicated in my opening remarks that I thought it was a valid criticism of the 1994 provision.  My aim in reviewing the Act was to strike the right balance to provide the legislative framework for a safer environment on our roads and accordingly I was pleased to note general all-party agreement for the grading of penalties and the general thrust of the changes I wish to bring about.  The disqualification of drivers with blood alcohol levels in the bottom band was a point of consistent focus. This is an issue I have carefully considered in the review.  The Government is fully satisfied that some period of disqualification from driving should apply to all drink driving offences and that has been the case since the very first drink driving offences were instituted.  It would have been a significant move to alter that principle and it might have given the wrong signal, something that on balance we did not want to do.</P>
    <P>A further issue raised by Deputies during the debate was the cost of motor insurance.  Deputies will be aware that insurance companies determine their costs on the basis of the assessment of risk, and that conviction for any serious road traffic offence will have implications for the motorist's insurance premium. In addition to saving lives one of the key aims of road safety initiatives is to reduce the cost of motor insurance for all road users.  As road deaths and injuries are reduced I will certainly ensure that pressure is put on the insurance industry to replicate that by reducing insurance costs.  The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment has decided to commission a study which will analyse insurance costs and identify the key factors which contribute to high insurance costs.</P>
    <P>In his contribution Deputy O'Hanlon referred to the clause which gives the courts the option not to apply the repeat driving test requirement.  It will be a <Col N="372" /> matter for the courts to apply that clause where they are of the opinion that there is an exceptional or unusual reason a convicted person should not have to pass a driving test.  The repeat driving test requirement will not apply to the generality of cases.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies referred to enforcement and I concur with what they said. I want to create, in consultation with the Minister for Justice, an environment where people do not feel they must be mindful of the drink driving laws at Christmas time only.  It is an ongoing issue.  If we establish laws which have broad public support, as I believe this measure will have, enforcement will be a regular feature and people will come to the conclusion that they cannot drink and drive.  That is the objective of all road safety measures.</P>
    <P>I took careful note of all the issues raised and hope to respond to them in other measures that will come before the House as the scope of this measure is rather narrow.  Generally speaking, Deputies welcomed it.  Deputy McGahon said that we had the highest number of road deaths as a percentage of population of any EU state.  The latest figures I have for the 12 EU countries indicate that Ireland in 1991 ranked ninth in terms of road deaths.  We were not among the eight worst countries but that is not something about which to be complacent. There was consensus on the Bill on all sides which I welcome.  I have tried on the one hand to have a regime which will ensure the greatest degree of safety on our roads and on the other hand one which all citizens will be comfortable with and support.  This should be a fundamental principle of the legislative process.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

The sooner the legislation is put on the Statute Book the fewer anomalies will arise. That point was recognised by the Whips in tabling the Bill for discussion.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a fair one.  That will be recognised by the majority of interests outside the House, particularly the motoring public.  It will result in a system of enforcement and penalties which will be regarded as just and equitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 7 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>The main day-to-day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union.  The Naval Service's fishery protection patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps in the form of aerial maritime patrols.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service currently has a total of seven vessels which are deployed in the most efficient manner on fishery protection duties having regard to current and predicted fishing patterns.</P>
      <P>Aerial maritime surveillance is undertaken by Dauphin helicopters working in conjunction with <i>LE Eithne</i> and the two new CASA aircraft recently acquired with the assistance of funding from the EU.  The aerial patrols are co-ordinated with the operation of the Naval Service vessels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the new arrangements on fishery control measures which will arise in <Col N="375" /> 1996, the workload of the Naval Service is set to increase.  I am very conscious that additional resources, including new ships, would enhance the capability of the Naval Service to patrol our waters effectively and to enforce the new fishery control measures coming into place. I should say that the Spanish fishing effort is to be maintained at its present level &mdash; a maximum of 93 vessels &mdash; and, significantly, will continue to be distributed on the basis of geographic spread. We have managed to secure continuing recognition of and protection for the Irish Box.  Spanish vessels will be totally excluded from the Irish Sea.  Only 40 of the 93 named vessels will be allowed to fish in other parts of the Irish Box.</P>
    <P>It is expected that a new EU fishery surveillance funding package will be available from 1996, the details of which are not yet finalised.  I am hopeful, however, that for the first time such a package will include an element of funding for operational costs for Ireland.  An essential requirement in the new package, as far as Ireland is concerned, will be the provision of additional ships for the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>Discussions have been ongoing between officials from both my Departments to determine how best to meet the enforcement requirements of the new control measures, including the number of additional ships required by the Naval Service, and to prepare a detailed case for funding which I will present to the Commission next month.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Naval Service on its successful patrols and surveillance operations.  It is clear from what the Minister said that additional resources will be required not only to patrol 132,000 square miles of fishery waters and to meet the changes which will be implemented in 1996 but also to deal with drug trafficking.  My party always supported the purchase of additional ships and was involved in the purchase of the two new CASA aircraft. Will the Minister be in a position this year to recruit additional personnel to <Col N="376" /> the Naval Service to enable it to carry out its many tasks more efficiently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of personnel recruited will depend on whether we are successful in securing a commitment for the purchase of another ship.  If we are &mdash; I am strongly pushing for the purchase of another ship - a crew of 60 will be required.  Even if we do not secure this commitment, additional personnel will have to be recruited for the Naval Service this year.  I do not know the exact numbers.  A decision on this matter will have to be made during the early summer as the crew will require training on how to operate a ship.  I hope we will know the position by early autumn and this will determine the exact number of new recruits required.</P>
      <P>The primary role of the Naval Service is fishery protection and we have to be very careful that the funding provided by the EU for this purpose is not seen to be diverted by us into other activities. The Naval Service is involved in drug surveillance in support of the civil power but more needs to be done in this area.  The Minister for Justice proposes to bring forward an initiative in this area and decisions should be made in the not too distant future.  She has been in touch with the Departments of the Marine and Defence to see how best the Naval Service can be integrated with other bodies in the battle against drugs, which I strongly support.</P>

However, if an additional ship is purchased consideration will have to be given to an increased allocation for the Naval Service.</P>

      <Quest>the total number of Spanish fishing boats arrested by the Irish Navy from 1 January 1995, to date; the number of court cases and the total amount collected in fines; and his views on whether the fines are adequate to deter the continued illegal fishing by Spanish boats.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Coveney) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Coveney)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the 250 vessels boarded since 1 January a total of 27 have been detained in Irish waters.  Twelve of these were Spanish registered vessels and eight of the ten UK registered vessels and three of the Irish registered vessels were of Spanish origin.  In other words, 23 of the 27 vessels were either Spanish registered or Spanish owned.  Prosecutions have been initiated in respect of 26 of the boats detained and seven cases have been dealt with so far by the courts.  The total fines imposed in the seven cases heard so far amount to <Col N="378" /> £220,500.  The gear and catch were automatically forfeited as well, with provision in certain circumstances for these to be bought back.</P>
      <P>Our penalties are the highest in Europe and specifically designed to deter illegal fishing and reflect Ireland's determination to ensure that all vessels fishing in Irish waters comply with fishing regulations.  In addition to the increased financial deterrents, the Irish fisheries surveillance capability has been significantly enhanced with the coming into service of the two new Casa aircraft operated by the Air Corps. Ironically, those were built by the Spanish. The aerial surveillance has already substantially contributed to more focused and effective deployment of the Naval Service vessels in fisheries surveillance at sea.  I look forward to even further enhancement of our control and enforcement capability through the additional financial resources for Ireland agreed at the Fisheries Council last December and currently being negotiated with Brussels.</P>
      <P>Ireland has been and will remain at the forefront in the EU in seeking tighter control and enforcement in the management and conservation of fish stocks.  Policy will continue to be firmly geared to cracking down on illegal fishing activity irrespective of the nationality of those involved.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> It is obvious from the Minister's reply that the majority of the boats detained have a Spanish involvement.  He stated that 23 are either Spanish owned or have a flag of convenience from Spain.  There is widespread anger among Irish fishermen and workers at the blatant manner in which the Spanish boats are flouting the law and stealing fish stocks.  Will the Minister accept that these illegal operators do not regard the fines imposed by Irish courts as significant?  There is a view among Irish fishermen that these illegal operators are treating such fines as laughable.  Will the Minister consider reviewing the fines?  While he has stated <Col N="379" /> they are the highest in Europe, the point made by Deputy Deasy is relevant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not open to me to comment on judicial decisions in relation to individual cases.  Obviously, there are differences in the scale of offences.  The Naval Service is correctly detaining people for breaches of the law but the degree of seriousness is not the same in every case.  There is a big difference between somebody who has failed to fill in a log book and somebody who is loaded with illegal fish.  One has to leave to the discretion of judges the application of the law relative to the seriousness of the crime.  I have not carried out an analysis of whether one could conclude that the courts are being too lenient but I undertake to carry out such an analysis.  I would not be prepared to stand up in the House and condemn the Judiciary without knowing the <Col N="380" /> facts.  Clearly the severity of the fine has to relate to the severity of the crime.</P>
      <P>We do have heavy penalties and one ought not to ignore the part of my reply which related to the seizure of gear and so on because that is often worth more than the fine.  We are determined to put a stop to it.  We have made significant progress this year.  The Naval Service has been efficient following a slow start due to extremely bad weather in the earlier part of the year.  The level of detentions is high.</P>
      <P>We need to tighten up on other issues.  It has been said to me that if a number of trawlers are fishing in an area and one is arrested the necessity for the Naval Service to escort them to port &mdash; which may be 150 miles away &mdash; sends out a message to the remaining trawlers that there is no surveillance in that area.  There is a potential danger in that.  I want to examine the law on that matter.  Is it essential for the Naval Service to sail back to Galway Bay from 200 miles west?  It takes a long time and the offending boat will tend to slow down deliberately.  I have not yet got an answer to that question but I intend to look into it.</P>

Because there are so many types of degrees of offence I do <Col N="381" /> not know whether it would work.  I am not sure what the Deputy means by following Canada's example.

      <Quest>his views on the measures proposed by the EU Commission for the partial financing of national early retirement schemes for fishermen, individual compensatory payments to fishermen, aid for the establishment of a bad weather unemployment fund and a mechanism for the financial compensation of fishermen; if he will support these measures; and the likely timespan for implementation of these measures.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9151/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Commission's proposal for additional measures to help fishermen adjust to the difficult structural changes currently underway in the European fishing industry.  I indicated my support in principle for such measures at the Fisheries Council last month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rationale for such measures is clear.  It must be acknowledged that the overall EU policy objective of bringing fishing effort into balance with available stocks, coupled with the very difficult market situation, requires a specific response to the social and economic consequences for fishing communities of implementing structural change.  This has been recognised by a number of member states, including Ireland, and by the Commission.  The proposal now under consideration is a positive move in the right direction.  It includes provision for an early retirement scheme for fishermen, bad weather funding and <Col N="383" /> compensation for serious market fluctuations.</P>
    <P>I am concerned however that at this stage there is no provision for additional EU funding to cover the cost of such schemes.  The funds currently available to us under the fisheries operational programme are fully committed to meeting the investment needs of the fleet and the aquaculture and processing sector.  If anything those funds are over-stretched. I have strongly signalled this concern at Council and intend to raise it with Commissioner Bonino when I meet her to review fisheries matters generally at the end of the month.</P>
    <P>I would be reluctant at this stage to predict when these measures are likely to be agreed by Council.  It has to be said that several member states are opposed in principle to the introduction of any such measures for the fishing industry.  Our approach will continue to be positive and supportive with a view to moving ahead with an acceptable package at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>Fishing is hazardous for the personnel involved and I am glad that the Minister will support the Commission's proposed measures to partially finance retirement schemes, bad weather compensation payments and compensation for serious market fluctuations.  However, I am disappointed that there is no provision for additional EU funding to cover the cost of such schemes.  Could the Minister take any action, in conjunction with the Department of Social Welfare, to ease the pressures on the fishing community which is suffering great hardship because of changes in the social welfare code consequent on court decisions and which was aggravated by the particularly bad weather during the winter and early spring?  In the light of the measures that will be necessary to conserve and again grow stocks, the age of our fishing fleet, the age profile of the people involved in fishing and the necessity for early retirement because of the type of work, can anything be done <Col N="384" /> to case some of the pressures between now and the resolution of these matters in the context of EU negotiations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the lack of progress in the EU.  The ideas are aspirational but the money to support them is not forthcoming.  There is opposition to the provision of funding from the countries one would expect to object, the main paymasters which include the British and the Germans. These proposals are not much good without funding because we would have to take money from other areas of fisheries to implement them.</P>
      <P>On the question of bad weather, we experienced a bad start to the year, but since early to mid-March there has been unparalleled good weather and, on balance, the situation is not as critical as it was in 1994 when my predecessor introduced a compensation package.  We do not have it in mind, nor do we have the resources to come up with a compensatory package for 1995.</P>
      <P>I am not sufficiently informed on the social welfare issues, but I will draw them to the attention of the Minister for Social Welfare, although I cannot promise anything.</P>

      <P>Ireland does not manufacture conventional or other weapons.  When required by the Defence Forces such equipment has to be purchased from sources abroad.  Contracts are awarded on the basis of competitive tendering.  It is not the practice, for security reasons, to release the names of companies with which the Department has placed contracts for defensive equipment.  A small quantity of anti-personnel mines, most of which were of a non-explosive type, was acquired by the Department of Defence once in the past five years.  Their availability to the Defence Forces for training and familiarisation is essential in the context of overseas duties with the United Nations where military personnel may be called upon to locate and render harmless anti-personnel or other types of mines.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the replies to parliamentary questions on 9 and 10 May 1995 by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs in which he outlined the action being taken at international level in relation to anti-personnel landmines.</P>

      <P>I am heartened by the Minister's reply and glad to hear that the only reason landmines were purchased by the Irish Government was for familiarisation in relation to overseas work we undertake.  I understand that the Minister cannot release the names of companies for security reasons.  However, I urge him in his capacity as Minister for Defence, to ensure that Ireland does not contribute to companies that manufacture landmines because, whatever glossy name is put on them, they have the most long lasting mutilating effects in countries where there has been conflict.  The Pax Christi figures must have horrified everyone.</P>

It would, therefore, be inconsistent if we supported their use in any way.  There is a potential difficulty in that international or multinationals supplying arms might, conceivably, have a subsidiary manufacturing landmines, of which we would be unaware.

Will the Minister work further on amending the inhumane weapons convention so that it covers internal wars as, at the moment, it is only designed to cover wars between countries? I understand that 80 per cent of landmine injuries take place in internal wars such as in Cambodia.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive list of events has been drawn up by the Naval Service to commemorate its 50th anniversary in 1996.  The list includes cultural, social, liturgical and sporting events.  The principal event of the year will be a fleet review, to include naval ships from other countries, with an associated programme of events planned for 12 to 14 July 1996 in Cork Harbour, the Naval base and Cork city.</P>
      <P>As part of the 1996 celebrations, it is planned to hold a reunion of ex-members of the Naval Service.  In addition, the Naval Service will present each 1946 veteran with a bronze commemorative medallion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the arrangements which the Naval Service is making to ensure the maximum participation in commemorating the 50th anniversary of its foundation.  There will be other opportunities to laud but in the question I specifically ask if either the Minister or the Department have any plans to commemorate the anniversary. The Minister should not rely solely on the Naval Service to make plans.  Both <Col N="388" /> he and the Department have a wider responsibility and should find some way of demonstrating how the country and the national interest has been served by the Naval Service.  They should take the initiative given that the Naval Service has been a source of pride for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Naval Service comes under the aegis of my Department. I have held discussions with Commander Kavanagh and the week before last I launched in Cork the programme for 1996.  The Department is involved.  It took the initiative by arranging for the striking of a bronze commemorative medallion which will be presented to each 1946 veteran.  It may take other initiatives.</P>

      <P>I welcome the decision to strike a medal to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the Naval Service.  We are fortunate to have a former member of the Naval Service among us in the Dáil.  Will every person who has served in the Naval Service qualify to receive the medallion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>

      <P>As a former member of the Naval Service, I welcome the fact that celebrations will be held in the Cork Harbour area next year.  The Minister has stated that it is the intention to present a medal to each person who entered the service in 1946.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulvihill</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask him to present a medal to all former members of the service, including myself.  When the Garda Síochána commemorated its 50th anniversary all former members of the force received a medal.  It is only fitting that all former members of the Naval Service should receive a medal, especially the <Col N="389" /> relatives of those who lost their lives in the performance of their duties.  It is not all that long ago when a number of people lost their lives trying to rescue seamen off a trawler in Bantry Bay. They should also be remembered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been decided that we should focus on those who were in the service at the beginning.  That is fitting but it in no way undermines our appreciation of the work of the Naval Service, particularly those who gave their lives.  The medal will be presented to the 1946 veterans.  I am afraid I cannot go any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a broad measure of agreement across all parties in the House that the Minister should take the extra step.  It is right that he should signal our appreciation and find a way as happened in the case of other forces of commemorating those who lost their lives as well as the living. Many people pass on without having received recognition.  It would be much better to provide recognition while people are still living.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself in relation to the procedures followed regarding the refusal to approve an Army disability pension for a person (details supplied) in County Waterford; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9025/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>A disability pension may be granted under the Army pensions Acts to a former member of the Permanent Defence Force in respect of permanent disablement due to (a) a wound or injury attributable to service in the Defence Forces; (b) a disease, but only if attributable to or aggravated by service with a United Nations force.  The <Col N="390" /> Acts prescribe that application for a disability pension must be made within a statutory time limit of 12 months after discharge or retirement in wound or injury cases and eight years in cases of disease.</P>
      <P>The person in question was discharged from the Defence Forces at his own request in June 1979.  He submitted an application for a disability &mdash; disease &mdash; pension in respect of his medical condition in June 1990, when the eight year statutory time limit had expired.</P>
      <P>As the period for the making of an application is strictly governed by statute it is regretted that the application from the person concerned for a disability pension could not be accepted and that there is no provision to extend the time limit for the making of such applications in individual cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have heard it so often, I could nearly recite the Minister's reply by heart.  The problem is that a figure of eight years is stipulated. On 3 May I tabled a question for written reply, Question No. 166, in which I asked if people discharged before 1992 were aware of this stipulation.  In his reply the Minister did not address the question.  He stated that it has been established practice for many years to provide all Defence Forces personnel on their discharge or retirement with information setting out their possible entitlements under the Army pension Acts and emphasising the statutory time limits for submission of completed applications.  This information is included with each individual's discharge documents.  All this man received in the post was his Army discharge book which contains details of length of service, conduct while in the Army, courses attended and so on.  He received no notification that a figure of eight years was stipulated.  Written documentation to this effect can be supplied, if necessary.  Recently I asked someone who was discharged in 1988 or 1989 if he was aware of this stipulation but he had no knowledge of it.  The person concerned developed symptoms in <Col N="391" /> 1984 and had he known that a figure of eight years was stipulated he would have applied in time.  In those circumstances it is only fair that his case should be reconsidered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy saying that the Defence Forces were obliged to inform him and did not or is he saying that they were not obliged to do so but in all fairness should have done so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure whether they are obliged to do so but in all fairness they should bring it to the attention of the people concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am statutorily bound by the regulation and it is not open to me to change it.  If there is a requirement that the Defence Forces inform people about this matter and they failed to do so, I will take up the matter, but if there is no such requirement my intervention could open the floodgates.  I will make inquiries in the matter and come back to the Deputy on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe it would open the floodgates.  The individual concerned left the Army in June 1979 and the problem arose five years later, in 1984.  That can be medically documented.  It would not open the way for a flood of cases because the disease in this case was contracted within the eight-year period.  I would appreciate if the Minister would look into the matter.</P>

      <P>Since 1986, a National Day of Commemoration has been held each year in Dublin.  The National Day of Commemoration, organised by the Department of the Taoiseach, takes place in July and is held to honour all Irish men and women, including those in the Merchant Navy, who died in past wars or on service with the United Nations.  On the Day of Commemoration, a ceremony is held comprising an ecumenical service of prayer by religious leaders and a wreath laying ceremony with appropriate military ceremonial at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham. This years' National Day of Commemoration will take place on Sunday, 9 July 1995.</P>
      <P>On Friday, 28 April 1995 the Taoiseach hosted a ceremony to commemorate all those people, North and South, who lost their lives in the second World War and the victims of the Holocaust and to mark the liberation of the concentration camps and the end of the war.  This ceremony took place in the Irish War Memorial Park in Islandbridge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The agenda for the meeting referred to was mainly concerned with the Western European Union's preparations for its input to the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference of the European Union and the future role the Western European Union might expect to play.</P>
      <P>In this connection the principal issues were a draft declaration on operational development, which in the main is a matter for full members of the Western European Union, and a common reflection of the new European security conditions.</P>
      <P>The latter, which is an interim document, reflects points of view on a range of issues in the European security context and covers matters in which Ireland would have an interest, for example, emphasis on a broad concept of security, need to address risks such as the proliferation of weapons, drug problems, etc.  This common reflection will be further developed.  As Ireland has observer status only at the Western European Union, the deliberations of the meeting will have no direct impact on the Department of Defence.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  My question relates to items for discussion at the meeting and I am glad he saw fit to answer it now that the meeting is over.  While accepting that Ireland has purely observer status at the Western European Union, is the Minister concerned that the Western European Union appears to be moving in the direction of interfering in what are normally considered domestic problems, such as crime, drug abuse, etc.?  Is there any method by which we can raise this matter and voice our concerns without infringing our observer status given that we do not want to be involved in discussions? Will positive proposals be put <Col N="397" /> forward in that regard at the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference of the European Union?  Will we be able to say then with what we agree or how far advanced are we along that road?  Is the Minister concerned that the Western European Union appears to be interfering in our national security while prior to this it concentrated on its concerns, which were not Ireland's?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised issues which, as the Ceann Comhairle pointed out, do not fall within my remit. I will give the Deputy background information to the meeting.  We attended it purely as observers.  The observer nations were Ireland, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Austria.  Apart from the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs who attended the meeting, all the countries were asked to send Defence Ministers to the meeting and the observer countries I named did so.  I asked my Minister of State to attend it to avoid laying undue emphasis on the defence side because I know it is a delicate matter.  We are pleased that it was possible to raise transnational subjects at it, such as the drugs problem.  That gives us a valid reason for our observations at it and there are other issues with which we would not be involved to the same extent.  In addition to the principal members of the Western European Union of which the Deputy is aware and the observers I named there is a group of associate partners which comprise most East European countries, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.  Their status is not dissimilar from ours.  The Western European Union is a useful forum and it is no longer merely an exclusive military club. It would be unwise not to take up our position as observers and attend its meeting.  As this issue and the wider ones with which I am not directly involved will clearly arise during our <Col N="398" /> Presidency, we must be well aware of what is happening and, therefore, we must be at the table as observers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 26 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>There are in excess of 900 harbours, piers and landing places along the Irish coast and on offshore islands.  A small number of these are privately owned, six are owned by Department of the Marine, one by Iarnród Éireann, 24 by boards of harbour commissioners and the vast majority by local authorities. The primary responsibility for development and provision of facilities at these locations rests with the owners.  The funding of such developments is a commercial matter for the owners in each case.  Limited funding is provided by the Department of the Marine under specific aid schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department's responsibilities in relation to the development and provision of pier facilities around the coast and on the offshore islands fall into the following categories: (a) grants-in-aid are provided to the boards of commissioners of harbour authorities set up under the Harbours Act, 1946, in respect of certain harbour infrastructural development works; (b) the Department directly controls and operates Dún Laoghaire harbour; (c) the Department directly controls and operates fishery harbour centres at Howth, Dunmore East, Castletownbere, Ros a' Mhíl and Killybegs under the Fishery Harbour Centre Acts of 1968 and 1980; (d) the Department directly operates and maintains a number of small piers under the <Col N="400" /> Harbours Act, 1902, for example, North Harbour on Oileán Cléire, Liscannor in County Clare and Cleggan in County Galway.  The Department has maintenance responsibility for ex-congested district board piers such as Dooagh in County Mayo and Magheragallan in County Donegal and (e) grants-in-aid are provided to maritime local authorities for certain fishery harbour development works at their harbours.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing the funding for works in category (e), the Department of the Marine provides a design and construction service by contract or by direct labour for some of the grant-aided works.  Similar agency services are provided to the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht for harbour works on islands and on the mainland in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the maintenance of Kilmurvey Pier lies with Galway County Council and its development may be eligible for funding from the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht since it is located within the Gaeltacht.  My Department has been asked to update the costs of doing certain development works to this pier and will report this to the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I have no general function in relation to maintenance of harbours, quays or slipways.  That is the responsibility of individual owners.  Equally I have no function in relation to provision or maintenance of facilities for access to offshore islands whether those facilities are on the islands themselves or on the mainland.  I have no direct function in relation to the workings of the Interdepartmental Committee on Island Development, although my Department is, of course, represented on the committee.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that my colleague, Deputy Carey, has been appointed Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, with special responsibility for co-ordinating the Government's commitment to western development and rural renewal and for development and improvement of living conditions on our offshore islands.  In <Col N="401" /> that capacity Deputy Carey chairs the interdepartmental islands committee.</P>
    <P>One of the issues that has arisen in the interdepartmental committee is the question of preferential treatment of Gaeltacht islands when compared with non-Gaeltacht ones.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that as a maritime nation with fishing and tourism potential many of our piers and ports are in a dilapidated condition?  Will he consider introducing a coherent national strategy to see to what extent we could, on a phased basis, develop these resources in conjunction with local authorities and with owners? Perhaps grant-aid could be given to priority cases.  The country would benefit greatly as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had the resources, nothing would give me more pleasure than to do what the Deputy suggests.  A large number of harbours, piers and landing places need to be developed. We provide grant-in-aid to maritime local authorities for certain fishery harbour development works and, from visiting some of our harbours, I am aware of the great potential that exists for what the Deputy suggested.  I could not, however, commit myself to a national strategy for carrying out the development suggested by the Deputy within a reasonable timescale, and some areas need priority.  I was impressed with the arguments put forward in Duncannon yesterday and I hope to develop other similar ports during my time as Minister. Relatively small amounts of money spent in such a manner would produce a good local response and assist local development and employment.  I would do what the Deputy suggested if I could obtain the necessary resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware that resources are limited and the Opposition do not wish to present a picture that such development could be achieved at one time.  From a cursory glance at the amount of available resources, it is obvious that some areas <Col N="402" /> must be given priority, local authorities may need to be encouraged to build up resources and involve local communities. If a community is not prepared to support a local initiative, it will not receive priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>In one case a local authority is prepared to allocate 25 per cent and the local harbour board another 25 per cent of the cost of developing the harbour in their area.  It would be worth sending out a message that the Government is more inclined to support those who support themselves. That would also help establish which areas should be given priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister the desire or power to ensure that harbours are maintained in a safe and presentable condition?  Does he agree that the Dublin Port authority has dragged its heels in terms of the harbours at Balbriggan and Skerries?  Does he propose requiring an owner to hand over a harbour to a local authority in a safe, presentable and working condition?  A hand-over is contemplated for Balbriggan and Skerries? &ldquo;Safe&rdquo; could mean simply boarding up the harbour and allowing it go out of use, but that would not mean the harbour would be in a presentable condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority of ports are not in the ownership of the Department of the Marine or under the control of harbour boards.  In the main, they are owned by local authorities.  Earlier today the Minister of State and I announced an EU funded programme of £30 million, including £1.5 million for environmental improvement works, for the Dublin Port area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of some <Col N="403" /> quirk of history the Dublin port authority operates the harbours at Balbriggan and Skerries but have chosen to ignore them.  It has also forgotten to inform the Minister of that position.  It is Dublin Port, not the local authority, who is responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the harbours to which the Deputy referred part of the area over which the Dublin port authority has jurisdiction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, those harbours come under the management and ownership of Dublin Port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>In that event it could use some of the EU funding to which I referred to develop those harbours.  I will take up the matter with the Dublin port authority and ask the Minister of State to do likewise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Will the Minister hold discussions with the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Enterprise and Employment and the Taoiseach regarding Leader, county enterprise board and partnership programmes?  Those organisations are in the business of creating jobs, but they refused funding for harbour development and suggested that applicants contact the Departments of the Marine or the Environment.  There is far too much bureaucratic nonsense attached to those organisations.  If they were set up to help create jobs they should be in a position to make funds available for the development of small harbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome funding for harbour development works from any State agency.  The Department of the Marine will assist the development of small harbours if the local authority provides equal funding and the harbour is prioritised.  As funds are limited only a few harbours can be developed each year.  If the Deputy has a particular harbour in mind he should give me the details and I will consider <Col N="404" /> the application, but I cannot make any promise as to the likely outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>As other Departments appear to have substantial funding for job creation projects, I am sure the Minister could convince them that onshore and offshore jobs could be created at low cost, perhaps lower than is the case in many industries.  I am aware of the Minister's and the Minister of State's great love of the sea.  The Minister might be able to draw down additional funds if he considered creating more onshore jobs.  As he agreed to support the development of Duncannon port, he could use it as an example for drawing down additional funds for onshore jobs rather than for the sole development of ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to my visit to Duncannon port, a project with which I was very impressed.  For fear of being accused of favouritism.  I did not select a port in my constituency.  As my predecessor, Deputy Andrews, was a heavy-weight I was genuinely surprised he was not able to convince the then Minister for Finance of the importance of the point raised by Deputy Byrne.  I am also having difficulty in that regard.  The Department of the Marine is not given the priority it deserves in terms of its potential to create jobs at relatively low cost and other local economic activity.  I intend to ensure it is given priority.  We have been given some additional resources this year but the Department is underfunded generally and I welcome the Deputy's support in that.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 126 together.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Marine is currently engaged in a consultative process with various representative organisations engaged in canoeing and windsurfing on a range of measures to improve the safety of their activities. When this process is completed it is the intention to publish comprehensive safety guidelines.  In addition, I expect to be in a position to issue, within a matter of weeks, new safety leaflets for sea canoeists and windsurfers, as part of the Department's safety awareness campaign.</P>
      <P>These safety leaflets will include advice that sea canoeists and windsurfers should put reflective tape on their craft and on their protective clothing. This would greatly assist their detection by the marine rescue services in the event of an emergency.</P>
      <P>There is no legislative basis available to me at present to oblige manufacturers of water sportswear to incorporate reflective strips in their products. Even if such legislation were in place in Ireland, its impact would be almost negligible, as most of the equipment is manufactured in the UK and elsewhere abroad.  I understand that the UK authorities have no plans to introduce such requirements for manufacturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also understand that such reflective material is not generally a standard feature of wet suits and safety equipment. The bringing in of mandatory regulations in this regard would raise a whole range of practical difficulties, not <Col N="406" /> least the problems of enforcement, having regard, in particular, to the large volume of existing equipment already in use.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, our aim is to develop new guidelines in this whole area and working with the various representative organisations to increase safety awareness and especially to promote the wearing of reflective strips.</P>
    <P>I thank the two Deputies for putting down these questions.  They have been in the forefront of bringing these matters to my attention as they live in constituencies where serious accidents have occurred in recent months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response.  I am reminded of the time I put down a parliamentary question to the Minister for the Environment. I had a constituent who believed that if all bikes manufactured in the country had mandatory back and front lights, it would possibly reduce many of the deaths on our roads. However, as in this case, there are a number of difficult avenues to go down before that could ever be achieved.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister also for meeting representatives of the Windsurfing Association and the partner of the person who tragically lost his life in the recent windsurfing accident.  I asked the Minister this question when we met, but is there anything more he can do in putting an onus on retailers of canoes and windsurfing boards?  Will he insist that the sellers of these goods, which are manufactured mainly outside of this country, be required to provide a course in basic windsurfing and canoeing as part of an overall package?  What other action can the Department take in regard to education and liaison with clubs and local authorities in whose jurisdictions much of our coastline is located?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy said, we had an informative meeting with representatives of the Windsurfing Association and I know the Deputy is an expert in that field.  My Department will <Col N="407" /> place most of its emphasis on producing an informative safety leaflet which will be distributed not only to clubs and organisations but also to the main stores that sell this equipment so that they might be persuaded to include a copy of the leaflet when selling such equipment. The leaflet will obtain advice on the necessity to take lessons before getting involved in what are potentially dangerous activities for people who have no experience of them.  I am not very familiar with canoeing but windsurfers, by their very nature, are individualistic. Many of them are not members of clubs; they simply head off to the nearest beach whenever they choose.  It is difficult to deal with that in safety terms but if we can produce this leaflet and distribute it widely, that would be a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>Another point that arose at the recent meeting was whether we could persuade local authorities to place notices in areas known to have dangerous tidal conditions, etc.  That is a wider question and local authorities can experience difficulty in this regard if they place notices only in areas where drownings have occurred.  They can be reluctant to become involved in identifying dangerous areas.  However, that is an issue for another day.  My main objective is to produce this leaflet as soon as possible because the season is already upon us. We will review the position at the end of the season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of our meeting the Minister's officials will contact the Windsurfing Association to assist his Department in putting together the information leaflet.  The Minister should, include in the leaflet useful telephone numbers, particularly the numbers of lifeboat stations in various localities.  In the recent unfortunate incident in County Louth, a person drowned while windsurfing.  His friends were unaware that one of the best lifeboat stations in the country, Clogherhead, was located nearby.  Had they known that, the man would have been <Col N="408" /> saved within five minutes but he lost his life because they were not aware of it.</P>

He will get a copy of the leaflet and send it to my Department.  We can then look at it and see whether we should include any other relevant points in the leaflet we intend to produce.  My main concern is that we are approaching the June bank holiday weekend and I do not know whether the leaflet will be ready in time having regard to the level of consultation required.  I regret we did not start this a month earlier but I am moving as quickly as I can in this regard.</P>

      <P>My question is not confined to windsurfers and canoeists but concerns leisure sports at sea in general, whether it be canoeing, surf boarding, yachting, speed boating, etc.  The Minister should introduce statutory regulations covering this area because until that is done, we will not see the type of action required.  The two young canoeists who were drowned in Dunmore East some months ago would have been saved if they had fluorescent markings on their wetsuits.  That is the view of the lifeboat service in the area.  Prior to that incident, the lifeboat crew had rescued a person involved in a boating accident who has fluorescent markings on his wetsuit.  They had no problem in identifying him.  These fluorescent markings could mean the difference between life and death and the requirement for their use should be put on a statutory basis. Lives are being lost because of this and people must be protected against themselves. The Minister is a yachtsman and he knows the dangers involved in these activities.</P>

      <P>The majority of people involved in sailing are members of clubs affiliated to the Irish Sailing Association. They have strict safety codes.  A person cannot go offshore unless the boat contains all the necessary safety equipment and checks are made before races are held.  I think self-regulation is still the best way and I am not convinced of the merits of a statutory legal framework for people's leisure.</P>
      <P>I understand the point the Deputy is making but it is better to educate people that their own clubs and organisations should accept greater responsibility for training and proving a safety and rescue service.  Too often we jump to the conclusion that we must make more laws to deal with situations but then we cannot implement them and make a fool of ourselves. Bringing in statutory provisions for people's leisure would be the last resort.</P>

In areas around the country where water sports and activities take place we have very large warning signs and the measures the Deputy mentioned are included on it.  I cannot recall if we had notices in the newspapers but I will check that for the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I see too many drownings in my area and I too wish to refer to the drownings that Deputy Deasy mentioned.  Does the Minister accept that inexperienced people who go to sea have no fear of the water because quite possibly they have never been to sea before?  I am inclined to agree with Deputy Deasy that we must take a stronger line.  Mr. John Walsh, the coxswain of the Dunmore East lifeboat says it should be obligatory to have fluorescent strips and had that been the case in the instance mentioned by Deputy Deasy the people would have been saved.</P>

      <P>In conjunction with his deliberations on what his Department can do, will the Minister liaise with those involved in the day-to-day search and rescue service?  The reason I tabled a question asking for regulations on fluorescent strips on these garments is that people who are involved in the day-to-day-rescue service have requested it. Similarly if the person involved in the Louth tragedy had been wearing fluorescent strips it is possible that person would have been saved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I accept what Deputy Deasy said about yachts and other craft there is some standard rescue equipment on them such as radios and so on.  Even someone in a canoe is more protected <Col N="411" /> than a person who is wind surfing.  Generally the people who take up wind surfing have never been on the water before.</P>

      <P>I accept that.  I am as interested as anybody, and possibly more so, in people using those strips. We are arguing only about the means of achieving that.  I am reluctant to enforce it by legislation if I can do it some other way.  Deputy Deasy says it is wishful thinking but I hope through a continual education process we will improve the position.  With or without regulations, we will unfortunately have accidents.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Ballyjamesduff (Cavan) Sewerage Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me raise this issue and I am glad that the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, who is familiar with County Cavan is here to respond.</P>
      <P>The environment action programme published in 1990 stated that the Department of the Environment had asked Cavan County Council to submit plans as a matter of urgency to upgrade the sewerage treatment works at Ballyjamesduff. Ballyjamesduff is situated on the Mountnugent river, a very important tributary of Lough Sheelin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of a modern and efficient sewerage system for Ballyjamesduff is essential.  Since the publication of the environment action programme in 1990, the various stages of planning for this project have been completed and I understand that the contract documents are with the Department for approval.  In his reply to a parliamentary question recently, the <Col N="501" /> Minister indicated that the Ballyjamesduff sewerage scheme was included in the Lough Ree catchment protection scheme, which has been submitted to the European Commission for assistance under the Cohesion Fund.</P>
    <P>The reason I raise this matter on the adjournment is to indicate the urgency attached to having a new scheme put in place at the earliest possible date.  The present treatment works are totally inadequate for the town and unfortunately the lack of a proper treatment plant is a contributory factor to damaging the water quality in Lough Sheelin. It is reckoned that the present inadequate scheme contributes between 11 and 40 per cent of the total phosphorous load in the lake.  Lough Sheelin was one of Europe's premier brown trout fishing lakes and is one of our major natural resources for angling.  It has had unfortunately its ups and downs and I take this opportunity to compliment the many individuals, organisations and public agencies who have contributed and are still contributing very significantly to its restoration on the success they have had in creating an awareness among the people of the need to conserve major waterways such as Lough Sheelin.</P>
    <P>The provision of a new sewage treatment scheme in Ballyjamesduff is totally in keeping with the philosophy of preserving and nurturing our environment to the highest possible standard.  I am sure the Minister will have to determine the priorities for the commencement of schemes and expenditure when the Cohesion Fund applications are approved by the European Commission. I appeal to the Minister on behalf of the people of Ballyjamesduff, of County Cavan and the adjoining counties and everyone at home and abroad who wants to see Lough Sheelin in a permanent state of good health.  This would be a major infrastructural asset to Ballyjamesduff, to that area of south Cavan and to the tourism and angling industries. I hope the Minister will indicate that this scheme is a priority one and <Col N="502" /> that work will commence before the end of 1995.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Smith for raising this matter.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the need to extend and improve the existing sewerage system in Ballyjamesduff which discharges ultimately to Lough Sheelin and to the wider Lough Ree catchment.  The sensitivity of Lough Sheelin in environmental pollution terms is well recognised. The Environmental Protection Agency examined the position and recently conveyed to the Minister their advice that the Ballyjamesduff scheme should be urgently implemented.  We accept that advice.</P>
      <P>In recognition of this, Lough Ree has recently been designated a sensitive area by national regulations made in December 1994 which implement the EU Urban Waste Water Treatment directive.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, considerable progress has been made in recent years with the provision of water and sewerage infrastructure in County Cavan. This scheme has been included in an application to the EU Commission for finance under the Cohesion Fund in respect of the Lough Ree catchment protection scheme.  A decision on this application should be available shortly.</P>
      <P>The present scheme caters for a population of about 1,500 persons and suffers from overloading of the treatment works and consequent pollution of the Pound Stream.  It is proposed to extend and improve the system to cater for an estimated population of 2,200 persons. A new treatment works incorporating phosphate removal, extended aeration, tertiary treatment in upward flow clarifiers and sludge treatment is proposed. Extensive refurbishment and extension of both the surface and foul sewerage systems will also be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of issues, however, remain to be resolved before full approval can be granted to the contract documents which are under examination in my <Col N="503" /> Department.  We are awaiting the submission of a certificate of completion of planning from the county council.  This will not be possible until the relevant land acquisitions are finalised.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these matters can be resolved so that we may be in a position to advance the project later this year.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Dublin Inner City Educational Needs.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter on the day of my election in 1982 in the arrangements the then leader of Fianna Fáil, Mr. Haughey, made with me in exchange for support in forming a Government.  I am sure most Members remember that occasion.  It was such an essential demand that I included it in response to those who elected me and because the area had been neglected for so long.  I refer to the need for a second level community college in the north inner city.</P>
      <P>Since 1982 plans have been drawn up for a community college.  They were revised on several occasions but have remained on the shelf.  No Minister saw fit to approve the plan.  The reason approval has not been given is that the site for the college, which Dublin Corporation made available, is located in the poorest urban area in the State, an area bedevilled by drug abuse, high unemployment and other social problems. The only way children in that area will break the spiral of poverty is through education.</P>
      <P>Some years ago a research consultant, Kieran McKeown, was commissioned by the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul to report on the area.  He stated:</P>
      <P>...44 per cent of the population of the north inner city of Dublin left school before the age of 15.  This is significantly higher than the 27 per cent and the 29 per cent who left school before the age of 15 in the Greater Dublin Area and Ireland in that year respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="504" /> He also pointed out that the level of non-attendance is higher in the north inner city than in Dublin city and gave the scandalous statistics that a mere 1 per cent of children living in the Dublin 1 postal district go onto third level education.</P>
    <P>A decision was taken by the Government that fees should be abolished for those affluent people who attended college. It is a great scandal that not only do children in north inner city Dublin not go on to third level education but many of them do not get through second level.  That is not a criticism of the many primary schools in the area or the teachers who are so committed.  It is a tragedy to see the teaching staff and principals of those schools plead with the Department of Education to retain a teacher or provide an additional resource or remedial teacher.  It should be a matter of public policy that schools in an area with so many problems should be given all the resources they require.</P>
    <P>It is the view of all educationalists who have examined the problems in this area that a second level college specifically geared to the children in that area is necessary.  When the children leave primary school they go to schools around the area and outside of it.  Many of them leave after a year or two.  If the community had the political muscle and ability to use the media to highlight their cause, the school would have been provided a long time ago but it is in the nature of disadvantage that such communities do not have that influence.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education has become the champion of the affluent third level student.  This is an opportunity for her to show that she believes in social justice and equality of educational opportunity.  She should act on that belief by giving the approval to go ahead for this community college.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and also for the interesting way in which he rattled the skeletons of history.  It gives <Col N="505" /> me the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Education, to clarify the position.</P>
      <P>There are eight post-primary schools, six secondary and two vocational, located in the north inner city of Dublin. The Deputy reminded us that in 1982 the then Government, as part of a package of measures for that area which, if memory serves me correctly, became known as the Gregory deal, gave a commitment to provide a new post-primary school at Waterford Street/Sean MacDermott Street.  It was intended that the school would be a community college under the City of Dublin vocational education committee and would replace existing schools at Parnell Square for girls and at Denmark Street for boys.  A site was acquired by the City of Dublin vocational education committee.  The position of the provision of a school was reviewed regularly in subsequent years in light of declining enrolments and demographic trends.  The indications were that the projected number of second-level students would not justify building a new school, solely catering for second-level pupils.</P>
      <P>The Department is again undertaking a review of the educational needs of Dublin north inner city, including the Seán McDermott Street area.  The case for the provision of a second level school is being re-examined.  The issues are complex and broader than just deciding whether to build a new post-primary school.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be assured that in view of the special circumstances of the Seán McDermott Street area the Minister is extremely anxious to expedite the provision of educational facilities which are most appropriate to the needs of the area.  The Department will shortly be approaching the City of Dublin vocational education committee with a view to discussing the development of the site at Seán McDermott Street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is also conscious that the only way many of the young people in that area can escape is through education. She is also concerned about the <Col N="506" /> low level of access to third level education which is a feature of the disadvantage suffered by children from the north inner city area of Dublin 1.  A technical working group has just reported to the steering committee on the future development of the higher education sector.  This report shows unequal participation rates at third level for young people from different social and economic backgrounds.  Overall, young people from less well off backgrounds, including the Dublin inner city, have a much lower chance of access to third-level education.</P>
    <P>All the available evidence indicates that the struggle against disadvantage is won or lost at first and second level.  The Minister has taken a range of measures to improve and promote participation in the education system by students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  When the report of the steering committee is available consideration will be given by the Department to appropriate measures which might be taken to improve access to third level education for students from Dublin north inner city and other areas where there are similar problems of very low participation in third level education.</P>

      <P>This is the third time the situation in the Sunbeam plant has been raised on the Adjournment.  When we outlined it on 16 February and 7 March last, the Minister assured us that everything possible was being done by him, his Department and the relevant State agencies to retain the jobs in this plant.  On 16 February the Minister said that consultants had been commissioned to examine the future options at the plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="507" /> In spite of the loss of 108 jobs during the intervening period Opposition Deputies have endeavoured to be as constructive as possible in regard to this issue.  There were further job losses a month ago and the situation is getting worse.  I read that Forbairt is confident solutions will be found to this problem. While I hope it is proven correct, yesterday afternoon 175 workers in the plant were advised that they were being put on protective notice.  These workers are critical of their public representatives. Deputy Quill and I decided to adopt a responsible approach to this problem so that we could not be accused of using it to gain publicity.  The workers have criticised us and the Government for not highlighting the problems at the plant.</P>
    <P>The assurances given by the Minister have amounted to nothing.  More workers have been laid off and unless a package can be put together within the next two or three weeks the remaining workers will lose their jobs.  This issue is of relevance not only to the 300 workers in the Sunbeam plant but also to their families.  In some cases the only breadwinner in a household is the mother who is working in the plant.  The Government has made no public response to this issue and, unlike other disputes, the Minister has not appeared on television to discuss it.  I wish the workers involved in those disputes the best of luck, but the workers in Cork believe that the Government is not interested in their problem.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Wallace for sharing his time with me.  Since the start of the year the future of the Sunbeam plant in Cork has been riven by uncertainty.  Last March 108 good jobs were lost in the knitwear division.  At that time we were told that replacement jobs would be found but this has not happened.  This uncertainty is having a devastating effect on the workforce, their families and the community.  We have now heard that a further 175 jobs in another division of the same industry <Col N="508" /> are at risk.  All we have had from the Government during the intervening time is a deafening silence.  Even when the matter is down to the wire neither the Minister nor his Minister of State has seen fit to come into the House to reply to this matter.  This speaks volumes about the Government's interest in the future of the Sunbeam plant.</P>
      <P>If the Government adopted a hands on approach to this issue it would inspire some confidence in prospective investors who might create jobs and save the industry.  The Government's silence and indifference have not done anything to create the kind of confidence which would attract an investor, thereby saving the plant and jobs.  The Minister should show some interest in this issue, adopt a hands on approach and take all the steps open to him to ensure the jobs in this crucial industry in the north side of Cork city are saved.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Enterprise and Employment and his Minister of State have failed to fulfil the tasks given to them under their remit.  I strongly condemn the <i>laissez-faire</i> approach taken by them to retain jobs in this vital industry.  The Government is more interested in chasing after promised jobs than in retaining existing jobs. Well placed people have told me that there is now a clear decision to wind down the textile industry.  This decision may not be written down but it has been taken.  I come from a textile background which, unfortunately, was wound down many years ago when synthetics became the vogue.  If that industry had remained in production its time would have come around again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Government to give further consideration to the Sunbeam plant which has a motivated workforce. Despite fine promises from the Minister for Enterprise and Employment the Silverlea Plant in Athlone was closed.  I ask the Government to ensure that the Sunbeam plant does not go the same way.  I also ask the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, to ensure that attention is given to this industry.  Even though the <Col N="509" /> Government is lurching from crisis to crisis, it is not too late to save this plant.</P>

The concerns expressed by the Deputies about the workers and their families are shared by the Government and it is doing its best to ensure the company is rescued.</P>
      <P>During the past two months Forbairt has made every possible effort to secure the future of existing operations and discussions have been held with a number of potential investors.  Discussions are continuing on one particular proposal and a business plan which will be crucial to the resolution of this matter is expected to be submitted to Forbairt for consideration within the next week.  I am anxious to ensure that the negotiations taking place between all the parties involved are facilitated in every way and are afforded every opportunity to be brought to a conclusion.</P>
      <P>Deputies opposite can be assured that no effort will be spared in the Department of Enterprise and Employment to ensure, with the assistance of Forbairt, that if there is a viable business proposal every assistance will be given in an effort to save these jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In raising this matter my primary concern is for the consumer. Eating trends over the past number of years have changed dramatically and the consumption of red meat has fallen for a variety of reasons.  People are more health conscious and consider that eating fish and white meat is more healthy.  People's lifestyles have changed dramatically.  People want to <Col N="510" /> feel they are living in a better environment and that the food they eat is clean and healthy.</P>
      <P>People want an assurance that meat is not contaminated and is residue free.  In a disappointingly brief written reply to my question the Minister claimed that only affected animals are destroyed.  In view of the fact that BSE has a long incubation period, what assurances can the Minister give that the remainder of the herd is not at an early stage of infection? What assurance can be given that the human food chain is not contaminated? I would like an assurance that every possible source of the disease is eliminated from the human food chain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the dangers posed to the food chain by BSE.  It is important that the public and those worldwide consumers of beef are reassured on these very important issues.  My Department and all aspects of animal health have the most stringent worldwide controls in relation to BSE. The consumer can be absolutely assured in relation to the efficacy of that and the quality of Irish meat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to set out the procedures involved in relation to BSE.  Animals that are affected with BSE are destroyed by burial or burning and no part of the carcase enters the food chain.  This is part of a series of measures in place to deal with the disease: first, the disease is a notifiable one under the Disease of Animals Act, 1966; second, there is legislation in place specifying the action to be taken where BSE is suspected or diagnosed &mdash; this provides for the slaughter and destruction of affected animals and the payment of compensation to owners; third, restrictions are imposed on those herds in which cases of the disease are confirmed. There is also a programme in place for the voluntary depopulation of such herds with compensation paid at open market value.  We are the only EU state, even though there is no transmission of the disease whatsoever, who <Col N="511" /> depopulate the entire herd.  Fourth, veterinary practitioners and the Department's veterinary staff have been alerted to the disease and have been instructed as to the measures which should be taken when BSE is suspected. Where animals presented for slaughter indicate suspicious symptoms, they are not slaughtered at the factory but are returned to the farm for further investigation by the Department's veterinary officers.  If suspicion is confirmed, the animals are destroyed and buried in situ with the brain going for laboratory examination.  Fifth, a prohibition has been placed on the feeding to ruminants of meat and bonemeal.  That is the critical point.  The reason this disease is being dealt with is that the meat and bonemeal plants were responsible for the disease going on to the next link in terms of meat and bonemeal being a source of protein in animal feed.  For several years the production of meat and bonemeal has been obliterated here.  It is not allowed and does not occur.  Sixth, in accordance with a European Union decision, the import of cattle from the UK is not permitted.</P>
    <P>In my discussions with the Jordanian Minister for Health, the Mexican Ambassador and Minister for Agriculture, I have been at pains to point out that there is a clear difference between the UK position and the Irish position both in control, in incidents and in eradication.  Some years ago we did suffer but this is very much in the past tense.  In terms of being discriminated against this is no longer a problem because there is now worldwide recognition of the quality of Irish beef.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence whatever that BSE is infectious.  For this reason no restriction is placed on meat from animals originating in herds in which an animal has been diagnosed with BSE. These are completely healthy animals and there is no scientific justification, <Col N="512" /> however remote, for preventing their meat from entering the food chain. There has not been one single case in this country where a steer, a bullock, an animal for beef, has been found to have BSE.</P>
    <P>The scientific veterinary committee, an EU Commission group of scientists, has on several occasions considered the question of BSE.  It has uncovered no evidence of animal-to-animal transmission of BSE.  Similarly, no evidence that BSE is transmissible to humans has been found.  The scientific committee advised the Commission and the Council of Ministers on what measures should be adopted in the EU in order to minimise the risks posed by the disease and to control its spread.  The committee's advice is closely adhered to in EU legislation adopted in the context of BSE.  Apart from UK animals, the committee has not advised that any special measures should be taken in regard to the human consumption of meat from cattle that have not been found to be affected with BSE.  We are not operating under Irish rules but under EU rules.</P>
    <P>The committee has made recommendations in regard to meat exported from the United Kingdom and any such meat coming to Ireland must meet these standards.  The EU institutions are satisfield that, in the light of the present knowledge, all measures necessary to protect human health, in the context of BSE, are in place and the controls in place in Ireland are fully in conformity with these measures.  I will continue to keep under review developments on the scientific front as regards BSE.</P>
    <P>I caution Members that any statements on this very sensitive topic are a source of propaganda by some of our competitors.  It is important that at all times the truthful record is adhered to.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 23 May 1995.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can advise the Deputy that the average <Col N="413" /> age of vessels in the Irish fishing fleet is currently about 35 years.  Two key objectives for the management and development of the fleet are to improve the age profile and to enhance operational safety through the restructuring and modernisation of the fleet, in line with EU fleet targets and in balance with available stocks.</P>
      <P>With significant EU assistance of nearly £14 million under the Operational Programme for Fisheries, the following investment strategies are being put in place to achieve those objectives.  In order to move towards mandatory EU fleet targets by end 1996 and to facilitate the entry of more modern vessels to the fleet a voluntary decommissioning scheme is being introduced. I will be announcing details of the scheme which will be administered by BIM very shortly but in essence grants totalling £6 million will be payable for the disposal of eligible registered fishing boats.  It is envisaged that boats decommissioned under the scheme will in the main comprise older and smaller vessels.  The anticipated removal of up to 4,000 tonnes from the fleet under the scheme will contribute to an improvement in the overall age profile and to enhanced safety levels. We will also be aiming to achieve a better balance between fishing effort and fishing opportunities in line with EU requirements.</P>
      <P>A programme of investment in the modernisation of existing fishing vessels is also underway with EU assistance under the operational programme.  The modernisation strategy will contribute directly to achieving a more efficient, and above all, a safer fleet through improved operations, fishing gear, and on-board equipment as well as better working conditions for crews.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of licensing policy is to facilitate the entry of more modern and safer vessels into the Irish fishing fleet through the replacement of existing vessels.  The policy objective of the introduction of more modern boats into all segments of the fleet, in line with EU capacity targets and licensing policy, is <Col N="414" /> also geared to reducing the age profile and improved safety standards.  In this regard, it is a prerequisite for licence approval that the vessel has been surveyed and confirmed as meeting strict safety and seaworthiness criteria.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that investment and licensing strategies will enable us to seriously address the objectives of a safer, modern and efficient fishing fleet.</P>

      <P>The major development works at Kilmore Quay, which have resulted in the temporary closure of the harbour, are being undertaken by the Department at the request of both Wexford County Council and the local fishing community.  In excess of £2.5 million is being invested in the project which will result in a magnificent harbour benefiting all fishermen and indeed the south-east Wexford area in general.</P>
      <P>The funding voted to the Department of the Marine for fishery harbour development purposes is to be used for such works only.  It cannot be used to compensate fishermen for any disruption arising.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Marine is conscious that the lobster fishermen have had to moor outside the harbour and in other locations as a result of the works at Kilmore Quay.  However, in order to help alleviate the problem to some extent the Department will move the bund around the mouth of the harbour back past the underpinned section of the pier.  This will provide some 55m of berthage at the mouth of the harbour to cater for small boats while the project is being completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 32, 38 and 127 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to questions raised within the European Parliament, MEPs have been advised that the dumping of munitions dating from World War II in <Col N="416" /> the sea does not fall under Community law and that the Oslo Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft, 1972, is an appropriate forum through which this issue could be pursued.  Ireland is a party to the Oslo Convention and we are pursuing the general issue through that forum.</P>
    <P>Information on the precise location of the dump sites used by the UK for the dumping of chemical weapons between 1945 and 1957 in waters adjacent to Irish territorial waters, and the volume and composition of the weapons have been made available to the Irish Government.  Indeed, information in relation to the dumping off the Donegal coastline has been available since 1986 and in the public domain for a number of years.  The Department is in continuous contact with the UK authorities in this matter with a view to ensuring that all relevant information has been supplied. If necessary I will raise this matter at ministerial level.</P>
    <P>On-going scientific assessments undertaken by the Department's Fisheries Research Centre in respect of chemical weapons dumped off the Irish coast indicate that given the properties of the chemicals (being either quickly soluble in, or heavier than water), the sea depth at which they were dumped and the considerable number of years which had elapsed, the weapons are not considered to pose a hazard to the health or fishing activities of our coastal communities.</P>
    <P>The dumping of chemical weapons is a matter of major concern to Ireland and indeed to most contracting parties to the Oslo Convention.  There are some 13 countries party to the convention. Chemical weapon dumpsites are located throughout the maritime area covered by the convention.  This subject was on the agenda of the April meeting of the Environmental Assessment and Monitoring Committee (ASMO), a scientific working group of the convention.  Studies undertaken by Denmark concerning war gas in the Baltic Sea were considered at the ASMO meeting.  These studies concluded that as the risks <Col N="417" /> associated with the recovery of dumped chemical weapons are high it would be hazardous to undertake a salvage operation. The results of earlier studies carried out by Belgium concurred with those of Denmark.</P>
    <P>In short the best available information and technical advice at the moment is that given the nature of the chemicals, seepage is not considered to pose serious hazards and efforts to retrieve or remove would be more dangerous than leaving the dumped material in place.  Nevertheless, this remains a matter of serious concern. Further investigation into this whole area is required.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, determined to ensure that a comprehensive investigation of the impact of the dumping of chemical weapons off the coast of Ireland should be initiated.  In this regard it was decided, at the April ASMO meeting that, as part of a wider quality status report on the maritime area covered by the Oslo Convention, the impact of the dumping of war gas ammunition would be specifically addressed. This wider quality status report is to be completed by the year 2000.  Ireland and the UK are responsible for the preparation of that part of the report in respect of a region which covers the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and areas to the west of Ireland and west of Scotland and the aim is to have the war gas aspect addressed as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>Primary responsibility for coastal protection lies with the property owner, whether it be a private individual or a local authority.</P>
      <P>I will of course facilitate, where warranted, anyone who wishes to implement an appropriate coast protection scheme by granting a foreshore licence.  For the first time ever EU funding is being made available for coast protection works for which an economic benefit can be shown.</P>
      <P>Some £5.1 million is being made available over the life of the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-99.  Although this represents a significant increase on funding levels in recent years &mdash; which was £100,000 for capital works &mdash; it is still a relatively small sum.</P>
      <P>In order to draw up a list of national priorities the Department sought details from maritime local authorities of their top four priority protection proposals. The submissions received are being assessed by the Department and the projects to be undertaken between now and 1999 will be chosen from the proposals submitted.  The bulk of funding available in 1995 has already been allocated and final decisions have yet to be made in relation to the remaining funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary objective of the Department's investment in coast protection works is the preservation of the State owned foreshore; local authority property; tourist amenities including the beach and dune system; and natural habitats-ecology.  Private property is only protected as a consequence of protection works being undertaken in respect of the outlined objectives.  Furthermore, protection works will only be undertaken if the cost of the protection works and subsequent maintenance is less than the cost of the property being protected and then, only if such works support rural development, tourism, <Col N="419" /> environmental protection or other activities contributing to the economic potential of coastal regions.</P>
    <P>As the present allocation is inadequate to meet our needs I will be reviewing over the coming year how to get additional funds for the purpose of coast protection.  With regard to Coastal Zone Management policy the Government is beginning to examine the whole area with a view to formulating a national policy.  To this end, a study is being commissioned jointly by the Departments of the Marine, Environment and the Office of Public Works. This study, which will be commissioned within the next few weeks, will make recommendations for coastal zone management policy for Ireland, taking account of the specific potential and problems of the coastal zone in Ireland, including issues arising from overlapping administration structures and boundaries.</P>
    <P>The study will take approximately six months to complete.  At that stage there will be full public consultation on the matter.</P>

      <P>This case is concerned with two important principles of the Treaty of Rome i.e. freedom to provide maritime transport services between member states and freedom of competition within the EU.</P>
      <P>Ireland operates an open ports policy. Ships of all nationalities are welcome in our ports provided they comply with international safety standards.

      <P>In late November 1994, the Department of the Marine wrote to all maritime local authorities inviting them to submit details of their top four priority coast protection projects.  The local authorities were advised that any projects submitted must be seen to support rural development, tourism, environmental protection or other activities which will contribute to increasing the economic potential of coastal regions.  In line with this a cost-benefit type appraisal of projects was also requested.  No funding will be available in respect of projects whose capital and maintenance costs over the life of the project are greater than the economic value of the benefits arising.</P>
      <P>The majority of submissions from local authorities have now been received and these are being assessed by the Department.  It is likely that additional information on the proposals submitted will be required in order to draw up a list of national priorities.

That being said, no guarantee can be given that every maritime local authority area will benefit under the programme to be drawn up by the Department.</P>

    <P>In relation to Rosslare Strand, the Department of the Marine in conjunction with Wexford County Council, has undertaken a major protection scheme at the strand over the last three years, at <Col N="423" /> a cost of approximately £1.5 million. The project, which is being completed this year, involves the construction and extension of rock groynes and the provision of beach nourishment material. This work formed part of an EU sponsored project entitled ECOPRO (Environmentally Friendly Coast Protection).  The work undertaken to-date is being monitored regularly and appears to be highly successful at reducing the erosion.  It is hoped that the scheme will provide a long term solution to the erosion of Rosslare Strand.  An additional £80,000 will be spent on the scheme this year to allow for the extension, topping and reshaping of groynes and the provision of protection at the Back Strand.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>The latest available (1993) statistics for the fish processing industry indicate that there were 2,076 people employed on a ful-time basis, and 1,624 employed on a part-time basis.  The total value of production was IR£238 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During 1994, projects representing an overall investment in the processing sector of IR£7.86 million received grant assistance of IR£3.6 million.  The Operational Programme for Fisheries 1994-1999 provides for a total investment in <Col N="424" /> excess of IR£31 million in the fish processing industry.  EU and Exchequer grant aid will amount to almost IR£14 million.  The strategic objective for the processing sector is to create a strong processing and marketing base to maximise the use of fishery and aquaculture products and to create additional employment through greater value-added, improved quality and hygiene and more efficient structures.</P>
    <P>The planned investment under the operational programme, in new facilities, equipment and installations and upgrading of existing facilities, is being geared to delivering on this objective.</P>

      <P>I am aware that hydro-electric schemes can have possible adverse impacts on fish populations.  The developers of these schemes have a statutory responsibility to ensure the safe passage of fish.  In addition, all such proposals are subject to the full planning process and are notified to the relevant regional fisheries board for assessment from the fisheries perspective.  The boards consult as necessary with applicants and local authorities in order to ensure that all appropriate safeguards and conditions to protect fish populations are incorporated into any planning permissions given.  The subsequent operation of such schemes are regularly monitored by the fisheries boards.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that, by and large, the planning process ensures that the concerns of fisheries boards can be met.  I am not aware of any compelling reason to seek additional safeguards within the planning code but the matter will be kept under review in consultation with the regional fisheries boards.</P>

      <P>In 1994 two projects were proposed by the Office of Public Works for national lottery funding. The first, relating to the provision of a new exhibition centre at Kilmainham Gaol, commenced in 1993 and is due for completion early next year.  The project estimated to cost £2,150,000, has been approved in full and expenditure to date amounts to £763,000.  The second project was the conservation and restoration of the Custom House Limerick, a State owned building, by Limerick Corporation, for use by the Hunt Museum, in respect of which a contribution of £400,000 by the Office of Public Works from lottery funds was approved.</P>
      <P>The decision to allocate national lottery funds to these projects was made on the basis that they involve the conservation and presentation of historic buildings which are in State ownership and their use is for cultural purposes.</P>

      <P>The only basis in law for reinstatement is contained in section 11 of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, as amended by the Civil Service (Employment of Married Women) Act, 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 11 of the Civil Service Regulation Act, as amended, provides for the reinstatement of women in certain circumstances, <Col N="437" /> namely if she was a civil servant, retired from the Civil Service for the purposes of, on or following marriage, and &ldquo;...is for the time being a widow or woman who did not get married or in respect of whom it is established to the satisfaction of the Minister for Finance that she is not being supported by her husband&rdquo;.  Under these provisions a married woman who is not a widow may be deemed not to be supported by her husband if his income is below certain limits.  In addition the non-support must be of a long term nature. As the woman concerned did not satisfy the necessary criteria her application for reinstatement was not successful.</P>

      <P>Persons in receipt of a widow's contributory or a widow's non-contributory pension from the Department of Social Welfare were exempted from payment of the health contribution levy on all of their income.

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The drug referred to by the Deputy is a novel drug for the condition concerned and is not licensed for use in this country.  Before any drug can be placed on the market here, the National Drugs Advisory Board must be satisfied as to the quality, safety and efficacy of the drug concerned.</P>
      <P>As the drug concerned does not have a licence, otherwise known as a product authorisation, it can only be made available on a &ldquo;named patient&rdquo; basis.  One of the conditions attached to drugs provided on a &ldquo;named patient&rdquo; basis is that they be administered by a specialist in a setting which has the appropriate facilities to correctly diagnose and monitor the patient and to ensure that there are no adverse reactions or other undesirable effects.  It is important, therefore, that such unlicensed drugs should be prescribed and used in the context of a hospital setting.  Where such unlicensed medicines are made available on this basis, the use of the preparations should be under the ongoing supervision of the consultant initiating the treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances, arrangements have been made to have Beta Interferon made available to patients who have been deemed suitable for treatment with this drug by their consultant through the hospital concerned.  The Deputy will appreciate that these <Col N="439" /> arrangements are necessary to protect the interests of patients who are prescribed novel drugs of this nature.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>The Health Vote is comprised of subheads funded from the Exchequer and the national lottery.  Spending on health programmes is determined by reference to the overall level of funding available and is not directly to the source of the funding.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Capital Programme, the overall sum available in 1994 was £65.17 million, of which £11.1 million came from national lottery funds. However, the distribution of that money was related to the individual commitments and priorities within my Department without reference to the source of those funds.  It is, therefore, possible for a proposal to be funded both from Exchequer and national lottery funds.</P>
      <P>Likewise, in the case of the Health Promotion Programme for 1994, £1.6 million of the programme was funded from Exchequer funds and £0.5 million was funded from the national lottery.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> A total of 108 voluntary organisations applied directly to my Department for national lottery funds in 1994.  Of these, 18 were fully successful, 20 were partly successful five were funded from other resources and there were 65 unsuccessful applications.</P>
      <P>The criteria used to assess applications for national lottery funding are as follows.  First, the application must comply with the legislation governing the distribution of national lottery funds as it applies to the health services i.e. that it is in respect of the health of the community.  In addition, due to the limited resources available, each grant request is assesed by the relevant service division within my Department.  The division will, either through its direct knowledge of the work of the organisation or on the basis of information provided by the relevant health board, take a view on whether the grant should be favourably considered and, if so, the order of priority which should be afforded to it among the competing requests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy should be aware that in respect of the overall lottery funds of £30 million provided in the Health Vote in 1994, £15.8 million was allocated in support of ongoing services administered by health boards or by bodies which have a close relationship with my Department: £1.7 million was allocated to health boards in respect of block grants: £11.1 million was included in funding for the Capital Programme and £0.5 million was included in the Programme for Health Promotion.  The remaining amount of £0.9 million was therefore available for payment to organisations on a discretionary basis. Requests for lottery funding may be <Col N="441" /> received from a number of sources including public representatives and members of the public.  On receipt of any request for funding a standard application form is issued to the relevant organisation.</P>
    <P>The amounts allocated to each organisation in 1994 are listed as follows.</P>

    <P>In 1989 the then Government decided that, with effect from 1990, a block allocation would be made to each health board in respect of grants to voluntary bodies in their area.  Such grants are distributed by health boards having regard to local priorities and within the guidelines laid down by my Department.  The grants are accounted for within the health boards annual financial returns and are subject to audit in the normal way.  Under those circumstances health boards are not required to supply my Department with details of the individual grants from this source.</P>

      <P>Grants may be allocated to community based projects under the headings; mental and physical handicap, the elderly, psychiatric services, child care services, personal social services, including information and counselling services. At least 70 per cent of the block grant should be allocated to voluntary groups.  Grants from the block grant allocation should not be used in substitution for section 65 grants.  Particular care should be taken to ensure that grants are made only to viable schemes which will be completed within a reasonable period.  Health boards take particular care to assess the ongoing revenue implications in determining the priority of schemes.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The accident and emergency department of Beaumont Hospital provides a 24-hour service. Because of the nature of the work, it is not possible to predict the workload of hospital accident and emergency departments at any particular time.  At all times, priority is accorded to those patients most in need of immediate medical attention.  Because of the unpredictable nature of the workload which may present, it can happen that on occasion patients must be placed in <Col N="446" /> temporary accommodation pending the availability of more appropriate beds.  I can assure the Deputy that every effort is made to keep this practice to a minimum.</P>
      <P>All patients, while in the accident and emergency department are under the care of medical and nursing staff.  Every endeavour is made to make patients as comfortable as possible and this includes the provision of food to patients while they are awaiting a hospital bed.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the accident and emergency departments is monitored by my Department on an ongoing basis.  In this regard, shortly after coming into office I approved a sum of £850,000 as an immediate response to recent problems experienced by the Dublin accident and emergency hospitals, Difficulties which have arisen in recent weeks have not been caused by a shortage of acute hospital beds but are due to insufficient step down facilities for patients who are no longer in need of acute hospital care.</P>
      <P>In relation to Beaumont Hospital, there have been a number of occasions in recent months when, owing to the accident and emergency department being particularly busy, some patients have been accommodated on trolleys for a period until a bed has become available.  To counteract this, elective admissions have, from time to time been cancelled and an action plan has been put in place in Beaumont Hospital to ensure that beds are made available at the earliest opportunity for patients being admitted through accident and emergency.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy of my continuing concern that the accident and emergency hospitals in Dublin are enabled to respond effectively to the demands placed upon them and that I will continue to monitor the situation with a view to taking further action if required.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there is a waiting list for ophthalmic services in the Eastern Health Board area owing to a steady increase in the number of applicants for services.</P>

There is no waiting list for children requiring glasses.</P>

      <Col N="448" /> This year I have provided additional funding to the Eastern Health Board to allow it increase the number of approvals it issues to applicants for optical treatment under the sight testing and provision of spectacles scheme.

      <P>Proposals for funding library projects are processed through various stages involving both technical assessment and management of demand to match available resources.  In these circumstances, it is unlikely that a project first submitted in any year would be cleared to proceed within that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1994, my Department received eight new proposals for library construction-refurbishment, four proposals for <Col N="452" /> funding new library vehicles, and two proposals for funding library automation. The total funding requirements was estimated at £3.14 million.</P>
    <P>Proposals fully approved for construction in 1994 were: Listowel and Dingle County Kerry; Mohill, County Leitrim; Longford Library Headquarters; Ballinrobe, County Mayo; and Boyle County Roscommon.  Final sanction for a new library vehicle was also issued to Meath County Council.</P>
    <P>Proposals authorised to proceed to the preparation of contract documents or to tender stage were: Carlow; Mahon, Hollyhill and Douglas, Cork City; Castlecomer, County Kilkenny; Dooradoyle, County Limerick; and Tubbercurry, County Sligo.  One project, Clones, County Monaghan, was referred back to the local authority for further consideration.</P>
    <P>Proposals for library funding are assessed in my Department by professional and administrative staff, with advice from An Chomhairle Leabharlanna.</P>

      <P>Section 71 of the Roads Act, 1933 prohibits unauthorised signs on public roads and empowers road authorities and the Garda to remove them. It also prohibits, and provides for the removal of, caravans, vehicles, etc. <Col N="453" /> which are used for the purpose of advertising, for the sale of goods or the provision of services, on public roads.</P>
      <P>Subject to certain exemptions, all vehicles used in a public place are subject to the normal range of traffic and parking regulations under the Road Traffic Acts, 1961-1994.  There is also a specific provision in the 1961 Act containing a prohibition on acts which cause, or are likely to cause, obstruction of traffic.</P>
      <P>Under section 21 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1992 and the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations, 1992, a motor trader may, on certain conditions, obtain a trade licence from the local licensing authority on payment of the appropriate excise duty.  Under a trade licence-plate, a vehicle may be used in a public place for a wide range of purposes, including demonstration for the benefit of a prospective purchaser.</P>

      <P>My Department received no proposals in 1994 from local authorities for national lottery funding in respect of swimming pools.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of the Environment has primary responsibility for local authority swimming pools and administers a national lottery funded scheme for the provision and renovation of swimming pools.  It is noted that the 1995 allocation for this scheme is £2 million.</P>
      <P>My Department's role in the funding of local authority swimming pools is confined to three locations which were specifically designated by Government in early 1988 for the provision of regional sports centres under the major sports capital programme.  Following an investigation of the sporting requirements in these locations, in consultation with the local authorities concerned, it was agreed that swimming pools should be provided.  The swimming pools in question are in Sligo (£1.5 million), Athlone (£1.5 million), and Cork (£1.75 million).</P>
      <P>The present position on these swimming pools is that the Sligo project has been completed, tenders are under consideration in respect of the Cork project and planning is in progress on the Athlone project.</P>

      <P>The recreational facilities scheme assists voluntary community organisations in the provision of, improvements to and equipping of recreational, leisure and community facilities.</P>
      <P>The advertisement in the national papers on 11 February 1994, inviting applications for assistance under the scheme specifically outlined the criteria for the selection of projects as follows: the priority of the proposed improvement/facility in relation to the organisations existing facilities; the ability of the organisation to undertake the project and claim the grant in 1994; the amount of local funds available; the availability of the other facilities in the area and the requirement to achieve an equitable geographical distribution of funds.</P>
      <P>The 1995 allocation of £2 million for this scheme comprises £0.7 million in subhead B.10 and £1.3 million in sub-head B.11.  There are no differences in criteria between these two subheads.</P>

      <P>It is not possible in the time available to provide the detailed information requested by the Deputy in relation to the applications made by individual colleges and the amounts paid to those colleges in 1994.  I will be pleased to ensure that it is forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it is collated in the format requested.</P>
      <P>In 1994 there were no unsuccessful applications.  The scheme does not provide for partial recognition of courses.</P>
      <P>The funding in the subhead is used to pay grants towards tuition costs to colleges that organise Irish language courses, mainly during the summer months.  Grants are paid up to certain maxima based on the type and length of the course, the number of students and the individual attendance records of those students.</P>
      <P>Applications for recognition as a coláiste and proposed courses are evaluated by the Department's inspectorate. When recognised, a coláiste continues to enjoy this status unless it ceases to function or unless the Department formally withdraws the recognition.  This can happen if, over time, the Department is not satisfied with the quality of the courses which the coláiste provides.</P>
      <P>Recognised coláistí submit applications annually in advance for the recognition of each course.  These applications are evaluated &mdash; primarily on the basis of course content and staff qualifications.  It is extremely exceptional that either the initial application or an amended version is not approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has prepared Rialacháin faoina n-íoctar deontais ar son Cúrsaí Samhraidh i gColáistí Gaeilge, a set of regulations under which it pays grants.  Each course is inspected by a <Col N="460" /> member of the Department's Inspectorate who provides a written report and a recommendation as to the payment of grants.  Administrative staff settle the claims for payment.  Grants are paid on the basis of fully documented claims. The grant may be reduced or withheld if the inspector reports that the course was unsatisfactory in whole or in part.</P>
    <P>There is an annual review of the operation of the scheme and the criteria which apply involving the Department and CONCOS, the umbrella organisation of Irish summer colleges.  The Department has not found it necessary to advertise the scheme annually as grant assistance is confined to Coláistí previously recognised by the Department.</P>
    <P>This scheme is complemented by another scheme, administered by the Department of Arts Culture and the Gaeltacht, under which grants are paid to &ldquo;Mná Tí&rdquo; in respect of the maintenance of recognised students attending these colleges.</P>

      <P>I am glad to inform the Deputies that, earlier this week, the Government decided to allocate an additional £10 million for the community employment programme, which will take total available funding to around £265.7 million and provide for an average of 40,000 places on the programme this year.</P>
      <P>The Government and I are well aware of the high level of demand for places on the community employment programme and for this reason additional funding was made available for the programme. The bulk of the additional funding will come from savings in social welfare payments with the balance coming from savings in Departments which benefit directly or indirectly from the programme.</P>

    <P>FÁS in consultation with my Department, has been considering a number of ways to give FÁS clients a greater say in the organisation's programme-services and a decision in principle has been taken to establish a FÁS Users Council.  Among the issues to be determined are whether the new arrangements should be centrally or regionally based and whether one set of arrangements would be appropriate given the diverse range of clients using FÁS services. In determining the most appropriate arrangements, account will be taken of the relevant recommendations in <Col N="472" /> NESF Report No 6 &ldquo;Quality Delivery of Social Services&rdquo; and also of the INOU &ldquo;Charter of Rights for CE participants&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 112 together.  At the time of the acceptance by the workforce in January last of the cost reduction measures, the company indicated that lay-offs later in the year would be unavoidable because of the loss of a major contract.  No guarantee in relation to future employment levels was given by the company.  What was given, and repeated within the past two weeks, was an assurance from the parent company that it has a commitment to the long term future of the Tallaght plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January last, when a settlement was agreed which provided for lay-offs, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, Minister of State with responsibility for commerce, science and technology, and I agreed with <Col N="474" /> the company that it would do everything possible to minimise the extent of any lay-offs.  When settlement was reached the company agreed to maximise its efforts to win back some part of the J2900 contract and to seek new business. A lay-off was inevitable but success in these efforts and success tackling the competitiveness problems in the plant could have minimised the extent and the duration of the lay-offs.  It is to be regretted that it was not possible to win back or replace business that had been lost last December.</P>
    <P>In private companies like this, lay-offs tend to occur when they are unable to win sufficient business for the full workforce but retain a hope of doing so.  The critical issue for winning business in competitiveness, and in this instance, particularly cost competitiveness and productivity.  Nonetheless I still believe the plant at Tallaght could have a successful future &mdash; but only if all parties work together in a spirit of mutual trust and co-operation to address the competitiveness issues.  If this cannot be done then the outlook is very bleak, as everyone involved is very fully aware.</P>
    <P>The discussions which I and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, had with the parent company in January last were designed to avert a threat to the plant at that time, to obtain a further opportunity for the workforce to consider and decide on their response to management's proposals for achieving progress, and to create a climate for the favourable resolution of the company's difficulties. This continues to be my priority and I sincerely hope that even at this very late stage a way forward can be found towards a resolution of the current impasse.  My announcement of 18 January is as relevant now as then: it is vital for both sides to establish trust and co-operation if there is to be any prospect of a solution.</P>

      <P>I am seeking a number of changes to the existing provisions on individual base areas &mdash; IBAs &mdash; so that, if it is necessary to operate such a system, we can do so in a practical and equitable manner.  The existing provisions relating to IBAs in EU legislation are not satisfactory.  They do not cater for hardship cases, such as farmers who temporarily ceased production during the qualifying base years, nor do they make any provision for allocation of base area rights for new entrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments which I am seeking include the setting up of a national reserve to cater for such cases.  These changes would require the agreement of the Council of Agriculture Ministers.  I will need to be satisfied that any revised individual base area rules can be <Col N="477" /> implemented in a way that will ensure that the objective of maximising efficient production can be realised. This is of particular importance in a sector which, in Ireland, is in deficit.</P>
    <P>It is clear at this stage that if IBAs are to be introduced they will not be in place for the 1995-96 planting season.</P>

      <P>An Post applied in 1990 to my Department for national lottery funds to restore the facade of the GPO which had been eroded by pollution.  The work was to have been completed in 1991, to coincide with Dublin's designation as the European Capital of Culture and also to mark the 75th anniversary of the 1916 Rising.  Due to An Post's financial difficulties at the time the cost of the work was beyond the means of the company.</P>
      <P>The restoration work was estimated to cost £1 million but the final figure amounted to £3.122 million and the work was not completed until 1993.  The additional expenditure arose from the need to correct unforeseen and serious faults in the building and not from any over-run on cost estimates for known works.</P>
      <P>Given the historical significance of the building, the fact that the State retained ownership of the premises, (An Post occupies the building under licence from my Department) and that the restoration work was necessary, Government approval for the project was given.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 128 and 129 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March 1991, following extensive scientific studies of the site, the authorised sewage sludge dumpsite was relocated from its previous location two miles off Howth Head to a new site south-east of the Kish Lighthouse about ten to 14 miles offshore.  Some localised <Col N="497" /> environmental impact had been identified in the vicinity of the old site.</P>
    <P>Monitoring of the status of the new sewage sludge dumpsite and the recovery status of the old dumpsite close to Howth Head was carried out in 1993.  At the new dumpsite the monitoring revealed that there was no significant impact on the sediment fauna in the area while at the old dumpsite the monitoring revealed an increase in the number of benthic faunal species in the area, suggesting good recovery.  According to international practice, monitoring of such sites is recommended at approximately five year intervals and the sites will be resurveyed in 1998.  Under present disposal conditions environmental problems are not anticipated at the new site.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation currently holds an annual permit under the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981 and is permitted to dispose of up to a maximum of 340,000 tonnes of sewage sludge at sea during 1995 with a maximum of 2,000 tonnes to be dumped per day.  Three trips are normally made to the site per week with approximately 2,000 tonnes being disposed of on each trip.</P>
    <P>The dumping of sewage sludge at sea will be prohibited internationally under the Oslo Convention from 31 December 1998.  Alternative land-based methods of treatment and disposal are being developed by Dublin Corporation with that timeframe in mind.</P>

      <P>An investment programme of almost £30 million for Dublin Port between now and 1999 was announced by me today.  EU grant aid of some £15 <Col N="498" /> million from the Cohesion and Structural Funds is expected toward this programme of investment.</P>
      <P>The development of port and shipping services on the Central Corridor is of strategic importance to the country. The development strategy for Dublin Port essentially entails the provision of adequate competing services for ro-ro and lo-lo traffic.  In line with this strategy the programme of investment outlined today involves</P>
      <P>&mdash; upgrading of ferry terminal for Dublin Ferry Port (Irish Continental Group (ICG));</P>
      <P>&mdash; extension of ro-ro berth for Pandoro;</P>
      <P>&mdash; extension of Marine Terminals Ltd. and Dublin Freight Terminal's (ICG) lo-lo berths;</P>
      <P>&mdash; improvement of bulk handling and storage facilities;</P>
      <P>&mdash; upgrading the VTS system and improving ship movements within the port area;</P>
      <P>&mdash; breakwater refurbishment, environmental landscaping, and fire protection.</P>
      <P>The programme is designed to develop Dublin Port facilities for all modes of transport to the highest standards.</P>
      <P>The projects for Dublin Port will receive assistance from the Transport Operational Programme, the Cohesion Fund and the Maritime INTERREG Programme.  I have today given approval to the projects on the following list which are being aided under the Transport Operational Programme.  The EU Commission are evaluating the projects under the Cohesion Fund and decisions are expected shortly.  The Maritime INTERREG Programme is being finalised by the EU Commission at present.  All projects must meet the criteria for EU aid set down in the relevant EU funding programme.</P>
      <P>The list of the projects announced today is as follows.</P>
