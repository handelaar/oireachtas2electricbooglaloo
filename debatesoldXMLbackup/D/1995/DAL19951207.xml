      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 5 &mdash; Vote 34 only &mdash; 7, 8 and 9.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 1 and 5 shall be decided without debate and any division demanded on No. 5 shall be taken forthwith.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government Whip is not keeping the Taoiseach informed.  We have the draft schedule for next week.  The Government has refused a debate on Northern Ireland and to debate the Book of Estimates. <Col N="826" /> Will the Taoiseach give the House a categorical asssurance that next week, in accordance with usual practice, we will debate the Book of Estimates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been the practice, to my knowledge, that the Book of Estimates is discussed in any detail at this stage.  To my recollection, there was one occasion on which it happened. The Government is working carefully on the Book of Estimates and it will be published as soon as work on it is complete.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister for Social Welfare say if we may debate the Social Welfare Estimate for 1996?  Can the Taoiseach tell the House when the book of Estimates will be published, and if he will have a debate on it in this House next week?  Can we have an adjournment debate, a debate on Northern Ireland?  We will debate anything, but the Taoiseach is saying no to everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as a debate on Northern Ireland is concerned, there is provision for a debate on a motion from the Government next week concerning the establishment of an international body to examine the subject. Furthermore, as far as the Estimates are concerned, these will be published as soon as they are completed and we will make such provisions as are appropriate thereafter for their debate.</P>

      <P>It is a serious matter if the Book of Estimates is not agreed this morning.  If it has been agreed, the Taoiseach would have told us when it is to be published.  I urge the Minister for Finance to continue to hold the line against the spendthrift tendencies of Democratic Left, supported by Fine Gael.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Last December there were extraordinary developments; obviously December is the month for that.  With the exception of last year, because of those extraordinary developments, the Adjourment debate always includes a debate covering the Estimates which have always been published from early to mid-November.  As a person supposedly committed to Dáil reform who wants his Government to be as transparent as a pane of glass, does the Taoiseach agree that it is unsatisfactory that we do not have the Book of Estimates and will not, therefore, be able to have a meaningful debate next week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been a good while in this House and I have a good recollection of Appropriation Bills.  I remember fighting in this House for a debate on the Appropriation Bills when it was the custom, as it was for approximately 20 years, not even to debate the Appropriation Bill which was passed without debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There were one or two occasions at most on which the Estimates were debated in general terms before the end of the year.  Therefore, the assumptions underlying Deputy Harney's questions are not valid or in accordance with the facts.</P>
      <P>When the Government, which is working cohesively, collectively and carefully on the Estimates, has completed its consideration of the matter, the Estimates will be published.  The Opposition parties should not be unduly concerned in relation to this issue.  They will not discover anything to disrupt their having a happy Christmas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the practice for a number of years for this House to engage in a debate in relation to the Appropriations Bill or the Book of Estimates. This has been the case since 1987, with the introduction of the Book <Col N="828" /> of Estimates in December of that year. The Taoiseach may consult the Official Report for the relevant dates.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach repudiate the outrageous and insulting attack, made yesterday by a Government spokesman on the professional competence and integrity of civil servants in the Department of Finance while carrying out their public duty?</P>

As someone who has worked closely with officials in the Department of Finance I can say that they are people of high integrity and a high level of patriotism.  I compliment them and all other officials working in connection with this issue.  I advise everyone concerned to treat the officials with great respect, which in fact they do.  I advise Deputy Ahern not to listen to tittle tattle.</P>

      <P>In paragraph 61 of the Programme for Government a commitment was made that encouragement would be given to Ministers and Ministers of State to discuss various proposals prior to publication with the Oireachtas committees responsible for legislation.  During recent weeks the Government has indicated that the heads of a number of Bills, including the freedom of information Bill, have been approved.  Publishing the fact that the heads have been approved by Government, rather than publishing the Bills themselves, represents a change of practice.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach inform the House of any proposals the Government might have to discuss the drug trafficking Bill, the freedom of information Bill, the juvenile Justice Bill or the equal status Bill with any of the committees concerned? The Dáil could then discuss this proposed legislation before publication, as was enunciated in the Programme for Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been the practice for such action to take place. However, if Oireachtas committees request discussions with the relevant Ministers in relation to particular areas of policy which may be subsequently presented in the form of legislation, such requests can and will be considered on their merits.  The appropriate approach would be for the committees to raise such matters with the relevant Ministers.  We will investigate, on a pragmatic basis, how this might be achieved.  I expect to meet one of the committees next year in relation to a policy issue.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  It is very important legislation which will allow the VHI to move into the next century in a strong and positive manner.</P>
      <P>People must recognise the tremendous service provided by the VHI which was established under a Government led by Fine Gael.  We must be very proud of the role it has played during the past 40 years.  In the region of 35 per cent of the entire population contribute to the VHI and are under its care.  It is a non-profit making organisation and the wealth it has created has been reinvested in the provision of health care for its contributors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the VHI's administration accounts for only 6 per cent of its overall cost is a tribute to how it has been managed.  The health insurance industry is entering a competitive market and we must ensure that the people who are most vulnerable obtain and <Col N="832" /> retain health insurance at a reasonable cost.  I specifically refer to the elderly and chronically ill.  Health insurance is mainly family-based and has been extremely beneficial.  However, the country is faced with an ageing population. We must ensure that the VHI, in its new format, and any new competitors do not engage in cherrypicking and abandon vulnerable sectors of the population to a difficult situation.</P>
    <P>The health service will change dramatically in the coming years.  The Minister and his predecesssor worked closely with the health boards as they move into a new era of health care.  It is envisaged that people will spend shorter periods in hospital and convalesce at home or in nursing homes and the VHI must gear itself to take account of that. If necessary people could be paid an allowance which would enable them recuperate at home instead of in hospital.</P>
    <P>Consultancy services in rural areas, particularly in Cavan-Monaghan, should be improved in order to provide a service for people close to their homes. People would not have to travel to the Blackrock Clinic or the Mater Private Hospital if health care services were decentralised.  The Bill gives an opportunity to the VHI to be better placed to meet the challenges of the future and that is one of them.</P>
    <P>Middle income families with children at college or facing other extraordinary costs find it difficult to meet, in many cases, exorbitant VHI subscriptions. They must pay their doctor's bills and medication, dental care and physiotherapy bills.  The VHI should devise a package that would give access to such care at a nominal rate.  The membership of VHI is such that a package could be offered at a relatively low cost.  Group schemes are in operation which offer discounts to participants and perhaps a similar scheme could operate for ordinary medical care.</P>
    <P>As there is peace in Northern Ireland we should consider aligning our hospital care facilities with those in Northern Ireland.  When we consider the level of <Col N="833" /> health care in Altnagelvin Hospital it seems sensible to have an arrangement not just at health board or Government level but at VHI level with that hospital. In Cavan-Monaghan and in Louth many people have family connections in Northern Ireland and it would be more convenient for them to be hospitalised immediately north of the Border or in some of the extremely good hospitals in Belfast.  During the troubles in the North great expertise was built up in such hospitals, particularly in the Royal Victoria.  This could be tapped into in providing ordinary health care service. The Minister and the VHI should examine this possibility.  It would introduce competition which might help to lower costs.  It might also result in speedier access to treatment which would help those suffering from chronic illness.</P>
    <P>Services have been developed at local level.  There is a scanning machine in Cavan hospital and major improvements were made in Monaghan hospital. This has resulted in the earlier diagnosis of illness at local level.</P>
    <P>The Minister examined the area of private care for the elderly.  It is right that he should have control over that and ensure proper services are available but he might also look at the level of care in private hospitals.  The majority of patients in private hospitals receive extremely good care and treatment but we must be certain that the best care possible is available particularly when State or VHI funds are involved.  We must be certain that top quality nursing and medical care is available.  In general hospitals there is continuity of nursing staff.  That is important as a term in hospital for a person is a traumatic time for the patient and the family.  We must ensure that patient care, for which the consumer is paying a hefty insurance premium, is of the highest quality.  The experience of some families who pay high premiums and are hospitalised in private hospitals is that the level of care is less than what they anticipated.  They would also have experience of care available in general hospitals.  The Minister should examine this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> The VHI should have customer help lines.  That may be difficult to operate but the customer is often alienated from the provider.  This particularly applies to those who participate in group schemes. People should know what services are available and if they have a problem they should have access to somebody who will help resolve it.</P>
    <P>For example, if a person is diagnosed as having cancer he or she should know exactly what treatment is available. There should also be a fair complaints procedure.  I hesitate to suggest the office of an Ombudsman in the case of the VHI because of the danger of it being unable to negotiate with hospitals and so on.  However, people must be able to have their complaints dealt with.</P>
    <P>The VHI has provided a great service for many years.  Many people owe their lives to it because the health services could not have coped with the increasing numbers of open heart surgery, triple by-passes and so on that have been carried out in recent years if the private hospitals, which are funded mainly through VHI, had not been available.  The majority of people are satisfied with the service provided by the board.</P>
    <P>The health care consultative forum which the Minister proposes to establish next spring will play an important role in the provision of public and private health care and the VHI has a major role to play in that.  I wish its chief executive, Brian Duncan, every success in promoting further changes in the system and this Bill will enable the board to compete successfully in the next century. In any business changes are necessary, otherwise we would move backwards. There is an onus on the chief executive, the board and all concerned to ensure that the VHI provides as good a service, if not better, in the next century.</P>
    <P>The VHI is a major business.  In the last financial year £224.5 million was paid out in hospital and consultancy care, £107 million of which was paid to <Col N="835" /> private hospitals, £60.3 million to consultants and £57.2 million to public hospitals.  When account is taken of the number of public hospitals perhaps that balance should be re-examined to ensure that as many people as possible are treated in their home environments. The fact that 35 per cent of our population are members of the VHI is a tribute to the service and the operation of the board.  It is interesting to note that only 12 per cent of the UK population are covered by similiar health insurance.</P>
    <P>As costs are bound to increase, the VHI must endeavour to make the best deal possible with hospitals and consultants. It is important that the Minister maintains some control to ensure that increases are at a minimum.  If costs are too high young people may opt out of health insurance and, while this would provide them with cash in their pockets in the short-term, it would have serious implications for them and the VHI in the longterm.  It is important that the VHI, in consultation with the Minister and the Department, ensures that increases are kept to a minimum and that a maximum number of people are covered by health insurance, thus providing a good balance between private and public health care.  Our public health care is of a high calibre.  If one compares the position in places such as the United States and Canada one must acknowledge the major improvements that have been brought about in health care here, through a mix of private and public services.</P>

      <P>Is maith liom an deis seo a fháil labhairt ar an ábhar seo mar tá cúrsaí sláinte bunúsach dúinn go léir. Tá sé tábhachtach go bhfuil an Bille seo faoi bhráid na Dála anois.  Cuireann sé íontas orm go minic cé chomh mór is a ghlacaimid leis go bhfuil an VHI ann.</P>
      <P>Ta an costas réasúnta dar liomsa agus mar atá ráite tá sé ag freastal ar os cionn milliún den phobal.  Dá ndeánfaí scrúdú air is dócha go bhfaighfí amach go bhfuil sé ag freastal ar bhunáite na ndaoine nach bhfuil cártaí leighis acu.</P>

    <P>Cruthúnas é sin ar cé chomh mór is atá an VHI taréis dul i gcionn ar an bpobal.</P>
    <P>Níl aon amhras ach oiread ach go bhfuil athraithe móra ag teacht ar chúrsaí árachais sláinte sna blianta beaga atá romhainn.</P>
    <P>D'fhéadfaí a rá go bhfuil céim chun tosaigh á thógaint leis an mBille seo. Caithfidh mé a rá áfach go bhfuil beagán íontais orm nach bhfuil ceist na hiomaíochta pléite go hiomlán sa mBille.  Is beag tagairt atá ann dáiríre do cheist na hiomaíochta in óráid an Aire. Sin í an cheist is mó a bheidh an VHI ag díriú air as seo go ceann blianta beaga.</P>
    <P>This is an important Bill.  The VHI has served us well over the years and provides a service about which I have had relatively few complaints from my constituents.  Its monopolistic position enabled it to operate community rating in a true sense.  If the market opens up it may be impossible to prevent cherry-picking. If a new operator comes into the market and applies the same rules as the VHI it would automatically enjoy a huge cost benefit.</P>
    <P>The VHI does not accept members over a certain age but, as it has been in the business since 1957, a large proportion of its membership is over 65 years. Consequently, if new players are allowed to enter the market in future on the same terms &mdash; the Minister appears to favour that without much equivocation &mdash; they would have to accommodate a similar proportion of people over 65 years.  In other words, they could not be allowed to apply the same age restriction rule as, if they did, it would be many years before the age profile of its members would be the same as that of the VHI.  If a new player came into the market and did not accept members over 65, it would be at least 30 or 40 years before the average age profile of its members would be similar to that of the members <Col N="837" /> of the VHI.  If we were to allow a service which has been provided on the basis of equity to be cherry-picked, those who remain with the VHI would be at a cost disadvantage with the result that fewer young people would opt to join and, in turn, the age profile of its members would disimprove.  Costs would also increase and we would find ourselves in a vicious circle.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of the VHI for a long number of years although in recent years I have not availed of its services. Those in good health believe it is important to take out health insurance cover.  They know the time will come when they will have to make a claim and, therefore, appreciate the concept of community rating.</P>
    <P>The VHI cover a family for most services at a reasonable cost.  I estimate that one is not talking about much more than £100 per person per annum in plan C when tax relief is taken into account. If competition was introduced, would a similar service be available, irrespective of age?</P>
    <P>It is obvious that, proportionately, older people are in need of more medical care than younger people.  It is also my experience that families with very young children avail more frequently of the services of the VHI.  There is a need, therefore, to ensure that any new players on the market are not allowed to cherry-pick those whom they consider a good bet.</P>
    <P>While I would like to see the range of packages available widened &mdash; there has been reference to cash cover &mdash; it is important that the core business of the VHI is maintained.  It is akin to the social insurance system to which one pays into to ensure that unexpected medical expenses are covered.  There is a saying in Irish, Ní hé lá na faoithe lá na scolb.  If the VHI did not exist, many people would not make provision for such cover.</P>
    <P>Most of those who do not have a medical card automatically take out voluntary health insurance cover.  This is a simple procedure whereby one buys a certain package.  If competition was <Col N="838" /> introduced, people would be inundated with offers of various packages.  It is my fear that people would see this as an extra they could do without.  We have to guard against this.</P>
    <P>Many employers offer their employees insurance cover through the VHI.  When I was an employer I organised a VHI group scheme for my employees and others in the community. This was convenient for them and simple to operate.  It also meant that, as an employer, I was selling the only product on the market.  They were asked to select the plan they wanted to pay into and those who joined &mdash; we encouraged people to do so &mdash; knew what they were getting.</P>
    <P>If competition was introduced, employers would feel that there was an onus on them to check what was on offer elsewhere on the market.  As a consequence, fewer employers would be willing to collect health insurance payments from their employees as they would be required to make value judgments as to which scheme offered the best value.  This would require much research.  The implications, therefore, of opening up the market need to be further researched.</P>
    <P>It should not be accepted that there is no downside to competition.  When competition was introduced in Europe in some instances the results were good, but in others they were questionable.  In this context, questions were raised by the ESB this week.  In the case of health insurance, I do not believe that VHI cover is expensive when one considers the service provided.  I am not convinced, therefore, that we would end up better off if the market were to be opened up.</P>
    <P>It is curious that competition may be introduced in services which in previous times it was considered, because of the enormous infrastructural costs involved, should be provided by a sole provider, in the case of health insurance by the VHI as we wanted to adopt the concept of community rating.  As I pointed out in another place, there is no evidence to <Col N="839" /> suggest that the introduction of competition in the motor insurance market has resulted in lower premiums.  In tandem with this, two of the most expensive services provided by the State &mdash; education and health &mdash; are being brought more and more under State control.</P>
    <P>We should compare the cost of VHI cover and the service provided with the vast sums of money spent on public medical services.  I have not done the sums, but if one takes the figures I have given, the average, including the Blackrock Clinic and so on, works out at £178 per person per annum.  For this one has access to a private bed and consultant without having to queue.  I often wonder if the State would be better off taking out VHI membership for the remaining two million people and letting the private sector administer the system. That is a great dream.  Under such a system people would be asked to pay an extra £100 per year through the social insurance system in return for which no one would have to queue for a hip replacement operation or heart surgery.</P>
    <P>One of the advantages associated with VHI membership is that people can save time by attending the casualty department at Galvia Hospital in Galway, otherwise one has to wait hours on end to have even the most simple procedure performed.  On the other hand we have noticed that if one rings Galvia Hospital, one can be in and out in an hour.  How, on £178 per annum per person less tax relief, can top private facilities be covered?  If one discards the private bed and non-medical elements, the cost comes down considerably.  At the same time it seems to be impossible to provide services for public patients without huge queues.  That puzzles me and I would love to get a rational explanation for it.  It is about time the public service sector of medicine studied how the private sector manages to operate without constant queuing.  If a private patient requires cardiac surgery or a hip operation, he or she does not have to go to North America or to outside providers but the public sector is always <Col N="840" /> looking for outside facilities to which it can direct the queues.  This question must be answered.</P>
    <P>It seems to be a matter of fundamental principle to so-called socialists in this country that the State provides and the State decides.  A similar type arrangement to that which applies to private patients when choosing consultants should apply to public patients.  I do not see why the State should choose who carries out treatment even if one is going public.  Few of us would allow the State decide what garage would service our motor cars.  It is extraordinary that we think it axiomatic and reasonable that the State should decide who treats our bodies.</P>
    <P>There is an artificial division between public and private medicine.  Private medicine is similar to the social insurance dentist scheme where one picks from a panel.  If a person is eligible for public services, the situation should be similar.  There should be an element of competition meaning that the consultants who were not delivering would not get customers.  Public patients could pick from panels of consultants on various disciplines.  The list for public patients would disappear fast because there would be an incentive for consultants operating in the public service to provide services as they do privately.</P>
    <P>It is important to ensure a geographic spread of medical facilities.  This matter has been raised several times during the recent debate but cannot be repeated too often.  There is not a full cardiac facility available in Galway.  The western region is a huge geographically dispersed region which lacks this basic facility.  Rather than having a number of such facilities in the capital, it would be more important to spread the service on a reasonable geographic and regional basis.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a belief that when one gets to Galway one has reached the most western tip of the country or that Castlebar and Ballina are as far west as one can go.  It is often forgotten that, for many people, Galway, Ballina and Castlebar are 50 or 60 miles to the east <Col N="841" /> on the way from the west to Dublin.  In Connemara, a large number of people live 60 miles west of Galway city and must travel on bad roads.  A journey to Dublin is 200 miles.  Those who make decisions forget that there are people who live more than 130 or 140 miles from the capital.</P>
    <P>I welcome many of the changes proposed. However, as Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn said yesterday, we must take a more fundamental view of the health area.  Many things require change and we should not accept anything at face value.  Rather than introducing competition to a service which has worked well on a community and no profit basis, we should examine the possibility of creating more competition within the provision of health care to ensure that all the people, whether in public service or private service, are provided with the care to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an Bille seo á thabhairt ar aghaidh.  Sílim fhéin go bhfuil sé beagáinín teoranta agus béidh mé ag súil le leasaithe móra ar cursaí sláinte sa tír seo sna blianta atá le teacht.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Health on bringing forward this timely Bill which addresses the important issue of competition in the insurance market, particularly in the context of the EU directive implemented last year.  In an era of increasing competition which is largely dictated by developments in the European Union competition law has become the norm for the providers of public and private services throughout the European Union.  All European countries are finding great difficulty in coming to terms with the completion of the Single Market.  This Bill represents the need for competition in the health <Col N="842" /> sector.  Many people will make comparisons with competition in other insurance markets including motor insurance or life assurance.  Both providers and customers of health insurance wonder if we will find trends in the health insurance area which are similar to those experienced in other insurance sectors.  We have often been told that competition from overseas companies will inevitably provide lower premia for motor and other insurance. Nothing could be further from the truth. Recent experience has clearly indicated that if other factors are not taken into account in our jurisdiction, the directives and legislation we enact to provide competition, lower premia and better value for money are ineffective.  The same situation will arise with premia levels for subscribers to the VHI unless we take fundamental action in respect of cost control.</P>
      <P>Worrying trends developed in the VHI, resulting in the need for a financial package to recover the financial fortunes and reserves of the VHI some years ago.  This clearly indicated that costs were out of line, that premium levels were rising too fast and that the company was out of step with the normal expectations of subscribers as to what they were prepared to pay and what they could afford to pay in order to maintain their level of health care cover. Even though people had tremendous foresight in 1957 in establishing a private health care insurance market through the VHI, we are now in a different era.  We are facing major challenges to maintain the strength and position of VHI in the health insurance market.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health stated that 35 per cent of the population has membership of VHI.  That is a tremendous share of the market by ordinary standards.  I have no doubt the new chief executive, Mr. Duncan, who has much experience in Irish Life and will bring it into the 21st century, will also bring his far-reaching vision to bear on this company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dramatic increase in VHI premia in recent years is an indication that it <Col N="843" /> will soon be out of the reach of the ordinary person.  Premia levels have increased by about 50 per cent in the last eight or nine years in line with the dramatic increase in medical costs. Improved health facilities and technology in the medical area make many operations in hospitals such as the Blackrock Clinic and the Mater Private Hospital very expensive.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to consider section 2 of the Bill, perhaps the most important section, which provides for the development of a greater range of products by the VHI.  As Deputy Ó Cuív rightly pointed out, there is a danger that young people will discontinue membership of VHI if attractive packages are not introduced.  Even though assurances have been given that cherry-picking will not be possible, there is a danger that it will be practised by outside competition. The status of community rating must be maintained and the only way that can be done is by introducing a competitive package for all sectors of the community, particularly those who are least likely to make claims from the VHI, namely, young people.  A regulator is required in the health insurance area to deal with the interests of outside companies in the health insurance market and ensure the VHI is not at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> other companies who wish to become involved in this area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section that provides for an expansion of the board of VHI. In the light of future competition, a tremendous amount of experience, which is available in the State, is needed in the VHI.  There are many excellent people in the commercial world of life assurance and other forms of insurance who could guide VHI into the future. Section 2 also deals with value for money and gives the VHI power to compete with insurance providers.  It also provides for the containment of costs which is important to the future of VHI in terms of retaining the market share it has so valiantly built up over the years.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that the Minister <Col N="844" /> may prevent automatic premia increases, which I welcome.  The informal arrangement that existed between the VHI and the Minister for Health needed to be formalised.  There is always a danger that companies will seek premia increases rather than control costs within the company.  Attention is focused on the need for the board in the first instance to seek the minimum increase in premia.  A Minister for Health cannot be expected to sanction an irresponsible increase if the VHI board has not put its own financial house in order first.</P>
    <P>I support the retention of tax relief on VHI payments, which has been part and parcel of budgetary decisions by successive Ministers for Finance down the years.  The tax regime allows many people to become subscribers to the VHI who could not otherwise afford it. Subscribers are encouraged to continue to be part of a private health care system, without which an extra burden would be placed on the State through the public hospital system.  The tax allowance is very important in making VHI subscriptions attractive.  I hope that in the next budget and future budgets the allowance will continue to assist the VHI in retaining its market share, which is essential if it is to become competitive and build up the financial reserves necessary to meet increased claims in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to declare my interest in this Bill in that I and my family have been members of the VHI for many years.  I first joined when I was employed by Wicklow urban council and it is a great relief to know that one's health expenses are covered in times of need.  I have contributed much more to the VHI down the years than I have claimed.  Insurance schemes operate on the basis that a larger amount is received by way of premia than is paid out in claims; if everybody claimed more than they contributed the scheme would obviously collapse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also have an interest in this matter as chairman of the Joint Committee on <Col N="845" /> Commercial State-sponsored Bodies. The VHI is one of the organisations that has been recently investigated by that committee.  A report containing 19 recommendations was brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It would be useful to make time available to debate reports by committees of the House.  This is one report in which there was great public interest and such a debate would inform people of the work carried out by committees on their behalf.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House incorporates a number of the recommendations &mdash; we would have welcomed acceptance of them all &mdash; by providing for some important changes to the VHI.</P>
    <P>There are a number of reports dealing with the operations of the VHI which cover aspects such as relations between the public and the VHI.  Many of the reports call for the abolition of the tax allowance on VHI payments.  The joint committee, which is representative of all parties, believes the tax allowance is very important to membership and strongly supports its continuation.  I will not repeat Deputy Hogan's argument, but he made a strong case that that recommendation be adopted by the Minister though obviously it is not part of the Bill nor should it be.  The committee recommended the retention of the tax allowance on VHI payments.  There is considerable demand among VHI subscribers for full indemnity against the cost of consultants' fees.  The joint committee endorses the VHI's policy to attain full indemnity.  At present 65 per cent of consultants have agreed to that and are participating in the scheme. People are irritated by being asked when attending a consultant or hospital if they are members of the VHI.  Many subscribers feel it is perceived that a member of the VHI can afford to pay more towards medical expenses as well as paying the hospital bill.</P>
    <P>The joint committee also believes the VHI should publish the names of participating consultants for the benefit of its members.  This was resisted by consultants but despite strong opposition from <Col N="846" /> vested interests their names were published in the joint committee's report.  I recommend to the Minister that their names be published as it is important that members should be informed of the areas of expertise covered by consultants and the number of consultants available in different specialities covered by the VHI.  Members wish to know the full list of the names and addresses of participating consultants and details of their specialities.</P>
    <P>The joint committee does not recommend an attempt to regulate consultants' fees by law.  I note such a provision is not included in the Bill and I am glad the Minister accepted that recommendation.</P>
    <P>The VHI suggested that an official licensing system should be introduced to regulate the use of new medical equipment in hospitals, including public hospitals, to prevent duplication in the provision of expensive equipment.  The joint committee proposes that such a system should be introduced by the appointment of an assessor or ombudsman to deal with claims from consultants and private hospitals.  Such a system is fair.  It operates in the banking and insurance industries and an ombudsman deals with claims related to the operation of the public sector.</P>
    <P>Most members who have spoken on the Bill agree with the recommendation of the joint committee that the VHI's policy on community-rating should be preserved as much as possible to ensure that vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, should not be exposed to large increases in subscriptions.  Given that the VHI has provided a service for 40 years, members who joined it when they were young and healthy may now be heavily dependent on it.  That sector represents an increasing number of members and it requires the Minister to ensure that the community-rating policy is maintained even in the face of severe competition that may result from opening up the insurance area as a result of the implementation of the 1994 European Directive.</P>
    <P>The joint committee recommends <Col N="847" /> that the VHI should not be involved in the ownership or operation of hospitals except for the most compelling reasons. It cannot be the payer and the operator at the same time.  The Minister should ensure that important guideline is adhered to in his dealings with the VHI. However, the scope of the VHI's activity should be extended to cover a variety of health insurance related activities, including preventative health programmes, cash schemes, holiday insurance and other related services, and section 2 provides for that.  I am sure we would all agree that if the VHI provided such a variety of health insurance cover the cost of members' subscriptions could be kept down to some extent.  It would also ensure that members of the VHI would only have to deal with one insurance company for a variety of insurance packages.</P>
    <P>The joint committee recommends that the VHI should become a State company.  That does not appear to be included in the Bill, but the committee considered it an important recommendation and I understand it has been taken up.  The committee also recommended that the number of directors on the VHI board should be increased to nine and I note the Minister has provided that the number will be increased from five to 12.  The joint committee considered that members' interests should be widely represented on the increased membership on the board.  The joint committee recommended that the VHI should review its organisation and personnel with a view to changing from a monopoly to a competitive organisation in the open market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak on this Bill to extend and update the 1957 Health Insurance Act.  I welcome the proposals to develop new health insurance products. I hope the implementation of the EU directive in the area of non-life insurance to open up the market will not lead to higher health insurance premium costs.  I also hope the new players <Col N="848" /> to be allowed into that market will not cream off the crop and that the competition which should be generated will not lead to increased subscriptions for VHI members.  If competitors were allowed to pick the best and leave the rest it would lead to higher subscriptions for VHI members.</P>
      <P>The impression from the Minister's speech was that the VHI should operate at arm's length, but a reading of the Bill indicates that the Minister must have a short arm as he seems to have his hand on the tiller.  I would like as many foreign insurance companies as possible to enter the private sector, an area where there should be more competition to reduce health insurance premiums.  We should expect young people to pay for their own health care through membership of the VHI and in return they should get a higher tax allowance.  That is the health care area which we should be addressing.  I want to pay tribute to the role of the VHI in providing private medical insurance, especially for those who, through failing health, have made excessive demands.  As a contributor for many years to VHI as a premium holder, I am aware of its benefits and agree with a previous speaker who said he had probably paid in more than he took out.  None of us will have any quibble with that because we knew we must have good cover, which is important.  In my experience, there would have been severe hardship in many families down the years if they had not that cover and the service which it provided.</P>
      <P>There is an ingrained fear of a breakdown in health and it can cause families great concern unless reasonably priced cover is available.  Such cover eases people's concern considerably and it also eases their minds.  In the public sector and the GMS which is different, this is noticeable.  When you meet people who may be just outside the qualification limits for a medical card, although they may have a good pension they are concerned to have cover to ensure they get necessary treatment during their life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that opening the <Col N="849" /> market may not lower premia and that the tendency would be to compete more on services than on price.  This House does not expect reduced costs in whatever legislation we bring before it because while there have often been promises of the reduction in costs through various legislation, the outcome by and large is a substantial increase in costs.</P>
    <P>In no area have costs increased as much as in the health field, they have spiralled from year to year.  Despite all the health programmes, we have continued increased demands on visits to GPs from patients on the GMS, increased hospital admissions and drug costs.  I have been a member of a health board for over 20 years and I have consistently made recommendations and statements on the costs of drugs.</P>
    <P>The substantial increase in VHI premia over the last number of years was outlined here yesterday.  The costs are spiralling and nothing seems to have been done in the health field to tackle this problem.  We may bring in legislation to cover the VHI but the root cause needs to be tackled.  According to the Minister in 1980, VHI subscriptions amounted to £25.2 million with claims of £19.6 million, by 1995 the corresponding figures were £232.6 million and £233.1 million respectively.  That is a big increase which came at a time when new procedures and facilities were being provided and still the costs spiralled. Irrespective of hi-tech or new procedures in the hospital field, the cost is astronomical.  Being a member of a health board and listening to these consultants who have many subspecialities etc., it seems we will be providing many more jobs to do practically the same thing and the end product is that it will cost more and more.</P>
    <P>A few years ago, I was greatly concerned about the cut in the North Western Health Board by the Department of Health.  The reply to a question which I put down in October 1991 to elicit the <i>per capita</i> expenditure in each health board area was as follows: Eastern, £453; Midland, £406; Mid-Western, <Col N="850" /> £349; North-Eastern, £301, which is the figure for my health board; North-Western, £501; South-Eastern, £393; Southern, £350; and Western, £462.  That caused a lot of concern, we discussed it at length with the Minister for Health at the time and received an assurance that things would change.  When the health Act came into operation in 1987 and with the Minister giving <i>pro rata</i> increases as opposed to increases by virtue of need, it left the North-Eastern Health Board, which was starting from a low base, lagging behind.  I remember we went to the Minister to put our case strongly to him and were promised everything under the sun; the situation would change even before we got back to Monaghan.</P>
    <P>The reply on 24 October 1995 to a similar question regarding the health boards which I put down was as follows: Eastern, £702; Midland, £512; Mid-Western, £513; North-Eastern, £447; North-Western, £658; South-Eastern, £527; Southern, £536; and Western, £657.  In those years, the increase in the Eastern Health Board was £249 per head which is almost as much as the North-Eastern Health Board received in 1991.  The increases over the period were as follows: Eastern, £249; Midland, £106; Mid-Western, £164; North-Eastern, £146; North-Western, £157; South-Eastern, £134; Southern, £186; and Western, £195.</P>
    <P>In that reply in the Official Report of 24 October 1995; Vol. 457, Col. 1035, the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan <i>(Limerick East),</i> mentioned the demographic factors but the difference between any one of the eight health boards would have been small.  The Minister mentioned &ldquo;the present stage of development of the services&rdquo; which is the crunch issue.  The only way in which the Minister will develop the services is through funding and health boards, which are far behind in so far as occupational therapists, speech therapists and district nurses &mdash; and there is a serious imbalance from health board to health board &mdash; are concerned, can only address the situation with money.  The <Col N="851" /> onus is on a Minister, irrespective of which portfolio he or she holds, to ensure even-handedness.  One does not expect this to be brought about over a year but I thought in 1991 I would not be saying in 1995 that the situation is still uneven, unbalanced and unfair.</P>
    <P>Basically, that is the way it is when the Eastern Health Board has £702 <i>per capita,</i> an increase of £249.  In that health board, I believe a person can walk into a private operator, take an eye test and it is paid for by the health board.  It is wrong that they are able to bring their spectacles home with them on the same day while people in my health board area have to wait up to six or 12 months.  The only activity many old age pensioners can enjoy is reading the daily paper and I am very annoyed that the necessary funding has not been provided for them to have their eyes tested.</P>
    <P>Given that my county had the best hospital in the country and a good psychiatric hospital, the county council decided to invest the money in capital development.  As a result the other three counties in the North-Eastern Health Board area have been allocated funding, to which they are rightly entitled, for certain facilities and we have suffered in terms of the funding provided for such facilities.</P>
    <P>I understand it has been decided not to proceed with the reduction in cover for psychiatric patients. One of my constituents told me that if the length of cover had been reduced from 90 to 40 days he would have had to pay an extra £3,500 in hospital charges earlier this year.  I am glad it has been decided not to proceed with this proposal.</P>
    <P>The VHI provides cover for 35 per cent of the population.  This is a very high percentage given that only 12 per cent of the population in the UK are members of the voluntary scheme there. Deputy Ó Cuív said that it may be beneficial to privatise the scheme and let the State pay the VHI or a similar body to provide this service.  There would be <Col N="852" /> nothing wrong in doing this and it certainly would not cost any more than the public sector payments under the GMS. The Minister said that he is considering setting up a health care consultative forum.  Given the cost of health care and the requirement for new services, such a forum should be established as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been very close co-operation between the North Western and the Southern Health Boards in Northern Ireland and the North Eastern and North Western Health Boards here.  This is an ideal partnership as the health boards cover all the areas along both sides of the Border. There has been much co-operation in terms of the facilities provided and I hope this can be extended, particularly in the area of community care for old people.  For example, it should be possible for old people in the South to visit day care centres in the North and <i>vice versa.</i> In the general hospital sector, the ENT consultants in Omagh Hospital attend the out-patient departments of the Cavan-Monaghan hospital grouping and carry out the operations.  This type of co-operation will not only improve the quality of service provided but will also reduce costs.  We have visited the trust hospitals in the North and consideration should be given to setting up similar hospitals here.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I have been concerned about the increases in premiums in recent years.  Nevertheless, I congratulate the VHI on the efficient service it has provided since its foundation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.  As a member of the Mid-Western Health Board I thank him for the tremendous improvements carried out in Limerick Regional Hospital.  The £20 million expansion announced by him is very much needed in the hospital.  His work is as appreciated in other areas as it is in the Mid-Western Health Board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a specific interest in this Bill as I was a member of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies when it <Col N="853" /> examined the VHI in detail.  Some of the deficiencies identified at that time have been rectified in the Bill.  As Deputy Kavanagh said, the committee felt at the time that the board was much too small with five members.  I, therefore, welcome the proposal to increase the membership to 12.  Given the rapid changes in the health care sector, it is extremely important to ensure that the proper professional personnel are at the top level to guide the VHI into the future.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the increased cost of health care.  It is recognised that we have an ageing population, which gives rise to increased costs in the health area.  In addition, the use of expensive sophisticated technology also gives rise to increased costs. In recent years an additional burden has been placed on the health service, that is, the high cost of insurance for medical practitioners, be they doctors in general practice or surgeons.  As in America, there has been an increase in medical litigation and local GPs talk about the escalating cost of insurance which is essential to protect them and their clients.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley and I referred some years ago to the VHI's resistance to giving recognition to new private hospitals in the mid-west region.  Various packages were prepared with regard to the principle of establishing a private hospital in the area and it would appear these have been resisted by the VHI at all stages.  I understand another proposal is being prepared but it will never get off the ground if the VHI do not provide funding for those who avail of that facility and do not recognise the hospital afterwards.</P>
    <P>In the Mid-Western Health Board area many VHI members may decide not to go to the local regional hospital but to avail of facilities in private hospitals.  They will rightly say they are playing an enhanced membership rate in order to provide for that.  We have a private facility in Barrington's Hospital where there are a number of consultants who, in many cases, refer their patients <Col N="854" /> to the regional hospital.  In other cases the regional hospital may not have the required specialist services available and they refer those patients to various private hospitals in Cork, Galway, Kilkenny and Dublin.  This is unfortunate because in the Mid-Western Health Board area there is a population over 310,000 people, many of whom are VHI members.  A segment of the population are disenfranchised in comparison with other parts of the country.  Perhaps the VHI will address that issue, especially in view of the competition which may arise in the future if others come into this market.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that community rating should continue.  We cannot have new health care companies coming in to the Irish market and creaming off the younger segment of the population, with fewer inherent risks, quoting an unrealistic rate and not necessarily conforming as we would wish.  It is important if any health care company wishes to operate in the Irish market that it establishes a profile on age structure and the type of populations etc. which the VHI have to contend with in framing their premiums.</P>
    <P>Most politicians encounter situations where because of changed circumstances, probably due to redundancy, a person who was part of a group membership in VHI may decide some months later for economic reasons not to continue their membership.  When they get a heart attack or some other serious illness they realise the importance of VHI membership which they no longer have.  In many cases such people are not eligible for a medical card, yet cannot afford VHI membership.  A segment of the community is trapped in that position.  I have encountered many instances of hardship concerning people who were members for many years but, because of changed economic circumstances, are no longer members of the VHI.  Having approached the VHI regarding the merits of their cases I have found it to be tolerant.  In other cases there may be difficulties in regard to giving some concession or honouring <Col N="855" /> their long time membership.  There is a segment of the population which is not eligible for a medical card and which the VHI does not cover.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to bring to the attention of the Minister the case of a VHI member who is admitted to hospital and has an accident there which may prolong their stay by a further couple of weeks.  I would not expect the VHI to be liable for an accident which happened in the hospital.  I will illustrate this by giving two examples.  One is the case of a VHI member who was hospitalised for tinnitus and was put on a trolley, left unattended and fell off and had to go to an orthopaedic hospital for three weeks.  Having been admitted to hospital for tinnitus this person came out badly bruised and injured as a result of their experience in the general hospital.  I am still awaiting a full explanation from the hospital.  Last week a person was admitted for dialysis, for which, I understand, a certain amount of supervision is required as the person may be weak afterwards.  The person fell and had to get 15 stitches.  One can imagine the frustrations of people who are admitted to a health care environment and come out worse than when they were admitted.  Most of these people are VHI members.  I do not think the VHI is liable.  The health board should share whatever costs are incurred.  Those two examples left me rather bemused by the health care system.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are members of the VHI appreciate the protection it offers. If we contrast the health care system here with that in the United States we have a fair system.  Medical card holders do not have to wait as long as in the past for cataract and hip operations due to Government decisions regarding waiting lists.  People who have had a cataract operation are very happy with the outcome and are full of praise for the health care system.</P>
    <P>People who are not eligible for the medical card system may avail of the VHI, but some are unable to afford it. <Col N="856" /> Some take a gamble in the hope that nothing will happen.  Does the VHI provide a simple package where, in tandem with the health board, it caters for a person who is not eligible for a medical card to ensure they do not have the worries associated with illness at a later date?</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, which is a step in the right direction.  The VHI, because of the great work it has done, needs to be protected from competitive forces.  If the market place is fair, if competition is fair and if whoever comes into the Irish market can operate on the same terms, the VHI will prosper and flourish into the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMorley" hpid="Mr. Morley Mr. Morley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to express a few thoughts on this very important Bill.  I congratulate the VHI on its great success since its foundation in 1957.  I thank it for the support it has given to many thousands of people in times of illness and in need of medical treatment which they would not have been able to afford without VHI membership.  Very few of its members have not had to call on its services.  I endorse what Deputy Finucane said in praise of the VHI.  I endorse his call for an examination of the scheme so that those who are marginally above the threshold for a medical card could participate in an inexpensive scheme that would tide them over in the event of illness. I hope that the Minister will be able to act on this suggestion.</P>
      <P>It is no harm to recall that on its foundation 40 years ago, the VHI with State support stepped in to provide a public service which the private insurance sector appeared unwilling or unable to provide at the time.  Times change for everyone and the VHI is no exception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill strengthens the legislative and structural basis of the VHI board to enable it to compete with the many insurers who are now free &mdash; and obviously willing &mdash; to offer a product under the Health (Amendment) Act, 1994 which implements the EU directive. The legislation enables the VHI to <Col N="857" /> meet that challenge.  I am pleased that the Minister is committed to preserving the principle of community rating, open enrolement and life time cover.  The VHI operates under this principle and has been able to offer affordable health insurance during the past 40 years.  Risk rated insurance cover should never be contemplated by the Government now or at any time in the future because of its unfairness, particularly to old people and those who are chronically ill.  To preserve community rating will demand great resolution on the part of the Minister and the Government, but I am sure they will rise to the challenge.</P>
    <P>I criticise the steep rise in VHI premiums in recent years, particularly in the late eighties, with the concurrent reduction in benefits in certain cases. Balanced billing is another protracted and unsatisfactory arrangement.  I am aware of factors outside the control of the VHI which account for this and I trust that this legislation will place the board in a better position to deal with the pressure for future premia increases and support its efforts at cost containment generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister emphasised the need for providers of health care and insurance companies to be more transparent and accountable about the services provided to patients.  It is clear there is a common interest between the provider, the insurer and the member patient.  Those who provide the service should be accountable to members.  They are there to serve the patient, not vice versa.  In this context I welcome the establishment of a members' advisory council by the VHI.</P>
    <P>I am critical of the VHI's recent attempt to limit insurance cover for those with mental illness.  My final criticism is of the capping arrangement that has been agreed nationally between the VHI and the Department of Health on the treatment of patients with VHI cover in hospitals.  As a member of the Western Health Board I know the hospitals in our region alone incurred a loss of £500,000 in the past two years as a result of this arrangement.  It has led <Col N="858" /> to the anomaly where private patients are being treated virtually free of charge in hospitals at the expense of public patients.  The hospital is not being compensated for the service it has provided to the patients once it has reached its cap allocation, yet the consultants who treat the patient are remunerated.  This puts pressure on hospital services which have had to be curtailed and this in turn impacts on public patients who are denied early treatment to which they are entitled and have to go on a waiting list.  I am aware that changes have been made and the chief executives of the various health boards will negotiate with the VHI directly, not with the Department of Health.  I trust this will be more favourable to hospitals in the western area which continue to be under the greatest pressure to meet patient demands because of inadequate funding by the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>As well as recommending the appointment of Mr. Duncan as chief executive officer, the voluntary health review group recommended the enlargement of the board from five to 12 members and a change in its corporate status to that of a limited company. It is entirely reasonable for the Minister to leave the change of status to another day when the proposed changes to enhance the range of expertise at board and management level have been successfully effected.  I question the wisdom of enlarging the board membership from five to 12.  I know a perfectly good reason has been given, namely that the board should have available to it a depth and range of knowledge and experience not only in health but in the actuarial, financial and marketing fields appropriate to the company operating an insurance business.  Surely this expertise could be made available to the board without extending its membership. My fear is that when the Minister is appointing members to the board he will come under intense pressure to have the board reflect predominantly vocational rather than business interests.  This would not be desirable.</P>
    <P>Section 2 enables the VHI to offer <Col N="859" /> new health insurance products to cover situations other than the traditional indemnity it gave members against medical expenses incurred in the treatment of injury, disease and illness.  The fact that the VHI has attracted 1.3 million people or 35 per cent of the population to avail of its product against the 12 per cent in the United Kingdom who have health insurance cover is testimony to the success of the VHI.  However, the VHI will face competition and in order to survive it will be compelled to offer packages comprising a combination of indemnity and cash cover.  This in turn will enable it to target young people, and this is necessary for the success of the organisation that offers cover on a community rating rather than risk basis. In the interests of its clientele it is reasonable that the Minister should retain an influence in the overall direction in which the board develops and in the implementation of any premia increases sought from time to time.</P>
    <P>Many Members referred to the increasing cross-Border co-operation between the health boards nationwide, a most desirable development which should continue to be encouraged with its enormous potential benefit for the provision of health care services for everyone North and South.  I am sure the Minister and Government will spare no effort in further encouraging such co-operation for the benefit of patients and their requisite services.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill are geared at enabling the Voluntary Health Insurance Board provide its health care services to a modern society, the first introduced since the 1957 Act which established the VHI.  I am certain its provisions will enable the board to gear itself to meet any challenge presented by its competitors while continuing to provide its members with a satisfactory health insurance scheme.  I wish the board every success in its future operations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill and the opportunity to <Col N="860" /> make a few brief comments on it.  The importance of the operations of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board nationwide is evident from its membership of one third of our population, its subscription income of £232 million being further evidence of its key role in the provision of health care for our citizens.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to a matter mentioned by my colleague, Deputy Leonard, the potential for co-operation between North and South, of particular importance to Members like Deputy Leonard and me who live on the Fermanagh border, and my constituents residing closer to the Erne Hospital in Enniskillen than to Cavan General Hospital.  It is my understanding that the cost of availing of VHI cover in hospitals in the North &mdash; comprising part of the province of Ulster &mdash; is prohibitive, commensurate with those required by the Mater Private Hospital or the Blackrock Clinic.  Surely it is within the competence of the Department of Health, its counterpart in the North and the VHI to make the VHI health care scheme available to those wishing to avail of its cover and services in the North.</P>
      <P>There is much talk at present of co-operation between North and South, a most welcome and necessary development which must be encouraged at all levels and which has been much in evidence in recent years in many areas of activity, such as development of the arts and the protection and maintenance of our common environment.  Unfortunately, all facets of life North and South are not easily amenable to such co-operation but there is an unanswerable case for the provision of health care services on a joint North/South basis.</P>
      <P>The Joint Framework Document drawn up by the Irish and British Governments earlier this year, in its outline of North-South institutions referred to the need and opportunities to develop constructive relationships between North and South and had this to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is envisaged that, in determining <Col N="861" /> functions to be discharged or overseen by the North-South body, whether by executive action, harnonisation or consultation, account will be taken of:</P>
    <P>(i)  the common interest in a given matter on the part of both parts of the island; or</P>
    <P>(ii)  the mutual advantage of addressing a matter together; or</P>
    <P>(iii)  the mutual benefit which may derive from it being administered by the North-South body; or</P>
    <P>(iv)  the achievement of economies of scale and the avoidance of unnecessary duplication of effort.</P>
    <P>Referring specifically to health the document stated:</P>
    <P>Health might include co-operative ventures in medical, para-medical and nursing training, cross-Border provision of hospital services and major emergency accident planning.</P>
    <P>On this small island of ours the provision of health care matches each of those aspirations.  Indeed no other area of activity could reap such immediate, beneficial effects from such co-operation North an South through the joint provision of such services.  Such developments would be enormously practicable, immediately visible and available to all sections of society regardless of their different traditions.</P>
    <P>I compliment the officials of the North Eastern Health Board on their initiative in having pushed out the boundaries of such co-operation.  For example, the Western Health and Social Services Board located at the Tyrone County Hospital in Omagh provides ear, nose and throat services for those living in the Cavan-Monaghan catchment area.  Such co-operation in the delivery of public health care services must be complemented by sensible, practical arrangements in order to render private medical insurance cover possible.  Existing levels of co-operation between the North Western Health <Col N="862" /> Board and the North Eastern Health Board and their counterparts across the Border must be encouraged.  I must applaud the initiative of those officials North and South who, when the political climate was not as favourable as at present, pushed out those boundaries and developed what became known as the Ballyconnell Agreement of 1992, drawn up between four health boards, two in the North and two in the South. That agreement referred to specific areas where co-operation should exist, covering an area with a combined population of one million.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, that agreement recommended that such co-operation should obtain through the exploitation of opportunities for co-operation in the planning and provision of services, the improvement of health and well-being of the population of that catchment area and assist Border areas in overcoming their special developmental problems arising from their relative isolation within national economies and the European Union as a whole through the promotion of Government and European Union awareness of and support for this process.  It also envisaged the exploitation of all opportunities for joint working or sharing of resources where such would be of mutual advantage and the joint procurement of any funding available from the European Union.</P>
    <P>The people involved in drawing up that agreement were dealing in a very practical manner with the daily problems arising within Border areas, where the respective population catchments within the two jurisdictions may be located nearer to a hospital or health care centre in the neighbouring jurisdiction. That sharing of resources for much of the present very expensive medical care required must be pursued.</P>
    <P>The Minister or his Minister of State may have had meetings with their counterparts in the North but, if not, I would strongly recommend such consultation. I assure them that public representatives like myself who represent people in Border areas are very keen that such practical sensible co-operation <Col N="863" /> be developed.  It has enormous potential because in no other area of activity will people more readily see its effects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to endorse the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies chaired by Deputy Kavanagh on the VHI.  The report informed the work of preparing this Bill and was a valuable contribution.  The more debate on this issue the better because 35 per cent of the population are affected by the VHI's policies.</P>
      <P>The contributions made to this debate signal that there is no disagreement on the need for change in the legislation governing the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  There exists between all of us the common objective of securing the future of the VHI as a financially sound insurance undertaking having a strong commercial ethos and orientation towards customer service.</P>
      <P>While there are other, perhaps more radical, ways to proceed in changing the shape of the VHI, orderly and measured change is what the circumstances of the VHI require at this time.  In addition to this a commitment and determination exists on my part to explore and implement such future changes as may be identified as beneficial to the VHI.  I am satisfied that the Bill, together with the ongoing revamping of the VHI's management structure, represents a genuine momentum towards the better positioning of the VHI to succeed in an open market environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened to the suggestions made in this debate and the perspective others have on how the VHI should develop.  I will ensure that these are given the fullest consideration in terms of amendments which may be brought forward in Committee.  The country will be best served by a financially strong and commercially vibrant VHI.  It is essential that this objective be achieved most directly in the interests of its members but also to maintain the public/private health service mix and to <Col N="864" /> secure the continuation of a strong and stable private health insurance market.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer again, in brief, to some of the matters raised in the debate.  In its 1994 Budget Statement the then Government announced that income tax relief on health insurance premiums would in future only be allowable at the standard rate.  In reaching this decision the Government had been convinced by the argument that all taxpayers should be on an equal footing, irrespective of income, as regards the extent of support given through the tax system.  It also had regard to the recommendations of various expert groups, including the Commission on Taxation, the Culliton group and NESC, that discretionary tax reliefs should be curtailed.</P>
    <P>It has been the policy of successive Governments to move towards the standardisation of tax reliefs.  This remains the situation and it is not intended to depart from the broad thrust of taxation policy in respect of the level of relief applicable to health insurance premiums.</P>
    <P>The publication of a White Paper on health insurance was suggested.  At this stage we have had the introduction of the Health Insurance Act, 1994 and comprehensive draft regulations deriving therefrom have been the subject of considerable and extensive consultation with interested parties.  It is, therefore, difficult to see how this can now be regarded as the optimum time to move on a White Paper on health insurance.  It can be looked at when there are better indications as to the future shape of the market.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was made yesterday that a statutory forum be established to represent VHI consumers' interests.  I prefer to see how the Members' Advisory Council recently announced by the VHI will operate.  An informal council is more flexible than a statutory scheme and I believe the VHI initiative will be successful.</P>
    <P>The exemption of health insurance from the scope of the Competition Act is wholly inconsistent with the thrust of Government policy to foster an open, <Col N="865" /> competitive and efficient economy both for the benefit of the consumer and the better operation of the economy generally. I am not aware that any Government, whatever its political make-up, regarded the Act as other than applying to the economy as a whole, without favour or exception.  One clear consequence of our membership of the European Community, now the European Union, was to fully embrace both the principles and mechanisms of a fully competitive single market.  Obviously, each sector could make its own good case as to why it should be an exception to the rules of competition.  Exempting any sector of the economy from competition law, let alone one as significant as health insurance, would be detrimental to the effective operation of a key instrument of economic policy which the Competition Act represents.  The avoidance of abuse of dominant position is the key, not exclusion from the Competition Act itself.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health was asked yesterday for an up-date on the position of the draft health insurance regulations. My Department is in discussions with the European Commission on the draft regulations and I hope these discussions will be completed in the near future.  As part of these discussions with the Commission, the Minister has sought enhancement in regard to the original proposals for psychiatric cover. My Department is pursuing that objective during these discussions.</P>
    <P>Regarding the issue of VHI premium increases I would like to refer to the mention made by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn to the 18 per cent change over the past 14 months.  During the past two years the average overall increase has been 15 per cent, with 9 per cent in August 1994 and 6 per cent in September 1995.  The Deputy may have misconstrued the figures because the August 1994 increases in Plans C, D and E, which have 20 per cent of VHI members, were between 9 per cent and 12 per cent while increases in Plans A and B, which have 80 per cent of members, were between 6 and 9 per <Col N="866" /> cent.  It is important to be clear that the overall average increase in premiums to VHI members was not 18 per cent.</P>
    <P>In relation to the September 1995 increase, the first within this Government's period in office, the VHI indicated in July last that it proposed to implement a price increase of 6 per cent with effect from 1 September 1995.  The Minister for Health concurred with this proposal because of the financial position of the VHI.</P>
    <P>The VHI review group disagreed with the making of appointments to the board on a representative basis and it held that such appointments would be inconsistent with the commercial ethos which it regarded as essential.  While this approach may be too absolute, it has much to recommend it.  Clearly the rationale for expanding the size of the VHI board is that its composition should reflect the balance of skills and expertise appropriate to the board of a commercial insurance company.  It would, in my view, fall short of this objective, which is so important to the commercialisation of the VHI, if the composition of the board was to have more to do with the representation of interests rather than the organisation's business management needs.</P>
    <P>I consider that the VHI should not engage in activities beyond the scope of health insurance.  The VHI has not made any proposal to me that its role should be fundamentally changed for it to own and/or run hospitals.  Apart altogether from other considerations, the VHI is not currently sufficiently well placed financially to undertake any such broadening of its operations.  Health insurance, and not hospital ownership and operation, is the VHI's area of expertise.  There would also be a major question of conflict of interest and equity in its dealings with other providers if the VHI itself were to become a provider.</P>
    <P>This Bill is about empowering the VHI to develop and achieve success in a competitive market environment.  It is clear that for so long as the VHI <Col N="867" /> remains a monopoly it must be accountable to the Minister.  This has been the attitude of the House as demonstrated in the past in terms of questions and motions about the activities of the VHI. The Minister, as the 100 per cent shareholder, must have a role in relation to the policies and strategies of the VHI which have the potential to impact on 35 per cent of our population.  Accordingly, it is appropriate that the Bill should provide for the Minister to have an involvement where such major issues as premium increases and new products are being contemplated by the VHI. Indeed, the 1957 Act provided for the Minister to have a role in approving the scope and extent of schemes of health insurance and the Minister has also been consulted on a custom and practice basis when premium increases were in prospect.</P>
    <P>The Bill is concerned with providing the capacity for the VHI to raise its threshold of commercial preparedness in order to better compete in the open health insurance market.  The focus is clearly on the commercialisation of the VHI.  The powers being provided under section 2 are merely intended to put the VHI on an even footing with commercial undertakings generally in regard to the conduct of its business arrangements with providers.  A statutory dispute resolution or arbitration system is the characteristic of a public sector type system and is not necessarily the commercial model which is needed in the VHI's case.  Furthermore, the VHI would be put at a considerable disadvantage in the open market as newcomers would not be bound by such a system.  This would run contrary to the whole thrust of the Bill which is to put the VHI on an equal footing with competitors.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, open to the VHI and those representing providers to come to a mutually acceptable arrangement for the referral of disputes, which may arise from time to time and which cannot be resolved through direct negotiation between the parties, to an independent third party for determination.  I do not <Col N="868" /> propose to provide for any such arrangements under statute nor at public expense.</P>
    <P>I propose to request the enlarged VHI board to address the future corporate status of the board.  It should be understood, however, that any change of such a nature would only be considered in terms of the VHI remaining 100 per cent State owned.</P>
    <P>Another issue raised during the debate was the licensing of facilities and equipment.  The term &ldquo;medical technology&rdquo; is often associated with equipment but its true meaning embraces all methods of providing treatment to patients.  This is a health service issue rather than a specific health insurance one and is therefore not directly appropriate to the Bill.</P>
    <P>This could be a difficult area to regulate from medical and legal standpoints. It is generally the position that technology introduced becomes quickly diffused throughout the system whereas the evaluation of its efficacy and outcomes may often follow far behind, possibly in terms of years.  Health care technology assessment has become an area of growing activity in Europe.  My Department is considering arrangements for technology assessment with a view to identifying the model best suited to the Irish scene.  Furthermore, the Healthcare Consultative Forum, which I mentioned in my speech, will consider, <i>inter alia</i>, the development of Protocols on the enhancement of technological capacity in the health services.</P>
    <P>I already informed the Seanad some weeks ago that I am committed to community rating and the Minister made a similar commitment in the Dáil.  It is a system which has helped the very vulnerable groups such as the elderly and chronically ill.  I will resist any attempt to undermine community rating and the draft health insurance regulations help the system in a number of technical apsects.  Anybody who competes in this market will do so in a context whereby if they try to cherrypick customers they will pay into a risk equalisation fund; this will prevent such products from <Col N="869" /> weakening the community rating system.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the VHI should not structure its benefits to such an extent that it pays even more for costly procedures but neglects opportunities for lower cost care perhaps in a community setting.  An overdependence on expensive technology will be ultimately destructive of the VHI and health insurance generally.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that all insurers will be clear on what they are offering their members.  Recent experience in the UK suggests that the small print is often overlooked by the consumer and companies can abuse their position.  Under section 13 of the Health Insurance Act, 1994 I have powers to regulate advertising and promotion of health insurance business if there is a problem for consumers. I will keep a close eye on such advertising and promotion to make sure that members understand what is being sold to them.  I may add that my Department has established close links with the insurance ombudsman in regard to health insurance and those contacts will continue.</P>
    <P>The Bill specifically allows the VHI to develop new products and move away from a complete dependence on indemnity products.  I am anxious that the VHI look at all possible areas of product development and I believe that an extended board will have an important role in that area.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents a significant strengthening in the commercial hand of the VHI with further changes to be looked at and to be implemented should circumstances warrant.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this technical Bill which is very important in an Irish context.  I thank the Minister of State for introducing the Bill and also for his detailed explanation of its contents.</P>
      <P>This Bill is of importance to Irish business and to organisations carrying out their business here or planning to establish operations here.  To date, the inability of service organisations to register their names, brands and logos has been a significant omission and cannot have been helpful in the establishment of the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Trademarks &mdash; and their registration &mdash; with the protection they afford are a matter of serious concern to industrial and commercial interests.  Brands, as they are better known, have become a major business asset.  Brands, which cover goods of all shapes and sizes, will now embrace services for the first time. Members will appreciate that the value of some international brands stretches into billions of dollars.  Brands, whether international, national or local, are important to proprietors and of interest to their competitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Bill is of a somewhat technical nature, it is necessary for the protection of brand owners and will provide them with rights of redress when their proprietorial rights or interests are infringed.  It is worth reflecting that a trade mark or brand is a tangible representation of entrepreneurial skills, <Col N="871" /> ideals, thoughts, initiatives and inventiveness.</P>
    <P>As my party's deputy spokesperson on enterprise and employment, I congratulate those who have created brands suitable for registration.  In particular, I recognise the courage and initiative of our young and emerging entrepreneurs who have recently registered brands and those people establishing or developing new businesses here.  I ask these people not to consider brand registration as another piece of bureaucracy but as a goal achieved toward fulfilling their aspirations and ambitions in commercial life.</P>
    <P>On 20 March 1883 a number of countries signed what has become known as the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property.  That this convention is still a basis for modern regulation and legislation is a credit to its signatories. While the emphasis was then placed on industrial property, today intellectual property has become a significant part of Irish, European and International law.  Intellectual property embraces three areas: patents, copyrights and trademarks.  These three are interrelated. Our Patents Act was brought up to date in 1992.  The Copyright Act, 1963, and the Trade Marks Act, 1963 are in need of modernisation and advancement.  I am interested in the proposal of the Minister of State to bring copyright legislation up to date as it is important that the three prongs of intellectual property law are kept abreast of each other in terms of world developments.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to repeal the Trade Marks Act, 1963.  It is proposed to incorporate the European Council directive of December 1988 and regulations of December 1993 relating to trade marks and the Community trademark into the legislation.  The Bill will give effect to the Madrid Protocol relating to the international registration of marks, which was signed on 28 June 1989 and to certain provisions of the Paris Convention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> The Madrid Protocol stems from the Madrid Arrangement 1981 covering an international system for the registration of trade marks.  Ireland concluded the Madrid Protocol on 27 June 1989 and agreed to incorporate this in Irish legislation by 28 December 1991.  To accommodate certain states this deadline was extended to 31 December 1992 in exceptional circumstances.  We are only three years behind the extended deadline.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Minister of State to incorporate these European directives in Irish law by means of this Bill is correct.  While he could have achieved the same result by way of statutory instrument under the European Economic Community Act, 1972, as amended, this would not give the House and industry the same opportunity to debate the proposed changes in Irish law.  I note that the Minister retains the right, and properly so, to prescribe rules under which matters such as fees and registration will be dealt with.  Perhaps the Minister will advise the House if significant changes in the current fee structures are proposed.  While I appreciate the cost factor involved in the registration of trade marks I am concerned about small businesses who will have more forms to fill and paperwork to deal with.  This will involve them in further costs.</P>
    <P>The Bill is pro-business and much more flexible than the previous Act.  It gives better protection in cases where rights are infringed and at the same time makes it easier to establish that such rights have been infringed.  The inclusion of &ldquo;services&rdquo; which embraces so many sectors including communications, tourism, banking, insurance, finance, etc., is overdue but welcome. The fact that international financial organisations could not register in Ireland heretofore would not have been of assistance to the International Financial Services Centre.  Penalties which heretofore were of a civil nature are now of a criminal kind.  I welcome that and I do not think the balance has moved too far in the other direction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="873" /> The owners of brands in Ireland who up to now had to register them abroad on a country by country basis will have two additional options.  One of these is to register with the World Intellectual Property Organisation &mdash; WIPO.  This United Nations agency, based in Geneva, could then make registrations in countries nominated by the brand owner.  This will assist Irish business although for the foreseeable future the WIPO registration system will continue to exclude major countries such as the United States and Japan.</P>
    <P>The United States, for example, with its Patent Office in Washington DC and its nominated ports of entry for goods entering the United States is concerned to have its own measures to control and restrict counterfeiting, which is a major international problem.</P>
    <P>Another option for Irish business on enactment of the Bill would be for brand owners to register with the Office for the Harmony of the Internal Market &mdash; OHIM.  This will deal with Community trademark registrations.  The office has been set up in Alicante, south east Spain, and is expected to be open for business early in the new year.  It will take time for the office to be fully operational because of the complexity and variation of trade marks but it will eventually allow Irish brand owners to make a one stop registration for European Union countries.  I am disappointed that Ireland did not secure this office.  I do not wish to sound political but the bungling of a previous Administration lost us that facility.  It would have given major employment in this country.  I understand regional offices may be set up and we should make a case for one to be set up here.  That would give us a foothold in the registration of trade marks on the international scene.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that trade marks can be registered for ten years with ten year renewal periods.  Heretofore, they could be registered for seven years with 14 year renewal periods.  The new system is simpler and more logical.  A &ldquo;use it or lose it&rdquo; clause has been included <Col N="874" /> whereby a trade mark not used after five years will be extinguished.</P>
    <P>Counterfeiting is a major problem in the area of brand protection and trade mark registration.  When looking at brands we must realise that trade marks are infringed on a wide scale and involve legal and honest owners in the loss of vast earnings which, in turn, are falsely and unfairly reaped by imitators. There are many examples of this but perhaps the watch industry is the one most well known as suffering from false imitations.  Many of us have come across imitation watches bearing famous names.  With modern technology imitations are extremely difficult to detect. Footwear, particularly sportswear, is another industry adversely affected by counterfeiters.  In Cork, Adidas is bedevilled by imitations.  It makes distinguished sportswear which others imitate. The greatest trading nation, the United States of America, suffers problems with counterfeiters who are able to reproduce water and other security marks on the paper on which large denomination dollar bills are printed.  I understand this paper is now printed outside that country.  Section 14 provides that the use by a person of his or her name shall not infringe the registered trade mark, provided that such use is in accordance with honest practices in industrial and commercial matters.</P>
    <P>People have been known to be very inventive in the use of their names in amending or changing them by deed poll.  Indeed, this possibility has not escaped distinguished politicans in this city who adopted their own distinguishing marks in their titles.  The Minister may recall a case, perhaps when he was a schoolboy, of the Italian gentleman, Senor P. Arker, who produced quality fountain pens bearing his abbreviated first name and surname. The management of the Parker pen company in the United States was not amused.  Due to the necessity under Italian law to give due, full and lengthy consideration to the rights of defendants in <Col N="875" /> legal proceedings, matters were somewhat protracted before the might of corporate America was able to rein in the Latin initiative of Senor Arker.  Unfortunately, such amusing incidents are unworthy of the attention of today's highly organised, skilled and technically advanced international counterfeiters.</P>
    <P>Another example of what is happening in the world of counterfeiting is illustrated in an extract from last Thursday's <i>Financial Times</i> which, under the heading &ldquo;Italian video pirates targeted&rdquo; states:</P>
    <P>Record producers are to open a special office in Milan in January to spearhead their campaign to beat piracy in the Italian recorded music industry.  The office will be run by FIMI, the national industry federation, and IFPI, the international umbrella organisation for the recording industry, and staffed by anti-piracy specialists.  With a budget of $1m, the campaign will concentrate on enforcing Italian laws against music piracy and raising awareness. Pirated recordings in Italy &mdash; on cassette, compact disc and vinyl &mdash; have tripled in four years and now account for 44 per cent of pirated recordings in the European Union.  IFPI is modelling its operation on the successful anti-piracy unit set up in Spain in the 1980s.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposed increases in penalties.  The ultimate protection would be to make it a peanlty to use, or have for use, counterfeit goods or services. However, this would be difficult to implement in practice and perhaps could infringe our Constitution.</P>
    <P>The proposed penalties set out in section 90 apply to those found guilty of contravening the legislation if intention can be shown.  The word &ldquo;intention&rdquo; crops up a great deal in legislation and always presents problems in the interpretation and the proving thereof.  The Minister should re-examine this section which may represent an escape clause in <Col N="876" /> what otherwise may appear to be more severe penalties.</P>
    <P>The Bill apears to be based on the UK's Trademarks Act, 1994.  While I am not a proponent of copying British legislation, in this case it is acceptable as the British legislation, in turn, appears to be a copy of the EU Councils Trademark Registration Directive we are trying to incorporate into our law.  However, section 47 is different from Article 48 of that directive and from section 44 of the UK Act.  I will elaborate further on this matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>To a large extent, the value of this legislation will be reflected in the way it is enforced.  I have already alluded to the section on offences and the difficulty in proving intent.  The Bill does not provide for the appointment of trading standard officers who are an integral part of the operation of such legislation in other European jurisdictions.  Will the Minister examine this matter on the basis of it being a self-financing operation so as not to place a further burden on the Exchequer?  The legislation is designed to assist business, in particular the service sector, which is vital to this country.  For these and other reasons, on behalf of my party, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to note the unanimous support for the introduction and passage of this legislation.  It should be noted that under a 1992 European directive the then Department of Industry and Commerce was obliged to implement this legislation by the last day of that year but failed to do so.  As far as I am aware, it did not make any significant progress even in its preparation to implement it.  I am not singling out that Department for undue criticism but, like many other matters on which we are obliged to act under European directives, in the last analysis our response has been unconscionably tardy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We knew in advance that we were obliged to implement the directives on which part of this Bill is based.  Yet, for some reason it was thought wise to delay the matter.  In March or April <Col N="877" /> 1993 I introduced a Bill designed to implement effectively the same provision as the one before us.  It was designed to marry our international obligations under EU law with the necessary reforms in our trademark law in a way similar to the laws then proposed for enactment in the United Kingdom.  The reason my Bill and this one adopts the UK model in many respects as a precedent is important.</P>
    <P>A great deal of lip service is paid to the idea that we are an independent parliament with our own views and do not copy what happens internationally.  In areas such as company and intellectual property law it makes sense for a small country such as this to follow closely a system with a common language and legal heritage in an adjoining and larger jurisdiction.  Whenever possible it makes sense to conform with UK law on such matters because it enables our courts to benefit from decisions made in advance by courts in England when similar cases arise here.  On a purely statistical basis, if our law in such matters is similar to that in the United Kingdom, it is much more likely that a particular case of interpretation would have been decided in the United Kingdom before falling to be decided here.  The advantage would be twofold: a lawyer confronted with a particular problem of interpretation could look to the Bill and state that, on a similar wording, an English court had already heard arguments on both sides and arrived at a particular view and advise his client accordingly and, second, the Irish courts would have the advantage of a decided case in a neighbouring jurisdiction which would not be binding, but would be of persuasive authority in many cases.</P>
    <P>Whenever we approach a Bill of this kind on which it would be foolish to suggest that the innate genius of the Irish will express itself in some remarkably innovative and independent way, it would be sensible to look across the Atlantic or to England to a cognate jurisdiction with similar legal concepts to see how they have addressed the issue and, whenever possible, to fall into <Col N="878" /> line with the practice of a country whose jurisprudence we understand and can interpret and apply with any necessary modification within the State in accordance with our own requirements.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that we should slavishly follow what the British authorities do in these matters, but I am suggesting that we should always hesitate to ask ourselves whether there is a good reason for doing something differently for its own sake.  The Bill tendered to the House in 1993, therefore, was based largely on the proposed legislation in the United Kingdom.  In large measure, this Bill reflects that particular decision.</P>
    <P>I was pleased when the then Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, now Minister for Finance, wrote to me to say that he had decided to press on with the project of reforming our laws on trade marks and, in that context, to base his legislative proposals largely on the material contained in the Private Members' Bill submitted by me.  I wish to pay tribute to two individuals who assisted me in the formulation of that Bill two years ago, Shane Smith and Martin Tierney, two registered trade mark agents who put much effort into kick starting the legislative process which has brought us to this day.  I hope that this Bill will proceed with any necessary changes through the remaining stages of the legislative process.</P>
    <P>I do not say this in any sense dismissively or negatively, but it is a shame that it took two years from the preparation of my text to produce the Bill before the House which most people would say is substantially the same, although I agree there are some significant amendments. In retrospect, it would have been more sensible to refer my Bill to a select committee where it could have been amended.  If that had been done it would have been enacted roughly 18 months ago.  Whereas I did not want to stamp, shout, roar and make egocentric remarks at the time &mdash; I took at face value the sequence of letters I received from successive Ministers stating that the matter would be dealt with within a <Col N="879" /> matter of weeks &mdash; it is worth pointing out that in respect of this Bill there was undue delay both before the implementation date of the European directives and thereafter.</P>
    <P>The English state had decided to extend protection of registration to service marks many years before the European Union made it obligatory for us to do the same.  Ireland, collectively, should have been asking itself whether service marks should be registered from 1986 onwards when the decision was made in the United Kingdom.  I agree fully that the legislative way in which the United Kingdom initially introduced service marks was most clumsy and inelegant.  I would never have suggested that the Irish State should follow the particular amending legislation which was difficult to follow in the format in which it was passed through its parliament, but the idea that there is a radical distinction between goods and services in relation to intellectual property and goodwill is unsustainable.  It is strange that the Irish Legislature took so long to realise that there was no rational distinction between the two.</P>
    <P>In my practice as a barrister I have come across cases where what, in effect, were service marks were registerd by reference to items which fell into the category of goods so that those who, for instance, proposed to run a restaurant franchise registered their marks in relation to the boxes in which take-away goods and the like would be sold.  That was a highly artificial circumstance which deserved to be addressed long before 1995.</P>
    <P>Provision was made in section 37 of the Bill I tendered for searches for prior and conflicting similar trade marks, but this has been omitted from sectin 40 of this Bill.  Provision is only made for such a search if required by regulation.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, assured me in writing that there would be no departure from the requirement that such searches should be carried out.  I am not happy with the present situation. <Col N="880" /> Although it will be possible by regulation to make such a search mandatory, it was an important part of our trade mark law that the register was kept reasonably pure by searches for prior and conflicting marks.  There is nothing wrong in principle with such an arrangement. It should not be a matter of ministerial discretion as to whether such a search procedure should exist in the future.</P>
    <P>There is a sense in which this Bill attempts to deal with the issue of the criminal application of trade marks to goods and services in dishonest circumstances. As Deputy O'Keeffe correctly pointed out, the question of intent is difficult to prove.  There are many cases in which the pre-existing law was unfairly applied and interpreted.  Let me give a mundane example.  There is a Scandinavian company called Brio which manufactures wooden trains for children. These are sold in Dublin in the Early Learning Centre which also manufactures its own wooden trains for children.  Under pre-existing trademark legislation it was held to be an infringement of a trade mark in many circumstances if one advertised a particular product as being compatible with another.  In other words, one could not say on the front of a box that the product contained therein was compatible with another product.</P>
    <P>It occurs to me that in this matter the crucial issue is whether there is honest or dishonest intention.  The idea that certain forms of advertising and consumer information in relation to the sale or promotion of products were prohibited by reason of the fact that one could not refer to the registered trade mark of a competitor's product was an instance of anti-consumer application of what in theory should be a pro-consumer legislative code.  I am glad that probably will disappear under section 90 but section 90 could be changed to assert positively the right to apply a trademark to one's own goods for the purpose of indicating compatibility. That would not be a retrograde step.  If <Col N="881" /> one is selling a spare part which is compatible with Hoover products or Novum washing machines or is suitable for use on a Ford or Volkswagen car, it is important that one should be able to state that on the packaging and in advertising without infringing trademark law, as long as the process is honest and one is not selling the product as a genuine Volkswagen or Hoover spare part.</P>
    <P>I am wary of over-rigid application of intellectual property law.  The use of copyright legislation to give monopolies on the design of spare parts was, until recently, a matter of common legal practice.  It required special legislative intervention against judicial decisions to bring about a situation in which one could manufacture a spare part for a product on an industrial basis in Ireland without being found guilty of breach of copyright of the original drawings of the original manufacturer's spare part for the same product.  We should have a generally liberal approach to intellectual property law which should favour fair competition.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not purport to change or amend the law on passing off one supplier's goods as those of another.  At some stage the House will have to face up to reforming the law in this area. There is such a thing as dishonest or unfair competition which does not involve the deception of the consumer as to the origin of the goods in question. It is high time that the Legislature examined the area of dishonestly appropriating the goodwill of another trader, even if that dishonest appropriation is not based on the proposition that one is deceiving the consumer as to the origin of the goods.  There are many cases where the consumer could not care less about the origin of the goods and there is no such thing as a trading reputation in goods.  Those circumstances of themselves should not give rise to a licence to act dishonestly.</P>
    <P>The goodwill in a certain aspect of goods could be shared between two people in a way which was equally open to the proposition that either of them <Col N="882" /> was the source of the goods or services. However, this does not entitle somebody who has no connection with either of them to muscle in on the scene solely on the basis that those two people have not come to an arrangement whereby one or both of them has a monopoly right in the reputation of those goods. The time has come for us to address unfair competition in terms of passing off and allied remedies which are slightly more radical than those which could have been included in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Many aspects of this Bill deserve closer scrutiny on Committee Stage. However, the Bill is effectively three years overdue and that delay on the part of the Irish State is inexcusable.  Most elements of this Bill should have been addressed many years ago and it should have been enacted early in 1993 or in late 1992 to comply with our EU obligations.</P>
    <P>One of the curious features of the Bill is that, like the Bill I introduced, it will facilitate the registration of service marks on foot of applications made when service marks were not registerable. That is sensible because if the EU directive had been complied with, it would have been possible to register service marks here.  Applications were made to the controller's office for the registration of service marks to establish priority and protection notwithstanding the fact that they could not be registered until the law was amended.  I am glad the Bill seems to retrospectively validate such applications and register them in accordance with the priority dates of application as though the applications were made after the passing of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of some considerable pleasure to me that this legislation is before this House.  There were times in the last two years when a succession of assurances from Ministers led me to believe this was something which would be done by the next Government.  I am glad that it is moving forward now and I hope its passage through the House will be expedited and any necessary changes and improvements to its text will be effected on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="883" /> I thank the Minister and Deputy O'Keeffe for their contributions.  I fully support this Bill.  It should have been enacted a long time ago and the sooner we get it through this House the better because it is in ease of the reasonable rights of business people.  I am not in favour of monopoly rights in themselves. We should only concede, by way of property rights in respect of reputations, that which is reasonably necessary to protect people from unfair competition. This Bill is a step in the right direction.  It rationalises Irish trademark law, extends trademarks to service providers and to some extent removes some of the rigidity and inflexibility of previous legislation.</P>
    <P>This is not the last word on intellectual property.  We will have to reform our law on copyright.  The Department of Enterprise and Employment should get moving on that issue because our law on copyright is unsatisfactory.  It should not be up to an Opposition TD to produce a Bill on the subject.  There are many issues, including moral right and others relating to copyright, which the Department is sitting on at the moment.  It should get on with the job because the law on registerable designs is unsatisfactory.  An EU directive or Opposition Private Members' Bill should not be the only basis on which reforming law is introduced.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to seem ungenerous. There is a certain torpor and sleepiness in the Department about getting our law up to date.  I get no sense that the Department had its independent agenda with which it was ploughing along at a reasonable rate.  There was a lazy assent to the proposition that there would have to be change at some time but there was no forthright and dynamic agenda to change and improve the law.  The delays we have seen are by no means unique in the Irish system of law reform.  The same applies, with much more emphasis, to the Department of Justice, and I do not wish to seem harsh on the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="884" /> There is a sense of complacency in the public service about modernisation and codification of existing laws and this Bill is one example of that.  I do not wish to criticise individual public servants.  I know that many of the public servants who worked on this legislation have moved on to better things.  One cannot point the finger at any individual and say he has not done his part.  It is the system that has failed, and the system is the responsibility of its political masters, including fellow party members of mine.</P>
    <P>We should learn from the delay in enacting this legislation that there is no substitute for adopting a proactive approach to legislation.  Like Deputy Bruton, I do not believe legislation is, of itself, a good thing and this House should be cluttered with one Bill after another simply because people feel it is better to keep us busy.  In a country whose legislative arrears in terms of reform and codification are so massive, it depresses me on occasion that the public service, particularly several leading Departments, do not consider it necessary to keep the heat on.</P>
    <P>In this House we have been very remiss in our approach to EU directives. We have no system &mdash; maybe the position has changed in recent months &mdash; in which European directives are considered by a committee of this House in advance of agreement, and that is a shame.  For example, in Denmark draft directives and regulations are laid before committees to see how they affect the Danish economy and Danish interests.  Under our system the Department of Enterprise and Employment engages in consultation with interested bodies such as the Association of Patent and Trade Mark Agents or IBEC about Bills of this kind.  The Legislature does not engage in issues involving forthcoming EU directives and regulations until they are in large measure a <i>fait accompli.</i> That is a defect in our system of Government.</P>
    <P>In this case we are addressing the issue two years after we were obliged to do so by EU law.  It has not prejudiced us hugely that we were slow in that <Col N="885" /> regard, and perhaps it can be said in mitigation of the effects of the delay, that we were in some ways able to benefit from the fact that the UK addressed the same issues and therefore we can decide on the merits of demerits of its approach.  However, we as a Legislature are wholly remiss in complying with EU requirements.  We never anticipate them.  We frequently act in arrears in terms of them in a way that is not to our credit.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for introducing this Bill.  I assure the Government we will do our best to expedite its progress through the House with necessary modifications that may become apparent on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the remarks of Deputy McDowell on European directives. We have one of the worst records of any member state in making the necessary regulations and bringing the necessary legislation before the House to transpose European directives into Irish law.  That seems to be a problem throughout Government Departments. As I said on a number of occasions in this House and outside it, it is ludicrous to introduce legislation following agreement reached some time earlier on a European directive without an opportunity, through our committee system, to have an input in the final decisions of the EU.  There is a tremendous democratic deficit in that regard and I hope in the context of Dáil reform, the matter will be addressed satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>The public also has a problem in coming to terms with EU initiatives since the first time they hear about them is when they are discussed in this House, probably three or four years after they have been agreed in Brussels.  If these issues were discussed before agreement is reached it would go a long way towards educating the public on the importance of the work of the EU and its effect on member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussion of a Bill such as this is probably innocuous to a number of <Col N="886" /> people but it is very important legislation which is largely understated.  The adjudication of a service mark or trade mark in respect of an invention always has the makings of a good row, whether inside or outside the court.  In the absence of clear guidelines laid down by the House, litigation is often inevitable in these cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy McDowell depends on trade marks for a living.</P>
      <P>From my experience of dealing with constituents, it is often the cause of great frustration that clear guidelines are not available on trade marks.  Very often applications to the Department of Enterprise and Employment or an agency under its control for grant aid are turned down for one reason or other, particularly in terms of register of design when a minor modification would render the application successful. Immense problems arise in that regard for public representatives and people applying for State aid to manufacture a particular prototype.  The whole issue not only of trade marks but also register of design must be considered with a view to allaying the fears of many people who believe there is an inside track of people who are better informed of matters than unsuspecting people who do their best in terms of innovation and invention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole issue of trade marks, which now includes for the first time the registering of services, is linked with consumer protection.  Consumer law, which is very progressive in terms of product liability, has been largely foisted upon us by the European Union. In this case the consumer is a person who registers goods and services marks for his own protection.  The Minister in his speech referred to additional protection for the proprietors of trade marks in the context of a franchise or licence. I agree that due to market demands a licence is very important to a proprietor <Col N="887" /> and that he or she will go out of their way to protect themselves without the need for State policing of those matters. I hope the position will be subject to review.</P>
    <P>The dishonest competition factor mentioned by Deputy McDowell is very much at the heart of this legislation although it relates more to the design than the trade marks area.  Will the Minister of State say when it will be possible to introduce legislation which will review registering design concepts and prototypes and when it will be introduced here given that it is probably more important than the legislation under discussion today?</P>
    <P>The first cases that will be brought under this legislation will provide an opportunity to ascertain how the definition of a trade mark and service mark will pan out.  That will set in train precedents for the future registration of such trade or service marks.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government on its decision regarding the decentralisation of the Patents Office and, hopefully, it will not be too long before its decentralisation to my constituency of Kilkenny comes to fruition.  It would be remiss of me if I, as the public representative for that area, did not take this opportunity to ask the Minister of State to use his good offices to expedite that decision as soon as possible.  I understand we will be in a position to deal with that in early 1996.  I ask the Minister of State to communicate with me at the earliest opportunity about the present position regarding the relocation of that office to Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>I am pleased this legislation has been introduced and I compliment Deputy McDowell for initiating it in 1993.  Many people would not regard it as important legislation, but I do.  I also have a fondness for the Association of Patent and Trade Mark Agents as it appointed me to the Seanad in 1987 and if it had not been for the generosity of that august body I might not be a participant in this debate.  Having heard Deputies' contributions, the Minister has an opportunity <Col N="888" /> to deal with matters related to this legislation and I hope he will remove many of the anomalies in trade marks of goods and services that have developed over the years and address the guarded protection, or lack of protection, interpretation, or misinterpretation, constructed in that regard.  The issue of design is another debate, an area in respect of which legislation should be introduced as quickly as possible.</P>

Regarding his general remarks about the torpor of the system and the need to respond more speedily to the modernisation required in legislative terms, the points have been made and I do not wish to go over them.  The important point is that the Bill is before the House. I assure him on my behalf and that of the civil servants who are working and have worked on the Bill that, perhaps for reasons unique to this Bill, it took considerable application and dedication on their part to have it introduced in 1995.  Perhaps that is not as it should be, but that has been the position and I thank the officials concerned for ensuring that we made the 1995 deadline in introducing the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies O'Keeffe and McDowell <Col N="889" /> referred to the need for updating copyright legislation.  I assure both Deputies that the torpor referred to has not descended on this area of the commerce division, that a copyright Bill is being prepared and that the putative contents of the new copyright Bill were the subject of consultations with a number of interested parties and organisations. What Deputy McDowell said about civil servants moving on to greater things has affected this area, but the work is continuing. This is a complex area.  I hope that as a result of the consultations to which I referred the draft legislation will take account of the need to strengthen the existing legislation in line with developments at European Union level and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe referred to the question of fees.  Changes in the present fees charged by the Patents Office will be required by a number of provisions of the Bill.  Registration of a trade mark and its renewal will be for a standardised period of ten years, replacing the current periods of seven and 14 years. Registration and renewal fees will have to be adjusted to take account of that change.  An application for registration of a trade mark will now cover goods or services which fall into more than one class under the international classification system.  Currently a separate application is necessary for each class of goods and a change of the current fees structure will be necessary to take account of that change.</P>
    <P>On the issue of counterfeiting raised by Deputy O'Keeffe, penalties under section 90 (4) are quite severe. Section 13 defines acts which constitute infringement of a registered trade mark.  It implements Artice 5 of the directive. Subsection 3 goes beyond what was provided for in the 1963 Act by extending infringement to use in connection with non-similar goods where the trade mark has a reputation in the State.  Previously a trade mark was infringed only by use in relation to the goods for which it was registered.  Section 13 (3) will provide for the unauthorised use of a sign which <Col N="890" /> is either identical or similar to a registered trade mark in relation to non-similar goods or services to constitute infringement.  This provision establishes the right to prevent use detrimental to the mark's reputation.  The provisions on infringement proceedings in sections 17 to 23 which protect the interests of proprietors and licensees, should also be noted.  Section 22 provides for penalites to be considered by the court including the destruction or forfeiture of infringing goods, materials or articles.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell referred to searches and, as stated in a letter to him previously, there is no intention to change the existing search and examination procedures.  It is proposed to continue the existing system which we share with the United Kingdom's patent office.  Deputy McDowell will be aware that the present search provisions were in the trade mark rules of 1963 rather than in the 1963 Act.  The same approach is being taken now of including the search provisions in the rules.</P>
    <P>The cornerstone of the Bill is the Directive and it will be of benefit to Irish business, as Deputies have remarked, that differences between the laws of member states have been reduced.  The Directive, in assisting with the Single Market, will create opportunities for exporters to compete in Europe on a more level playing field.</P>
    <P>While introduction of this legislation has taken longer than anticipated.  I hope Deputies will find the Bill deals comprehensively with the changes which have taken place internationally to date.  Council Regulation 40/94 had not been published when the Private Members' Bill was initiated and it is more satisfactory for this House to consider section 55 of this Bill now that Council Regulation 40/94 has been published rather than to have to anticipate its contents.  This council regulation was finally agreed in late 1993 and it dealt with the creation of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market which is based in Alicante, Spain.  This office will process applications for a <Col N="891" /> Community trade mark from April 1996.</P>
    <P>It had been long recognised that a unitary trade mark system would be a logical development for the European Union.  Formal proposals for such a system were published in 1980 after discussions with business and legal experts in the member states.  A Community trade mark will give its owner the exclusive right to use that mark throughout the Community.  It would not be reasonable for that right to be granted if it would conflict with a similar right already enjoyed by somebody else. The existence of an earlier conflicting mark anywhere in the Community will therefore present a bar to the valid registration of a Community trade mark.  The existence of the Community trade mark system in parallel with our national system offers an opportunity to proprietors of trade marks to obtain Community-wide protection by means of a single application.</P>
    <P>Equally, ratification of the Madrid Protocol will facilitate proprietors in obtaining more extensive protection of their marks.  Significant savings should accrue from making a single application to the World Intellectual Property Organisation in Geneva rather than applying to each national trade mark office where registration is desired.  The extension of the legal protection afforded by registration to trade marks in respect of services will also be generally welcome.  We understand there will be a considerable demand for service marks to be registered.  All of these changes are advantageous to business.</P>
    <P>In the Single Market of the European Union and, indeed, in markets beyond its borders, firms must be increasingly competitive to win and retain market share and this Bill will reduce the costs of competing in those markets.  The Directive, as I have said, will reduce barriers to entry on the European market and the Community trade mark and the Madrid Protocol will reduce the cost of obtaining international registrations. The opportunities for owners of trade <Col N="892" /> marks in Ireland to expand into the rapidly developing markets of China and Eastern Europe, for example, are enormous and the Protocol will facilitate such wider registration of marks.</P>
    <P>It is not claimed that this Bill has got everything right.  Now that it has been published, my Department will continue to listen to the views of interested parties with a view to further improving the Bill on Committee Stage and I am pleased it has received a general welcome in the House.</P>
    <P>On the question of a review of design law, which was raised by Deputy Phil Hogan, it must be generally acknowledged that our law on design registration, which is based on the 1927 Act, needs to be updated.  Discussions are currently under way at EU level on both the harmonisation of national design laws and the creation of Community-wide protection of designs.  It would be prudent to await the outcome of these discussions before reforming our national law in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on social housing. I recognise a fair amount has been done in this connection in recent years and the document on social housing was published a few years ago, but there are <Col N="894" /> still a huge number of social housing problems which must be solved.</P>
      <P>If we look at the range of schemes available, I suppose the one which everybody thinks of first is the scheme for the provision of local authority housing but there are other schemes with regard to repairs in lieu of local authority housing, housing aids for the elderly, essential repairs grants, the £3,000 new house grant, shared ownership and disabled persons' grant, not to mention the Gaeltacht grants.</P>
      <P>I wish to say a few words about local authority housing regarding which some problems have yet to be tackled.  There was a move some years ago to get away from segregated housing, particularly in our cities and larger towns, where the better off people live in one part and the less well off in another.  Huge social problems have been created by that policy and the economic cost has been enormous.  We must make a firm commitment that we will never again allow segregated housing in our towns or cities and we have a huge job on hand to undo the problems of the past.  We must get away from that type of policy and ensure we never return to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Official recognition should be given for transferring from one local authority area to another.  There are two local authorities in my constituency &mdash; Galway Corporation and Galway County Council.  This should also be valid for a person who wishes to transfer from a local authority in, say, Dublin Corporation or Dublin County Council to the west or even the other way around. Sometimes people want to transfer from rural areas to the city but there is no official system to facilitate such transfers. When I ask council officials about this I am told it is done on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis only.  When a person in Rosmuc wished to transfer to Galway city it was possible to find somebody in Galway city who was willing to do a direct swap but that is normally difficult to achieve. A number of people in Galway city are anxious to return to the areas from <Col N="895" /> which they came, particularly unemployed people who have no ties with the city.</P>
    <P>If the county council is to provide a unit of housing in rural areas and in that way release property in the city and other local authority areas, the authority providing accommodation is at the loss of one of its units while the authority who transferred the person has gained a unit.  Obviously, that is not attractive to the local authority which has been asked to provide housing. Nobody will argue with anybody who leaves and makes a house available as long as they have got good alternative accommodation.</P>
    <P>We should have a formal system whereby, if a person gives up a local authority house in one area and is provided with accommodation in another area by a different local authority, some resources would be given to the providing authority so that it would not be at a total loss.  If that happened it would give people freedom to consider transfers, it would allow mobility and in rural areas it would allow people to return where they wished to do so.  Will the Minister of State consider this issue in the near future?</P>
    <P>Another issue which is causing a problem is the criteria on which housing is allocated in tourist areas.  The housing officer normally allocates housing on the basis of overcrowding or the condition of the housing.  A problem arises where homeless families who, because they are known locally, manage to rent good property but in the summertime the landlords are anxious that they move to other property.  This can go on for years.  Where this has happened for two or three years and where it is clear there is a need for housing and where permanent private accommodation is not available, the requirement for a settled place in which to live should be taken into account with the other two criteria.  One family in my constituency has been on the housing list for the past five or six years.  They have moved within a ten to 50 mile radius from <Col N="896" /> house to house.  This is very unsettling for the children as it means they do not know from year to year what schools they will attend.  No other case has taken as long.  We have to insert a criteria here because in rural areas there is a problem in regard to houses being available for the summer season.</P>
    <P>The house purchase scheme has an advantage over previous schemes in that the intention is to keep people in the estate so that, in time, there is a mix between rented and purchased houses. In that way people are not taken out of the estates when they settle down and get some money together.  I favour the purchase scheme but I regret that it is limited to 3 per cent per annum up to 30 per cent, plus £3,000.  I recognise that the £3,000 was an addition this year.  I do not understand the reason it cannot be extended for another ten years for those people who have been renting for 15 or 20 years and the reason the 3 per cent cannot be extended to a limit of, say, 50 per cent plus £3,000.  Some long-term tenants find it difficult to purchase the houses, because they have never managed to get full-time employment, even in these circumstances.  The ten years cut-off point is too low.  It is a good scheme and it is one in which many people have an interest because there is still a strong interest in home ownership in the community.</P>
    <P>There are two sets of flats in Galway in Rahoon and Mervue.  Mervue accommodates mainly old people who are happy to live in flats but that is not the case in Rahoon.  A huge amount of money will be expended on refurbishing them.  I believe this is money wasted. Every week in my clinic parents with young families and single parents with young children beg to get out of the flats.  The flats are a kind of purgatory through which one has to go to get a house.  Nobody chooses to go there. Many people in need of housing are told they will have to spend three years in the flats but most refuse as there are too many social problems there.  I accept that people of every class live in flats <Col N="897" /> but when flats have a transient occupancy or are used by people who have not paid their rent this causes huge problems which cannot be solved by repairing their physical structure.  There is a proposal to spend a huge sum of money on them but the public demand is for housing.</P>
    <P>What people should want is not relevant but rather what they feel they will be happy with.  In many cases people are much wiser than the social planners on these issues because they have a broader perspective of the whole package which includes, for example, the fact that one is living on the third floor.  If you want to let your child out to play you have to come down three flights of stairs to supervise them.  If it is an unsupervised flat, lifts will have to be installed and these will be interfered with.  It includes many things which are not relevant when talking about private flats owned by private individuals in cities who intend to live there by choice and in many cases do not have young children and do not face the problems which mothers face in flats like Rahoon. It is clear that the only way corporations can get tenants into such flats is by saying they cannot get a house unless they take a flat first.</P>
    <P>Given the cost in social terms and the damage caused to health, it would be much cheaper to invest the money in the provision of alternative accommodation. Galway is not unique in terms of this problem and serious consideration must be given to the provision of alternative accommodation.  If there is a short-term once off cost so be it; if it reduces social problems and minimises the level of human misery in the long-term it will be money well spent.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 4,000 people seeking resettlement in rural areas.  The voluntary rural resettlement scheme frees up accommodation in areas with long housing lists and resettles the people in communities which have under utilised schools, health centres, etc.  However, there is a shortage of houses in good condition for long-term <Col N="898" /> rent in rural areas.  Tenants in corporation or council houses receive a discount if they purchase a house and the Minister should consider giving the money to the rural resettlement group to enable it to secure houses on a repair and lease back basis over a long period. These houses could be used to resettle people in rural areas, thereby freeing up badly needed accommodation in cities. My proposal would not cost the Department anything more than it pays to people who purchase houses from a local authority.</P>
    <P>The scheme of repairs in lieu of social housing has taken off in a big way in Galway.  However, owing to a lack of funding it takes us more than five years to proceed with applications.  Under the scheme houses are renovated to meet all the requirements of the late 20th century, that is modern facilities, water and heating.  It would not require much money to make this scheme more worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The scheme of housing aids for the elderly and the essential repairs grant scheme are run in tandem by the health board and the local authority.  When old people ask me for advice on house improvement grants I give them two forms and tell them to apply to both bodies and see who will offer the help first.  If the health board cannot provide a grant because it has run out of money the local authority might be able to fund them or <i>vice versa.</i> The two schemes should be administered by the county councils.  The scheme of housing aids for the elderly was initially introduced as an emergency response.  If we did our job properly there would be no need for emergency responses.  A combined scheme should be introduced to ensure that old people receive an immediate response to their requests for aid.</P>
    <P>I am baffled as to why the £3,000 grant scheme is administered by the Department of the Environment.  Under the shared ownership option scheme council engineers examine the property and the Department of the Environment engineer repeats the examination. I do not understand why this <Col N="899" /> grant is not administered by the local authority in each area.  This would eliminate much of the duplication, simplify matters for the applicant and enable the county council to put a more comprehensive loan package together.</P>
    <P>The shared ownership option scheme is a good idea but it is bogged down in bureaucracy and time has caught up with it.  Although I welcome the recent relaxation in them, the income limits have been too restrictive.  Owing to the huge reductions in interest rates on the open market people can get mortgages at a rate of 6.75 per cent or 7 per cent. The rent part of the shared ownership option scheme is 5 per cent.  If a house costs £30,000 the purchaser can be given a grant of up to £12,000.  The rent part of the shared ownership option should be done away with and a sliding scale of grant should be introduced in its place. It is very important to have a half way house scheme, so to speak, but the shared ownership option scheme is too complicated.  A simpler scheme might be more effective.  House prices in urban areas are very high and people will find it very difficult to secure a mortgage.  A further problem has arisen in Galway city in that people cannot afford to purchase a second hand local authority house for £32,000-£33,000.</P>
    <P>Much good work has been carried out under the voluntary housing scheme. For example, in my parish sheltered housing has been provided for old people.  While I would not normally encourage people to leave the countryside, under this scheme people who live in very isolated areas are given the option of moving into sheltered housing in a cluster.  This means integrated care can be provided for elderly people who are able to live independent lives.  In my parish the housing is located at the back of the health centre which is beside the church and other facilities.  This scheme has proven to be very popular and I would like to see it developed further in other areas.</P>
    <P>The introduction of schemes is all <Col N="900" /> very well but it is fundamental to provide adequate funding to ensure their proper implementation.  There are certain things to which people have a basic right, and shelter is one of them.  A decent house is fundamental.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the judgment in the case to which the Deputy refers, and I can assure him that it is being studied carefully.  I understand that the matter will now revert to the British Court of Appeal which referred the case to the European Court of Justice in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I have repeatedly emphasised to the British authorities the importance of a positive approach to the new situation created by the ceasefires.  The Government's view is that this should include dismantling the emergency provisions as soon as possible, in line with the greatly improved security situation on the ground.  Such a step would also serve to consolidate the peace and make a significant contribution to political progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="901" /> As the Deputy will be aware, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland announced some time ago that there is to be an independent review of the two emergency Acts &mdash; the Emergency Provisions Act and the Prevention of Terrorism Act &mdash; with a view to replacing these in due course.  I note that the reviewer has not yet been named, although I understand that this is likely to happen shortly.</P>
    <P>The Government will, of course, make its views on dismantling the emergency provisions known to the independent reviewer as soon as this can be arranged.  In the meantime and in line with estabished practice, we expect that we will be asked to comment on the operation of the Prevention of Terrorism Act during 1995 when this is reviewed early in the New Year.  We will reiterate our position that, in the present situation, serious consideration should be given to non-renewal of the Act next year, or at the very least that its more controversial provisions should be allowed to lapse.</P>

Second, it is very important to emphasise that anything that can be done by way of removing emergency legislation to consolidate the peace process, should be done and as quickly as possible.  We moved very quickly in many respects in this State and we have been trying to convince our colleagues in the British Government to take steps <Col N="902" /> that would be seen to buttress the peace process.  The Deputy will be well aware of the many complaints I made on the implications of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 20 and 24 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement concluded at Dayton, <Col N="904" /> Ohio, by the Presidents of Bosnia-Hercegovina, Croatia and Serbia on 21 November constitutes a framework for lasting peace and stability in a country which has been ravaged by war for almost four years.  It is to be signed formally at a peace conference in Paris on 14 December.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome this agreement.  If the fragile peace in Bosnia-Hercegovina is to be consolidated, the Dayton Agreement must be fully implemented. It is essential that there should be a well co-ordinated international effort to assist the peoples of the region in the difficult tasks of democracy-building, reconciliation and reconstruction which lie ahead.</P>
    <P>The Dayton Agreement is lengthy and complex.  Some of its more important elements are: the maintenance of Bosnia-Hercegovina as a single multi-ethnic state within its internationally recognised borders; an over-arching central presidency with representatives from each of the three ethnic groups, a council of ministers and a central parliament; underneath the central structures there will be two entities, the Federation and the Republika Srpska; elections will be held next year for the central presidency and parliament, and for the institutions of both of Bosnia's entities &mdash; the OSCE has been given the task of supervising these elections; special arrangements have been agreed to encourage refugees and displaced persons to return voluntarily and in safety to their homes; and the Security Council has been invited to authorise the deployment of an international force to supervise the withdrawal of armies to the agreed zones.</P>
    <P>The parties agreed at Dayton that the central structure of the state will retain responsibility for foreign policy, foreign trade, monetary and customs policy, immigration and asylum matters, international and inter-entity law enforcement, air traffic control and inter-entity transportation.  It is clear, therefore, that the central institution of Bosnia-Hercegovina will have real powers and responsibilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> On 4 December, the European Foreign Ministers reconfirmed their commitment to make a substantial contribution to the implementation of the Dayton Agreement.  To this end, the union will work to support the federation and to strengthen the central structures of Bosnia-Hercegovina by promoting constructive Bosnian Serb participation in these structures.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the Dayton Agreement will have both military and civil dimensions.  Regarding the former, the Security Council is expected to authorise the deployment of a multinational force when the peace agreement has been signed and to withdraw UNPROFOR. To maximise the effectiveness of the international community's support for the implementation of the civil aspects of the agreement, new and more effective co-ordinating structures will need to be created.  Tomorrow, I will be in London to attend the peace implementation conference which will begin to give shape to these.  I expect that there will be agreement on the role and functions of a high representative who will be entrusted by the Security Council with a pivotal role in co-ordinating civilian implementation.</P>
    <P>The holding of free and fair elections is, in many ways, the keystone for the development of a democratic society and is therefore crucial to the prospects for the overall success of the agreement. The OSCE has been given the task by the parties to the Dayton Agreement with the responsibility for supervising these elections.  These could be held next year during Ireland's Presidency. We will at that time have the leading role in the European Community Monitor Mission which will provide the OSCE with valuable support in preparing for and supervising the elections.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the agreement of the Bosnian parties to secure for all persons in their jurisdiction the highest level of internationally recognised human rights and fundamental freedoms. The European Union will do its utmost to ensure that this commitment is honoured.  It is being made clear to <Col N="906" /> the parties that support for reconstruction and the development of longer-term relations between the states in the region will be subject to respect for human and minority rights and for the right of all refugees and displaced persons to return to their homes.</P>
    <P>I attach the highest importance to the work which is to be undertaken by the UNHCR in support of an early and orderly return of refugees.  The UNHCR has been entrusted by the UN Secretary General with the role of co-ordinating the repatriation and relief of refugees and displaced persons.  The Government will continue to liaise closely with the UNHCR and to assist that agency in its work in this area.</P>
    <P>At Dayton the parties agreed on the establishment of an independent Commission for Refugees and Displaced Persons which will include representatives appointed by the European Court of Human Rights.  This body will work closely with the UNHCR to ensure that the parties co-operate fully in facilitating the return of refugees and displaced persons.  The new structures which will be established to monitor and co-ordinate the implementation of the Dayton Agreement, and in which the European Union will be represented, will have a role in ensuring that the parties honour the commitments which they have made in this area.</P>
    <P>I am under no illusions as to the enormity of the task which the implementation of the Dayton Agreement involves.  In this regard, I should emphasise that the primary responsibility rests with the parties themselves who must honour their commitments.  If there is goodwill and a genuine effort by all to implement the agreement, the international community will be able to provide substantial support for their endeavours and advance reconciliation. The Dayton Agreement is clearly an essential step towards a comprehensive solution to the problems of the region. That is why the Security Council has recently suspended the economic sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which had been imposed on <Col N="907" /> account of that state's support for the war aims of the Bosnian Serbs. However, there are a number of important issues such as human rights violations in Kosovo and elsewhere in Serbia which are not addressed in the Dayton Agreement on Bosnia-Hercegovina.</P>
    <P>I consider that the violations of the most fundamental human rights in Kosovo are entirely unacceptable.  Belgrade's policies in this regard also run the risk of destabilising the southern Balkan region by precipitating a Serbo-Albanian conflict.  Ireland, with its European Union partners, will continue to make it clear to Belgrade that human and minority rights must be respected throughout the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and that a large degree of autonomy must be restored to Kosovo. We are also insisting that Belgrade must permit the immediate redeployment of the long-term missions of the Organisation for Security Co-operation in Europe &mdash; (OSCE) &mdash; to monitor the human rights in Kosovo, Sandjak and Vojvodina.</P>
    <P>Belgrade is well aware of the priority the European Union attaches to the immediate and full respect of human rights in Kosovo, as well as the rights of the minorites in Sandjak and Vojvodina. The EU Council of Ministers on 30 October made clear that a solution to these issues is essential for the full integration of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia into the international community and for the stabilisation of the region as a whole.</P>
    <P>I hope the Agreement in Dayton will encourage Belgrade to end human rights violations in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and to restore Kosovo's autonomy.  Ireland, with our European Union partners, will continue our efforts to achieve these vital goals.</P>

      <P>We on this side of the House warmly welcome the Dayton Agreement.  It must have been an immense relief not only to the people of former Yugoslavia but to the whole of <Col N="908" /> Europe who have been shamed by what has happened in that area.  Does the Tánaiste consider a unitary state conceivable in Bosnia-Hercegovina after four years of war?  Would he agree that peace and democracy are absolutely essential if the conditions of the Dayton Agreement are to be built on?  Would he agree that the balance of peace there is very fragile and must be consolidated through building democratic structures?</P>
      <P>While refugees have the right to return to their homes under the Dayton Agreement, would the Tánaiste agree that conditions on the ground may not permit that?  What role does the Tánaiste envisage for the European Union in ensuring the capability as well as the right of those refugees to return to their homes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for welcoming the Dayton Agreement.  I am sure he echoes the views of all parties in this House and the public generally. Indeed, great credit is due to the United States and the European Union for their input into those, by all accounts, difficult negotiations.  It is a fragile agreement. Another three conferences will take place in the next three weeks to secure various aspects of it, including one beginning in London tomorrow. The European Union will continue to play a leading role with the assistance of the United States.  The object of the agreement is to enable Bosnia to continue as a single State, with its sovereignty fully respected by its neighbours. I consider this an enormous achievement bearing in mind the efforts of many to dismember Bosnia in recent years.  The State will be comprised of two entities &mdash; the Federation of Bosnia-Hercegovina and the Republika Srpska.  There will be a Constitution for Bosnia, creating effective central institutions, including a Presidency, Parliament and a constituent court.  Enormous tasks lie ahead for the goverance of Bosnia-Hercegovina which cannot be done successfully without the co-operation of the parties on the ground and the enormous support of the rest of the world.  It <Col N="909" /> will impose an enormous requirement on the European Union, the United States and third countries outside of those comprising the European Union and the United States.  Negotiations will take place with other countries on the contributions to be made in relation to the task ahead of us and, on the military and civilian sides, will require enormous efforts by the rest of the world. However, the Dayton Agreement provides an opportunity, as Deputy Ray Burke acknowledged.  Everything must be done to ensure there is no reversion to the four-year war in that region.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste mentioned in his initial response that the UNPROFOR forces were to be withdrawn. Does he envisage participation of members of the Garda Síochána or Army in support of the Dayton Agreement &mdash; obviously not within the context of NATO &mdash; if requested?  This side of the House would support any such request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the latter part of the Deputy's first question, the intention is that refugees will be enabled to return home.  The capacity for them to be absorbed will increase with the reconstruction and development that will take place in which we will assist.</P>
      <P>We have not been approached about possible participation by the Irish Army or police in the implementation force nor has the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution, as yet, and will not do so until after the conference. If approached, we will examine any such request very carefully.  We shall have to examine many issues, for example, whether we could participate under the provisions of current legislation which would have to be discussed in this House, but much will depend on the terms of the enabling United Nations Security Council resolution, the contents of which we must await.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, we will have to contribute personnel to the European Union monitoring mission during our Presidency, a <Col N="910" /> substantial contribution of approximately 70-80 Defence Forces personnel. We shall examine any request which I shall be happy to discuss with any spokespersons on Foreign Affairs of any of the other parties in the House.  As has been well recorded, we have a very proud record of contribution to United Nations peacekeeping missions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome our participation within the context of a mandate from the United Nations Security Council or European Union &mdash; but not of NATO.</P>
      <P>Would the Tánaiste agree that until there is peace among the Albanian population of Kosovo and the Serbian administration problem there is resolved, there cannot be lasting peace in the former Yugoslavia or in the Balkan area generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the matter of peace and respect for human rights of the Albanian population of Kosovo are fundamental to the long-term peace and security of that region.  Unfortunately, we are aware that human rights violations continue in Kosovo, that the situation on the ground is very tense, with the possible danger of the radicalisation of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian population, which information has been made available by the working group of the International Conference on former Yugoslavia, of which the European Union is well seized.  While the obvious solution is virtual autonomy for Kosovo &mdash; enjoyed by its people over many years &mdash; the situation is tense and, as the Deputy rightly said, until peace and respect for human rights in Kosovo is established, we shall not have the peace in that region to which we all aspire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>In July, unimaginable brutality took place during and after the capture of Srebrenica.  The events surrounding the fall of Srebrenica represent the darkest chapter of the brutal war in Bosnia-Hercegovina. There is overwhelming evidence that thousands of those who fled Srebrenica were murdered by Bosnian Serb forces.  The actions of these forces were utterly condemned by the Government. The European Union Council of Ministers strongly condemned the Bosnian Serb attacks on Srebrenica and demanded an immediate halt to this offensive and an end to the bombardment of Zepa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of the tragic events at Srebrenica and Zepa, I well understand the feelings of despair which led Mr. Tadeusz Mazowiecki to resign his post as the UNCHR's Special Rapporteur on human rights in former Yugoslavia.  The <Col N="912" /> international community owes him an enormous debt for his untiring efforts. His successor in office, Ms Elizabeth Rehn of Finland, has my full support in exposing human rights violations in the region.  I believe the hopes expressed by Mr. Mazowiecki in his letter of resignation that the appalling events in July would constitute a defining moment have been realised.</P>
    <P>As it transpired, the horrific events at Srebrenica in July did, in fact, represent a defining moment for the United Nations in Bosnia-Hercegovina.  At the London Conference which was held after the fall of Srebrenica, the United Nations, major troop contributors and NATO decided that, rather than deploy UNPROFOR personnel to the isolated safe areas, the increased use of air power would be the most effective deterrent.</P>
    <P>The crimes committed after the fall of Srebrenica must be fully investigated. The fate of the thousands of missing persons must be established.  I hope that the provision in the Dayton Agreement which commits the parties to cooperating fully with the ICRC in determining the whereabouts and fate of those unaccounted for will be honoured in full.</P>
    <P>Following the London meeting, detailed arrangements for the protection of the civilian population of the other safe areas were elaborated.  The subsequent action taken by NATO on behalf of the United Nations reflected the outrage and the strong desire of the international community to ensure the protection of the civilian population of the safe areas.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt as to where the responsibility rests for the events in Srebrenica and Zepa.  It is with the leadership, both political and military, of the Bosnian Serbs.  I welcome the fact that the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has recently issued a number of indictments against Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic in connection with their involvement in the crimes which took place in the eastern enclaves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="913" /> The United Nations peace-keeping operation in former Yugoslavia was mandated by the Security Council.  It has been the largest UN peacekeeping mission ever deployed.  The Security Council was kept fully informed by the Secretary General on its work and the overwhelming difficulties which it was encountering in discharging its mandate.</P>
    <P>With regard to UNPROFOR's specific role, that force was, in addition to its basic peace-keeping duties, mandated to deter aggression against the safe areas, but not to defend them.  The Secretary General had recommended some 35,000 additional troops to protect the safe areas.  Only 6,500 were forthcoming. UNPROFOR's largely symbolic presence in Srebrenica and Zepa was therefore unable to prevent the fall of these areas.  Its inability in this regard can also be attributed in considerable measure to the manifest absence of the cooperation of the belligerents on which the safe areas concept was predicated.</P>
    <P>Following a review of developments in September, the Secretary General reaffirmed his opinion that it was impossible to entrust a United Nations Peace-keeping Force with a mandate which would require it to take enforcement action against parties whose co-operation it required to enable the force to carry out its basic peace-keeping functions.  The Secretary General therefore recommended that the Security Council should authorise an <i>ad hoc</i> coalition of member states which would implement a peace agreement in Bosnia, with an expeditious transfer to that force by UNPROFOR.</P>
    <P>The Secretary General also underlined the limited capacity of the United Nations to manage large-scale operations, especially those established under Chapter VII of the Charter with a potential enforcement role; the severe difficulties which the United Nations has in obtaining sufficient military, police and civilian personnel for the conduct of large-scale operations; the difficulties of co-ordinating operations of military personnel with different chains of command; and the serious difficulties <Col N="914" /> which arise when a peace-keeping force is also tasked with actions of an enforcement nature.</P>
    <P>The Secretary General's conclusions also coincide with the assessment of many other parties who were deeply engaged in the search for peace in Bosnia-Hercegovina. The ongoing efforts to establish an implementation force reflect these conclusions.</P>
    <P>Many lessons need to be drawn from the United Nations peace-keeping presence in former Yugoslavia, including by the Security Council which elaborates peace-keeping mandates.  In particular, great care needs to be taken to ensure that peace-keeping forces have clear mandates and sufficient means to discharge them.</P>
    <P>I believe, however, that sight should not be lost of the fact that the United Nations peace-keeping forces have saved many thousands of lives in Bosnia-Hercegovina, prevented a second Serbo-Croat war in Croatia and prevented the conflict from spilling over into a more deadly war in the southern Balkans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it was shameful that thousands of UN soldiers, particularly Dutch soldiers under the UN command, were present during the events on 11 July, that they saw them happen, that they did not intervene, that they took video films of what was happening to the non-Serb Bosnian men and boys who were being murdered in their thousands, and that the video films which they took were subsequently confiscated by the Dutch authorities so that evidence of what happened would not be forthcoming? Would the Minister like to comment on what seems to me to be a very shameful episode indeed?  Would he like to reconsider his remark that the UN peace-keeping forces did not get the co-operation of what he called the belligerents when the non-Serb Bosnian people who had gone to Zepa and to Srebrenica had done so at the invitation of the United Nations, who assured <Col N="915" /> them that if they did go there they would be safe and would be defended?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that July of last year was the darkest chapter in the brutal war in Bosnia-Hercegovina. The operation of the UN peace-keeping mission is kept under continuous review by the Secretary General and by the Security Council by whom it is mandated.  Since the deployment of the UN peace-keeping forces to former Yugoslavia the Secretary General has reported regularly to the Security Council on the work of the peace-keeping forces, including the substantial difficulties which they encountered in discharging aspects of their mandate.  The Secretary General expressed his concern for a period of time with the inability of UNPROFOR in Bosnia to discharge tasks which were given to it by the Security Council without sufficient resources to discharge the tasks. He was also concerned by the difficulties which arise for the UN peace-keeping forces when they are required to carry out tasks of an enforcement nature.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Dutch authorities undertook an extensive debriefing of their troops who were present in Srebrenica at the time of its fall, and this report was to be made available to the Secretary General of the UN.  The report showed that the hope that a largely symbolic presence in Srebrenica would deter aggression was tragically a vain one.  The report stressed that the co-operation of the parties, on which the safe areas concept was based, was not forthcoming in this case.  The tension had been heightened by sorties by Bosnian Government forces in and around the Srebrenica area.  The report concluded that the UN peace-keepers had attempted to carry out their military and humanitarian duties to the best of their ability.  Above all else that report concluded that the responsibility for the tragedy rests squarely with the Bosnian Serb forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the Bosnian forces and the Bosnian Government to be blamed for seeking to defend their own people when they are the subject of a massacre in a so-called safe area?  Why does the Minister persist in trying to lay the blame equally on both sides when patently it is not in accordance with the facts and when the aggression and the breaches of human rights are very predominantly on the Serb side?  Does he think that partitioning Bosnia now on what is essentially the ethnic cleansing basis which the Bosnian Serbs sought to achieve from the start is the best way to achieve peace in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the best endeavours of the European Union and the United States failed to bring any resolution of the horrific conflict in the Balkans region which we have had for the past four years.  Due to enormous effort by the United States, and by Assistant Secretary Holbrook in particular and the European Union under the leadership of Carl Bildt, we now have an agreement signed in Dayton, Ohio.  The Deputy was not in the House when I gave Deputy Burke details of this very complex agreement which will require the best efforts not only of the parties on the ground but of the European Union and the United States and other countries like Japan and the ASEAN countries in terms of resources and personnel for the reconstruction and redevelopment of the region.  It may not be perfect.  We recognise that it is a very fragile agreement which has enormous complexities and difficulties, but it is the best hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opportunity is there now, if the parties on the ground are prepared to accept it, to work with the European Union and the United States and the international force that will be there. Sixty thousand ground troops will be required if this mission is to have a prospect of success.  One of the major weaknesses of the UNPROFOR mission was the Secretary General's inability, despite his best efforts, to obtain the <Col N="917" /> requisite number of troops necessary for success.  A lesson which must be learned is that when inadequate numbers of troops &mdash; whose mandate for peace enforcement under Chapter 7 is unclear &mdash; become involved in hazardous missions, completion of them becomes impossible and they should be avoided in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste did not reply to the first part of my series of supplementary questions about what occurred on the date to which I referred.  Does the Tánaiste regard it as ideal that this entire situation was becoming uncontrollable until NATO's intervention?  Would he agree that, had NATO not intervend by way of military action, the situation would have grown considerably worse and Bosnia would have been overrun by the Serbs?  Does the Tánaiste accept that, in the event of facing an aggressor of this kind, it is necessary to meet force with real force? Would he agree that this is the only way to end such a conflict?  Would such thinking pervade the approach of the European Union in the future if a sitution erupted in Kosovo, or any other part of the former Yugoslavia, similar to the awful one which occurred in Bosnia? Is it not correct that the Serbs will only be stopped by the use of superior force against them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The UNPROFOR mandate was not specific enough and there was a lack of sufficient numbers to implement it.  It was only through robust action on the part of NATO that the aggression was deterred.  There is a lesson to be learned in this issue and its nature is obvious.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 12, 35 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>The Government considers that the voluntary and organised repatriation of the more than two million Rwandan refugees from Zaire, Tanzania and Burundi is a central aspect of a solution to the political and humanitarian crisis in the Great Lakes Region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last three months, intensive diplomatic efforts have been under way to establish a regional political framework to promote peace and stability and to encourage a large scale, voluntary return of refugees.  These efforts have <Col N="919" /> involved representatives of the Secretary General of the United Nations, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mrs. Ogata, the regional Governments and former US President Jimmy Carter.  These efforts have enhanced the prospects for a long-term settlement of the crisis.  The Government welcome the Carter initiative and the resulting Cairo Declaration of November 30 in which all regional leaders, including President Mobutu of Zaire, committed themselves, <i>inter alia,</i> to working together for accelerated voluntary return of refugees. It is our hope that the Cairo Declaration, and the follow-up Summit planned for early next year, will prove to be a catalyst for long-term peace and stability in the region.</P>
    <P>Since September the rate of return of refugees to Rwanda has remained low. From our ongoing contacts with UNHCR and Irish aid agencies, I understand that within the camps in Zaire there is still uncertainty as to the intentions of the Zairian authorities. There is a strong sense that more decisive action is needed against intimidators in the camps who are actively discouraging ordinary refugees from returning home.</P>
    <P>Within Rwanda itself, plans are in place to receive greater numbers of returning refugees.  The plans have been agreed by the Government of Rwanda in close co-operation with the UNHCR and international aid agencies.  The objective is to provide essential rations to between 6,000 and 8,000 returning refugees per day as they transit to their home communes.  The resettlement of Rwandan refugees in their communes will be closely monitored by the UN Human Rights Field Operation for Rwanda who have an essential role in ensuring that the communal authorities act fairly and guarantee the rights of returning refugees.</P>
    <P>The Government does not underestimate the challenge which the large scale return of refugees will pose at a social level within Rwanda &mdash; not least in relation to property issues.  It has been <Col N="920" /> estimated that between one and two million Rwandan people could be criminally implicated in last year's genocide of close to one million people.  There are major implications both socially and legally to this level of criminality.  The prisons of Rwanda are unacceptably overcrowded and there is a serious risk of revenge killings which would further postpone any prospect of national reconciliation.</P>
    <P>The Government remains committed to doing everything possible, both bilaterally and in cooperation with EU partners and the UN, to help overcome such challenges and to encourage national reconciliation and reconstruction in Rwanda.  Our commitment reflects the continuing concern of the Irish people that Rwanda be an ongoing political and humanitarian priority.  That concern was further expressed by President Robinson during her visit to Rwanda from 9 to 13 October when she was accompanied by the Minister of State with responsibility for development cooperation at my Department, Deputy Burton.  The Government will continue to voice that concern and it is our intention to make action on Rwanda and the Great Lakes Region an ongoing priority as part of our EU Troika and Presidency responsibilities during 1996.</P>
    <P>Ireland, with its EU partners, supports the continuation of the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda &mdash; UNAMIR &mdash; which is due to expire on 8 December.  We consider UNAMIR to be an important stabilising factor and objective presence in Rwanda.  At a practical level, UNAMIR provides significant technical and logistical support to the international aid effort in Rwanda.</P>
    <P>Against this background Ireland supported an EU demarche to the UN Deputy Secretary General for Peace-keeping Operations, Mr. M. Kittani, which was made in New York on 1 December.  Bilaterally, Ireland also made its own demarche to the Rwandan Government through diplomatic channels earlier this week.  In so doing, we strongly emphasised the importance of <Col N="921" /> extending the UNAMIR mandate and sought the cooperation of the Rwandan Government accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Government hope for a positive outcome to the ongoing negotiations on the extension of the UNAMIR mandate. The negotiations will probably not be concluded before the end of this week.</P>
    <P>Since the beginning of the crisis in Rwanda and in the region a total of £6.9 million has been allocated by the Irish Government for emergency relief and rehabilitation efforts.  The objective of this assistance has been to support international efforts to meet emergency needs and to restore civic institutions and the rule of law in Rwanda.  This assistance has been channelled through the Irish aid agencies Concern, Trócaire, GOAL and Refugee Trust, to UN agencies, the International Committee of the Red Cross and directly to Rwandan Ministries.  A detailed breakdown of each grant has been made available to the House and for inclusion in the Dáil records.</P>
    <P>Of the total allocation of £6.9 million, £4.8 million has been spent on emergency humanitarian assistance for refugees and displaced persons including a grant of £350,000 to ease the humanitarian crisis in Rwanda's prisons.  A further £1.4 million has been spent bilaterally on basic rehabilitation projects aimed at restoring national and local administrations which have been devastated by genocide and war.  Grants have been made for communal police training as well as for six Rwandan Ministries &mdash; including the Ministry of Justice and the Interior.  Grants totalling £730,000 have been made to the International Tribunal, the UN Human Rights Field Operation and for the recent Genocide Summit in Kigali which Ireland co-sponsored with the US Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Tánaiste's understanding that, as President Mobutu has associated himself with the Cairo Declaration, the threatened forced repatriation of the refugees will now <Col N="922" /> not take place?  If not, will the Tánaiste take action at EU level to ensure that this threatened repatriation does not proceed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>President Mobutu's co-operation is significant and I hope it has the effect Deputy Burke desires.  The forced expulsion of refugees from Zaire resulted in the return of 15,000 Rwandans to their own country.  Numerous demarches were issued by the European Union and Zaire suspended its actions. At that time, the Zairian authorities stated they would recommence forced repatriations towards the end of 1995 if substantial progress was not made in relation to voluntary repatriation. Extensive diplomatic efforts have been made in the region, and at international level, to establish a regional political framework to promote peace and stability and to encourage a large scale voluntary return of refugees.  These efforts have involved the representative of the UN Secretary General and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.  We will continue to monitor the situation.</P>
      <P>We understand, from our mission in Geneva, that the UNHCR has not received any reports that Zaire intends to expel a large number of refugees. Internal debate is taking place at Kinshasa between President Mobutu and his Ministers on the question of the deadline.  We will continue with the international effort to ensure there is no forced repatriation and with efforts to assist in building a regional political framework that will promote peace and stability.</P>

      <P>What action is being taken to ensure that refugees are successfully assimilated into Rwandan society on their return home?  Their safety is obviously fundamental.  What action is being taken at EU level to establish a force to ensure their safety on their return?  A proper judicial system is essential.  What steps are being taken by the international agencies, the EU and the UN, to introduce such a system?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU and the UN are actively involved in establishing respect for human rights and a proper judicial system.  Financial and other assistance has been and will continue to be given. We have had the benefit of information from the UN/EU human rights mission in Rwanda on what happened to refugees who returned home.  Of 30,000 who returned in October 1995, 60 were arrested and accused of genocide.  After some days 14 of them were released. The view is widely held that those who participated in the genocide living outside Rwanda will be slow to return voluntarily. We hope that the majority of refugees who are in a position to return home will do so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that we continue to support the work of the international tribunal and this month we allocated a second grant of £100,000 for it.  We have urged greater international support for the tribunal.  It is expected that it will begin full proceedings in the new year with a plenary session scheduled to take place in Arusha, Tanzania between 8 and 12 January.  This is the result of a recent <i>demarche</i> by the European Union and the UN seeking to expedite the proceedings of the tribunal. The hearing of genocide cases will be a welcome important contribution to the process of national reconciliation in Rwanda.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the serious criticisms made by the NGOs that the international community seems to have forgotten the problems in Rwanda particularly the fact that those involved in genocide were not brought to trial and that thousands of prisoners are held in inhumane conditions?  The imposition of harsh policies by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank is adding to the economic <Col N="924" /> and social hardship experienced there particularly with the collapse of coffee prices.</P>

We will take note of the ongoing work of the NGOs.  The Irish NGOs did not form part of the expulsions yesterday.  We are doing everything to expedite the tribunal and ensure that those who participated in genocide are brought to justice.  I am not in a position to comment on coffee prices.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the increasing anxiety of the Irish community in the United States with regard to the growing anti-immigrant feeling in some quarters and in particular the proposals in the Smith Bill which, if passed, would adversely affect the quality of life in the United States of America for legal immigrants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns to which the Deputy refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Congressman Lamar Smith's Immigration In the National Interest Bill proposes a number of changes to US immigration and welfare law which would adversely affect Irish immigrants or potential immigrants.  The proposals include a reduction in total annual legal immigration from 830,000 to 535,000; elimination of the diversity immigrant <Col N="925" /> visa programme, known as the &ldquo;Schumer&rdquo; or &ldquo;lottery&rdquo; programme; changes to the welfare system relating to both illegal and legal immigrants and restrictions on employment-based immigration.</P>
    <P>Other legislative proposals to restrict entitlement by immigrants to benefits have been presented in both Houses of Congress in the context of reform of the welfare system.  Through the Embassy in Washington I am carefully monitoring these developments.  We have made known our concerns about the implications of any new legislation to Members of Congress.</P>
    <P>An amendment sponsored by Congressmen Schumer of New York, Flanagan of Illinois and Hoke of Ohio to the Immigration in the National Interest Bill, retaining a diversity immigration programme for which Irish people would be eligible, was passed by the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives on 24 October.  I am hopeful that this amendment will be retained when the Bill is considered by the full House in the New Year and that the effects on Irish immigrants of restrictive legislative proposals will be minimised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the status of Irish immigrants in the US could change and that there is talk of a two tier citizenship?  What further action does he propose to take to fight these proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the proposals and the Deputy will be aware from his contacts in Washington that we are doing everything we can.  On my last visit to Washington I had a number of discussions with Senators and Congressmen on the adverse effect the Bill will have on Irish immigrants if it is passed in its present form.  With the help of the ambassador and his staff in Washington who are active on this issue I am reasonably confident that the Schumer amendment will be maintained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Was this matter raised with President Clinton?  Is the Minister confident that the President can veto the legislation?  I understand the matter is tied up with balancing the budget.  Did the Minister meet any immigrant welfare groups?  Has he any information on the efforts made by Senator Kennedy to put amendments forward?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be unusual to take a matter like this up directly with the President.  The Deputy will be aware of Senator Kennedy's interest and assistance in such matters.  When I was in New York last September I had discussions with Irish citizens' welfare groups.  They play a big role in providing facilities and assistance to the Irish community. They voiced their interest in the matter and we will do everything possible to ensure Irish citizens are treated in the way they have been for many decades in the US.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 6 and 65 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in the House before, it is the Government's policy to promote cross-Border economic co-operation in all sectors.  The Government wishes to see <Col N="927" /> full advantage taken of the significant new opportunities which arise in the context of the cessation of violence for North-South trade and economic co-operation.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputies that all Departments and State agencies are fully supportive of establishing and developing cross-Border links.</P>
    <P>Apart from the regular meetings of the Anglo-Irish Conference, Government Departments and agencies, North and South, are in regular contact with each other on a wide range of issues of mutual interest.  I would mention, in particular, co-operation in the operation of EU programmes such as INTERREG II and the special programme for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties.</P>
    <P>Overall ministerial and departmental responsibility for general North-South economic co-operation rests with the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The Anglo-Irish Conference provides a framework for co-operation across a wide area of social and economic issues between the two jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>The conference has in recent years taken initiatives to promote co-operation in fields such as tourism, transport, energy, environment, health, agriculture, education, North/South trade, forestry and fisheries.  Specific projects which have developed from such co-operation are the upgrading of the Dublin-Belfast railway line and the Shannon-Erne waterway.</P>
    <P>In the period since the ceasefires alone, the conference has considered the scope for practical co-operation in the areas of animal health and rural development; cross-Border roads, urban renewal and environmental and health issues.  Further possibilities for North-South co-operation will be examined by the conference over the coming months.</P>
    <P>In addition to activities at central Government level, it would be remiss of me not to remind the House that a wide range of local government and private <Col N="928" /> sector initiatives are under way to promote cross-Border economic and business co-operation in the context of peace.</P>
    <P>While administrative arrangements for North-South co-operation are subject to periodic review, I believe that such co-operation is best carried out as an integral part of the activity of the various Departments and co-ordinated through the Anglo-Irish Conference, whose meetings I chair.  This process already involves close consultation and co-ordination with the various Departments.</P>
    <P>The present arrangement ensures that this important area remains central to the Anglo-Irish process in a way that might not necessarily be achieved under the arrangements envisaged in the Deputy's question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the level of growth in cross-Border trade since the ceasefire has been disappointing?  Does he also agree that there is unnecessary duplication on the two parts of this island in areas such as third level education and hi-tech medicine as the small population on both sides of the Border cannot support much of the infrastructure already in place?  Does the Minister agree that there should be rationalisation in areas such as electricity generation and telecommunications? Would he encourage active and practical co-operation in these matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree in principle that there is duplication in many areas on both sides of the Border which, in the interests of competitiveness and efficiency, we would like to remove. Since the ceasefire and the conference on trade and investment in Washington, with follow-up visits from Mr. Meissner and the Secretary of Commerce, Ron Brown, there is much work to be done but the process must be two way.  We can only engage in talks with those who wish to do so.  Whereas we actively encourage increasing trade and investment, many of the Northern politicians <Col N="929" /> are not as forthcoming in this regard. From a strictly commercial trade investment point of view, both communities would be far better off if this was considered on all-island economy in terms of electricity, telecommunications, transport, tourism and so on.  There are enormous efficiencies and economies to be gained from viewing this as an all-island economy and that would not interfere with people's understanding of sovereignty.  However, having regard to the correspondence I receive, not all people view it in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1994 EU audit found that most schemes funded on a cross-Border nature did not have a real cross-Border objective.  Of the 270 schemes involved, only 39 were of a cross-Border nature.  Even since the ceasefire State agencies have shown little additional interest in cross-Border co-operation. Last week the IDA informed me it had not received any additional remit of funding under the heading of peace and reconciliation since the creasefire. After reading the report of the EU audit it was embarrassing to hear on British television that the only worthwhile cross-Border project was the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal, with which I was involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin-Belfast railway line is another major cross-Border project.  The Deputy should note that the Border also touches the east coast. The Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal project was very successful and brave decisions, that required courage and vision, were taken by those responsible at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give credit where it is due.  That project would not have been possible it he had not taken the initiative.  It has been successful in revitalising many areas along the canal.  Credit is due to the former Taoiseach, Charlie Haughey, for taking the initiative in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="930" /> We must place emphasis on developing cross-Border roads, which was impossible until late last year.  From our many discussions the Deputy will be aware of the priority given by the Government to reopening cross-Border roads in an effort to return a sense of normality to regions that have been disrupted for many years because of their closure.  I hope we can make progress in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss as regards the Deputy's comments about the IDA.  It is endeavouring to attract investment to all parts of this country and finds it easier to market Ireland now that there is peace. However, there must be a lead-in time. Deputies who have been involved with the IDA will know that the follow-through on projects takes a considerable length of time.  The IDA has had enormous success in the past few years and long may that continue as we need jobs and foreign investment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The IDA does not have have sufficient EU funding to build the infrastructure necessary to attract investment along Border roads.  Does the Minister agree that in terms of cross-Border economic co-operation it is important to draw down the maximum EU funding?  There appears to be a problem in this regard, particularly as the Government is having difficulty agreeing the Estimates.  Will the Minister guarantee that maximum EU funding will be drawn down for this purpose, even if it must be redirected from other areas in the short-term?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easy for the Deputy to speculate on areas from which money could be redirected but those sitting around the Cabinet table do not easily give up money allocated to, say, the health services, education or social welfare to fund infrastructural development. Ministers will protect their areas <Col N="931" /> to the best of their ability and, ultimately, we must produce a Book of Estimates.</P>
      <P>The peace process and ceasefires have presented an opportunity to attract investment to Border regions.  I know from discussions with Deputies McDaid and Leonard and Senator Gallagher that Border areas have been severely hit in recent years.  Inquiries are being made and I hope we will see the fruits of the lead-in period by the middle of next year.  People who, for obvious reasons, did not want to locate industry in the Border regions for the past 25 years now view it with much more openness.</P>

      <P>I echo the concerns of my colleagues, Deputies Leonard and McDaid, on the lack of inward investment. Will the Minister agree to meet a deputation of Oireachtas Members from the Border region to discuss the matter so that he could give impetus and direction to programmes and ensure that tangible results come on stream without delay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Gallagher made a similar request to me in the past few days and I told him I would do so at the earliest possible opportunity.  As it would assist me with my responsibilities, I would be happy to meet Deputies.  In principle, we should do everything possible to draw down maximum funding from the EU when it is available.  We can make arrangements to hold such a meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>I agree with the Minister that there has been a limited response within Northern Ireland to some of the overtures that have been made to promote co-opertion, but does he accept, because of the enormous benefits co-operation would bring to the people of the Republic and Northern Ireland, that both he and the Government should continue to pursue this matter as strongly as possible?  Does he realise that many business interests in <Col N="932" /> Northern Ireland do not have the reservations or inhibitions mentioned and that these matters can often come to fruition from small beginnings if one keeps at it?</P>

      <P>As we all learnt many years ago, <i>perseverantia vincit</i> and I intend to persevere.  I have had numerous meetings in the past 12 months with the joint council of the two business bodies, IBEC and its counterpart, which are doing tremendous work in this area. The business community is well aware of the opportunities that exist in many sectors in both parts of the island and will develop these to the full.  The people at large need more information on the benefits to be gained through the elimination of duplication.  It is our objective to continue to promote co-operation between North and South, particularly in the areas of commerce, trade and investment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 16, 23, 38, 48, 63, 64 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland, both bilaterally and along with its partners in the European Union, has consistently expressed its serious concern to the Nigerian authoriies about the case of the late Mr. Ken Saro-Wiwa and his co-defendants.  The Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Joan Burton, gave a comprehensive account of the Government's repeated efforts and appeals to the Nigerian Head of State for clemency in their case during her statement to the House on the Adjournment on 9 November. As Deputies will, unfortunately, be aware, these appeals, along with those of the European Union, the United States, the Commonwealth and numerous other members of the international community, were subsequently ignored.  It was with great sadness and personal disappointment that I found myself expressing the Government's deep sense of shock when the sentences of the Ogoni Civil Disturbances Tribunal were carried out.</P>
      <P>The executions of Mr. Ken Saro-Wiwa and his co-defendants have provided renewed impetus to Ireland and its partners in the European Union to determine what further measures need to be adopted against Nigeria in view of the human rights abuses of the military regime and its failure to demonstrate convincingly its intention to return to democratic rule within a credible and democratic timeframe.  This is reflected in the fact that within the past fortnight two meetings of the General Affairs Council adopted Common Positions on measures against Nigeria.</P>
      <P>In its Common Position of 20 November, which Ireland called for and keenly supported, the European Union strongly condemned the execution of Mr. Ken Saro-Wiwa and his eight co-defendants which took place on 10 November. It deemed this to be a clear failure by Nigeria to honour its commitment to human rights as enshrined in a number of international instruments to which Nigeria is a party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" /> In general terms, the European Union used that Common Position to condemn the human rights abuses perpetrated by the military regime, including capital punishment and harsh prison sentences, implemented following a flawed judicial process and without the possibility of recourse to a higher court. It expressed particular concern at the detention without trial of political figures and the suspension of <i>habeas corpus.</i> It recalled its deep concern at the annulment of Nigeria's 1993 elections &mdash; which were considered free and fair &mdash; and the installation of a new military dictatorship at that time.</P>
    <P>Among the measures adopted or reaffirmed in the Common Position of 20 November are the following: an embargo on arms, munitions and military equipment; the suspension of development co-operation with Nigeria with the possible exceptions of poverty alleviation and support for human rights and democracy; visa restrictions on members of the Provisional Ruling Council and the Federal Executive Committee or their families; suspension of military co-operation and visits of members of the military; visa restrictions on members of the military or security forces and their families; cancellation of military training courses; suspension of all high level visits that are not indispenable to and from Nigeria.</P>
    <P>In adopting these measures Ireland strongly supported the inclusion of a review clause in the Common Position. We did this in order to convey to the Nigerian authorities that further measures would continue to be considered by the European Union and that the situation in Nigeria would be kept under close review.  We also wished to underline that current measures could be increased and strengthened if the situation fails to improve.</P>
    <P>Along with other EU Foreign Ministers at the General Affairs Council last Monday, I gave Ireland's support to a further Common Position on Nigeria which adopted additional restrictive <Col N="936" /> measures against Nigeria.  These provided for: the non-admission to EU countries of persons already in possession of long-term EU visas who are members of the Nigerian Provisional Ruling Council, the Federal Executive Council, the military or security forces and their families; the expulsion of military attachés serving in Nigerian embassies in the EU and the withdrawal of their EU counterparts from Nigeria; the interruption of all contacts in the field of sports through the denial of visas to official delegations and national teams; the adoption of a resolution on Nigeria at the 50th UN General Assembly; the inclusion of Nigeria on the agenda of the UN Commission on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>This latest Common Position is framed in stronger terms than its predecessor, clearly stating that further measures, &ldquo;including sanctions&rdquo;, will be considered if specific steps are not taken by the Nigerian authorities towards an early transition to democracy and full respect for human rights and the rule of law.  Renewable at six-monthly intervals, the Common Position will be monitored by the Ministerial Council to which the Presidency and Commission will regularly report.</P>
    <P>The measures adopted in the EU Common Positions of 20 November and 4 December clearly express the EU's intention to keep the situation in Nigeria under close scrutiny for the foreseeable future and to take such further action as may be required in response to developments.  More restrictive measures, including an oil embargo or assets freeze which I would support, will be considered by the Government and our EU partners accordingly.</P>
    <P>At Monday's Council meeting my own view that we should introduce an oil embargo and a freezing of Nigerian assets was shared by a number of colleagues, but the majority was in favour of adopting the measures I have listed. The feeling was that the time was not yet right, and that an embargo would need to be global to be effective.  The <Col N="937" /> same consideration would apply to any other envisaged sanctions.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that if these or similar options are adopted, they get the full backing of the international community and are not undermined by a lack of cohesion in their observance at international level.  The Government, therefore, strongly supports EU consultation with like-minded states on the question of an oil embargo and other measures to ensure that this will be the case.</P>
    <P>We are very concerned by reports that 19 more Ogoni activists have been charged and are due for trial by the Ogoni Civil Disturbances Tribunal in connection with the murders upon which the case against the late Ken Saro-Wiwa and his colleagues was based.  It is partly in the context of this regressive and most deplorable development that Ireland has urged, within the EU, the review and strengthening of existing measures.  The Government will closely monitor such events in Nigeria and will give its full support to those measures which will put strong political and economic pressure on the Nigerian regime to bring about an early transition to democracy and respect for human rights.</P>
    <P>At Ireland's instigation, the EU sent a fact-finding mission to Ogoniland in November 1994 to assess the damage caused by the very serious civil disturbances in the area.  As a result of the findings of the mission in which Ireland, Austria and the EU Commission participated, a substantial grant was approved under the EU Commission's ECHO programme for the reconstruction of villages and community facilities in Ogoniland.  The implementing agency for that programme was Trócaire.  Bilaterally, Ireland has provided a grant of £14,000 for the restoration of fishing activities in a number of Ogoni villages. This year, we have stepped up our funding in support of human rights activities in Nigeria with a grant of almost £15,000 for the Nigerian Civil Liberties Organisation. We have also provided funding for another Nigerian NGO in the <Col N="938" /> amount of £7,000 for the provision of free legal aid for prisoners being held on long-term remand &mdash; this can be for anything up to ten years.  In addition to funding for human rights activities, £467,183 has been allocated so far this year under the Government's NGO cofinancing scheme in support of poverty alleviation programmes throughout Nigeria.</P>
    <P>Officials at my Department are in consultation with the Irish Ambassador to Nigeria whom I recalled from Lagos immediately after the Ogoni tribunal executions were carried out.  This was followed by the recall of almost all EU Ambassadors for consultations over an indefinite period.  The Nigerian Ambassador to Ireland was recalled to Lagos a short time later.  The Government has not yet decided on the question of the Ambassador's return and is actively discussing the matter with EU partners.  The return of our Ambassador will have to be carefully evaluated in view of ongoing developments in Nigeria, the need to continue to express our views to the Nigerian Government through diplomatic channels and the need to protect the interests of the substantial number of Irish citizens residing in Nigeria.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that he personally and, presumably, the Government would support the imposition of an embargo on oil exports from Nigeria, but that this is not the majority view within the European Union.  Is Ireland in a position, as a gesture at least, to do so unilaterally or must this be done by all 15 member states acting together?  If it is the argument of the majority in the European Union that there would have to be a universal or global ban, does the Minister agree that the refusal of the European Union to buy any oil would have a serious effect on Nigeria and, perhaps, bring it to its senses and lead to the restoration of the democratically-elected President who won what was universally regarded as a free and fair election in 1993 against the military regime, but who is now in jail <Col N="939" /> without a proper charge or conviction? Will the Minister call for his immediate release and reinstatement as President of Nigeria?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to say that a unilateral imposition of an oil embargo by Ireland would be an empty gesture.  The Deputy knows much about the oil industry but, to the best of my knowledge, virtually all of our oil is supplied from the North Sea.  An embargo would therefore be pointless.  I argued strongly that we should seek an international oil embargo as well as asset freezing.  The general view within the European Union is that further action may be necessary depending on developments in Nigeria.  It would be for the United Nations to impose these sanctions if they are necessary.  The EU would probably not have as much impact as would be hoped if it acted on its own. Obviously, these matters will be considered.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government would like to see the release and reinstatement of the President who was elected following what were deemed by the free world to be free and fair elections and the end of the military regime.  The civilised world made its views known over recent weeks and will continue to do so.  I believe we will have a long and difficult battle with the Nigerian regime to establish the rule of law and respect for democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the only action and language these murdering thugs who are in control in Nigeria will understand is an oil embargo because their concerns are cash and assets?  Even if one leaves aside the support of America, the main purchaser of Nigerian oil, the imposition of an embargo by the EU on the purchase of Nigerian oil would be a major gesture given its size.  I am a little taken aback by the Minister's reference to &ldquo;depending on developments in Nigeria.&rdquo; How many more people must be hung or how much more environmental <Col N="940" /> damage must there be in Ogoniland and elsewhere?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister refer to the role of Shell International in this and the environmental damage caused there? The cancellation of visas and embargoes on arms imports are meaningless.  This is about cash into the bank accounts of the generals and civil service in control in Nigeria.  The only thing they will understand is the drying up of that cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, I was one of a number of Ministers who argued unsuccessfully with our European colleagues that we should have a total oil embargo.  I agree with the Deputy that that would have an impact and let the Nigerian regime know they will be cut off from trade.  Some 98 per cent of their overseas earnings come from oil and I will continue to argue for a total embargo and the freezing of assets.  Everything must be done to bring these people to their senses.  The prospect of further executions is worrying. The trials will take place in January and that is what I meant by future developments.  I will continue to argue with my European colleagues and I will probably have an opportunity to do so at the European Council meeting in Madrid next week.</P>
      <P>The view of the Government on Shell International was set out by the Minister of State in my Department, Deputy Burton.  Multinationals such as Shell should consider carefully the human rights aspects of their business operations. There is onus on the Nigerian Government and State parties to do likewise.  There is one difficulty when one sets out to impose sanctions.  While we want to impact on the military regime in Nigeria, there is always a danger that the stricken population in Nigeria will be hurt severely.  In that respect we are trying to co-operate with the NGOs and the many Irish missionaries doing great work there to ensure that work can continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the argument he made about <Col N="941" /> affecting the population was also made in relation to South Africa and that the people of Nigeria are entitled to the same right to self determination?  Would he agree that the EU has only given a gentle warning about an oil embargo? As Deputy Burke said, oil revenue is keeping those people in power.  Is it true that Shell International has continually involved itself in joint ventures with the Nigerian regime and that they are strengthening those joint ventures?  Will the Government and the EU take up that issue against Shell International?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the extent of Shell International's involvement with the Nigeria Government.  A strong message should go to Shell International to examine its involvement in Nigeria and in what is happening.  It may be in a position to assist the world in calling for the reinstatement of a democratically elected Government, respect for human rights and the establishment of total democracy in that country.  They may be in a position to exercise more influence than all of the Governments in the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 8 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>The Government believes that the right to march carries a responsibility to respect the principle that parades should not take place in an area, or along a route, where they are not welcome. I have consistently raised the implications of this principle in discussions with the British Government in the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
      <P>The manner of the policing of parades is also raised on an ongoing basis with the British authorities.  The Government has repeatedly emphasised the importance of the police sensitively handling such situations.</P>
      <P>At the most recent meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 17 October 1995, I expressed concern about various incidents during the recent marching season.  I urged the British authorities to consider the steps they could take to prevent a recurrence of such incidents next year.  In particular I made clear the Government's view that the use of the public order Order to reroute parades should be considered where necessary.  The conference communiqué expressed the hope that confrontations would be avoided in future by advance agreements among all concerned.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputies that I will keep this issue under constant review in the context of the ongoing contacts with the British Government.  The 1996 marching season will certainly be the subject of further intense discussion in the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that discussions are ongoing.  Would the Minister agree that it is essential that a system be put in place before next <Col N="943" /> year's marching season to prevent any repetition of this year's potentially explosive situation?  If agreement cannot be reached in the discussions will he urge the British Government to set out a firm policy for the security forces on preventing marches calculated to provoke the Nationalist community by passing through or beside Nationalist areas?  The Nationalist or republican marches do not go through loyalist residential areas so why should the Orange marches go through Nationalist areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is our view that it is both right and prudent that the right to march be exercised with respect for the rights and sensitivities of others and with regard for the maintenance of public order.  We have urged those involved in organising parades or public demonstrations to exercise the maximum constraint in the context of the developing peace process.  We were fortunate that the marching season passed off without difficulty for a number of years.  We had an unfortunate recurrence this year where we saw tribalism at its most base in the confrontations.</P>
      <P>We can have discussions with the British Government on outlining what I would consider to be fair procedures for the re-routing of marches but the basic principle is that marches should not take place where they are not welcome.  If that was observed, along with respect for other communities' sensitivities, we could avoid confrontation.  It is extremely important that we avoid confrontation in the efforts we are making to strengthen the peace process.  This is one area where we should particularly try to avoid confrontation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the so-called spirit of Drumree should be firmly stamped on by the British Government, that it has nothing to do with civil and religious liberty in a non-partisan sense and that consideration should be given to the question of marches through areas where they are not welcome?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="944" />
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly agree with the Deputy.  All our actions in terms of Northern Ireland are predicated on the basis of establishing tolerance and respect for others.  An incident such as that in Drumree is totally contrary to what we are trying to do.  There must be respect for people's right to march, but let us hope that respect is reciprocated by taking into account other people's sensitivities.</P>

That matter must be raised in the context of the Anglo-Irish talks.  I think the Minister will agree it is time we seriously considered taking the drum as well as the gun out of Irish politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We could sing that again. I understand the historical significance of marches for communities.  Personally they never appealed to me.  I got a better understanding of the marches from McGuinness's play, &ldquo;Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme&rdquo;.  There must be an appreciation of the sensitivities of communities. Events during the summer represented tribalism at its worst, and we are trying to move away from that.  The triumphalism displayed on our television screens after a deal had been agreed in an honourable way was totally unacceptable.  Let us hope that lessons were learned all around from that particular outing.</P>

      <P>I suppose we could request that marches would take place <Col N="945" /> through the fields, up the mountains, around the houses and through the glens.  There will be regular discussions between the Irish and British authorities and with the security forces in Northern Ireland.  Let us hope that next year, as another significant event in the peace process, the unfortunate residents will not experience the intimidation and difficulties which were a feature of this year's marching season.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the issue of social housing.  There have been dramatic developments recently in terms of housing policy, housing standards, location of housing and proposals for integration of social housing in the framework of overall housing.  For far too long we have been operating almost in a vacuum in terms of social housing.  Local authorities built houses as they saw fit, acquiring land for large estates in Tallaght, Clondalkin, Jobstown, Blanchardstown, Ballymun and the inner city. Huge complexes were created in a vacuum without establishing amenities or taking into account employment prospects. While schools were built in these areas they had no shopping centre, hospital or third level institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These facilities are being built at present &mdash; for example, in Tallaght there is a fantastic shopping centre, a fine new regional college and a hospital <Col N="1015" /> is under construction.  However, these amenities were not provided soon enough and many difficulties arose which could have been avoided by integrated planning.  I hope the practice of building huge housing estates without amenities is a thing of the past.  Recent legislation provides that in future local authority housing complexes shall not exceed 75 units, which is very desirable.</P>
    <P>The civic charter established in 1991 by the incoming Dublin Corporation specifically stated that for the duration of that council there would be no green field development by the local authority. Instead the local authority would develop the large number of derelict sites that existed, taking into account infill areas that were crying out for housing.  The ideas was to rejuvenate the city centre by a combination of private housing and social housing, and by and large that is what has been done in the last five years.  There are many cranes throughout Dublin city at present in the construction of apartments and housing developments.  That rejuvenation of the city centre is a welcome development and I hope it will continue.</P>
    <P>In the past a simplistic approach was taken to social housing, with the local authorities fulfilling their responsibilities by providing housing for those in need.  Today there is a much greater mix of housing, which is extremely welcome. We need to fine tune our social housing programme and ascertain which areas can be expanded.  Local authorities are operating a substantial house construction programme.  It is welcome that the number of local authority houses built has increased from 3,500 last year to 3,900 this year with a 27 per cent increase in the capital funding allocation. During the life of the present Government I estimate that in Dublin alone approximately 2,500 units of accommodation will be built by the local authorities, apart from other areas of <Col N="1016" /> housing provision, including those provided by the voluntary housing organisations. Such construction will take place within the boundaries of the corporation area, not on green field sites outside that area.  That is a welcome development as social housing must be in conjunction with housing construction undertaken by the corporation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the involvement of voluntary agencies in the provision of public housing albeit on a smaller scale than the corporation's involvement.  Hundreds of houses are being built in the city and around the country through the operation of voluntary housing organisations. Such voluntary organisations, which operate schemes funded by local authorities, undertake housing construction, draw up letting agreements and set up management structures.  The package provided by such voluntary agencies is welcome.</P>
    <P>Shared ownership housing schemes are excellent because they make it easier for people to simultaneously rent and purchase accommodation.  I hope local authorities will grant mortgages at a cheaper rate under that scheme.</P>
    <P>The purchase of private houses is perhaps the most problematic but the main growth area of the social housing programme presently.  It is growing proportionately strongest.  I estimate that of the 600 units that will be provided by Dublin local authorities, 200 or 250 will be allocated for private housing purchased from the private sector in private residential areas.  That represents a substantial increase when compared to previous practice.  Infant building sites in local authority areas are decreasing, whether used by the private sector to build apartments or by the public sector. While we maintain a policy of building new housing units within the city boundaries, increasingly we will have to purchase private housing from the private arena.  That is desirable, beneficial and key to a good social mix and a proper integrated social housing programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1017" /> As local councillors or politicians, we must give a lead in this area.  Too often communities are alarmed that the right type of people may not be housed in their area, that the people housed there may bring drugs into their community and residents will have no control over the matter.  Such communities are concerned that if a local authority buys too many houses on the one street or in the one area, it may devalue the property of existing residents' or attract undesirable neighbours.  We must reassure people that local authorities operate the scheme in a fair fashion and that there will be proper consultation with local residents, which was not the case in the past.  The absence of proper consultation will instil fear among communities. The extent to which such fears may be fuelled was evident in Blanchardstown recently when the Eastern Health Board attempted to establish a satellite clinic.  As consultations did not take place the residents were up in arms because they were afraid that the community would be inundated with drugs. That scheme is desirable but must be operated fairly.</P>
    <P>The development and operation of a tenant purchase scheme on a permanent basis is desirable.  It is welcome that tenants can purchase the homes in which they reside and that they no longer have to purchase another house.  That practice will give rise to a more settled community. Tenants will purchase the houses in which they reside, hopefully live there for the rest of their lives and pass it on to their children.  Rather than waiting for the development of other schemes, it is welcome that the tenant purchase scheme is now operating on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>The maximum allocation of 30 per cent of the market value of a house in which a tenant has resided for ten or more years under that scheme should be increased.  A higher percentage of the market value of a house should be deducted from the selling price of a <Col N="1018" /> house in which a tenant has resided for a longer period.  In such cases the maximum allocation should be increased from 30 per cent to 50 per cent of the market value of the house over a period of years.</P>
    <P>The management of local authority housing is provided under the 1992 housing legislation.  Every local authority is obliged to publish a management policy.  The purpose of the estate management policy is to focus on tenant participation in the management of flat complexes or housing estates, similar to the work undertaken by management boards of private apartment developments. We have neglected this key area in the past and I am disappointed it is still being neglected.  I would like the Minister to take the matter up with my local authority and I am aware she launched an estate management scheme on the south side of the city recently. However, we are dragging our feet in meeting this statutory requirement.</P>
    <P>New complexes are being developed as are refurbished complexes and the minimum we should expect is that tenants should be versed on estate management prior to being allocated a premises in such a complex.  New local authority housing should not be provided without tenants meeting representatives of the local authority concerned and being informed of the proper operation of an estate management scheme.  I do not understand why we house tenants in new schemes, such as that in Sherrif Street, without satisfying that requirement. Hundreds of people have been housed there without an estate management scheme being put in place.  We have demolished flat complexes because of mismanagement.  Sherrif Street is not an old scheme, it was constructed from 1956 onwards and is not one of the oldest in the city by any means.  Part of the problem stemmed from matters getting out of hand there and magnificent new houses have been built there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1019" /> We have a system of vetting new tenants, not to keep people out but to ensure nobody involved in drugs is allowed into the flats or houses.  We do not have a scheme of estate management and despite pressure, Dublin Corporation is not ready to implement one. I am not satisfied that that should be the case.  The new 32 unit housing scheme in Seán McDermott Street is without an estate management scheme and there should be one.  One of our priorities must be to get a scheme of estate management in all local authority complexes and I want to see the Minister pressurise the local authorities to a greater degree in that regard because I am firmly convinced they are dragging their feet on it.</P>
    <P>We have made some progress on private rented accommodation in recent years.  The Minister for Finance introduced tax relief of £500 to tenants in private rented accommodation in the last budget.  However, we still have a serious problem in central Dublin from Ranelagh and Rathmines on the south side, to the North Circular Road and I am sure we have the same problem in every town.  There is not compulsory registration of landlords and that is the key difficulty.  The local authority register is a voluntary one and there is no compulsion on the landlord to be registered or licensed in terms of quality or standards of accommodation provided. A rent book is required but many landlords breach this legal requirement and when it is put to them, they are often in the process of evicting without due legal process.</P>
    <P>There are many problems in this area and the only way to deal with them is to devolve the function of registration and licensing of private rented accommodation to the local authority where it would become part of the overall social housing programme.  This has not been included in the local authority remit and <Col N="1020" /> it should be part of social housing policy. We could then ensure everybody was registered and licensed on a statutory basis just as every publican must apply each year for a new licence to operate.  The licensing or registration fee could be used to fund the staff required to maintain the register, licensing, health and fire standards, ensure rent books are being provided and proper legal process is adhered to in dealings with tenants in private rented accommodation.  Enormous progress has been made on social housing policy. Attitudes have changed and the Department of the Environment has encouraged this in pressing for change.  I congratulate the Minister and the Department on their efforts.  I want them to go a step further to ensure the local authorities put statutory estate management schemes in place and ensure private rented accommodation is included in the overall social housing programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Politicians have always seen housing as a primary issue.  In the late 1950s housing schemes in Cabra, Crumlin and Ballyfermot &mdash; the major large social housing schemes of that era &mdash; were constructed in response to an overcrowding crisis in the old city area. Waiting lists were reduced at that time. By the 1960s, the crisis had built up again and Ballymun was the response to the 4,000 or so families who could be housed quickly in a new complex which was ideal in theory.  All political parties, other than Democratic Left which was not set up then, can be complimented or criticised for what was or was not achieved with social housing policy in those decades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I represent two of the new satellite towns created in County Dublin in the 1970s.  This was social housing in what are now Fingal County Council and South Dublin County Council.  It too was desirable in that it attacked the housing crisis in the corporation area at <Col N="1021" /> the time.  However, the families being accommodated in new local authority areas were probably inadequately served.  It is a matter of regret that a part of my constituency, north Clondalkin, is the only part of the country to be the basis for a task force on urban disturbances and difficulties.  The task force highlighted the difficulties in the area and the need for hands on management rather than responding to a crisis by housing thousands of people for instance in north Clondalkin, west Tallaght and west Blanchardstown areas. Deputy Costello mentioned hundreds of people being located in new housing in Sheriff Street, but housing in Clondalkin and Tallaght was in response to an urgent housing need and, in trying to achieve some equity in considering this, one must realise the families were being transferred from overcrowded accommodation to fine, new three-bedroomed homes which were costly from the point of view of the taxpayer.  Unfortunately, the back up was inadequate.  Locating such large numbers of local authority houses in one region, without giving the authority the ability to provide for community facilities or services, left these communities in difficulties.  Dublin Corporation was the housing authority and housing capital was provided.  I criticise the Department of the Environment, its Ministers and officials at the time, who had not the vision to broaden the issue beyond capital housing funds and left the rest of the problems to a local authority which was incapable of coping and providing anything like the necessary services and facilities.</P>
    <P>I recall local authority meetings vividly at which we discussed the distribution of limited community funds for various projects throughout County Dublin.  After a couple of years it struck me that parts of my constituency and that of Deputy Ryan were high on the list for securing funds while other areas did not receive funding.  The local community probably had an architect and <Col N="1022" /> somebody in the financial arena and a competent development committee who submitted a glossy presentation with which the community affairs people were impressed while north Clondalkin, west Blanchardstown and west Tallaght did not have the same sophistication. The limited funds were going to the projects which least needed them.  I criticised this and spoke against parts of my constituency at the time, out of that was born what is now called the CODAN areas which arose out of an argument during a debate on the Estimates when I criticised the fact that funds were going to areas which least needed them while areas which needed them most were not in the queue.  Officials took on board the recommendation that limited funds should go to those areas to enable them to catch up.</P>
    <P>Under the social housing policy hundreds of millions of pounds of scarce taxpayers' money was used in the construction of those large satellite towns while there was little in the way of investment.  This has resulted in a deterioration of those areas and further cost. Not much has changed in the satellite towns and the problems still remain. The benefit of discussing social housing policy here is to try to complete what commenced as a desirable housing programme to accommodate those living in inadequate housing.</P>
    <P>In an effort to make local authorites more responsive to the needs of the immediate areas we created a new structure in Dublin.  The Minister will recall that she responded to a matter on the Adjournment which I tabled regarding the transfer of local authority and social housing from the ownership of Dublin Corporation to South Dublin and Fingal County Councils.  It is deplorable that, as we approach the end of the year, this matter has not been resolved.  Dublin Corporation has been sucking the financial lifeblood of rents out of its good quality housing stock in the county and using its resources within the city <Col N="1023" /> boundaries.  It collects rents, takes them back to City Hall and nothing else is heard of them.</P>
    <P>The completion of the taking in charge of housing estates in North Clondalkin was painful.  If they had been private developers we would have attempted to have them jailed as we have done regularly.  Some of my colleagues from this side of the House who served as Ministers and officials in the Department did not ensure that local authorities took their responsibilities seriously.  The excuse is that there is haggling over State resources between local authorities.  Why have the Minister and his officials not cut through the bureaucratic red tape between Dublin Corporation and South Dublin and Fingal County Councils, resolved the matter and given responsibility for large housing areas to the democratically elected local authorities who have a responsibility for the greater north Clondalkin, west Blanchardstown and west Tallaght areas.  Local authority members representing those constituents have no access to questions, motions or inputs to Dublin Corporation who has responsibility, despite local government reform, for the social housing programme in the greater Dublin area which appears to be logjammed.</P>
    <P>Housing maintenance in North Clondalkin is dependent on the efficiency of the housing department of Dublin Corporation in lower Ballyfermot, which is deplorable.  South Dublin and Fingal County Councils have submitted their proposals but there has been no definitive conclusion to that fundamental platform of local government reform. The proposal for Dublin arose out of the fact that Dublin Corporation housed thousands of its families in the county area.  I urge that something definitive be achieved in this area.  I recall that under the legislation the Minister was the final arbitrator.  I think a person has been <Col N="1024" /> appointed with a view to obtaining a consensus but it is time it was completed.</P>
    <P>In regard to social housing, we do not have the same numerical pressures as in the past but we have equally difficult and changing circumstances that need to be addressed.  Our social housing policy is trying to respond to changing demographic trends and family sizes and the various aspects of single parenthood and so on.  Over the past ten or 15 years one of the social policy housing disasters was under Dr. Garret FitzGerald's Government who introduced a theoretical economic formula of how one could get cheap local authority housing.  It arrived at a calculator driven policy whereby if one gave back a local authority house one was given X pounds to buy a private house.  What happened in north Clondalkin and west Tallaght? Large local authority housing estates were denuded of their community leaders.  Hard-working priests in these communities deplored what was happening saying that the leaders of the parish were suddenly attracted away by a peculiar social housing programme which had a disastrous effect on some of those new areas.  I witnessed this and no doubt the Minister and other Deputies all received representation with a view to speeding up the process of the loan applications and the payment of the grants so that those community leaders could move into private housing.</P>
    <P>Instead of building housing at £30,000 to £40,000 per unit we were getting houses at £4,000 or £5,000 which saved the Exchequer funding but created a major social disaster.  With the wisdom of hindsight we can all be experts in regard to what should have been done.</P>
    <P>The joint ownership scheme was slow to take off.  For example, there are approximately 200 sites available in a location near me in Lucan where some houses have been constructed but with <Col N="1025" /> many gaps in between as clear boundaries were not established.  This is related to the points made by Deputy Costello about estate management.  The Minister should put in place a master development programme to be overseen by local authorities.  This scheme gives young couples an opportunity to enter the home ownership market without a heavy financial burden.  I have written to the manager of South Dublin County Council about this matter and the Minister of State should ask her officials to seek a progress report on the overall management of the joint ownership scheme, the numbers who have availed of it and its success rate.  I would hate to think that an excellent scheme could be made unattractive due to a lack of proper estate management.  Sites can be made very unattractive if the five or six houses already built are unfinished, have no back walls and no boundaries.</P>
    <P>The crisis management by the Government has resulted in much private accommodation being rented by the Eastern Health Board.  The only return to the State for the expenditure of this huge amount of money is a lack of housing stock and an ongoing drain on resources.  An open-ended rent support policy is not logical from an economic or political point of view.  The Department of the Environment is not adequately funded while the Department of Health is supporting the Eastern Health Board which pays the rent subsidy.  The rent paid to date could have been used to build many local authority houses.</P>
    <P>It is easy to understand why single parent families cannot be accommodated in three bedroom local authority houses.  Some years ago single parents in my constituency were accommodated in three bedroom local authority houses but this was opposed by young families with two or three children.  It is very difficult for public representatives to stand back when they see single parents with young children accommodated in large <Col N="1026" /> flat complexes which have very few facilities.  Recently at an advice centre a man told me that his wife and two children were living in the family home and he was renting a single room which was in a very bad condition.  It is very difficult under the social housing policy to provide accommodation for this man. There is an urgent need for the provision of accommodation for single parents/separated spouses similar to that provided for old people.  These people account for an increasing number of applicants on the housing lists, particularly in west Dublin.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to complete the transfer of corporation housing stock as quickly as possible and to give local authorities the necessary resources to manage large housing estates in County Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The decision of the Government to initiate a debate on this issue is to be welcomed.  Public representatives deal with problems relating to a lack of public housing on a daily basis.  In my clinics approximately 50 per cent of cases relate to local authority housing and loans and planning permission for private housing in rural areas of Fingal. Given the collective experience of Deputies on this subject, I hope the Minister of State will give serious consideration to any proposals which would improve the policy in this area.  I also ask her to look at any negative aspects of the policy highlighted during the debate.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, and the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, for their enlightened approach to this policy document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one of my first contributions as a Deputy I referred to local authority housing or, to be more correct, the lack of it.  Prior to my election in 1989 I gave a commitment that the Labour Party would do everything in its power to put <Col N="1027" /> local authority housing back on the political agenda.  A deliberate decision had been taken by the minority Fianna Fáil Government from 1987-89, and the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government from 1989-92, to drastically reduce the level of local authority housing.  The statistics bear this out.  By the time it left office in 1987 the Fine Gael-Labour Government had reduced the number of families on the housing waiting list from 28,000 to 17,000. However, by 1993 this figure had again increased to 27,500.</P>
    <P>People showed their opposition to this disastrous development by taking action.  Many housing action groups were formed in my constituency and two of the most successful were in Swords and Balbriggan.  These groups led to the formation of two housing coops with the assistance of NABCo.  The members of the co-op in Swords now reside in their own houses while the houses in Balbriggan are nearing completion. The co-op option is provided for in the policy document and is to be recommended.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, for funding the Balbriggan scheme and the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, for funding the Swords scheme.</P>
    <P>During the crisis in 1989 Gerry O'Sullivan and his &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; team produced a programme on the extent of the housing problem.  I drove around Swords with the camera in the back of my car so that housing applicants could be interviewed in their own environment. The programme which identified the extent of the problem was timely and a huge success.  Thankfully, since that date we have been moving in the right direction.  The experience of meeting housing applicants in their existing accommodation will always remain with me.  Probably long after leaving politics.  One family, two adults and two children &mdash; representative of thousands throughout the country &mdash;<Col N="1028" /> lived in a mobile home with no direct water supply or sewerage facilities.  The children were aged four and six months respectively.  I vividly recall the condensation running down the walls and large droplets falling on the bunk beds.  I also saw condensation dripping from the strip of aluminium in the centre of the roof to the floor.  The sheets and blankest were wet with condensation in the morning.  This is the reality of the housing crisis for thousands of people.  When the wind blows in a certain direction, the smoke comes down the chimney into the living area.  Was it any wonder that those children had coughs, and were attending the doctor and going to hospital regularly?  This is what thousands on the housing waiting list have to bear daily.  Should we wonder that marriages are put under severe strain in these circumstances?  It is even worse when the adults are unemployed, as many are.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the need for cutbacks &mdash; and we hear right wing economists calling for cuts &mdash; I sincerely hope the Minister will build on the progress made since the Labour Party came into office in 1992.  I am pleased that the Minister confirmed in her speech that the Government is well on its way to delivering on its commitment of 7,000 new starts this year.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that plans for large council housing estates are no longer under consideration in the Department. We must learn from past mistakes.  I believe Dublin Corporation's policy during the 1970s to lift people literally from their inner city environment and drop them in a greenfield development in the middle of County Dublin was disastrous.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased at <Col N="1029" /> the efforts being made in the Department of Health to implement the Child Care Act and to deal with child care issues.  However, I am concerned at the emerging evidence of ongoing disclosures of abuses of children who have been in residential care.  We have had a series of investigations, following allegations, by the health board in Dublin and others throughout the country.  I understand more evidence is emerging on what happened in Trudder House, County Wicklow.  Will the Minister inform us of the information he has on this home and how he intends to act on the issue?  Trudder House in the past catered for children with severe difficulties. It will be pretty disturbing if it emerges that they have not received the care, protection and care to which they are entitled.  It is critical that children who come into care &mdash; there are 3,000 children in care, with approximately 800 of them in residential care &mdash; receive the highest possible standard of care and protection that the State can provide if it is to take the place of the family.  It is very important that we take every possible step to ensure that abuses such as those that allegedly took place in Madonna House, perhaps in Trudder House and other residential homes never again happen to children placed in care.  The way to ensure that children in residential care are protected and that the highest standards apply is to publish the recommendations from the investigation into Madonna House as soon as possible.  When is the report on the investigation into Madonna House likely to be published?  Does the Minister believe that what we have learned from the Madonna House investigation will inform policy in future on the management of residential homes and will an independent inspectorate for residential homes be established?  It is very important because so many homes are now run by health boards, not voluntary groups, and health boards cannot investigate themselves.  Such an inspectorate <Col N="1030" /> staffed by experienced practitioners would bring, through working together, a comprehensive and integrated view of how services should be developed to the highest standard.  It would replace the <i>ad hoc</i> system of inquiries and investigations which has produced no independent report on allegations of deficiencies in the child care services.</P>
      <P>Independent reporting to the Minister would enable a clear understanding of where State or voluntary services fail children or any other vulnerable individuals. The impact of an inspectorate would show to ordinary people that confidence in public and voluntary services is justified as in the vast majority of cases staff are dedicated to the highest standard of care.  This would be supportive of staff.  The staff in residential homes need support because many feel under siege.</P>
      <P>In a number of related areas, the new guidelines on child sexual abuse must be monitored and evaluated in an ongoing way.  Health boards must be monitored to ensure they have written procedures for the management and investigation of child abuse.  This was recommended by the Kilkenny investigation.  It is also very important that joint training be initiated by the Garda Síochána and health boards to train staff, particularly social workers, to ensure that the new guidelines published earlier this year are being implemented properly.  There is a need for clearer procedures where complaints are made against staff members and employers and trade unions must be involved in working on these.  The constitutional review group must consider whether a statement on the constitutional rights of children should be included in a new constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that the most vulnerable children should not suffer further when taken into care.  We must ensure the highest standards and understand the danger of closed institutions, as we have seen clearly from the past.  I appreciate that the majority of staff in <Col N="1031" /> residential homes work very hard in difficult circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about recent revelations of abuse of children in residential care.  However, it is important not to lose sight of the excellent work being performed by residential care staff, the vast majority of whom are above reproach and share our revulsion at the very idea of children being abused while in care.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that a number of measures have been and are being taken to try to guard against the abuse of children in residential care.  Under the Child Care Act, responsibility for monitoring standards in children's residential centres operated by voluntary bodies rests with the relevant health boards while responsibility for monitoring standards in centres run by health boards rests with the Department of Health. The Act does not provide for the establishment of an independent national inspectorate of children's residential centres.</P>
      <P>New regulations under the Child Care Act in relation to the placement of children in residential care by health boards came into force on 31 October 1995.  At the same time, 44 sections of the Act were brought into operation.</P>
      <P>The regulations require health boards to satisfy themselves as to the standards in children's centres.  Health boards are required, among other matters, to satisfy themselves that appropriate standards, care practices and operational policies are operated in residential centres catering for children placed by the boards.  The regulations also require health boards to visit, supervise and review children in their care on a more systematic basis than before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular, the regulations require each health board to: satisfy itself that adequate arrangements are in place at <Col N="1032" /> each residential centre to guard against the risk of injury and for the reporting and recording of accidents and injuries affecting children residing there; satisfy itself that procedures are in place for the prompt notification to the board of significant events affecting children placed there by the board; arrange for the supervision of children placed in residential centres by the board, requiring that a child be visited as often as may be necessary, but the maximum intervals between visits will be three months during the first two years of the placement and six months thereafter; and arrange for the periodic review of each child placed in a residential centre. Reviews will be carried out at intervals not exceeding six months during the first two years of the placement and thereafter at least once in each calendar year.  The new regulations also empower an authorised officer of the health board to enter and inspect a children's residential centre, as required, and to take the necessary action to ensure compliance with the regulations.  Furthermore, the regulations permit the inspection, by a person acting on behalf of the Minister for Health, of the practices and procedures operated by a health board in relation to the provision of residential care services.</P>
    <P>In addition to the regulations, my Department has also circulated a draft guide to standards in children's residential centres.  This provides advice to all agencies concerned with the provision of residential care for children on the standards which should obtain in such centres.  The guide addresses a range of issues relating to residential care and pays particular attention to the need to ensure that children in care are not exposed to any risk of abuse.  The guide highlights the importance of agreed child protection procedures for residential centres which would define policy in relation to the prompt reporting and investigation of any suspicions or allegations of abuse or neglect of children <Col N="1033" /> while in residential care.  Such a policy would also ensure that staff are equipped with the necessary skills to recognise and deal with any signs or symptoms associated with bullying, scapegoating, harassment or abuse.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that new directions have been issued in relation to the recruitment and selection of staff for children's residential centres.  Under these directions employers must obtain Garda clearance on all staff being considered for appointment to a children's residential centre.  These directions have recently been extended to include the recruitment of staff to any area of the health services where they would have substantial access to children or vulnerable individuals.</P>
    <P>I believe that the various measures we are taking will go a long way towards ensuring high standards of care in all children's residential centres and in promoting and protecting the welfare of children in residential care.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm an deis seo a fháil le ceist atá ina cnámh spáirne le blianta fada in Oileáin Árainn á thógáil leis an Aire Stáit.  Is é sin an gá atá ann go mbéadh oifigeach leasa phobail lán aimsireach fostaithe ar Oileáin Árainn amach ó chósta na Gaillimhe.</P>
      <P>I láthair na huaire tá oifigeach leasa phobail ar na hOileáin ag comhnaí in Inis Mór fostaithe ag an mBord Sláinte agus de réir mar a thuigim, mar nár tugadh aon chead ó Airí Sláinte éagsúla, níl ach duine páirt-aimsireach i gceist. Tá beagáinín os cionn trian de phá iomlán oifigigh leasa phobail lán-aimsireach á íoc don duine atá fostaithe.  Mar sin tá tú ag caint faoi beagainín os cionn trian ó thaobh cúrsaí ama de don oifigeach leasa phobail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anois is féidir argóint nach bhfuil an <Col N="1034" /> t-oifigeach leasa phobail seo ach ag freastal ar dhaonra de 1,500 duine.  Is é sin, tá thart ar 800 duine in Inis Mór, 200 duine in Inis Meáin agus 350 duine nó beagáinin os a chionn in Inis Oírr.  Ach, ar ndóigh, is rud éagsúil ar fad a bheith mar oifigeach leasa phobail ag freastal or oileáin.  Caithfidh an t-oifigeach leasa phobail sa chás seo dul go hInis Meáin agus Inis Oírr lá sa tseachtain.  Go mór mhór sa gheimhreadh sa chaoi a bhfuil cúrsaí iompair caithfidh sé dul ann ar an eitleán.  So nuair a théann tú go dtí an t-oileán eile fiú muna bhfuil ach uair a chloig nó uair go leith oibre ann, caithfidh tú fanacht go dtí go mbeidh an t-eitleán ag dul ar ais trathnóna.  Freisin, ar ndóigh, de bharr nádúr na nOileán tá go leor daoine ar na hOileáin ag braith ar chúnaimh leasa shoisialaigh le maireachtáil. Mar sin, tá ualach trom oibre ar an oifigeach leasa phobail.  Agus freisin, ar ndóigh, níl na gnáth seirbhisí a bhíonn ar fáil ar an morthír ar fáil ar na hOileáin.  Mar shampla, níl aon Chumann Naoimh Uinsinn de Pól ann; níl aon oibrithe sóisialta ann agus mar sin de.  Dá bhrí sin tá ualach trom oibre ar an oifigeach leasa phobail ar na hOileáin nach bhfuil ar a leithéid ar an mór-thír.</P>
    <P>Cuireann sé iontas orm ó tharla go bhfuil oifigeach leasa pbhobail ag comhnaí ar na hOileáin, nach bhfuiltear sásta oifigeach lán-aimsireach a cheapadh. Tá fás nach beag tagaithe ar líon na ndaoine a thagann go dtí na hOileáin i rith an tsamhraidh agus fás dá réir ar na fadhbanna.  Mar shampla, tá suas le 2,000 duine sa ló ag teacht isteach go hInis Mór agus, ar ndóigh, éiríonn fadhbanna le cuid de na daoine seo. Fanann cuid acu agus ritheann cuid acu as airgead agus mar sin de.  Dá bharr sin bíonn tarraingt ar sheirbhísí an oifigigh leasa phobail.</P>
    <P>Tá mise ag súil go bhféadfadh an Roinn agus an Bord Sláinte breathnú go báiúil ar stádas lán-aimsireach a thabhairt don oifigeach seo.</P>
    <P>Tá plé fada ar bun maidir le coiste <Col N="1035" /> eadaránach, tuarascáil a gealladh dúinn roimh dheireadh mhí Dheireadh Fomhair nach bhfuil faighte.  Ach idir an dá linn seo rud beag a bhféadfaí a dhéanamh do na hOileáin.  Níl aon chostas mór ag baint leis, mar tarlaíonn sé nach bhfuil aon nós nó precedent i gceist do aon áit eile sa tír ó tharla nach bhfuil i gceist ach an t-aon duine amháin seo atá ina chomhnaí ar oileán atá ag cur seirbhís ar fáil do phobal na dtrí Oileán. Déanaim an achainí seo chun a chinntiú gur féidir seirbhís lán-aimsireach a chur ar fáil do na hOileánaigh mar atá a gcur ar fáil ar an mór-thír.  Creidim féin go bhfuil an t-ualach oibre ann agus go bhfuil gá le duine lán-aimsireach.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Virginia (Cavan) Sewerage Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity of raising this matter on the Adjournment and thank the Minister of State Deputy Liz McManus, for her attendance.</P>
      <P>The Virginia sewerage scheme was included in the river Boyne catchment protection scheme application for funding submitted to the European Commission in December 1994 under the Cohesion Fund.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, in reply to my parliamentary question on this subject on 27 April 1995 stated that he expected a reply from the Commission on that Cohesion Fund application by late May or early June 1995.  In exchanges during that Question Time the Minister accepted that the present sewerage system in Virginia is totally inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat that there is an urgent need to provide a new sewerage scheme in Virginia.  The present scheme which is totally inadequate was provided in 1935 and planned to cater for a population of about 300.  The same scheme now serves a catchment area with a population of 1,500.  When installed in the 1930s there were 110 connections to this scheme.  I understand there are now upwards of 300 connections, including one to a vocational school with 400 students, <Col N="1037" /> hotels and industries.  Further developments are proposed for Virginia, including additional tourist accommodation, a large number of private houses and a nursing unit with a 30-bed complement. Virginia is a growing town, and this will continue owing to its easy access to Dublin and the expected regeneration of the Border economy.</P>
    <P>I appealed previously to the Minister to try to have construction work on this scheme commenced before the end of 1995.  That target cannot now be achieved.  In view of the total inadequacy of the present scheme and the fact that the present system poses a serious danger to the quality of the renowned waterway of Lough Ramor, I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy McManus to try to have work commenced on this scheme at the earliest possible date.  Proper sanitary services are urgently needed in Virginia.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to inform me that this scheme will progress rapidly and that a positive and successful outcome to the application will be forthcoming without further delay.</P>
    <P>Finally, I appeal to the Minister to do everything in her power to ensure that construction of this much needed scheme commences during 1996.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Smith for raising this matter.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the need to extend and improve the existing sewerage system in Virginia, which discharges to Lough Ramor and ultimately to the wider river Boyne Catchment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made in recent years with the provision of water and sewerage infrastructure in County Cavan.  A water supply scheme has been completed at Belturbet at a cost of just over £2 million and a sewerage scheme at Bailieboro for over £1 million.  Two major water supply <Col N="1038" /> schemes are at present under construction &mdash; the Ballyjamesduff regional water supply scheme, costing an estimated £6,652,000, and the Bailieboro regional water supply scheme, at a cost of some £6,302,000.</P>
    <P>As regards new schemes, the planning of the Ballyjamesduff sewerage scheme is being progressed.  This has been included in an application to the EU Commission for finance under the Cohesion Fund in respect of the Lough Ree catchment protection scheme and I am confident of being able to advance it shortly.  The Ballyconnell sewerage scheme, estimated to cost just over £1 million, has already been approved for funding under the EU initiative INTERREG 2.  Under this programme also, another eight small schemes, including water and sewerage, have been approved for funding and these are estimated to cost £660,000.  I hope the Deputy will agree that all of this represents a very considerable investment in water infrastructure in County Cavan.</P>
    <P>The existing Virginia sewage treatment plant, situated on the northern shore of Lough Ramor, is acknowledged to be inadequate for today's needs.  It was installed in the late 1930s to cater for a population of between two and three hundred.  The present population is over fifteen hundred and the plant is now unable to cope.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to provide secondary treatment, which will relieve the problem of overloading of the existing sewers and eliminate flooding.  The new scheme is being designed to cater for an estimated population of 2,000 persons and would include the construction of a new sewage treatment facility, pumping station, rising main, sewer, storm overflow and outfall pipe.  Phosphate removal would also be provided to prevent enrichment of Lough Ramor and to improve and protect the water quality of the lough.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1039" /> The scheme is estimated to cost about £1.7 million and funding has been sought from the European Union.  Planning is well advanced and in July last the Department sought revised contract documents for the scheme from the local authority.  We are at present awaiting the submission of these detailed contract documents.  The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot give formal approval to a proposal which has not yet been fully finalised at local level.  I have, however, indicated my general acceptance of the urgency of this scheme and I hope it will be possible to progress it before long.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Dublin Commercial Airport Proposal.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for affording me the opportunity of raising this most important issue.  Over the past six months or so Mr. Tony Ryan and his Ryanair team have met with various county councils, town commissioners, chambers of commerce, community-based organisations and, I believe, the Department, endeavouring to elicit their support for his dream of a second airport at Baldonnel.</P>
      <P>The proposal to build a second commercial airport in Dublin is ludicrous.  It does not stand up to serious economic, environmental or social examination and would be a disaster for the economic life of North Dublin.  There is no justification for building a second airport for a city with a population of just over one million people.  The aviation needs of Dublin are well catered for by the existing airport.  The establishment of a second airport would simply lead to the loss of many jobs in North Dublin and to the transfer of existing jobs from one airport to the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin Airport is one of the best managed airports in Europe.  It caters for nearly eight million passengers annually and that figure is growing. <Col N="1040" /> When its present improvement programme is completed it will be able to cater for 14 million passengers and will have an ultimate capacity of 40 million.</P>
    <P>This proposal will also put at risk the possibility of developing Dublin Airport as a whole.  Like most international airports Dublin Airport will require a direct public transport system to the city centre by way of extension of the DART or the building of a light rail transport system.  To transfer some three million passengers per annum to a second airport would make this proposal uneconomical.  It would prove disastrous.</P>
    <P>Interest in this issue is not confined to Dublin.  The country already has three State airports and six private regional airports competing for internal and international business.  Most of the regional airports are struggling to survive and depend, to a large extent, on feeder traffic from Dublin.  A second airport would duplicate this traffic and place the future of many of the regional airports at risk.  It would also adversely affect jobs in the process.</P>
    <P>The Ryanair proposal for Baldonnel referred to an investment from the private sector of £50 million for building a terminal and provision of aircraft parking and taxiway facilities.  Who will pay for the necessary investment such as upgrading the runways, air traffic control approach roads, etc?  This process would involve duplication of scarce resources and it should not be forgotten that the Northern Cross Route will come on stream next year.  Ryanair representatives have spoken of 10,000 jobs being created at Baldonnel.  I do not believe the figure is correct, given the numbers currently employed at Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>A major environmental issue is also involved because Baldonnel was never planned as a civilian airport.  The immediate effect of turning it into such an airport would be a significant <Col N="1041" /> worsening of the environment of the area with adverse consequences for the neighbouring communities of Baldonnel, Clondalkin and Ballyfermot.  Aer Rianta, which runs Dublin Airport, is owned by the Minister on behalf of the taxpayers.  Over the past seven years Aer Rianta has paid the State over £100 million in dividends.  Are we prepared to allow Mr. Tony Ryan, a self-confessed tax exile, to put Dublin Airport at risk?  I assure the Minister that the people of Fingal and north Dublin and Fingal County Council are totally opposed to this nonsensical proposal.  I am not anti-Ryanair or its staff.  I acknowledge the role it played in introducing competition in the aviation industry.  However, this proposal must be rejected.</P>
    <P>The proposal is just a smokescreen because the real issue is charges.  If there is a case to be made for a review or reduction of charges, this should be resolved and Aer Rianta should be allowed get on with the job of developing Dublin Airport and providing jobs for the people of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ryan for raising this important issue.  He will be aware that this proposal for an airport at Baldonnel has been widely publicised in the media.  The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, regrets that because of pressure of Government business he is unable to be here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal submitted to the Minister is for agreement in principle to the construction, by the end of 1998, of a civil airport at Baldonnel which could cater for 400 commercial flights a week and annual traffic of up to 3 million passengers initially, building to 7 million by 2003.  In the event of any agreement in principle a full feasibility study of the proposal would be undertaken by the promoters.  The Minister is currently considering the proposal and intends to <Col N="1042" /> meet Dr. Ryan in the near future to discuss the matter.</P>
    <P>There are many issues to be considered with regard to this proposal, the need for a second commercial airport in close proximity to Dublin airport and the possible effects on other airports in Ireland.  Site location and physical feasibility raise aeronautical issues which must be examined, as does the strategic fit of the proposal with Government aviation and airports policy.  The adequacy of the supporting infrastructure such as roads, public transport access, water, power and sewerage would have to be assessed, the cost of upgrading taken into consideration and how this cost is to be funded.  Planning and environmental issues will also fall to be exam-ined.</P>
    <P>Baldonnel aerodrome is owned by the Minister for Defence.  The compatibility of the promoters' proposals with the requirements of the Air Corps would have to be assessed.  Funding of the proposed development is intended to be by means of private sector investor.  The Minister would need to be satisfied, as regards costings and the sources of finance, to ensure that there will be no call on state funding.  On the other hand, the project promoter holds out the promise of low cost air services to the Continent with knock-on positive effects for tourism and the potential for job creation as a result.  Admittedly, some jobs at Baldonnel would be created as a result of the transfer of activities from Dublin Airport and could result in corresponding job losses at that airport.  All these aspects need assessment in depth.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Deputy will agree there are many issues to consider.  It is not every day that proposals are made for a major new airport.  Examination of the preliminary proposal is not complete. As I mentioned, further discussions are scheduled to take place shortly.  The Minister hopes to be able to make a decision in principle in the <Col N="1043" /> near future but, in the meantime pending these discussions and further consideration, he is keeping an open mind on the proposal.  I assure Deputy Ryan that the strong points which he made, and the strong interest he has in this <Col N="1044" /> issue, will be conveyed to the Minister for his appraisal as part of the ongoing consideration.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 12 December 1995.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>I assume that Deputy Coughlan's question relates to the Taoiseach's plans for bilateral meetings particularly in the context of Ireland's forthcoming Presidency.</P>
      <P>Preparation for Ireland's Presidency of the European Union from 1 July to 31 December 1996 has been under way for over a year now.  As part of the planning process and in preparation for Ireland's Presidency of the European Union, including the European Council to be held in Dublin in December 1996, the Taoiseach intends to maintain bilateral contacts, concentrating particularly on the Presidency, with Heads of Government of the European Union member states over the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, the Taoiseach met Prime Minister Gonzalez, the current Chair of the Council, in Madrid on 3 <Col N="946" /> October and again in Dublin on 4 December.  He met with President Santer in Madrid on 5 November.  On 6 November, the Taoiseach had a substantive meeting with Prime Minister Juncker of Luxembourg en route to the funeral of the late Israeli President, Mr. Rabin, and while in Tel Aviv had a brief meeting with President Chirac of France.  Details of further meetings are being worked out at present.</P>
    <P>In addition to a series of bilateral meetings, the Taoiseach will have a number of opportunities to discuss issues on the European Union agenda with the Heads of State or Government at the European Council in Madrid next week and at one or more European Council meetings during the Italian Presidency.  Heads of State or Government will also meet in the the context of the Europe-Asia Summit in Bangkok at the beginning of March 1996.  During these summits there will be the opportunity for the Taoiseach to meet bilaterally with his European colleagues to discuss issues of relevance to Irish bilateral interests and to the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>For my own part, I will continue to hold meetings with colleagues over the coming months.  For instance, I visited Helsinki in October for a meeting with my Finnish opposite number.  The Italian Foreign Minister, Mrs. Agnelli, who precedes me as Chair of the Council, will visit Dublin for bilateral discussion later this month.  Meetings with the Belgian and Dutch Foreign Ministers have also been arranged.</P>
    <P>In addition, of course I will have the opportunity to meet my counterparts at every meeting of the General Affairs Council as well as at the European Council and other meetings scheduled between now and the start of our Presidency. I have had two meetings this year with the President of the European Parliament and I will continue to meet with members of the Commission.</P>
    <P>In this context, I had a luncheon meeting with Commissioner Flynn in Brussels on 10 November.  The purpose of the meeting was to discuss current issues on the European Union agenda <Col N="947" /> in view of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and Ireland's Presidency of the Union in the second half of 1996 and to brief the Commission on preparations which we are making for the Presidency.</P>
    <P>As the Minister responsible for co-ordinating the Presidency, I am encouraging all Ministers with Presidency responsibilities to ensure that they hold bilateral meetings with their counterparts in member states, with relevant Commissioners and members of the European Parliament in the lead up to our Presidency.  It is our view that adequate preparation for the Presidency will enable us to ensure that Ireland's Presidency will be in a position to advance the European Union agenda.</P>

    <P>The Maastricht Treaty also provided for the convening of another Intergovernmental Conference in 1996 to review, <i>inter alia,</i> its CFSP provisions, <Col N="948" /> including the relationship established between the EU and the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>As I have said on previous occasions, our observer status in the Western European Union is proving to be useful, particularly as the preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference are advancing.  Moreover, like the other neutral states which are observers at the Western European Union &mdash; Finland, Sweden and Austria &mdash; we see scope for exploring further the Western European Union Petersberg tasks in regard to peacekeeping and humanitarian operations.  This is an area where I see potential for Ireland, in view of our accumulated expertise in peacekeeping and humanitarian work, to make a contribution. The other European neutrals which are observers at the Western European Union are thinking along similar lines.  I should make clear that Ireland's approach to involvement in the Petersberg tasks of peacekeeping or humanitarian operations in no sense entails any mutual defence commitments that would be incompatible with Ireland's policy or military neutrality.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, in the context of preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference, various possible institutional options for future EU-WEU relations have so far been identified.  In the Reflection Group report, which was agreed yesterday, 6 December, for submission to the Madrid European Council on 15/16 December, and in the Western European Union contribution to the Intergovernmental Conference, which was adopted by the Western European Union's full member states at the Western European Union Ministerial Council in Madrid on 14 November 1995, a range of possible options have been identified.</P>
    <P>The options so far identified range from maintaining the EU and Western European Union as separate organisations, but with enhanced co-operation between them, through to proposals for eventual full merger.  Both the Reflection Group report and the Western <Col N="949" /> European Union input for the Intergovernmental Conference have been useful in providing insight into the development of the positions of partners at this stage in the preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>A central question in the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations will be to determine how the CFSP provisions, including the EU-WEU relationship, can best be developed to enhance the EU's contribution to European and global peace and security.  There is an emerging consensus that the EU should be better able to contribute to conflict prevention and crisis management tasks in such areas as peacekeeping and humanitarian operations.  It is possible that these peacekeeping and humanitarian tasks could provide a focus for the further development of the EU-WEU relationship.</P>
    <P>At the Madrid meeting of the Western European Union, I commented on the acceptance by the Western European Union members in their contribution for the Intergovernmental Conference that a comprehensive definition of security is required, rather than an exclusively military one.  The Western European Union members also explicitly acknowledged that the Intergovernmental Conference will need to harness to the best effect the diverse contributions to security and defence that European nations are able to make, and the national security and defence positions of each country must be respected.</P>
    <P>There is also an understanding that the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference must be acceptable to people in each member state.  The Government's approach to the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations and to the Western European Union, will continue to be in harmony with our outlook and traditions and at the same time responsive to the new and still evolving challenges that face us in promoting peace, security and progress at the European and global level.</P>

      <P>The Government has taken a close interest in the difficulties caused to the Crossmaglen Rangers GAA Club by the proximity of the joint British Army/RUC base.  Difficulties have arisen from the compulsory requisitioning of land from the GAA, from works on the base and also from the British Army's attitude to the club's expansion plans.  These matters have been raised by the Government within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  It is the Government's hope that the new security situation will allow for a full and fair resolution of the outstanding issues arising from the impact of the security force base on the club's grounds.</P>
      <P>I will continue to closely monitor the situation and, where appropriate, to pursue matters raised by the club through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 57 and 59 for answer together.</P>
      <P>The Reflection Group which was set up to assist in the preparation of next year's Intergovernmental Conference adopted its report this week.  The report will be considered by the European Council in Madrid on 15 and 16 December.</P>
      <P>I very much welcome the report which represents an important input to the work of the Intergovernmental Conference. I am particularly grateful to Minister Mitchell for his work as Ireland's member of the Reflection Group.</P>
      <P>The Reflection Group was not intended to be a forum for negotiation. Its role was to help in examining and clarifying issues and where possible to identify options for consideration by the Intergovernmental Conference itself.  I believe that it has fulfilled that mandate effectively.</P>
      <P>The range of options identified at this stage by the Reflection Group will greatly assist the Intergovernmental Conference in its work.</P>
      <P>I am also satisfied that Irish ambitions and concerns in relation to the future development of the European Union are fully reflected in the report.</P>
      <P>The challenges which are due to be addressed at the Intergovernmental Conference next year are important for the European Union, for the member states and for their citizens.  The negotiations will, in some respects, be difficult. We will for our part approach the negotiations constructively and I have every confidence that the outcome will meet the concerns of all member states and of their citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Intergovernmental Conference is <Col N="952" /> expected to open at the end of March 1996 during the Italian Presidency and to continue through the Irish Presidency. It will be a major priority of our Presidency and our aim will be to progress its work as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>The duration of the Intergovernmental Conference will be determined by a large number of factors.  There remains a significant possibility that the Intergovernmental Conference will run into the Dutch Presidency in the first half of 1997.  In our view, it is not the duration of the Intergovernmental Conference that is the primary concern but rather its success.  The duration should result from the substance of the negotiations and not vice versa.</P>

      <P>The Estimates for 1996 have not been published yet but I am confident that there will be a further increase in the 1996 funding for official development assistance.</P>
      <P>Over the last three years there have been major increases in ODA funding; a total of £75.2 million was spent on ODA in 1994 compared with £54.7 million in 1993.  This year's expenditure is likely to amount to around £89 million which will be 0.27 per cent of GNP.  This means that the level of Government spending on ODA has increased by £49 million in the three years since 1992 and, as I have already said, a further increase is planned for 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme for renewal has reaffirmed the commitment to increase Ireland's official development assistance significantly so as to make steady progress towards achieving the UN goal of 0.7 per cent of GNP.  By 1997 we should <Col N="953" /> be on a par with most of our EU partners. Like other Members of the House, I would wish to proceed thereafter as rapidly as possible towards achieving the UN goal of 0.7 per cent of GNP.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 25, 40, 43 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>In the course of my visit to the US in the last week of September, I and my officials had the opportunity of meeting President Clinton and both his National Security Advisor, Tony Lake, and Deputy National Security Advisor, Nancy Soderberg.  Ms Soderberg was in Dublin in early October, when we had a further meeting.  Mr. Lake and Ms Soderberg both accompanied President Clinton on his official visit to Ireland last Friday and I again had the opportunity to meet with both of them.</P>
      <P>The main focus of my discussion with the President throughout his visit was the recent Anglo-Irish Communiqué and possible developments in the twin track process in the immediate future.  I thanked the President for his constructive engagement and for enabling the appointment of Senator George Mitchell as chair of the Body on Decommissioning. I stressed the importance of maintaining momentum towards all-party talks, and also the value of the economic dimension of US involvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are part of the ongoing efforts I and my officials are and have been making to ensure that the President and his advisers are kept up to date on the situation in Northern Ireland.  The National Security Advisor has played an important role in the efforts of President Clinton and his administration to be a resource and a support for both Governments in their search for political progress.  The Irish Embassy in Washington, in particular Ambassador Dermot Gallagher, have kept in very <Col N="956" /> regular contact with the National Security Advisor and his staff over the last number of months.</P>
    <P>President Clinton's highly successful visit and his powerful endorsements of the twin-track initiative have provided a new impetus to the peace process.  The groundswell demand for peace from both communities, which was brought into sharp focus during the visit, sent, I believe, an important message to all of the parties concerned that the public wishes them to co-operate with the twin-track process and to secure political progress.</P>
    <P>We are deeply appreciative of the support, goodwill, commitment and constructive approach shown by the US Administration and at every stage in the peace process.  We have been conscious from the outset that the road to peace will warrant generosity from all sides. The Presidential visit has served to emphasise in the strongest terms the concern and goodwill which the US administration brings to the search for resolution of the conflict.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The establishment of an international criminal court has been discussed within the United Nations system for over 40 years.  The debate has been marked by occasional bouts of urgency interspersed with long periods of inactivity.</P>
      <P>The establishment by the Security Council of <i>ad hoc</i> Tribunals to deal with the appalling violations of human rights in the former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda had the effect, among others, of reviving the idea of establishing a permanent independent international criminal court.  It also galvanised the international legal community into undertaking serious work towards its inception.</P>
      <P>I have sought to maintain this impetus at the political and diplomatic level and I have raised the question of the establishment of a permanent international criminal court on the last three occasions upon which I have addressed the General Assembly of the United Nations.  Indeed, as recently as 27 September 1995, I stated at the 50th General Assembly that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;There is a growing acceptance that violations of humanitarian law are a threat to international peace and security.  The case for the establishment of a Permanent International Criminal Court is therefore more obvious than ever.  It is only through such a body that the international community can effectively demonstrate that massive human <Col N="958" /> rights violations will never go unpunished.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Progress towards the establishment of such a court received a major boost with the announcement by President Clinton, during the 50th Anniversary celebrations of the United Nations, that the United States would support the establishment of such a court.  The 15 member states of the European Union have also indicated their approval for the establishment of the court.</P>
    <P>Since then, officials of my Department have participated actively in the formulation of a General Assembly Resolution on the establishment of the court.  The Resolution, which is due to be adopted before the end of this Session, provides for meetings next year of a Preparatory Committee, the penultimate stage in the drafting of a convention establishing a permanent international criminal court.  The Preparatory Committee will have to reach agreement on several complex issues.  One of these will be the determination of the crimes over which the court will have jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I do not know which countries the Deputy is referring to when he uses the expression &ldquo;major powers&rdquo;.  The General Assembly Resolution concerning the Court has already been adopted at Committee level by all the Member States of the United Nations, including the five Permanent Members of the Security Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I have been monitoring the situation of republican prisoners in Britain very closely in the past few months.  Officials of the Irish Embassy in London have, on my instructions, made regular consular visits to the relevant prisons where they met with the prisoners concerned in each case and discussed their complaints with prison authorities.</P>
      <P>There have been eight such visits to various prisons in the past 12 months, the latest this week to Belmarsh Prison in London where an Embassy official met with four republican prisoners who have been subjected to a closed visits regime since this was introduced by the British authorities last June.</P>
      <P>The health of the prisoners in Britain has always been a key concern and this, together with their complaints about conditions in the prisons, problems with visiting arrangements and other matters, have been raised repeatedly with the British authorities.  We have also made clear in recent weeks, following entry into force of the new legislation under the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, that we stand ready to receive at any time those prisoners who wish to be transferred to prison in this jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Government's view, the transfer of prisoners under the Council of Europe Convention offers the best and most practical way of dealing with the problems encountered by republican prisoners in Britain at this time.  A referral to the Council of Europe would take a considerable amount of time, as the Deputy will know, and it is in any case important that all domestic remedies, including appeals, judicial reviews etc. should be availed of before contemplating such a step.  Several of the prisoners are involved in court proceedings or parole board hearings at this time. With this in mind, my view would be that a transfer of those who wish to be transferred to prison in Ireland is the more appropriate way forward and I <Col N="960" /> believe it is also what the prisoners themselves want at this time.</P>

      <P>The main obligation on any Presidency is to ensure an efficient, effective and impartial approach to the discharge of the business of the European Union.  The aims and objectives of Ireland's Presidency of the European Union from 1 July to 31 December next year will be to ensure that the business of the European Union is done efficiently, that the tasks of the Union are carried out effectively and that the Presidency is conducted in an impartial manner.</P>
      <P>A major preoccupation for the European Union next year will be the Intergovernmental Conference, due to be convened under the Italian Presidency and likely to continue through our Presidency.  In addition, the formal decision on the move to the Third Stage of European Monetary Union will be made by the Dublin European Council in December 1996, thus ensuring a continuing focus on European Monetary Union through 1996 and beyond.  The Dublin European Council in December 1996 will also consider the annual report on employment in the European Union. Employment will be a major concern of our Presidency and it is expected that long-term unemployment and youth unemployment will receive particular attention in the EU context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other important issues which are expected to be part of the agenda of the Union during our Presidency include the range of Third Pillar issues such as drugs, immigration and organised crime; growth and competitiveness will also be a major issue; agreement on the draft Union budget for 1997 will be part of the agenda for our Presidency as will <Col N="961" /> the implementation of the common foreign and security policy and the management of the Union's external relations.  Matters likely to be on the external relations agenda include the reconstruction of former Yugoslavia, the strengthening of relations with the US and deepening of relations with Russia as well as the further development of relations with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and with the Mediterranean states in the wake of the Barcelona Conference held last week.</P>
    <P>The 1996 Presidency will involve new challenges.  It is our view that with timely and careful preparation Ireland's Presidency will be in a position to move the agenda of the Union forward in important respects.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="963" /> My Department and the Office of the Tánaiste fully implement the Government's policy of equality of opportunity in the Civil Service.  The objective of this equal opportunity policy is to ensure that all staff have an equal chance to develop their potential and to advance on the basis of merit and ability.  More specifically, it seeks to ensure fuller participation of women at all levels in the Civil Service.  I regard the equal opportunity policy as an essential element of progressive personnel management and an important means of developing the full potential of all employees.</P>
    <P>It is the policy and practice of my Department and the Office of the Tánaiste that the principles of equality of opportunity are applied to the <Col N="964" /> recruitment, placement, promotion and career development of all its employees. At induction courses, new staff are briefed on the Civil Service equal opportunity policy.  In its assignment of staff to positions, the Department ensures that there is no discrimination on the basis of gender or marital status.  The Department also ensures that all staff are given equal access to training and development opportunities.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to report that the overall number of women in the Diplomatic Service has continued to grow over recent years.  The total number of officers serving in the diplomatic grades at present is 248, of which 49 or 20 per cent are women, including 15 per cent of those at Assistant Secretary level.

    <P>Recruitment into the Diplomatic Service is done by way of an open competition organised by the Civil Service Commission.  In recent years, officials of my Department have worked with the Civil Service Commission to increase the number of women entering the Diplomatic Service.  A number of changes have been made to the recruitment procedure and this has led to some improvement in the proportion of female entrants to the Diplomatic Service. In 1995, approximately one-third of Third Secretaries joining the Department of Foreign Affairs were women.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service Commission and my Department will continue to keep this matter under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Deputy last asked me this question on 18 October, I can report a number of developments.</P>
      <P>A US trade and investment mission visited the Border counties and Northern Ireland in the week from 15 to 20 October.  The mission featured 19 US companies who met with Irish counterparts, state agencies, etc.  The primary focus was in the areas of food products, information technology and environmental protection services.  The feedback, on both sides, was I understand quite positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Enterprise and Employment led a very successful North American business partnership mission, comprising some 30 Irish companies, to the US in mid-November.  The purpose was to promote strategic alliances and business partnerships between Irish and US companies to enable them to break into new markets.  During the visit, Forbairt and the US Small Business Administration (SBA) signed a co-operative agreement on implementing this new initiative.  The SBA will lead a similar Mission to Ireland in Spring 1996.  The US Department of Commerce, in keeping with its other commitments arising from the conference, is tailoring existing <Col N="966" /> schemes/programmes such as the Business Information Service and the AMBIT Programme, which offers managerial internships with US companies and which are financially supported by the International Fund for Ireland, to be of greater benefit to companies on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>The US Department of Commerce has also recently created an Internet &ldquo;homepage&rdquo; for Northern Ireland and the Border counties of Ireland which provides general economic information for the region.</P>
    <P>In the area of science and technology, several initiatives foreseen at the Washington Conference have been advanced recently: (i) the Minister of State for Science and Technology signed a Statement of Intent on the extension of US &mdash; Irish co-operation in Science and Technology with Secretary of Commerce Brown on 1 December 1995; (ii) the proposal for a Technology Trust Fund for Peace has now evolved into a pilot project called RADIUS (Research and Development between Ireland and the US), for which the International Fund for Ireland has agreed funding of £0.5 million in 1996.</P>
    <P>In addition, and independently of the RADIUS project, I am aware that Mr. John Cullinane and other US business persons are continuing to promote the idea of a venture capital fund which would support company to company business relationships between Ireland and the US.</P>
    <P>An Irish/US co-operative programme in research and development in the marine sector between the Irish Marine Institute and the US National Oceanic <Col N="967" /> and Atmosphere Administration was also signed on 1 December 1995 by the Minister for the Marine and Defence and Secretary of Commerce Brown.  On 4 December last, ABT held a seminar for Irish companies coinciding with the launch of their new Guide to US Public Procurement.  Speakers from the US were present to provide advice on accessing the US Government procurement market.</P>
    <P>I think that these developments show that extensive follow-up activity, with considerable potential to benefit companies in the Border region and beyond, is continuing to take place.</P>

      <P>In the wars in the former Yugoslavia mass murder, indiscriminate slaughter and rape became the weapons of choice for the protagonists as they attempted to ethnicly cleanse their so-called &ldquo;historical&rdquo; areas. As in many wars, women, children and the elderly were the primary victims. However, in the former Yugoslavia, unlike most wars, they were not just the victims they were the targets.  The establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in 1993 was a direct response of the international community to these barbarities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tribunal was established by UN Security Council Resolution 827 of 25 May 1993 &ldquo;for the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of <Col N="968" /> international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991&rdquo;.  It was the first international war crimes tribunals to be created since the Nuremberg and Tokyo Tribunals which followed World War II, and the first ever under UN auspices. To date 52 indictments have been handed down by the Tribunal.</P>
    <P>From its inception Ireland and our European Union partners have been strong supporters of the Tribunal. When, initially, agreement could not be reached at the UN on its financing, Ireland was one of a small number of countries which made a voluntary contribution to its upkeep (£15,000 in 1994). Following agreement at the UN General Assembly on its financing in July of this year Ireland was assessed in the amount of almost £24,000.  As is our practice, we paid in full and on time.</P>
    <P>Ireland is also assisting the Tribunal in other ways.  Members of the Permanent Defence Forces who served in the former Yugoslavia have briefed Tribunal officials on their knowledge of events there.  Next week officials from the Tribunal are visiting Ireland for further discussions with Irish Army personnel. They have requested advice from Army experts on artillery deployment and crater analysis and have sought live artillery demonstrations in this country.  The Defence Forces are co-operating fully with all of these requests.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the implementation within Ireland of the provisions of Security Council Resolution relating to the Tribunal.  In this regard my Department is maintaining ongoing contact with the Department of Justice which has primary responsibility for any legislative and other steps which may be necessary.</P>
    <P>I would wish to reaffirm the Government's commitment to fully co-operate with the International Tribunal in bringing to justice those people responsible for crimes against humanity who fall within the terms of the Security Council Resolution.  Not only must justice be done, but minimum standards of <Col N="969" /> accountability must be set if we are to avoid the creation of a cycle of impunity and the repetition of barbarities of this kind.</P>

      <P>I have consistently used all appropriate and available opportunities both bilateral and multilateral, including meetings within the framework of the EU, to raise the issue of French nuclear testing.  I should point out that our concerns on nuclear testing are not selective: we have also made clear our concerns to the Chinese Government in relation to the two Chinese tests earlier this year.</P>
      <P>In common with a number of our EU partners, we have urged France to end without delay its testing programme in the South Pacific and to thereby set an international example in support of moratoriums on nuclear testing, with a view to early progress towards a comprehensive test ban treaty.</P>
      <P>I have brought directly to the attention of the French Government Irish disappointment and concern that France has proceeded with this testing programme in the face of the opposition of the countries of the Pacific region and despite numerous appeals to desist, addressed to France by friendly countries, including Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my address at the 50th session of the UN General Assembly on 27 September, I highlighted the issue of nuclear testing by France and China.  I drew attention to the fact that the great majority of Irish people easily understand and share the deep concern of the peoples of the South Pacific.  I emphasised the great importance which the <Col N="970" /> Government attach to finalising a comprehensive test ban treaty early next year.</P>
    <P>On 16 November, in the Disarmament Committee of the UN General Assembly, Ireland voted in favour of an important resolution which, among other things, commended those nuclear weapon States observing moratoria on nuclear tests and urged them to continue the moratoria pending the entry into force of a comprehensive test ban treaty.  The resolution also strongly deplored all current nuclear testing and strongly urged the immediate cessation of all nuclear testing.  The vote on this resolution was 95 in favour, including ten EU member states; 12 against, including France and the UK; and 45 abstentions, including Germany, Greece and Spain.  The Plenary of the General Assembly will vote on the Resolution later this month.</P>
    <P>The French Government, for its part, has indicated that it will commit itself to a fully comprehensive test ban treaty next year.  This is a significant statement, as is its recent decision to sign next year the Protocols to the Treaty of Rarotonga, which establishes a nuclear free zone in the South Pacific, and outlaws testing in the region.  For our part, we will continue to work to bring an end as soon as possible to all nuclear tests.  We earnestly hope that France will heed the sustained and widespread calls to ends once and for all, and without delay, its programme of nuclear testing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland was an original signatory and is one of the 49 states which have ratified the Inhumane Weapons Convention. In this context, Ireland has taken a leading role in efforts to strengthen international restrictions on landmines and in particular to move towards the elimination of anti-personnel landmines which have caused civilian suffering on a huge scale.  I drew particular attention to this objective in my statement on 27 September in the General Debate at the UN General Assembly.</P>
      <P>Ireland's role in contributing to international action against the scourge of landmines, particularly anti-personnel landmines, was exemplified further in our participation in the Vienna Review Conference of the States Parties to the Convention, which met from 25 September to 13 October.  The conference engaged in detailed discussions with the aim of elaborating a strengthened Protocol to the Convention, which would enshrine further restrictions on landmines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some progress was made during the conference towards agreement on practical steps to reduce the negative impact of landmines on civilians and facilitate the task of mine clearance in the wake of conflicts.  However, the substantive positions of States Parties have not yet converged sufficiently to permit consensus on a strengthened Protocol.  The Review Conference will therefore resume its work in January and again in April-May 1996.  As a member of EU Troika from 1 January, Ireland will be closely involved in requests to third <Col N="972" /> countries to work for and support a successful outcome to the Review Conference.</P>
    <P>While I understand the concerns of the Deputies, I do not think it would be either appropriate or warranted for the Government to introduce legislation to ban the manufacture, sale, export, and stockpiling of landmines in Ireland. Importantly, Ireland has no armaments industry and our forward role on the landmines question is fully appreciated in the internatioinal community.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the example of Belgian legislation, to which the Deputy refers, is not in my view applicable to the situation here: Belgium was formerly a substantial producer of landmines whereas Ireland does not manufacture or stockpile any form of landmine and any application for a licence to export landmines from Ireland would be refused.</P>
    <P>The Government's priority is to continue to work in a realistic and focused way, in the multilateral fora open to us, for effective international action against landmines and, as a priority, for the objective of a total ban on anti-personnel landmines.</P>

      <P>Mar is eol don Teachta, bunaíodh stádas na Gaeilge san Aontas Eorpach mar theanga ina bhfuil na Conarthaí ar fáil sa bhliain 1973, ar dhul isteach dúinn sa Chomhphobal Eorpach.  Cuirtear córas na dteangacha in iúl go reachtúil in Ionstram na Comhairle.  Ní áirítear an Ghaeilge mar &ldquo;theanga oifigiúil agus oibre de chuid an Aontais&rdquo; san Ionstram sin.  Mar sin féin, ba cheart a mheabhrú, gur féidir Gaeilge a úsáid i gcásanna sa Chúirt Bhreithiúnais, agus, i gcúinsí áirithe, is féidir ráitisí a dhéanamh i nGaeilge sa Phairlimint Eorpach.</P>
      <P>Is féidir go mbeidh ceist chóras na dteangacha i measc na gceisteanna a bheas le plé ag an gComhdháil idir Ionadaithe na mBallstát (CIB) i 1996.  Toisc gur cheist achrannach í, agus toisc gur gá do na baillstáit bheith d'aon ghuth ag an gComhdháil idir Ionadaithe na mBallstát, tá seans ann nach ndéanfar aon athrú sontasach maidir le córas na dteangacha ag an CIB.  Ach, má phléitear córas na dteangacha ag an CIB, agus má bhíonn deis ann stádas na Gaeilge a fheabhsú sa chomhthéacs seo, tá sé d'intinn ag an rialtas beartas oiriúnach a chur chun cinn.  Thug Teachta Gay Mitchell, an tÁire Stáit um Ghnóthaí Eorpacha, le fios i láthair an Grúpa Machnaimh, a bhuail le chéile in ullmhúchán don CIB, go mb'fhéidir go luafaidh Éire ceist na Gaeilge ag an CIB i gcomhthéasc aon díospóireachta faoi chóras na dteangacha.</P>

Tá staidéar déanta ag mo Roinn ar stádas na Gaeilge san Aontas Eorpach a léiríonn roinnt feabhsaithe praicticiúla sodhéanta i bhfabhar úsáid níos leithne don Ghaeilge.

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the EU's special Initiative for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties.</P>
      <P>The Peace Programme, as it is known, provides for a new five-year Community Initiative for Northern Ireland and the southern Border counties.  EU funding of 300 MECU, or IR£240 million approximately is allocated for the first three years of the initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Northern Ireland and the Border counties will receive respectively, a maximum of 80 per cent and a minimum of 20 per cent of the total funding.  For the six Border counties of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo this will amount to EU funding of <Col N="975" /> £48 million approximately.  When national matching funds are added, this will bring the total to £60 million approximately.</P>
    <P>Funding in respect of the Border counties is not allocated on a county basis, but rather on a project basis.  It is thus impossible to say at this stage what will be the eventual outturn for each county.  The arrangements and procedures for the disbursement of financial assistance under the special support programme for Peace and Reconciliation are set out in the Decision adopted by the Commission on 26 July of this year.</P>
    <P>For the Border counties, more than half of the Programme will be delivered by intermediary bodies.  For the appropriate parts of the Employment, Urban and Rural Regeneration, Social Inclusion and Productive Investment Sub-programmes, the intermediary bodies are Area Development Management Ltd. (ADM) and the Combat Poverty Agency.  Co-operation North and IBEC/CBI(NI) will manage part of the cross-Border Development Sub-programme.</P>

      <P>On my instructions the problems faced by Meánscoil Feirste have been raised a number of times by the Irish side through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. I have myself visited the school. As I stated in a written reply on 18 October 1995, I raised the matter personally with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, at the meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference on 17 October 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While noting the provision of some moneys from the Making Belfast Work <Col N="976" /> Programme, I urged the British side to look again at the criteria being applied in refusing normal grant funding to the Meánscoil.  The Meánscoil is the only Irish language-medium secondary school available to the many pupils leaving such schools at primary level in the Belfast area.  In these circumstances, I believe that a more flexible application of the existing criteria for actual enrolments is warranted and this view has been made clear to the British authorities.</P>
    <P>My officials are in contact with the management of the Meánscoil and I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to press for adequate long-term funding from the Department of Education in Northern Ireland so that this school can be developed in a proper manner.</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy's question as referring to remarks made by Commissioner Kinnock in Berkshire in England on Friday, 24 November.  I gather that these remarks were intended to be private and were unscripted, but I have seen newspaper reports of them, together with reports of the response of Commission President Santer which was delivered shortly afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hard to see what purpose would be served by my commenting on what seem to be the personal views of an individual member of the European Commission.  In so far as the attitude of <Col N="977" /> our Government to the issue of enlargement is concerned, it is well-known that we are both open and positive to the accession of new member states and this attitude is reflected in the conclusions of successive meetings of the European Council.  We believe that enlargement is necessary to consolidate peace and stability in Europe and that it can bring greater prosperity to existing and prospective member states, provided that the overall conditions underpinning enlargement and resulting from accession negotiations are right.</P>
    <P>With regard to the forthcoming meeting of the European Council at Madrid, it is expected that the Council will consider the issue of enlargement against the background, <i>inter alia,</i> of a number of important studies which were requested of the European Commission at last year's Council at Essen.</P>
    <P>These include an analysis of the effects of enlargement in the context of the Union's present policies and of their future development, a study on the means of developing relations in the field of agriculture between the European Union and the associated countries of Eastern Europe, and an interim report on the implementation of the pre-accession strategy adopted at Essen in respect of those countries.</P>
    <P>The Commission's reports, and particularly its reports on agriculture and the common policies, represent an important contribution to the Union's assessment of the implications of future enlargement.  This assessment is ongoing. It will continue after the European Council and while the Intergovernmental Conference, which must be completed before enlargement negotiations begin, is under way.  The role of the Commission will be especially important in the assessment process.  In particular it will have the task of preparing formal opinions on applications for membership and of producing comprehensive proposals for the development of Union policies and their financing in the perspective of enlargement.</P>

      <P>The Treaty on <Col N="979" /> European Union provides that any European State may apply to become a member of the Union.  There are at present nine applications on the table. These are from Turkey, Cyprus, Malta, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Romania, Latvia and Estonia.  Applications from a number of others are expected in the future.</P>
      <P>The Treaty also provides for consultation with the Commission whose opinion is sought by Council on all membership applications.</P>
      <P>The date, the Commission has provided its opinion on the Turkish, Cypriot and Maltese applications.  In the case of Turkey, that country's application was the subject of a Commission opinion in 1989 which concluded that it would not be useful to open accession negotiations straight away but that a range of steps should be taken to intensify the EU's relations with Turkey. Since then, a Customs Union, between the EU and Turkey has been agreed and, subject to its ratification by the European Parliament, is due to come into force on 1 January 1996.  In the case of Cyprus and Malta, the Commission's opinions were delivered in July 1993 and were essentially positive.</P>
      <P>Commission opinions on the membership applications received from Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Romania, Latvia and Estonia are awaited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the likely future course of EU enlargement, it is worth recalling that last year's European Council meeting in Essen reiterated the position adopted at its earlier meeting in Corfu with regard to the commencement of accession negotiations.  This is that the institutional conditions for ensuring the proper functioning of the Union must be created at the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference which, for that reason, must take place before accession negotiations begin.  As regards Cyprus and Malta, the Essen European Council also confirmed that the next phase of enlargement will involve these countries. It was subsequently agreed that accession negotiations with Cyprus and <Col N="980" /> Malta can begin six months after the Intergovernmental Conference's conclusion, taking into account its results.</P>
    <P>These are the only aspects of the timetable of future enlargement that have been agreed to date.  It would not be sensible to engage in speculation on the commencement date of accession negotiations with other applicant countries or on the duration of all future accession negotiations.  Nor do I wish to speculate on which applicant countries, apart from Cyprus and Malta, are likely to be involved in the next phase of enlargement.</P>
    <P>The Madrid European Council is expected to consider the question of future enlargement in the light, <i>inter alia,</i> of a number of reports prepared by the European Commission.  These include its anlaysis of the effects of enlargement in the context of the Union's present policies and their future development and alternative strategies for further development of the EU's relations with the Associated Countries of Central and Eastern Europe in the agriculture sector.  We welcome these reports as an important contribution to defining the issues involved for the Union and the applicant States in future enlargement.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 54 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today is the twentieth anniversary of the invasion of East Timor by Indonesia. It is, therefore, opportune for me to <Col N="981" /> express again the Government's deep concern over the continuing violations of human rights in East Timor.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will be aware of the article on East Timor which I contributed to <i>The Irish Times</i> on 13 July 1995, a copy of which is available in the Library of the Houses of the Oireachtas. In the course of that article I indicated that Ireland has been and will continue to be an advocate for the case of East Timor.  During this present week, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Jose Ayala Lasso, is visiting Indonesia and East Timor.  I await with interest Mr. Ayala Lasso's report following his current fact-finding visit there.</P>
    <P>The Government has supported and continue to attach importance to the ongoing talks between the Foreign Ministers of Portugal and Indonesia which take place under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General.  The next round of talks is scheduled for mid-January 1996.  The Government have also welcomed the first all-inclusive, intra-Timorese dialogue meeting which took place in Austria in June 1995 and we hope that further meetings of this new forum will take place.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that on 25 September 1995, while attending the 50th Session of the UN General Assembly, I had occasion to meet with the Indonesian Foreign Minister when I had the opportunity to express views, on behalf of the Government, in relation to East Timor.</P>
    <P>In relation to the questions of East Timor and Tibet, Ireland has advocated two important principles: the need for dialogue to seek a solution to the underlying problems which require redress; and the need for full respect of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the peoples concerned, including their cultural rights and freedom of worship.</P>
    <P>Differences necessarily arise in the application of Irish policy because of the <Col N="982" /> differences in the two situations which exist.</P>
    <P>East Timor was a colony of Portugal until 1975.  Following the declaration of independence made by the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (FRETILIN) in November 1975, Indonesia invaded East Timor on 7 December 1975 and sought to annex it in July 1976.  The United Nations continues to view Portugal as the administering power of the territory and both the UN Security Council and General Assembly have adopted resolutions condemning the Indonesian invasion. Ireland subscribes to the view of the United Nations on this matter.</P>
    <P>When Ireland established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1979, the Government of Ireland recognised the Government of the people's Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China.  At the time the Chinese position was that China included Tibet.  That is still their position.</P>
    <P>I have raised on many occasions, on behalf of the Government, the question of human rights and the treatment of prisoners in Tibet with the Chinese authorities.</P>
    <P>Most recently, I had an opportunity to do so directly with Vice-Premier and Minister for Foreign Affairs Qian Qichen during his visit to Dublin on 6 October 1995.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 55, 58 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, the Minister for Social Welfare and I reported to the House on 29 November that, on the previous evening, following intensive discussions at both political and official level, the Irish and British Governments agreed to launch a &ldquo;twin track&rdquo; process to make progress in parallel on the decommissioning issue and on all-party negotiations.  By way of the twin tracks, the two Governments have the firm aim of achieving the launch of all-party negotiations by the end of February 1996.</P>
      <P>An International Body under the chairmanship of Senator George Mitchell, and also including General John De Chastelain and Mr. Harri Holkeri, has been established to provide an independent assessment of the decommissioning issue.  It has been asked to submit its report to the two Governments by mid-January.</P>
      <P>The two Governments also agreed to invite the Northern parties to intensive preparatory talks with a remit to reach widespread agreement on the basis, participation, structure, format and agenda to bring all parties together for substantive negotiations aimed at a political settlement based on consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Friday, 1 December, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I wrote separately, but in similar terms, to the Ulster Unionist Party, the SDLP, the Democratic Unionist Party, Sinn Féin, the Alliance Party, the Progressive Unionist Party, the Ulster Democratic <Col N="984" /> Party, The Workers' Party and to Robert McCartney, MP, inviting each of them to participate in preparatory talks as referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Communiqué.  I would hope that a process of dialogue on this basis can be developed in an intensive manner over the coming months.  I regret that the two main Unionist parties have already indicated that they do not envisage a meeting with the Irish Government in the context of the twin-track process in the near future.  However, I would hope that progress in the process will lead them to reconsider their positions.  All must play a part in the vital search for a political settlement to underpin the peace process.</P>
    <P>The Government is ready to meet the relevant parties in whatever format is agreeable to them.  This could include the two Governments meeting jointly with one or more of the parties.  The venues for these talks will vary according to the wishes and convenience of the participants.</P>
    <P>We are flexible about practical issues of this kind.  The basic test to be applied in each case will be whether the purpose of the preparatory talks &mdash; which is to assist in the launch of substantive negotiations &mdash; will be advanced.</P>
    <P>The positions of the Irish and British Governments are discussed in various formats as the occasion warrants.  These include formal and informal contacts at Prime Ministerial and Ministerial level, diplomatic contact through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat and the respective Embassies, and various official meetings convened to address specific points, and usually involving representatives of the Departments of the Taoiseach, of Foreign Affairs and of Justice.</P>

      <P>Since the end of the Cold War, the UN has been engaged in a substantial, and largely successful, intensification of efforts to resolve longstanding conflicts throughout the world. The UN operations in Namibia, Cambodia, Mozambique and El Salvador are regarded as particularly successful. However, there have been other UN operations which did not fully achieve their objectives.  The UN is now applying the lessons of these operations.  For example, in the light of its investment in Somalia, the UN is taking a more cautious approach to peace enforcement action under UN command and more attention is being given to peace-keeping in its traditional form to which Ireland has contributed substantially <Col N="986" /> over the years.  New attention is also being paid to conflict prevention and the mechanisms for early warning.</P>
      <P>The United Nations peace-keeping presence in Bosnia-Hercegovina, Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, has been the largest UN peace-keeping mission to date.  The Security Council deployed UNPROFOR to alleviate the impact of war on the civilian population; to contain the conflict and to mitigate its consequences.</P>
      <P>UNPROFOR worked, in the most difficult of circumstances, to create a climate conducive to the negotiation of an overall settlement.  The presence of the United Nations peace-keeping forces and the UNHCR and other humanitarian and relief agencies to which they afforded protection, has been invaluable in saving many thousands of lives.  For example, the UN is currently providing humanitarian assistance for 3.6 million people in former Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>In Croatia, the deployment of the UN peace-keeping force brought an end to the Serbo-Croat war in 1991, and relief to the victims of the conflict.  It was instrumental in reducing the possibilities for a new Serbo-Croat war.  The small United Nations peace-keeping presence in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has helped prevent the conflict spilling over.  This has been a most effective exercise in preventative deployment by a UN peace-keeping operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The efficiency of the United Nations operations in Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina, where peace-keeping troops were deployed in unique circumstances, could have been enhanced had the United Nations enjoyed the full co-operation of the parties which is essential for all successful peace-keeping operations.  Its ability to discharge its mandates effectively would also have been improved if UNPROFOR had been provided with the very substantial <Col N="987" /> additional troops which the Secretary-General had sought.</P>
    <P>Looking to the future of UN peace-keeping operations it is accepted that there is an urgent need to improve the response capability of the UN at the beginning of a crisis since early deployment could prevent an escalation of conflict.  The UN is actively addressing this issue.  There is also a growing view that regional organisations could be given a greater role under UN mandate in dealing with crises.  In addition, the role of humanitarian aid in the context of conflict prevention is receiving increased attention.</P>

      <P>A recent estimate by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) puts <Col N="988" /> the number of refugees worldwide at 14.7 million.  In addition, there are 5.4 million internally displaced persons. The following table indicates the principal countries of origin and host countries.</P>
      <P>Both through the EU and in its own right, Ireland has actively supported measures to address the refugee problem. Our general contribution to the UNHCR was £1 million for 1994.  In addition, there was a grant of £350,000 to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) to support Palestinian refugees.</P>
      <P>There are also provisions this year of £5 million for emergency humanitarian assistance and £3.5 million for rehabilitation programmes.  Much of the expenditure in these categories supports refugee populations.  The principal focus of such expenditure this year has been on refugees from Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>We have also responded positively to appeals to admit refugees to this country.  About 900 people have been admitted so far, mostly from Vietnam and the former Yugoslavia.  Following a Government decision of 29 July 1995 these will shortly be joined by another 250 refugees from the former Yugoslavia. There is also provision for this group of 250 to be joined by their close relatives.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the Irish Hotel Federation's proposal.  It will be borne in mind in the context of the 1996 budget,</P>
      <P>However, I would point out to the Deputy that the cost of the proposal would be significant and that the creation of a new reduced rate of VAT of 5 per cent for hotel accommodation would inevitably lead to calls for similar treatment for other sectors.  The cost of such a wider concession would be prohibitive.</P>
      <P>It is accepted that the Mediterranean member states apply reduced rates of VAT, ranging from 5 per cent to 10 per cent, to hotel accommodation. However, I would advise the Deputy that, in Ireland, the tourism industry has the benefit of the reduced rate of 12.5 per cent not just for hotel and holiday accommodation, but also of most tourist related services including restaurant services, sporting activities and short-term car hire.  Ireland's rating arrangements in this regard are far more generous than many member states of the European Union.  I understand that, for example, in the United Kingdom, the standard rate of VAT of 17.5 per cent applies to all of the services mentioned.</P>

      <P>It has been the policy of all Governments over recent years to adopt a gradual approach to tax changes.  In the 1996 budget I will be continuing to implement the Government's policy on tax reform as set out in the Programme for Renewal, which is aimed at lightening the income tax and PRSI burden, especially on those on low incomes.  The aim of this reform is to enhance the competitiveness of the economy, to strengthen our employment capacity to take advantage of favourable economic circumstances and to seek a fair distribution of the fruits of economic growth. This, together with the progress achieved in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> provides the policies on which the substantial economic and employment growth of recent years can be soundly based and can continue in the future.</P>

The excepted categories vary depending on the scheme.</P>
      <P>In the case of the free electricity and free television licence schemes, the excepted categories include a dependent spouse, invalid(s), other people who would qualify for the allowance in their own right and a person who gives the pensioner full-time care and attention if he or she is an invalid or semi-invalid. Therefore, depending on the circumstances involved in particular cases, these categories may include a dependent or non-dependent spouse.</P>

These may include a spouse regardless of whether or not he or she is dependent on the pensioner.</P>
    <P>In relation to the fuel allowance, the excepted categories include dependent children up to age 22 if in full-time education or other people who would qualify for a fuel allowance in their own right.  Again, these may include a dependent or non-dependent spouse.</P>

      <P>Under section 179 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to people in receipt of social welfare or health board payments.</P>
      <P>The purpose of rent supplements is to assist the reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources, and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.</P>
      <P>Local authority tenants pay an income-related, differential rent in respect of their accommodation. Responsibility for making and amending differential rent schemes lies with the local authorities since August 1986. Guidelines issued by the Minister for the Environment at the time require local authorities to ensure that rent schemes adopted by them are based on certain broad principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of these is that the rent payable should be related to income and a smaller proportion of income should be <Col N="1000" /> required from low income households. A further requirement is that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;provision should be included for the acceptance of a lower rent than that required under the terms of the scheme in exceptional cases where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship&rdquo;</P>

    <P>While local authority tenants are not precluded from applying for rent supplements under the current provisions of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, it has been the policy of my Department not to pay rent supplements to tenants of local authority accommodation.  It is considered that the need for such supplementation should not arise because of the nature of the differential rent schemes, that is, the ability of the local authorities to relate rents to household income and the option to invoke the &ldquo;hardship clause&rdquo; where appropriate.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the payment of supplements in such cases would result in an inefficient use of resources with two Departments of State individually addressing the same problem.</P>

      <P>The pre-retirement allowance, which was introduced in 1990 and is an optional scheme, relieves older unemployed people of the necessity of `signing on' each week at their social welfare local office and provides them with alternative arrangements for receiving their unemployment payments. Payment is made by way of payable orders encashable at post offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> The allowance was initially introduced for a long-term unemployed persons aged 60 or over but was reduced to 58 years of age in 1991 and to 55 years of age in 1992.  There are no plans at the present time to reduce the age limit below 55 years.</P>

      <P>Free travel is available to all persons resident in the State aged 66 years or over and also to certain disabled people under the age of 66.  The other free schemes are available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy the living alone condition.

      <P>Dental and optical benefits form part of the treatment benefit scheme which provides a range of benefits in the areas of dental, optical and aural treatment for qualified PRSI contributors and their dependent spouses.</P>
      <P>As regards dental benefit, an examination and scale and polish is available free of charge to the qualified claimant. In the case of fillings and extractions, my Department pays 70 per cent of the agreed fee in accordance with the scale of fees negotiated on behalf of dentists operating the scheme and the claimant pays the balance.  An agreed fee also applies in the case of dentures with the claimant and my Department each paying 50 per cent.  For other treatments, my Department pays a fixed contribution towards the cost and the claimant is liable for the balance charged by the dentist.  I have no plans at the present time to change the respective proportions of fees paid by my Department and qualified PRSI contributors towards the cost of treatment under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the optical benefit scheme, the qualified claimant can get free of charge an eye examination together with a pair of spectacles from a limited range of frames.  Where a more expensive frame is chosen, my Department pays a fixed contribution with the claimant paying the balance.  I have no plans to extend the optical benefit scheme to include the <Col N="1004" /> dependent children of qualified PRSI contributors.  The Deputy will be aware that, under the Health Act, 1970, optical care is available to pre-school children, national school children and children who are dependants of medical card holders.</P>

      <P>My Department is committed to the provision of comprehensive information in a clear and simple manner as an essential element in the effective delivery of social welfare services. Our objective is to ensure that all citizens are fully aware of their rights and advised and assisted when the need arises to avail of the benefits or allowances to which they are entitled.</P>
      <P>The regional management structure of my Department enables staff to identify the needs of customers at regional and local level and to tailor the delivery of services, including information services, to meet those needs.  Information leaflets and booklets relating to each scheme are available from the network of 58 Social Welfare Local Offices located throughout the country.  In addition, developments and improvements in social welfare services are widely advertised using an appropriate mix of media at local and national level. Selective use is also made of &ldquo;Free-phone&rdquo; services to provide information, for example, at budget time or on the introduction of new schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the National Social Services Board provides information on the full range of social services including social welfare through its network of some 81 Citizen's Information Centres, many of them located in rural areas.  My <Col N="1005" /> Department has also provided £250,000 in this year's budget for the National Social Services Board to develop computerised integrated social services information which will be available to Citizen's Information Centres and other voluntary information providers.</P>
    <P>The National Social Services Board has of course provided a mobile information service since 1989 and their mobile unit visited over 100 locations last year.  Additional funding was provided in 1995 to enable the NSSB to expand this service to isolated areas and a second mobile unit was introduced in August of this year.</P>

    <P>The Christmas bonus, which is being paid this week at a cost of almost £40 million, amounts to 70 per cent of normal weekly payments subject to a minimum payment of £20.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94, 95 and 96 together. The information and Consultation Directive, or the EWC Directive as it is often called, is due for transposition into national law by 22 September 1996.</P>
      <P>Following the issue of a Consultation Paper in July of this year, my Department has been having extensive consultations with employer and employee interests, including IBEC, ICTU and individual companies, on how best to transpose the Directive into Irish law. An expert working group in Brussels, which is representative of all the countries covered by the Directive, has also been examining transposition issues.</P>
      <P>I expect that legislative proposals to transpose the Directive into Irish law will soon be put to Government.</P>
      <P>While my Department is not officially engaged in the enumeration of enterprises, agreements or workers coming under the scope of the Directive, I understand from independent surveys that up to 300 enterprises with operations in Ireland and employment in the region of 150,000 could be affected.  I am not in a position to give the precise number of voluntary agreements under Article 13 of the Directive (i.e. Pre-Directive Agreements) which have been reached between firms and their employees.  I am informed, however, that in the EU as a whole over 60 Pre-Directive Agreements have been adopted, a number of which impact on Irish-based employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge companies and their employees, if they have not already done so, to consider whether they will <Col N="1008" /> adopt Pre-Directive Agreements or implement a prescribed form of agreement to establish co-operative transnational information and consultation arrangements.</P>
