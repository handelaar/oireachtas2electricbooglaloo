      <P>Satisfactory progress is being made in preparing legislation to implement the commitments in <i>A Government of Renewal.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the 26 Bills enacted this year, eight included provisions relating to the implementation of nine commitments in the programme.  Another five commitments are reflected in Bills before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Bills <Col N="2" /> listed in the Government's legislation programme for this session, which was published on 6 October, will give effect to a further 15 commitments.</P>
    <P>The 14 remaining legislative commitments are at various stages of preparation and I am confident that all will be well advanced within the Government's mandate from the present Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I could question the Taoiseach all day, not only on the legislative commitments in the programme, but on the commissions, groupings, surveys and so on to which it refers.  Perhaps one day I will table an omnibus question on the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What progress has been made in preparing legislation to amend the Ministers and Secretaries Act and introduce <Col N="3" /> an administrative procedures Bill and a freedom of information Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Much work has already been done in the Tánaiste's office on the preparation of a Bill on the freedom of information which relates to the wider question of the Ministers and Secretaries Act covered in the subject matter of the second report of the co-ordinating group of secretaries on the strategic management initiative.  That report contains a number of recommendations that would affect a definition of the role of Ministers as against secretaries, the establishment of mission statements for various Government offices and procedures for monitoring achievements under the provisions in those mission statements.  When the matter reaches the point of full elaboration the Ministers and Secretaries Act will require amendment or replacement by a new public service Bill.  However, in examining the strategic management initiative we have not reached a stage where I could say exactly when or in what form the amendments will be introduced, but they will be introduced in due course.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  What is the position in regard to the strategic management initiative?  I understand that earlier this year the various Departments put together their plans and proposals on a development initiative to be co-ordinated by the Taoiseach.  What is the present position regarding the initiative?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I regard the implementation of the proposals in the strategic management initiative as one of my most important functions as Taoiseach. If we can implement the changes implicit in the strategic management initiative and make strategic management part of the working culture of the public service rather than something imposed from outside, as is sometimes the case with various administrative initiatives, we will have made a significant achievement.  That is something to which I am committed, as was my predecessor.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>

      <Quest>the action, if any, he now proposes to take on foot of the strategic management initiative.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the co-ordinating group of secretaries established by Government under the SMI is to present its second report to Government by end October.</P>
      <P>In its decision on the first report of the co-ordinating group of 2 March. 1995, the Government mandated the co-ordinating group to: (a) review existing systems for making decisions, allocating responsibility and ensuring accountability in the Civil Service; and (b) bringing forward for Government consideration proposals for an integrated programme to modernise the systems and practices in question and for the consequent modernisation of existing personnel and financial management in the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the will exists on the part of the Government to decide to implement a coherent and comprehensive reform programme on foot of the co-ordinating group's report.  I would expect that decision to be taken this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Taoiseach see the strategic management initiative developing as one coherent plan?  I was involved in putting the plans <Col N="7" /> together, and we had to co-ordinate conflicting views from many Departments to formulate a management initiative which would allow Departments certain flexibility and certain new powers.  I would like to hear the Taoiseach's views on that.  Does he see merit in hiving off the executive agencies of those parts of the Civil Service which simply administer Government policy? This was a live debate among those civil servants who studied the New Zealand policy.  What are the Taoiseach's views on that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just had the opportunity of reading the second report of the co-ordinating group of secretaries which is a very interesting document. It covers a range of issues, none of which has yet been decided by the Government.  I am not, therefore, in a position to go into great detail on them. To sum it up briefly, it would include individuals within the public service having responsibility personally for the delivery of certain services and accountability for same.  It would clarify the respective roles of Ministers <i>vis-à-vis</i> Department Secretaries with clear responsibilities for each.  This would obviously require extensive consultation with the unions before being implemented because we want this process to proceed by way of agreement. It will cover matters such as regulatory reform, the elimination of red tape and the vexed problem of how to deal with issues which are the responsibility of two or more Departments which frequently creates difficulties of administration. It deals quite extensively with the whole question of staff morale, training, promotion, dealing with matters of under-performance where such occurs etc. and how that can be related to the performance indicators set for individual sections in Departments.  It also includes proposals regarding public expenditure control and how commitments can be projected forward so that one understands what is happening when such decisions are taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="8" /> The essence of the whole thing is to make strategic management part of the daily work of every decision-making official.  Strategic management will not be imposed from outside with consultants coming in and telling people that they should think strategically.  The culture of the service will change so that, as part of their daily work, people are thinking not just about how to make a decision today to serve today's needs but looking at its strategic implications for the service, how this impacts on the objectives that have been set by the office and whether or not consumers of public services are satisfied with the services they are getting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach indicate when the Government's discussion on this issue will conclude?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the next month or so.  We will get the report at Cabinet in the next two weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach would not disagree that we have a long way to go in implementing the strategic management initiative in Departments. Does he intend involving an implementation group as soon as there is a central position paper for all Departments?  If so, who is it intended to include in that group?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The House may or may not be aware that there is a co-ordinating group of secretaries which has drawn up the report which contains the matter I have just summarised.  They are probably the best people to act as the implementing group, because they are senior decision-makers within the service, and they understand the nature of the recommendations.  I entirely agree with the Deputy's suggestion that getting this agreed at Cabinet is only the beginning.  To devise performance indicators for Departments will be extremely difficult because individual Departments have quite diverse purposes and it is not possible to have a uniform quality of service indicators <Col N="9" /> across the service; there must be specific quality of service indicators for each individual service.  That will require much thinking by people to define what is their own purpose, and the creation of a structure whereby their achievement of their own stated purpose can be measured.  That will be quite a lengthy process which will require a fair amount of hands on management from the top. It is a matter in which I am taking a particular interest and in respect of which the Minister of State, Deputy Avril Doyle, is working on an almost full time basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that there is no incentive at the moment for the management in the Civil Service to effect savings and that the contrary is the case?  Does he believe we need to examine a form of remuneration of the management in the Civil Service based on performance targets, the achievement of certain targets and on effecting savings in different budgets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be premature to talk in those terms until one has at least satisfied oneself that the performance indicators are robust enough to be able to bear such a system.  We are only at the stage of talking about the concept of performance indicators.  We have yet to specify how they might work.  There are some Departments, for example, where it might be quite easy to measure performance, and others where it would be virtually impossible because of the general nature of the work that is being done.  Obviously one does not want to create a situation where a public servant who happens to work in a particular Department where performance can be easily measured would get pay increases, while somebody in another area of work which is just as important but not so easily measurable would not.  There are many problems with this.  It is not something that has developed rapidly in any jurisdiction to my knowledge.  It is not <Col N="10" /> excluded at this stage &mdash; we have not reached the point of decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The experience in other countries suggests that taking on management consultants from outside the Civil Service ensures it will never happen and is an excuse to bury it so I suggest that Civil Servant management is used.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned that delegated function orders apply to Ministers of State but does he envisage a change in the system whereby the Cabinet delegates functions to parliamentary secretaries and Ministers of State, and what change has he in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware there are many instances where delegation of functions to Ministers of State does not go to Cabinet, is informal and that, depending on their abilities and interests the Ministers of State are given responsibilities wider than those specified in the Government decision. That works reasonably well.  What will happen as a result of changes on foot of the strategic management initiative is that responsibilities will be much more formally and clearly defined for Ministers, Ministers of State, Secretaries and individual line officials running particular sections.  It will all go down on paper so that there will be a much clearer sense of accountability for individual matters.  This is the direction we are taking but at this stage we are looking for agreement in principle to implement a fairly detailed scheme which will have to be worked out Department by <Col N="11" /> Department because Departments are not all the same.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>Since taking office, the Government have taken two major initiatives to ensure that Ministers avoid potential conflicts of interests.</P>
      <P>First, the Ethics in Public Office legis lation has been enacted, providing <i>inter alia</i> a legal framework for the formal recording of certain private business interests held and gifts received by office holders, including Ministers. Second, on my appointment as Taoiseach. I took the unprecedented step of requesting all Ministers, Ministers of State and the Attorney General, on their assuming office, to furnish me with declarations of their financial interests. This was done in advance of the enactment of the ethics legislation so as to set a lead in this regard and to show my total commitment to the principles set out in that legislation.</P>
      <P>The Government today made a Commencement Order under section 1 (2) (a) of the Ethics Act, bringing into force the provisions of the Act in so far as they relate of office holders.  I understand that resolutions will shortly be put down in the Dáil and Seanad, to bring into operation the provisions of the Act which relate to Members of both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the effects of the Commencement Order is to establish the Public Offices Commission.  The commission is <Col N="12" /> charged with the preparation of guidelines for officer holders and members of the Oireachtas, to assist them in complying with the Act.  When the guidelines are ready, it is proposed to update the Government Procedure Instructions to take account of these and other developments.  It is also proposed to publish the instructions, in line with a commitment given in the Government policy document <i>A Government of Renewal.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>During the passage of the Ethics in Public Office legislation and the debate so far on the Electoral Bill I suggested that the procedures and guidelines involved be put before the House so that Members are clear as to what they are expected to live by; otherwise we would spend the next ten years arguing about it.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that it is contrary to the Government Procedure Instructions to brief the press either directly or indirectly on matters to be brought to Government?</P>

      <P>In general I regard it as very important that Ministers avoid anything that could be construed as being in any way a conflict of interest but I do not think I should go further because it seems that the Deputy has a specific case in mind and is asking me to interpret without notice the facts of a case of which I am unaware.</P>

      <P>No, I was asked what steps I have taken since the formation of Government to avoid conflicts of interest, I have outlined those steps and indicated also that we introduced and processed the ethics legislation, that it has come into force, that I have sought declarations of financial interests from Ministers on a scale that was never asked for before by any of my predecessors, and that I have obtained that information of which a record is kept.

      <P>Both Deputy Rabbitte and the Taoiseach were very keen on asking this specific question when in Opposition.  Should it be brought to the Taoiseach's attention that a Minister had appointed to a State board somebody with whose family business he had very close and valuable commercial dealings, what action would he take?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of appointment to a State board depends primarily on the usefulness and value of the person's contribution to the board. If Ministers have divested themselves of their business interests &mdash; I do not believe that business people should be excluded from becoming Ministers &mdash; I do not see any problem with appointing to a State board someone with whom they may have had dealings in the past but if there were some suggestion that something improper was being done or sought that would be an entirely different matter.  I do not think the fact that a Minister in his private capacity had done business with somebody in the past should disqualify that person from any appointment to a State board. Otherwise people would have difficulty <Col N="15" /> in doing business with politicians in their private capacities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>We know that office holders have to divest themselves of their interests for the purpose of doing their job and avoiding potential conflicts of interest.  In the case of ongoing business what would the Taoiseach regard as material facts that should come into the public domain?  In other words where a Minister has obviously divested himself of potential conflicts of interest, would the Taoiseach agree that where there are facts that are material to the public domain but do not necessarily involve a conflict of interest, these should be made known to the public so that they might gauge the situation.</P>

      <P>That may well be the case.  I have indicated to the House that I have obtained very extensive declarations of their financial interests from all Ministers, including interests that may be held by their relatives, such relatives being private individuals who do not have a public responsibility. Obviously for that reason I am not able to publish the entirety of the information I have received &mdash; it affects third parties.  The Ministers will comply in full with the provisions of the Ethics in Public Office legislation and all matters pertaining to it.  I am satisfied that will work well.  If the Deputies had any suggestions to make more rigorous the provisions of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, they had the opportunity to put them forward during the passage of the legislation through the House.  I am satisfied this Government does and will act in an ethical way in all its dealings.</P>

      <Quest>the new draftsmen, if any, that have been sanctioned and recruited to the Office of the Attorney General since April 1995.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I informed the House on 23 May in reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy O'Dea that a competition, under the Civil Service Commission Act, 1956, to lead to the recruitment of additional draftsmen was being advertised later that week.  The competition, which involved both a written element and an interview, was duly advertised on 25 May and has only recently concluded.  It is expected that recruitment will commence as soon as possible in accordance with the procedures of the Civil Service Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is intended to recruit five new <Col N="18" /> Senior Draftsmen from this competition. These will fill the three existing vacancies, at recruitment level, which have resulted from the filling, by internal promotion, of the vacant posts of parliamentary draftsman, assistant parliamentary draftsman and a newly created post at first senior draftsman level as well as two additional posts which have been sanctioned at senior draftsman level.  Because of the necessity for a training-in period for the new draftsmen it will be some time before the full benefit from their appointments will be achieved.  For this reason, the Government has recently sanctioned the recruitment, on a short-term contract basis, of up to four experienced draftsmen in order to augment the drafting capacity of the Attorney General's office.  Although these skills are in short supply worldwide, the Attorney General has already been investigating, with some success, the availability of such expertise in other common law jurisdictions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach tell the House how the throughput of legislation so far this year compares with previous years?  Will he agree that one of the main causes of the delay in legislation has been the shortage of staff and lack of modern facilities within the office of the Attorney General?  Will he assure the House that, when the new draftsmen are recruited, the matter will be remedied within the office of the Attorny General?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the introduction of the committee system had led to more rapid passage of legislation in this House.  The House can now progress three items of legislation simultaneously.  More legislation is being passed than was passed in previous years.  I am satisfied that the legislative programme is being effectively proceeded with.  I have already answered Question No. 1 from the Deputy about that matter.</P>

      <P>We are running out of time, but I take issue with the Taoiseach. I agree that the legislation is passing but whether it is more effective is a good question.  The Taoiseach was kind enough to assist the Opposition and the chairman of one of the committees here last week, when our party spokesperson was in the House and a Bill was being debated in a committee room.  We should look at whether the committee system is helping.  It is certainly helping to get legislation passed, but whether it is helping to get legislation examined is an interesting debating point.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a distinct improvement.  I have no doubt the Deputy will agree with that because he was a Member of the Government that agreed to the introduction of the committee system to progress the Committee Stage of Bills.  The record shows that the level of scrutiny has improved as a result.  The availability of parliamentary draftsmen has been part of the problem in preparing legislation, but much legislation has been debated and passed in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett) Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 28, 31, 32, 33 and 187 together.  The main <Col N="22" /> day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. The Naval Service currently has a total of seven vessels which are deployed in the most efficient manner on fishery protection duties having regard to current and predicted fishing patterns.</P>
      <P>With the new arrangements on fishery control measures arising in 1996 the workload of the Naval Service is set to increase.  These new measures will include the requirement for all fishing vessels to report to the Irish authorities before they enter or exit the Irish zone. In this regard, I am very committed to ensuring that sufficient resources are in place to enable the Naval Service deal with these additional demands and that a more sophisticated and comprehensive fisheries control and surveillance system is established in Ireland which will ensure that illegal fishing in Irish waters is a risk not worth taking.</P>
      <P>Discussions are ongoing on a new EU fishery surveillance funding package to run from January 1996, to December 2000.  Under this package, Ireland is seeking funding towards technical resources, new surveillance facilities and staff resources.  An essential requirement will be the provision of an additional ship for the Naval Service during this period.  Additionally, for the first time ever, it has been agreed that funding from the new package will be available to cover some element of the operational costs of Ireland's fishery surveillance operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of manpower, I can say that recruitment to the Naval Service is kept under continuous review within the Department.  The Department is currently in the process of enlisting 50 recruits for the Naval Service, 26 have already taken up duty and the remainder are expected to be enlisted shortly, at which stage the strength of the Naval Service will be at its highest ever level.  If a commitment from the EU for funding towards an additional ship for the Naval Service is secured then the question of additional <Col N="23" /> recruitment to the Naval Service will obviously have to be reviewed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Officials from both my Departments have been working to finalise Ireland's proposals for funding under the new package.  I expect that outline proposals for the overall Community-wide package will be agreed at the meeting of EU Fishery Ministers to be held at the end of this month.  I can assure the Deputies that at that meeting I will be making the strongest possible case to acquire the best deal for Ireland on the basis that the Naval Service and Air Corps are responsible for protecting 16 per cent of EU waters.</P>
    <P>As regards anti-drug surveillance the position is that responsibility for prevention of the illegal importation of drugs rests primarily with the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda Síochána. The Defence Forces, including the Naval Service, respond to requests from the civil authorities for assistance, including assistance in combating the illegal importation of drugs, and they will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>Existing resources have enabled the Naval Service to respond effectively to such requests.  The recent Government decision on proposals to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs including the establishment of a Joint Task Force involving the Garda, the Customs Service and the Naval Service will help to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating the illegal importation of drugs.  The designation of some Naval Service personnel as enforcement officers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 will also increase the role and effectiveness of the Naval Service in this area.  The question of whether additional resources are required will be kept under review as these proposals are implemented.</P>
    <P>Following a Government decision earlier this year, an interdepartmental group drawn from various Government Departments was set up to establish departmental co-ordination in respect of the drugs issue at European level in <Col N="24" /> the context of the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.  More specifically, one of the aims of the group is to identify possible initiatives that can be taken on action against drugs during the Irish Presidency in 1996.  Both my Departments are represented in the group, the work of which is on-going.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>With the record the Spaniards have for illegal fishing and the potential threat posed when they enter the Irish Box from January 1996, in addition to the importation of illicit drugs, which is an ever growing concern, it is clear from the Minister's reply that he is not satisfied with the level of manpower or the present position.  Is it true that we have insufficient personnel to man surveillance equipment, Naval ships and Air Corps equipment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not true.  Despite various rumours, I have thoroughly investigated this matter and I am totally satisfied that there are sufficient personnel to carry out all the necessary duties the Naval Service is obliged to do, particularly in the fishery protection area.  One of our ships, the <i>LE Eimear,</i> is currently undergoing a life extension refit similar to that which the <i>LE Deirdre</i> underwent in 1994.  I am quite satisfied that we have sufficient personnel.</P>
      <P>The Government will guarantee the implementation of European agreements that were reached on the accession of Spain and Portugal to the Common Fisheries Policy.  As far as is humanly possible we will provide whatever resources are necessary because the fishing industry &mdash; both in terms of potential and personnel &mdash; is far too valuable for us to allow anybody to fish illegally.  We have the assistance of two new CASA aircraft, as I am sure the Deputy is aware, which are of particular&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted.  Fair play. They are of great assistance to the <Col N="25" /> Naval Service and will continue to be so. However, we need personnel on Naval ships in order to carry out inspections and to ensure that arrests are made in the context of the illegal importation of drugs.  We will continue to supply such personnel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The roles of the Defence Forces were revised in 1993 and I have no proposals to alter these.  In July of this year the Government announced its response to the report of the Efficiency Audit Group (EAG) on its review of the Defence Forces and published a document detailing the EAG report and setting out the Government's approach to the reorganisation.  This report followed a lengthy analysis and consultative process on all aspects of the organisation of the Defence Forces.  The report was prepared on the basis of the revised roles of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The Government indicated that it accepted the general thrust of the EAG report.  It was also stated that an implementation group would be established to draw up detailed and fully costed proposals to implement a first phase plan covering the next three years.  This plan would be based on the reorganisation of the Defence Forces on the basis of a three brigade structure with a manpower level of around 11,500.  The Government also stated that the reduction in manpower would be achieved through a voluntary early retirement scheme which would be one element in the overall plan to be formulated by the implementation group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures to be introduced are important and represent a positive development for the Defence Forces. <Col N="26" /> The Government's objective is a properly structured, well equipped Defence Forces capable of meeting their roles in the most efficient and effective way. The Government also recognises that it is important that the Defence Forces provide a challenging and rewarding career for all personnel in the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps and that the management, organisation and operation of the Defence Forces are in accordance with best practice.  The changes required will involve very significant reorganisation of existing structures over the next three years.  This change will be undertaken at a realistic pace.</P>
    <P>As regards consultation, the Government has stressed that a consultative approach would be adopted in relation to the reorganisation proposals.  In this regard a special sub-committee of the Defence Forces Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme has been established and an on-going process of consultation has already begun with the Defence Forces Representative Associations in relation to the reorganisation.  I also understand that the implementation group and the Review Civil-Military Co-ordination Group have met with the Defence Forces Representative Associations on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, the Government has established an implementation group to draw up a detailed plan for the reorganisation. The implementation group will be reporting later this year and no decisions have been taken or will be taken until this plan has been considered by the Government.  The House will be kept fully informed of developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that the consultative process has developed into a case of take it or leave it and that the Government is now implementing the EAG report, notwithstanding promises of full consultation and promises to inform the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.  As I stated in my reply, no report has been <Col N="27" /> presented to me or to the Government. The implementation group is doing its work.  Ongoing negotiations are taking place with the various organisations, but nothing has been or will be decided until the Government so decides.  I have not received any report from the implementation group, but when I do, I will consider it and present it to the Government for early implementation.</P>

      <P>It is extraordinary that the Minister should disown what is happening in the Defence Forces.  Is it not true that we were promised a retirement package and that we have not see it?  Is it not true that we were promised a new recruitment drive which has now been abandoned, notwithstanding the pressures to improve the age profile?  Senior personnel are being transferred from critical areas and this will lead to the closure of Army barracks in those areas. Morale was never at a lower pitch, yet the Minister is telling us he knows nothing about this.  Is that the position?</P>

      <P>As part of the package which the implementation group will present to us.  There is no mystery about that and no one is being pushed around. The process is ongoing and I am not disowning anything.  I asked a group of people to do a particular job and when the report is ready they will present it to me and I will present it to the Government.  The Deputy should not make allegations which he cannot stand over.  It is ridiculous to say there is no voluntary early retirement scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in my reply that there will be a voluntary early retirement scheme.  That is being worked out and will be discussed with the representative associations in due course. <Col N="28" /> Recruitment will also take place as part of the reorganisation of the Defence Forces.  We are dealing with new structures and an age profile problem.  The voluntary early retirement scheme will be designed in such a way as to allow an intake over a three year period.  This will help to solve the numbers problem and the age profile problem by bringing in young people as older people retire. This will be done as part of the reorganisation process which will begin after the implementation group has presented its proposals.</P>

When the implementation group has completed its work, all the things promised will be presented and those who wish to take up the voluntary early retirement package may do so.  There will be no compulsory redundancy and people will not be pushed around.  It is important to put that on the record.</P>

      <P>Those are imaginary decisions.  This shows the scare tactics which are being used.  There has been no compulsory transfer of people so that barracks can be closed in any part of the country.  No one is authorised to do such a thing and no decision has been taken by the Government to close one barracks in phase one of this programme. It is a matter for a future Government to decide if they should continue to phase two or phase three and to do what it wishes in three years' time.  I hope I will be in Government then to deal with this question.</P>

      <Quest>the current situation regarding the provision of an aircraft hangar at Baldonnel, County Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14973/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The corps of engineers is engaged in preparing a plan and design for an aircraft hangar at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, to house the two CASA Maritime Patrol aircraft and the Gulfstream IV aircraft as well as providing maintenance facilities.  The design team are not due to report until next year.  I regard it as a priority to provide hangarage for these aircraft and intend that the project should proceed at the earliest possible date, subject to the necessary finance being made available to my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>Are there aircraft in Baldonnel aerodrome which do not have hangars?  Some of those aircraft have to take to the air at short notice and they must be in top shape for their flights.  Does the Minister agree that as no hangars are available for those aircraft, especially in winter, they are not in first-class condition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying that the existing hangars are not sufficiently large to house either the Gulfstream IV or CASA aircraft.  The Gulfstream IV is partially covered by the existing hangar and the two CASA aircraft are parked in the open, creating a problem for maintenance staff required to work on them.  Discussions are taking place at present to house these CASA aircraft temporarily in hangars at Dublin Airport and we propose to rent space from Team Aer Lingus when the need arises.  I agree with the Deputy, it is unsatisfactory that we do not have sufficient hangars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are at present four hangars there, hangars one, two and four were built around 1917 while hangar three was completely refurbished in 1988.  The older hangars are not in good condition despite continuing maintenance because of the age of their structures.  As the Deputy will know, like everything else, such maintenance is very expensive.  We shall endeavour to obtain the requisite <Col N="31" /> additional finance when the corps of engineers have prepared the plan for Baldonnel which, I hope, will become available early next year, at which stage I will do my utmost to provide them with the necessary funds to commence the work.</P>
    <P>I would not like anybody to think that aircraft piloted by the Air Corps would be allowed to take to the air if they were not considered to be in safe, good condition. It is important to state that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware there is a certain degree of concern on the part of personnel at Baldonnel aerodrome that aircraft used for important missions &mdash; which can be called to take to the air at very short notice &mdash; are not under cover in inclement weather between, say, November to late February or early March?  Is this occasioned by a shortage of funding?  Can the Minister give the House an assurance that the matter will be addressed as soon as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the corps of engineers are drawing up detailed plans for a new hangar.  When those plans become available, we shall seek funds, hopefully in 1996, in order to allow them to commence work.  However, because of the length of time the CASA aircraft remain without cover, we are seeking temporary accommodation at Dublin Airport where they can be housed in premises owned by Team Aer Lingus.  The position is unsatisfactory &mdash; there is no point in maintaining otherwise &mdash; but we shall endeavour to do something about it.  When one remembers all that has happened since 1917, one is led to the conclusion that somebody should have given some thought to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that my Department has been in touch with the corresponding UK authorities over a period regarding these various matters. We have been informed that the Ministry of Defence did indeed undertake sea dumping of chemical weapons stocks and conventional munitions as a means of disposing of redundant and surplus stocks and dealing with the legacy of weapons produced in the world wars. These disposals occurred in a number of locations and at random dates.  We have been informed that all such dumping by the UK Government has ceased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware of my continuing and deep concerns in this whole matter.  It is my firm objective to ensure that all information &mdash; in terms of locations, dates and nature of materials &mdash; on past disposals in the sea around our coasts is made public; the public is made fully aware of the current and planned monitoring of the state of our waters, both in the vicinity of dumped materials and in the wider marine area, <Col N="33" /> and authoritative information is made available on the current and prospective state of dumped materials together with an assessment of any potential medium to long-term dangers from the dumping incidences.</P>
    <P>To that end, I am today placing before the House all the information available to me in relation to dumping activities by the UK authorities.  As already mentioned in the debate on the Adjournment on Tuesday, 10 October, I have made contact with the UK Government directly in relation to more recent claims of dumping, particularly disposals of nuclear material, and sought more detailed particulars of where and when dumping was conducted, whether any chemical or nuclear materials were involved and stressing the need for strict monitoring and management of any dumped material which might impact on the marine environment or human health.  Since then I have also written to the UK Minister for the Environment stressing the need for urgent monitoring and better management of the various dump sites involved. I intend to follow up these various contacts urgently at a political level.  I have also asked my Department and the Marine Institute to impress on the UK authorities and the scientific community the need to enhance our scientific knowledge of the processes involved in the breakdown of these substances and their impact; I intend to impress on the EU Commissioner responsible for environmental affairs our Government's concern in these areas and have written to her seeking an early meeting.</P>
    <P>We are not alone in our concern about the use of the sea as a location for dumping chemical and nuclear material. On an international level, the dumping of chemical weapons is a matter of major concern to most contracting parties to the Oslo Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft, 1972. Ireland is a party to the Oslo Convention and the Government is actively pursuing the general issue of munitions dumping through that forum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> The Assessment and Monitoring Committee, a scientific working group of the Convention has considered studies undertaken by Denmark concerning war gas dumpings in the Baltic Sea and concluded, on the basis of the best available information and technical advice that, given the nature of the chemicals, seepage is not considered to pose serious hazards and efforts to retrieve or remove would be more dangerous than leaving the dumped material in place.  Nevertheless, this remains a matter of serious concern and further investigation into this whole area is required.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, determined to ensure that a comprehensive investigation of the impact of the dumping of chemical weapons off the coast of Ireland should be initiated.  In this regard it was decided, at the April meeting of ASMO this year that, as part of a wider quality status report on the maritime area covered by the Oslo Convention, the impact of the dumping of war gas ammunition would be specifically addressed.  This wider quality status report is to be completed by the year 2000.  Ireland and the UK are responsible for the preparation of that part of the report in respect of a region which covers the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and areas to the west of Ireland and west of Scotland and the aim is to have the war gas and other aspects of dumped weapons addressed as speedily as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister invoke the OSPAR arbitration procedures against the United Kingdom authorities &mdash; when the Dumping at Sea and the Energy (Miscellaneous) Bills are passed here which, as the Minister knows, will enable our Government to ratify the new OSPAR Convention &mdash; for the dumping of nuclear wastes in the Irish Sea in addition to potential dumping in the north east Atlantic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will our Government be represented at the Intergovernmental Conference on the Protection of the Marine Environment to be held in Washington later this month and early November?  What position will the Government take on <Col N="35" /> one of the most significant proposals at that conference, the global and legally binding ban on POPs into the marine environment?</P>
    <P>With regard to the concern expressed about these alarming developments over the past 30 years, will the Minister say whether we will hear of more secret dumps or has he been assured by the United Kingdom authorities that everything is now known with regard to their location so that any preventive action possible can be attempted, ensuring we will not be again surprised by new names and locations of other secret dumps?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The information made available to us, the details of which I am providing to the House, outlines 22 sites where conventional munitions were dumped at various stages since the mid1940s. It also outlines 24 sites where chemical munitions have been dumped. We have been given two assurances by the UK authorities that this is the complete information regarding the extent of dumping and that all such dumping has now been discontinued.  Scientific information available from studies carried out elsewhere reveals that in the interest of the marine environment it is better to leave such dumped material undisturbed but to monitor and manage such sites.  Our initiatives have been taken with a view to adopting a joint approach to managing and monitoring those sites.  That can be achieved under the OSPAR Convention, in particular under the requirement regarding the preparation of a quality status report which covers a section of the North Atlantic that surrounds our coast and the Irish Sea.  Responsibility for the preparation of that report rests jointly with the Irish Government and the UK Government.  That is the approach we intend to take.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Intergovernmental Conference to be held in Washington, it is intended that the Irish Government will be represented at it.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for the information he has given today. It is welcome that at long last someone is seriously addressing this problem.  For a number of years we have been aware of the extent of dumping off the north-west coast, particularly an area covering approximately 60 to 70 miles off the Donegal coast.  We are concerned about the condition of the casings in which those substances have been dumped. Would it be possible to carry out a visual inspection to asertain the condition of those casings which lie at the bottom of the sea?  There is widespread concern among responsible people and local authorities, that such gases could escape and cause untold damage to marine and other life.  Surely when it is possible to get down to where the <i>Titanic</i> rests, it should be possible to get down to where those substances are resting to ascertain their condition.  We have all been disturbed by a new twist revealed last week, the allegation of nuclear waste dumped along our coasts.  I urge the Minister to take this up at European level, if necessary, to ascertain what has been dumped, where it has been dumped and what can be done to save the environment, life and habitation around our coastal areas from such potential danger.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I need hardly explain the difficulty of identifying the precise locations of such dumpings at this stage. We have the co-ordinates at which the dumpings occurred but after 40 or 50 years of sea movement it is understandable that identifying precise locations and having them examined is quite difficult.  We have been in touch with the Scottish office and with the UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fishery and Food regarding dumping in the Beaufort Dyke.  The Scottish office has assured us it is undertaking underwater examination of that dump and is organising to have cameras sent down to photograph what is there to establish its condition.  It will provide us with that information when it is available.</P>
      <P>Regarding the more recent allegations of dumping of nuclear wastes in the Beaufort Dyke, the UK atomic energy agency denied those claims.  I have written to the UK Secretary of State for Defence seeking his observations on the charges made and precise information regarding the location of any such dumping, the condition in which substances have been dumped, the nature of casings and the monitoring and management in the meantime.  I assure Deputy McGinley that we will continue to pursue that with the UK Ministries of Defence and Environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>As my colleague, the Minister of State indicated, the Government is extremely concerned about reports of all disposals of hazardous materials in our adjacent seas and I can assure the House I intend <Col N="38" /> to ensure that we continue to pursue these matters actively at political, official and scientific levels with the UK authorities and the relevant international bodies.  To date Ireland has adopted a highly proactive stance in international bodies on these issues. This has been successful in keeping the need for information and action to the fore and in heightening the interest and attention given to marine environmental issues by most governments.</P>
      <P>We will pursue in particular the claims &mdash; since denied by the UK atomic energy agency as mentioned by the Minister of State &mdash; of the dumping of radioactive waste in the Irish Sea between Belfast Lough and the Scottish coast.  Given the particularly insidious impact of such wastes no stone will be left unturned in ascertaining the facts and the implications of any such dumpings.</P>
      <P>In relation to the implications for the fishing industry, I must assure the House the industry and consumers that there is no cause for alarm in this regard.  At the same time as we are pursuing the issue at international level, we will continue to carefully monitor the health of fish and other marine food products.  To date these ongoing tests give no reason whatsoever for disquiet nor do I expect any change in the future.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Will the Minister agree that this represents another episode of trying to drag information from the nuclear industry which operates in a secretive fashion?  Will he accept it is time to ask the EU to set up an independent investigative structure to examine in detail the source and types of nuclear wastes dumped along the Irish coast?  The report in the British newspaper, <i>The Observer,</i> which has not been denied, is of major concern.  While the Minister said there is a lack of information from the UK authorities, they have not denied that such dumpings have taken place.  Will the Minister accept this is a matter of grave concern for our people?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister of State and I said on numerous occasions &mdash; and I am aware that the Deputy shares this view &mdash; the time has long since passed when people can dump whatever they like into the seas.  We have taken a proactive role in highlighting that at various fora and we intend to continue to do so.  We wish to stress, whether it involves the British authorities or anybody else, that if information of that nature is sought, it is important that it be given openly and that there be no sense of fear in the community because of the tendency for secrecy which, in turn, would suggest something sinister was happening behind the scenes and which, in turn, would have downstream effects in various areas.</P>
      <P>On the Deputy's question about the fishing industry, we are particularly conscious of ongoing tests to make certain that fish life is not affected so that there will be no public scare.  This industry is too important to us not to take care and pay sufficient attention to so as to ensure that a very valuable stock is not damaged or that people's health is affected.  To date, despite ongoing tests, there is no reason for disquiet.  I do not expect any change in the future.  Many of the dumpings took place some years ago and, because of the ongoing research, if there had been any damage to fish life, it would have been noticed before now.  There is nothing to suggest that fish life has suffered.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome the statement by the Minister on the fishing industry.  We would all be concerned if nuclear discharges affected the fishing industry.  The Commission President, Jacques Santer, when referring to the French nuclear tests, said he accepted the Commission had a responsibility under the Euratom Treaty for the health, safety and environment of its citizens.  We have heard much from the Minister of State about the Oslo Convention but is the Minister pursuing this matter, as suggested by <Col N="40" /> President Santer, under the Euratom Treaty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We will avail of every forum to raise our disquiet.  As a small country we can give a lead in regard to protection of the marine environment.  As an island nation we should be aware of our influence.  We have used every possible opportunity and every angle to lead the charge and encourage others to make practices which were acceptable in the past unacceptable in the future.</P>

      <P>As the Minister is aware Civil Defence comes under the aegis of the Department of Defence. While it is a voluntary body, it is an important one.  Over the years the image of Civil Defence has deteriorated. Many of the question today dealt with the dumping of explosives in the Irish Sea and so on.  There is also a link between that and the Sellafield plant. Civil Defence will be to the forefront in the event of a discharge from Sellafield. One has only to look at what happened following the Chernobyl accident some years ago in places as far away as Lapland, Iceland, Donegal and the Minister's county to the sheep population. Only today we heard of a young child, deserted by her parents in Belorussia after she was disabled in the explosion, who has been adopted by a family from County Cork.  The Minister will have to <Col N="41" /> consider if Civil Defence with its supply of blankets and other equipment is able to deal with the after effects of an explosion at Sellafield.  Not long ago there was a suspicion that there was something radically wrong in that plant. I appeal to the Minister to take a serious look at Civil Defence in general.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept the allegation by Deputy Clohessy about the lack of morale and the depletion of equipment in the Defence Forces. As the Deputy rightly said Civil Defence comes under the aegis of the Department of Defence.  The range of activities in which the Civil Defence movement is involved, speaks for itself.  The organisation was established initially to protect the civilian population from hazards of war.  With the reduction of international tensions in recent years, the thrust of Civil Defence is changing and planning for the future is now geared towards objectives set out in the programme, Towards 2000, which is focused towards community help and support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objectives of the Towards 2000 programme are: to provide for stewarding at local and national events; to develop a response to flooding problems &mdash; as Minister of State responsible for the Office of Public Works I saw at first hand the tremendous work done in the Deputy's county, in County Galway and throughout the country in the autumn and spring of last year when horrendous flooding was experienced by the civilian population; to develop a response to environmental problems; to develop a response to major emergencies; to develop an overseas assistance response capability; to revise and update evacuee reception arrangements; to develop a response to plans for radiological protection emergencies; to develop a response to river, lake and coastal area search and recovery; to develop assistance response in blizzard <Col N="42" /> conditions; to broaden the scope of rescue capability; market Civil Defence training on a commercial basis and it was actively and effectively engaged in forest fire-fighting during the summer.</P>
    <P>The current membership of Civil Defence is approximately 10,000 personnel. Yesterday I had the pleasure of launching the press awareness campaign &mdash; the community endeavour programme 1995 &mdash; which will take place at the weekend.  Several thousand Civil Defence personnel will be mobilised in Clonmel, Blarney, Castlebar and Westport to take part in a range of tests and challenges they are likely to experience as members of the Civil Defence movement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I visited Irish troops serving with the United Nations in Lebanon, Cyprus and Israel during the period 14-23 September 1995.  The primary purpose of my visit was to see for myself the work of Irish military personnel serving in the region and to assure them, on behalf of the Government and people of Ireland, of how proud we are of the outstanding manner in which they have consistently performed their duties on United Nations service.</P>
      <P>While in Lebanon I had discussions with the Force Commander, Major-General Stanislaw Wozniak, and met with Irish personnel stationed at Force Headquarters in Naqoura and with members of the 77th Infantry Battalion serving in the south of the country. I saw at first hand the role played by Irish officers and was greatly impressed by their sense of commitment to the important work they are undertaking in the cause of international peace.</P>
      <P>The presence of UNIFIL is clearly vital to the stability of South Lebanon and to the safety and welfare of the local population.  The inhabitants of the whole region are deeply appreciative of the Irish presence and there was an obvious close rapport between the battalion and the community.  In Beirut I met Mr. Muhsin Dalloul, the Lebanese Minister for Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While in Cyprus I met Brigadier-General Ahti Vartiainen, the Commander of the United Nations Force in Cyprus and the Force's Chief of Mission, Mr. Gustave Feissel.  In Israel I met with Colonel <Col N="44" /> Jaakko Oksanen, Acting Chief of Staff of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation, retired Major-General David Ivry, Director General of the Israeli Ministry of Defence and Brigadier-General Tzur, General Officer Commanding, Israel's Defence Forces Liaison Unit to Foreign Forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Overseas involvement in the service of the United Nations has been an invigorating experience for our troops and has given them vast international experience of the world stage. What struck me forcibly in Lebanon was the manner in which those on conflicting sides were unanimous in their tribute to the skill and dedication of the Irish troops.  It is obvious there is something quite special in the make-up of Irish military personnel in terms of temperament and training that equips them to meet the challenges they face in the type of conflict in which they are involved, particularly in South Lebanon.</P>

The complainant will be given the opportunity of presenting his or her case orally.  Complaints not resolved will be investigated in an impartial manner by a third party independent of both myself and the military chain of command.  The complaints inquiry officer will be appointed with the agreement of the representative associations.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 27 and 30 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> In the period 15 December 1994 to 30 September 1995 Air Corps aircraft, both fixed and rotary wing, carried out 98 flights within Ireland involving the transport of Ministers, 23 of which involved the Taoiseach.  Details of the route, requesting Minister, number of passengers carried and the flying time for each of the 98 flights are set out in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  The role of the Department of Defence is confined to arranging flights. Details relating to the purpose of any particular flight or passengers carried are matters for the requesting Ministers.</P>
    <P>It is normal practice in the aviation business to cost aircraft by reference to the cost per flying hour under either of two headings (a) the direct cost, that is the costs which are additional to those associated with having the aircraft and which arise only when the aircraft is flown, or (b) the total cost, that is the direct cost plus the costs associated with having the aircraft.  In the case of the G IV the direct cost is £670 per flying hour in respect of crew and fuel, which is the figure used by the previous administration, while the total cost, which includes personnel, fuel, maintenance, depreciation and landing charges etc. is £4,000 per hour.</P>
    <P>Based on these calculations the direct cost of carrying out the 98 flights is estimated at £58,500.  The direct cost of the 23 flights involving the transport of the Taoiseach is estimated at £14,600.  The direct cost per flying hour of all Air Corps aircraft is being reviewed in connection with the work of the Committee on Ministerial Transport.</P>

      <P>Given the variations in the costs of flights, will the Minister explain the divergence between the costing given by the secretary of his Department to the Committee of Public Accounts and the figure of £4,000 claimed by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, in Opposition? Will he also state the number of trips undertaken by the Tánaiste to and from Farranfore Airport and whether he is satisfied that they all involved official business?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That instruction is followed by and large and the Taoiseach takes a direct interest in the matter.</P>
      <P>On the question of costs per hour, I spoke to the secretary of my Department who is very anxious to provide proper and adequate information to Deputies, particularly those on the Committee of Public Accounts. However, we have to either accept that we have an aircraft or we do not. Regardless of whether it is flown, an aircraft depreciates, a crew has to be trained and the aircraft maintained.  The average cost per flying hour depends on what one takes into account, for example, depreciation, maintenance or the cost of the crew plus the cost of fuel and landing charges.  This is why there are conflicting figures on the costs per hour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I never put down a question about this matter as I support the use of aircraft if it means that people can do their business more efficiently in the interests of the country.  I have no doubt that the Taoiseach can account for all flights taken by him.  Any fair minded person would say that in some cases this is the only way to travel.</P>

      <Quest>the progress, if any, which has been made regarding the provision of a new pier at Killybegs, County Donegal; when dredging of the harbour area will take place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 35 and 199 together.</P>
      <P>I recently visited Killybegs and was very impressed with the level of development in the fishing industry in the north west.  This is a highly competitive, efficient and modern fleet which deserves every support we can give it in terms of infrastructure and back-up. There is no doubt that investment is needed at the fishery harbour centre to underpin the viability of the industry. The lack of deep draught and berthage is causing difficulties and congestion. We need now to assess the structural deficiencies and to work on a comprehensive fully costed development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the fundamental funding problem which is seriously restricting the scope for much needed development at key fishery harbours around the coast.  The funding currently available to me under the Operational Programme up to 1999 is not remotely sufficient to do all that needs to be done and will certainly not cater for the major investment needs of Killybegs.  I inherited this limited level of money which is inadequate and, frankly, shortsighted given the economic potential inherent in the fishing sector.  I intend to do everything in my power to change this scenario.  I am working intensively to increase the overall funding available to me from <Col N="59" /> Exchequer and Structural Fund sources which is so urgently needed to address the infrastructural needs at Killybegs and at other key fishery harbours around the coast.  I have no doubt that I have the full support of all Deputies in this endeavour in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for visiting Killybegs.  However, will he answer my question regarding the provision of emergency Exchequer funding for the provision of a new pier?  Is he aware that the £25 million flagship of the Irish fleet, <i>The Veronica,</i> had to wait outside the harbour in Killybegs for a week because no berthing facilities were available and then had to travel to Dublin, resulting in the loss of thousands of pounds to Killybegs?  The staff also suffered losses as they were unable to berth at home before returning to Scotland. If emergency Exchequer funding is not provided for Killybegs there will be total frustration among those who export our produce.  Is the Minister aware that this frustration led to the resignation of the harbour master?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy knows that this is not the reason the harbour master resigned.  There is no point in denying that additional space is needed in Killybegs for landing fish.  If the necessary infrastructural facilities are not provided, fish will not be landed. This, in turn, will affect the processing industry.  I fail to understand how the previous Government transferred funding earmarked for fishery harbours under the operational programme to other areas thereby allowing this appalling situation to occur.  I will do everything possible to secure the additional funding required to provide the necessary infrastructural facilities, particularly in Killybegs which is one of our major fishery centres in which a large number of jobs are provided, but one has to be realistic.  I now have to find the money because of the failure of the party to which the Deputy belongs to <Col N="60" /> recognise the needs of these fishery centres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but when the Minister's predecessor went to Killybegs &mdash; it was he who launched the <i>Veronica</i>&mdash; he echoed the same sentiments. It is a disgrace that our premier port has been neglected.  Will the Minister be able to persuade the two men sitting to his right to provide emergency Exchequer funding?  There is no point waiting for European funding as it will take far too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reviewing the operational programme to see what can be done to provide additional funding for fishery harbours.  It will be necessary to extend the piers by a further 400-500 metres in the interests of safety.  They were designed to cater for vessels of up to 1,000 tonnes, but were being used by vessels of up to 8,000 tonnes.  The Deputy has made her case which I fully accept.  I will do my utmost to secure additional funding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>In my contribution last week I welcomed the attempt to tie up loose ends in terms of electoral procedures. However, the basic problems with our electoral system remain unresolved. I hope as politicians we will accept that our current electoral system is not the best one for the 1990s and beyond.  I am glad a committee is in place to deal with constitutional issues and I hope it will consider the electoral system with a view to changing it.  Considering the large volume of work that must be undertaken by Deputies as well as Ministers, the present system, while it may provide for continual contact with our constituents, does not allow sufficient time to seriously address the wider problems.  I hope this will be considered in future years.</P>
      <P>I reiterate my welcome for State funding of political parties.  Church gate collections are an unsatisfactory way of collecting money.  As an elected representative I found it demeaning to have to stand with supporters at church gates literally begging for money.  That is not the way political parties should be funded and I hope that trend will be changed as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much comment in the media about the prospect of the taxpayer funding political parties.  We should not ignore the fact that a price must be paid for democracy, and it was paid by those who fought for freedom in this and other countries.  As politicians we should be willing to spend money on the development of political parties and politics, which is about forming Governments and formulating policies to develop a country.  We should not be apologetic in seeking the maximum possible funding to allow us to do our job properly.  When we compare politics throughout Europe and worldwide with politics in Ireland, we <Col N="194" /> are a second rate country in terms of funding for research facilities and so on.</P>
    <P>I concur with the remarks of a number of my colleagues last week on the lack of facilities for Members, particularly backbench Members.  We are expected to work with the assistance of only one secretary while people in other parliaments and other sectors of the community with a similar volume of work have the assistance of five or six people.  One cannot work properly without sufficient resources.  I am disappointed that politicians are the last to speak up for themselves.  We have the notion that seeking extra facilities, staffing and resources will be sneered at and frowned upon by the electorate.  Rather than take that attitude we should ensure we put in place the necessary facilities, particularly research facilities, staffing and resources to do the job properly.</P>
    <P>The level of support available particularly to backbench Deputies is insufficient and urgently needs to be improved.  Perhaps that is not central to this legislation but when dealing with funding of political parties we should not ignore the fact that the majority of Deputies receive inadequate funding for political campaigns.  We also have inadequate staffing in this House and in constituency offices.  I hope progress will be made in that regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the improved provision for postal voting but I hope the most recent changes to electoral law will apply to the disabled, elderly and infirm who at present have to register in October of each year whereas the average elector is in a position to have his or her name added to the electoral list up to seven or eight days before an election.  I hope the Minister will be able to address that because postal voting has improved things for many people but it needs to be extended and I look forward to his response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is welcome, particularly the provision regarding public funding of political parties.  There is a public perception that political parties are funded by dubious means and <Col N="195" /> that corporate money is put into political parties.  People may get the impression, however, that under the provisions of this Bill political parties will be funded from public funds.  I do not think that was ever the intention of the legislation and the Minister referred to this point during his Second Stage speech.  The provisions under this Bill will supplement income from other sources.  It is well known that Fianna Fáil as well as other parties have always held a national collection, house to house or at the church gate, in rural areas.  It is a test of an organisation to carry out that collection and I hope it will always continue.  We may create the impression that the problems of funding political parties will end when this legislation is enacted.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the major disadvantage political parties are at when dealing with employer and farming organisations or any lobby group which have resources at their disposal.  I concur with him and I am glad that we will rectify it.  I hope the money will be used for research and office facilities, to which the previous Deputy referred.  I tabled a question earlier in the year on office facilities.  I know that the Office of Public Works and various Ministers of State in that Department had plans to develop what is known as the fisheries yard but that proposal seems to have gone by the board and there is a proposal to have research facilities and offices in Agriculture House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent elections a great deal of money was spent on election literature and television broadcasts but less and less is being spent on posters.  That is probably a good thing.  Unfortunately we seem to go to extremes when implementing reforms of the electoral system.  At one time there were complaints that one could not get into the polling station because there were so many party personnel with their caravans and posters but at the last election the opposite was the case.  When the then Government &mdash; and my own party was involved &mdash; introduced regulations <Col N="196" /> specifying that posters and personnel should be at a distance of 100 metres from the polling station it was widely welcomed but in rural Ireland, where polling stations change quite regularly, sometimes people do not know where they are, whereas in the past it was obvious from the posters.  Every party and independent candidate should be entitled to display one poster outside of a polling station as this is very much part of a rural election campaign.  I do not believe in an excessive display of posters and in my 20 years in politics, apart from the time I was involved in the by-election I never had an individual poster but always a party ticket poster. It probably had stood to us as a party. It is disappointing when people do not see evidence of an election taking place and I hope we will not be so extreme as to ban posters in future.</P>
    <P>It is important that people should be able to vote at their nearest polling station.  I know of constituents in County Galway who have to travel 14 or 15 miles to their designated polling station, passing two or three polling stations on the way.  That matter should be resolved and it would be quite easy for local councillors and corporation members to sort that out with the county registrar.</P>
    <P>There were proposals that there should be a minimum number of electors for each polling station.  One suggestion was 1,000 votes per polling station but that would be disastrous in rural areas.  In Connemara, where the population is very scattered, people would have to drive long distances to a polling station if such a proposal were introduced.  The present position of 200 to 300 voters per polling station is adequate and should be continued.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to simplifying the register, particularly for those who work away from home such as fishermen, transport workers and people on business.  I welcome that but I cannot understand why he did not refer in the same way to the special voters' list compiled every year, in County Galway the application has to be received before 25 <Col N="197" /> November each year.  This is bureaucratic because not only do people on the special voters' list have to apply each year for inclusion, they are visited by a special presiding officer accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána at election time.  I do not see the need for two people to call on a person with a disability when he is casting his vote. The Minister said that those working away from home can go into the Garda station and need only one person to witness them casting the vote whereas a disabled person has to submit a doctor's certificate with his application each year to get on the special voters' register and two persons have to call on him to enable him to cast his vote.  Has the Minister any proposals to change such a bureaucratic approach?  I have heard disabled people say in the past that they were frightened out of their wits when they saw a garda come to their house. That does not surprise me.  There must be simpler ways of dealing with the special voters list.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the commission dealing with constituency revision will be an independent one.  We should examine the system in other European countries.  In Germany, for example, there is a combination of the list system and the single seat transferable vote.  In the past Fianna Fáil proposed the introduction of the single seat constituency but, with hindsight, they have realised that they were wrong and that this would not have meant a single transferable vote.  The Germany system has much to recommend it, particularly in the case of a constituency like my neighbouring one of West Galway which has five Deputies.  From the town of Gort to the Aran Islands is a huge area and there is much duplication with five Deputies travelling to many meetings throughout a huge stretch of the county.  The German system, combining the list system and single seats, would result in a better balance.  Within constituencies where there is competition personality cults build up, and these are, unfortunately, very much <Col N="198" /> hyped up by the media.  It is a matter of humorous comment in this House that certain Deputies are competing for a small number of votes in a certain area. We should examine the electoral system from that point of view.  I welcome the fact that independent candidates will also get some funding and I look forward to hearing details from the Minister.</P>
    <P>The question of automation is covered in the Bill.  I hope to see the introduction of computerisation soon because of the serious delays in reaching decisions at electoral centres not only when there is a need for a recount but where two candidates in a three seat constituency are elected on the first count and it takes hours to elect the third.  The main reason for the delays relates to the distribution of surplus votes.  It would be a relief to every candidate in an election if counting were computerised and could begin as soon as the ballot boxes were closed.</P>
    <P>Most parties would agree that they had bigger meetings and better rallies when there was a question of getting small subscriptions from members.  In the case of trade unions, membership fees are deducted at source, so there is not the same involvement as there used to be.  The same is true of political parties.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister did not refer to the question of student votes.  Student voting could be facilitated if, as I have advocated on a number of occasions, we held elections at weekends.  The fact that the divorce referendum will be held on a Friday is a welcome move in the direction of Friday or weekend voting at elections.  It will give students whose names are on the register of electors the opportunity to vote.  Students' names are often removed from the register on the assumption that they will be included in the electoral register in the area where they are studying.  However, that does not happen so they should be allowed to remain on the register in their own town or village.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="199" /> Next year we are to have a referendum with a view to allowing three Senators to be elected by emigrants.  I note that the Minister has put no limit on expenditure for Seanad elections. This is interesting because the election of Senators by emigrants could involve a lot of money.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us when the referendum will be held, and when he will initiate a debate on the matter.  It has been suggested that there be Senators to represent Australia, America and Europe.  That would be very nice if it worked, but without a debate we can have no idea how it would work in practice.</P>

      <P>What about Ireland?  Is there anything to prevent an Irish person representing emigrants?  How can we say that we will have a Senator representing three of the five continents?  I hope we can have a debate on that soon. I would prefer if emigrants were allowed to continue to vote in elections for a number of years subsequent to emigrating.  However, that does not seem to be the decision of the Government. It wants emigrants to be represented in the Seanad.  That is not what the emigrant groups want.  They would prefer to have a vote in general elections.</P>
      <P>Regarding expenditure on Seanad elections, what would be the cost of bringing the elected Senators home to sit in the Seanad?  We would be faced with a very large bill if they were to travel each week to attend meetings of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding funding, the Minister mentioned that there should be an election agent for the party and an election agent for each candidate.  I suggest that that agent would have to be an accountant. Given that money will be given to parties and to candidates, double accounting will be necessary and it will be very difficult to work out the aggregate amounts.  During an election in Northern Ireland Dr. Joe Hendron was <Col N="200" /> challenged in the courts.  He won the case, but at a huge financial cost to himself. Will we face such a situation?  The accounting will be further complicated by the fact that advertisements placed by friends of candidates will also be included in the aggregate.  That will cause major complications.  I hope it does not give rise to court cases, as happened in the North under similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and its provisions on party funding, whether in respect of headquarters or for research purposes but, as the Minister is aware, such funding will be only in addition to what parties must obtain from their resources.</P>

      <P>It should be as clear as night follows day that Democratic Left support the Bill.  It will do much to bring us into line with mainstream European democracies.  Members are familiar with the slogan, &ldquo;he who pays the piper, calls the tune&rdquo; and in a democracy taxpayers and voters, rather than big businesses and vested interests, should call the political tune.

Deputy Kitt stated that Fianna Fáil, like other political parties, does the democratic thing and holds national collections once a year, the implication being that it is the sole source of its funding and I am sure, like all political parties, such funding contributes significantly to the coffers of Fianna Fáil.  We must have a level playing pitch.</P>
      <P>In a debate such as this, one cannot help but recall the close relationship in the past between Fianna Fáil and business organisations under the title Taca.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="201" /> The Bill will go a long way towards distancing political parties from what would appear to be the undue influence of certain sectors.  While it may be dying out, there was a perception in the past that the building industry was the Fianna Fáil business machine and that all building work was carried out by builders who supported Fianna Fáil. When a political party is linked to an industrial base, such as the building industry, it can be implied that the public is being bypassed and that private house building is grant-aided only to satisfy the demands of the Construction Industry Federation.  Because of the funding the Labour Party gets from the trade union movement, it could be implied that the public who elected its members are not being fully represented and that another group is directing the policy of the party.  Similarly, there is a perception that Fine Gael is funded to a large extent by large farmers.  I hope the Bill levels the playing field.  It is interesting that as we debate this Bill people such as Willie Claes of NATO appears to be having great difficulty explaining how money from contracts for the purchase of helicopters may have been diverted to his political forces in Belgium.</P>
    <P>Together with the Ethics in Public Office Bill, this Bill will ensure that politicians are no longer open to charges, often unsubstantiated, of undue influence having being exerted on them by vested interests.  I hope once and for all it will dispel the suspicions of a brown paper bag culture and that it will also ensure that those who contest elections, as far as possible, do so on a level financial playing field.  In a proportional representational system the financial playing field can be particularly bumpy.  I am not arguing against the merits of proportional representation.  On the contrary, our electoral system has served us extremely well and survived two assassination-like attempts by Fianna Fáil in the past which, in its perpetual search for that elusive overall majority, cast wistful glances at the first-past-the-post system that operates in the United <Col N="202" /> Kingdom.  Deputies Dempsey and Hughes implied that we should consider such an electoral system.  Proportional representation best represents our diverse electorate and if a proposal to change the system was put before the people for a third time it would again be rejected.</P>
    <P>Smaller parties such as the Independents, while elected under the proportional representational system, generally struggle on the financial sidelines. This is particularly true of Democratic Left who refused to jump on board the commercial gravy train of big businesses which, while in the short-term proved lucrative for many parties in the past, compromises both the policies and principles of political parties.  The Bill will help reverse this imbalance and ensure that those elected by the people have the financial wherewithal to exercise their mandate and to put forward the views they were elected to express. The legislation consolidates our democracy.</P>
    <P>The Bill is two-pronged.  As well as providing for the funding of political parties, election expenditure will be capped, something which the public and many Members will welcome.  It would be interesting to know the cost involved in producing the tonnes of literature distributed outside polling stations on polling days in the past.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that a lengthy lead-in time to elections is not provided for under the Bill and that there are no provisions to regulate electioneering accessories, such as private opinion polls.  Congressmen and senators in the United States rent huge billboards to display their photographs as they smilingly welcome people to their respective states.  Is there a provision in the Bill to prohibit such activity here which might not necessarily take place in the run-up to an election but would constitute ongoing expenditure?</P>
    <P>I would also like to know how we can control unfair competition between myself and other colleagues in my constituency, who are quite wealthy and who can afford to place substantial <Col N="203" /> advertisements in the local papers.  They go around advertising the fact that they have the money available to sponsor the local football team and are quite happy to buy the team's kit, provided it has the individual's name displayed.  There are many examples of where politicians can circumvent the legislation.  Perhaps the Minister, in her response, will explain how we can overcome this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the publication of this legislation.  I believe it is a balanced and well thought out instrument which will ensure that those elected will serve the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleagues, I also welcome this Bill and pledge wholehearted support for it.  It is one of the most important electoral Bills to come before the House in recent times. It includes measures that are central not only to the Irish democratic process but to democracy in any country.  The main objective of the Bill is to reform and improve the political environment within which every political party and elected representative must operate. The Bill aims at ensuring that more information will be readily available to the general public, which will hopefully dispel the prevailing cynicism and distrust that exists in relation to the operation of the political system.  The Bill also aims at facilitating the integration of the general public into public life. This can only be a good thing for the political system in particular and society in general.  The multifaceted approach of this Bill breaks new ground, sets new standards and procedures and, as the Minister of State said in her opening comments, will stimulate an important debate about democracy.  It goes hand in hand with the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, which will be coming fully into operation shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statutory basis for an independent constituency commission is a step which will hopefully eradicate any hint of gerrymandering from the political system.  The Bill provides that, on the publication of a census report following <Col N="204" /> each census of population, a commission will be established to review the constituencies for Dáil and European Parliament elections.  It is unfortunate that the claim of gerrymandering has arisen in the past and has caused much discontent among the electorate.  We, as Members of this House, have an obligation as democratically elected public representatives to reform those aspects of the political system that gave rise to claims of gerrymandering.  I often wonder why, in my own constituency, the coherent district of Coolock, which is my Dublin City Council ward, has been divided between two constituencies for the past 25 years and more.  I have often wondered why a coherent area should be divided.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill concerning payments to each political party will also contribute significantly to the political and democratic process.  This is the central core of the Bill and is made up of three interrelated aspects: public funding of political parties, disclosure of significant donations and control of election expenditure.  While the funding of political parties may seem unreasonable to many people, it is only by ensuring diversity within the political system that choice can be ensured.  The main objective of this provision is to facilitate this choice, which is central to the maintenance of democracy.  It is only as a result of political diversity that the electorate is able to choose the Government it wishes.</P>
    <P>I welcome, for the reason outlined by others, the basic element of funding, which works out at approximately £1 per voter and I recommend that the Minister look at the provision of 10 per cent for Opposition parties on top of that amount.  That is something we could look at in a more generous spirit, since many of us or our parties have spent time in Opposition.  Politics is an expensive business and the costs are constantly rising.  All parties have tried desperately to involve themselves in so many areas.  Fundraising can be a timeconsuming and exhausting business.  I welcome the provision of funding and <Col N="205" /> the special provision for the training and education of youth and women.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party are proud of the fact that we have consistently brought forward women public representatives, members of branches and constituencies at all levels.  I hope that our target will be to achieve representation similar to that in Sweden, where 43 per cent of MPs are women.  My own party also has an active youth section and has produced some outstanding candidates and Members.  I hope that is another area we will also be able to develop with proper funding.  It is no accident of course that so many other countries &mdash; the Scandinavian countries, the United States, France, Belgium and Canada &mdash; have had public funding of political parties for many years and have rightly recognised political parties as the workhorses of democracy.</P>
    <P>We have seen in recent years how all parties have been burdened with debt. The conservative parties, in particular, have run up enormous debts.  My own party has had a much tighter financial and auditing system, mainly because we have been able to spend so little over the years on elections and political activities, by comparison with the larger conservative parties.  In general, I welcome that major provision.</P>
    <P>Suspicion also surrounds the practice of confidentiality in political contributions and this has led to claims that contributions are being made to influence political decisions.  We must create an atmosphere in this House whereby no political party or politician would be seen to be for sale.  The best and fairest way of doing that is by the provisions in the Bill relating to disclosure of political donations.  While I question the veracity of claims of corruption, I consider it important that we eradicate the suspicion. As long as it exists in the public consciousness we, as public representatives, will never to be free to undertake any measure without being under severe scrutiny and subject to claims of acting for less than honest motives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="206" /> The rationale of these measures is illustrated in the fact that the Bill preserves the right to privacy of persons who may wish to make relatively modest contributions to the parties and candidates with whose policies they are in agreement.  There has been worry in the past in relation to political contributions to the major conservative parties.  There has been reference to the fact that an important politician in the Opposition has accommodation provided to him by supporters.  It is areas like that which give concern.</P>
    <P>There has been, thoughtout the decades, a feeling that Fianna Fáil, in particular, behaved in some respects like the old Russian Communist Party. It had its apparatchiks throughout the private sector and was able to call on them at times of election and when funding was necessary.  The provision limiting election expenditure is a practical measure.  The electorate today is highly educated and well informed and any attempt to influence the electorate through excessive spending is an insult to its intelligence.  The amount generally the Minister has provided for in this Bill is appropriate.  Many speakers have said that huge spending at elections can be ineffective yet my experience is that this is not the case.  During the last election, gigantic posters of the present leader of Fianna Fáil appeared in the constituency of Dublin Central and of Mr. Seán Haughey in Dublin North-Central.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>And life-size posters of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>In Dublin North-Central, there were cars with expensive video with sound systems promoting Fianna Fáil candidates.  I often wonder how much money was spent.  In the 1989, when I was first a candidate, it was alleged that £150,000 was spent by Fianna Fáil in my constituency.  The measure before the House will hopefully end this type of expenditure forever. These are examples where massive <Col N="207" /> spending on posters and so on can actually make an impact.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne raised an interesting point in relation to when the election period will begin.  There could be massive spending outside of election time and maybe not so much in it.  That is something the Minister should examine carefully.  I understand there was reference to a Member of Parliament, Mr. Joe Hendron, in this regard and our Northern colleagues, who have been in Dublin over the past year, have told us of the difficulties they can have at times in funding themselves throughout the election period.  I hope that is something to which the Minister will give some attention.</P>
      <P>There is also a reference to the fact that writing for newspapers and appearing on television fairly regularly can be an important benefit to candidates and would-be candidates.  Although it cannot be included in the Bill this is a grey area so I wonder what the scenario will be.  Some people write for papers and appear on television more regularly than others.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the provision for special arrangements to allow transport workers, fishermen and others to vote.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies referred to other areas they would like the Minister to examine, and I support those who said backbench Deputies' facilities are still in the 19th century.  Our job is still treated as a low paid and poorly resourced occupation.  According to the State Directory ambassadors are paid £80,000 per annum yet, while we have a far harder job, our salaries and expenses are only 40 per cent of that figure.  I often wonder how it is decided that certain State employees should get massive salaries while people like us &mdash; who are the workhorses of democracy, as one of my colleagues said &mdash; are so badly resourced.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I also welcome the measures to enforce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the <Col N="208" /> opportunity to make some observations on the Electoral Bill, 1994, especially those aspects relating to payments to political parties; the provision of voting arrangements for those who because of their occupation are unable to vote; and the establishment of a commission. It is unlikely that Cavan-Monaghan will figure in any constituency revision for a long time to come.  It will remain a five seat constituency for many years because there has been little variation in population from one census to another.  Since the heavy emigration of the late 1940s and 1950s the population has levelled off and it will probably remain static.</P>
      <P>I feel strongly about the multi-seat constituency system.  In five-seater constituencies many people do the circuit, raising their problems with most of the five elected representatives.  Government Departments, health boards, county councils and State boards have to send a huge number of replies to elected representatives because of this duplication.  It would be interesting to know how many of the five Deputies in such a constituency would have had representations made to them on a particular problem.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of the single seat transferable vote system and I hope that some political party will grasp the nettle in the future.  In the 1960s I remember discussing the single seat constituency system with the then Minister for Local Government, Kevin Boland, in the Westenra Hotel in Monaghan.  We saw the single seat system in operation across the Border in Northern Ireland where bits of constituencies were altered to ensure that one party would have the lion's share of seats.  We tried to impress on Deputy Boland the advisability of considering the single seat transferable vote system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>European Parliament constituencies were also mentioned.  There are eight counties in the constituency of Connacht-Ulster, a fact that is criticised especially around convention election time in the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan. It would be hard for a candidate <Col N="209" /> from those two counties ever to win a seat in the European Parliament because most of the population, and consequently the voting strength, is in the western part of that Euro constituency. Having said that, Fianna Fáil is pleased with the high level of representation if gets at that level.  I could not think of another constituency that is better serviced than we are with advance notifications of measures coming up in the European Parliament as well as details of all schemes.  We are getting a continuous flow of information.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal for payments to political parties although I suppose very little of this funding will ever reach the local constituency organisations. They will, however, be relieved of the obligation to raise funding for the party at national level, so it will be a help.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed by the last two speakers who used their time to have a go at Fianna Fáil.  It is very petty of Deputy Broughan to criticise Fianna Fáil and then make a token criticism of Fine Gael and Labour.  That type of muck spreading does not help politics or politicians.  I fought my first election for Fianna Fáil in 1948 and having been involved in the organisation since then, I count myself as decent and honourable as 90 per cent of the people in my constituency. As a Fianna Fáil member I do not like to hear people attacking the party about alleged links with big business. If big business was paying such substantial funds to Fianna Fáil we would not have been in debt.</P>
    <P>One continuously hears that type of criticism but the answer was given in the opinion polls last week when 50 per cent of those polled supported Fianna Fáil, while only 10 per cent were for Labour and a small percentage for Democratic Left.  I suppose this annoys the critics and so they come back with empty arguments. Fianna Fáil did not have presses to print money nor did the party receive millions of pounds from the Soviet Union or anywhere else.  That is my answer to people who make unfounded allegations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="210" /> Political parties are very important to the democratic system but it takes massive funding to keep them going.  It is very important for parties, especially Opposition parties to have such funding because they come up with alternative policies.  Such policy formulation is important because a good Opposition ensures a good Government.  One cannot have a reasonable Government without a strong Opposition.</P>
    <P>Contributions to political parties have been mentioned and over the past number of years the finger of criticism has been pointed at industrialists.  In future industralists will be very slow to contribute to election funds because it is almost certain that if they do their action will be misconstrued.  For that reason it is essential that funding be made available.</P>
    <P>Future political parties will be in a better position as far as expenditure is concerned because they will know what their budget is and will be able to determine their outlay accordingly.  Political parties in many constituencies spend valuable time discussing fund raising methods and pursuing every penny they can.  This Bill is welcome in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that women and young people should be positively encouraged in politics.  He also said that the amount spent in those areas would be left to the parties' judgment, but that the decision would be open to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>Fewer contributions will be made to political parties in future, so there will be less need for disclosure.  Individuals will not be allowed to go on spending sprees because of the limitation on expenditure.  There is always a strict budget in rural constituencies where money is not easily found.  I cannot see any problem as regards living within the budget mentioned in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker said that personnel, posters and amplification would not be allowed in the vicinity of polling stations.  I saw the tactics used at polling stations in the 1980s and, coming from a Border region, I am not sorry that people will not be allowed near them in <Col N="211" /> future.  The Minister should examine the possibility of allowing one hoarding per political party which would identify the polling station as there should be some form of identification at polling stations to tell people that an election is taking place.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the limit for constituencies is £25,000.  He also said that £10,000 could be spent in a three seat constituency, £12,000 in a four seat constituency and £15,000 in a five seat constituency.  In the constituency I represent, we are able to live within the figures and we would have no problem with accountants bringing us to task for overspending.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum mentions persons who are unable to vote at polling stations.  It states:</P>
    <P>Electors in this situation may apply for entry in the postal voters' list. Application for entry in the list will be made at the time of preparation of the register of electors.  Applications must be supported by a certificate from the employer, in the case of an employed person, and by a statutory declaration in any other case.</P>
    <P>This provision will affect long distance lorry drivers.  These people change employers regularly and, therefore, if they are registered with one employer I hope their papers will be transferred if they change employer.  They are most in need of this provision.</P>
    <P>An incapacitated voter, or someone on his behalf, must make the application each year in October.  However, an election could be held every nine or ten months.  Incapacitated voters should be dealt with in the same way as those omitted from the register.  If people are omitted from the register because of a clerical error, they can register a short time before the election and that should also be the case for incapacitated voters. If people are mobile, they will insist on casting their vote rather than allowing someone to complete the forms for the postal vote.  Perhaps the Minister would set a deadline of a month before an <Col N="212" /> election for an incapacitated voter to apply for the postal vote.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies mentioned the lack of research facilities for backbenchers.  A few years ago a Fine Gael Minister said that backbenchers worked from prepared scripts.  I have been in this House for 22 years and I never had a script prepared for me, nor do I see any hope of getting one.  I would be looked at if I asked for one in the press office. Research facilities, including those in the Library, should be improved because we have less time to research material for contributions in the House. This means we must become more professional individually and at party level to keep pace.  I should like the Minister to re-examine the facilities for incapacitated voters and of postal voting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which demonstrates that at last we are doing something about State funding of political parties.  However, in taking these modest measures, we are no great pioneers or trail blazers in facilitating the work of political parties or our democratic structures; rather we are simply following established practice in most other democracies, particularly the newer ones.  Indeed, our tardiness in taking this essential step merely reflects our cowardice as legislators in introducing conditions and facilities to enable us properly undertake the work for which we were elected.</P>
      <P>Whenever it came to the provision of reasonable conditions and facilities for ourselves in the past, always we backed off or, at the very best, passed the buck to someone else, not through any high motives but rather through fear of what the electorate might think of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of funding for political parties, to a significant extent, will remove the fund-raising imperative that has continuously dominated the activities of most of our political parties from their foundations, clearly to be seen from any reading of the minutes of parties in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s when fund raising always was the dominant feature.  It is particularly important that <Col N="213" /> the provisions of this Bill will remove a demeaning aspect of politics for Members of this House and, more important, will remove a compromising aspect of politics.</P>
    <P>I am not talking about church gate collections which, after Mass, can be an interesting social occasion for everybody. I am not talking about the occasional, modest raffle but about the soliciting of the big bucks now required continuously to run a political party and mount any meaningful election campaign.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that much of the funds coming to political parties emanate from their loyal supporters, people who want a party to succeed and prosper because of their belief in its policies, perhaps through inherited allegiance, or for a variety of reasons such as belief in a particular candidate being someone who will make a contribution at national or constituency level.  Nonetheless it must be admitted that some funding comes from people with an alternative, if unstated, agenda of hoping to influence decision-making.</P>
    <P>Political parties always have been in what I would regard as a very vulnerable financial position, the stark reality to date being that most could not function properly, or at all, without the substantial backing of people and organisations beyond their own fold.  This Bill will put in place at least a basic resource to enable a modern party to survive and do its work without undue dependence on outside contributions.  As with many other aspects of political life, on the question of funding, perception often is as important, if not more so, than the reality.  Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that no political party be seen to be beholden to any group of organisations or individuals for its financing.  There is a perception abroad that big backers are rewarded in some way, which has done a major disservice to politicians generally and their standing with the electorate.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill encompass a measure of public funding for political parties, affording them some financial <Col N="214" /> independence and will go some way to altering the perception to which I have just referred, as will the other elements of the integrated package the Minister has introduced, such as the requirement to disclose significant political contributions and limits on election spending.</P>
    <P>We must remember that the cost of recent elections to most political parties has been shattering.  In the course of the 1981 general election it was my duty to introduce a budget for the promotion, publicity and public relations exercise of my party which subsequently was seven times greater than the entire expenditure of my party in the 1977 election. That demonstrates how costs have escalated in the current competitive climate, much of which comes to the surface at election time when, in the heat of battle, very wise financial constraints decided in advance are thrown out the window with colossal sums of money being spent.  The limit on spending provided for in this Bill should control that aspect of electioneering without diminishing in any significant way the effectiveness of any campaign or damaging our democratic system.</P>
    <P>The electorate will understand the need for and the very positive aspect enshrined in this State funding of political parties, designed &mdash; as the Minister of State pointed out &mdash; to supplement their income from other sources.  I believe the public will also welcome the requirement to disclose the sources of substantial donations.  There need be no fear that the new arrangements would lead to even the remotest degree of State control over the independence and policies of political parties.  The requirement of parties to indicate the extent of their expenditure in order to encourage participation by women and young persons in political activity will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to monitor.  Any party seeking to make progress on its aims must concentrate on those elements.  Therefore, there might well be more to be gained in the long run from leaving this aspect of funding voluntary rather than seeking <Col N="215" /> any degree of compulsory allocation of funds for such specific purposes.</P>
    <P>On the disclosure of political donations, I hope the system will not become too top-heavy or bureaucratic which could become an administrative nightmare and lead to a morass of disputes. In this respect well thought out regulations must be enforced, something that will need to be fully teased out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the statutory establishment of an independent constituency commission to handle the revision of Dáil and European Parliament constituencies following each successive census, thus rendering permanent the type of commission that handled the more recent constituency revisions.  It did a good job by and large.  However, I will never understand how sensible, eminent people like those who served on that commission introduced the constituency of Longford-Roscommon into the Irish political landscape thereby crossing the great natural boundary of the Shannon, crossing provincial boundaries, the European constituency boundaries and, if one reverts to ancient times, crossing the strongholds of rival chieftains.  However, whatever aberrations that commission membership may have had, it has to be said its revision was a major improvement on the days of moving quotas in the Custom House, presided over by the incumbent Minister for Local Government, with the census report in one hand and tally sheets in the other.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State also said it was his intention to speed up general election counts.  I am glad he is taking on that task, the best and simplest way of doing so being to begin the count at midnight on the night of an election. There is no reason to continue as though the ballot boxes were being brought to counting centres by horse and cart.  What is wrong with beginning the count at midnight, as is the case in most other democracies, immediately <Col N="216" /> after balloting has ceased and the ballot boxes have been received?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has also told us that at some future date voting and counting at elections will be fully automated but stated, realistically, that is some distance way.  Why?  We have the expertise to design and provide the necessary programmes and technology. I do not believe it would be excessively expensive.  The Minister for the Environment should pursue that, we have a good name &mdash; Howlin &mdash; for the machines on the counters.  In the meantime he should give instructions and necessary funding to returning officers to ensure that there is adequate space at count centres for party activists who have devoted their time to knocking on doors during the three or four weeks in the run-up to an election, to gain admission to see the fruits of their labours.  It is regrettable that candidates cannot oblige their canvassers by providing them with tickets to gain admission to counts because the centres are too small.  We accept there must be movement and that returning officers must do their work but they should be given instructions.  If they were given the necessary funding they would be pleased to provide enough space to accommodate everybody.</P>
    <P>Although it is probably a matter for another day I was disappointed that the Minister did not apply himself to the possibility of a fixed Dáil term.  I suppose the present one is as near as we will get to a fixed term, but it is a matter we should examine.  It could be introduced by way of minor constitutional amendments.</P>
    <P>I have been a great supporter of the PR system and the multi-seat constituency on the grounds that, to an exceptional extent, it returns parties in proportion to the support they receive from the people.  In that regard, it is the best system anywhere in the world. However, it has its drawbacks, a major one being because of multi-seat constituencies and the pressures to which they give rise, Ministers charged with running major Departments must spend <Col N="217" /> at least 60 per cent of their time on constituency work, otherwise they will not be re-elected.  There is no point in being a great Minister if one is not prepared to carry out constituency work.  It is important to examine our electoral system. My preference is for a system like the German one where half the candidates are elected under a PR system from constituencies and the other half elected through a list system.  If such a system were introduced here, half the Deputies in the Dáil would not have particular obligations to constituencies and could devote all their time to their work as legislators, the basic work of a TD.  That might give inordinate power to parties, but so be it.  It would be preferable and an advance on the present system.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope it is only the beginning in terms of Members of the Oireachtas providing proper facilities for themselves, such as the provision of a constituency secretary as well as a Dáil secretary, to carry out the work for which they were elected.  That is a basic service Members have not provided for themselves, they do not have the courage to do so for fear of what the public would say about it.  Deputies need such basic services and proper research facilities. What Opposition Deputy has had the luxury &mdash; it should not be a luxury &mdash; or the opportunity of properly researching a speech in this House unless it was carried out by a Department. I have been a Member of this House for 14 or 15 years and I had an opportunity and the facility on only one occasion to carry out research on a speech with which I was satisfied and proud.  We should provide ourselves with such facilities and pay TDs a salary appropriate to their work and responsibilities. If we fail to do that, we will also fail to attract into politics and this House the talent that it needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I note Deputy Nealon's point regarding the facilities given to Government and Opposition backbenchers. <Col N="218" /> Opposition Deputies who do not have vast resources on which to draw are unable to employ research assistants and Deputies who wish to retain their seats in the next election must devote the majority of their time to important constituency work.  However, more time and facilities should be available to Deputies to carry out the necessary research to assist them in making meaningful contributions in the House.  During the past number of years facilities have improved and there will be further improvements.  A comparison of the facilities available to members of parliaments throughout Europe and elsewhere reveals how far behind we are in that regard.  I understand there are Government plans to improve the information network and to install an internet on computers within the Dáil.  That would facilitate Deputies in carrying out research to enable them to make more detailed contributions to the debate which has not been the case in the past.</P>
      <P>This Bill refers to electoral reform.  It has five main purposes including the establishment, on a statutory basis, of a commission to revise Dáil and European Parliament constituencies; to provide for payments to political parties; to provide for the disclosure of substantial donations received by political parties, Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and the European Parliament and candidates at elections; the imposition of limits on election expenditure by political parties and candidates and voting arrangements for persons unable, by reason of their occupation, to vote at their polling stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of an independent constituency commission has been accepted by all parties for some time.  The arrangements in place have also been accepted and have worked well since the first constituency commission was put in place.  Nobody has argued about the current procedures although a number of people, with justification, have argued strongly about the results of various reports.  The main questions that have arisen relate to drawing and <Col N="219" /> redrawing boundaries.  As many speakers mentioned, especially those representing constituencies in the west, the redrawing of provincial and county boundaries does not make sense.  Did those who sat on constituency commissions consider the impact of their decisions at ground level?</P>
    <P>Deputies in the west and in the midlands find it nonsensical that constituencies cross the Shannon in different counties and provincial areas.  We should look at how this affects people rather than at statistical returns.  My constituency has not been revised since 1977.  On the last occasion I had hoped to get back some of my hinterland, which is classed as part of Cork city but, in reality, is part of east Cork, a rural area.  The commission did not see fit to do as I wished.  It is right to set up an independent commission enshrined in law, otherwise, there could be a recurrence of the gerrymandering which backfired badly in 1977.  If the Minister wants to argue that this legislation will ensure the independence of the constituency commission he will have to alter the Bill.  If this commission is to be independent, why should it have to wait until the Minister signs an order to allow it to function after each census? A Minister might, for political reasons, delay the commencement order for such a commission.  When the report is made, it is up to the Government to draw up the legislation to give effect to recommendations. Political considerations could lead to unnecessary delays.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to ensure the independence of the commission, surely its composition should reflect this.  Logic requires that public servants, rather than the Government, should decide its membership.  We already have precedents for taking this approach in the Public Offices Commission, established under the Ethics in Public Office Act, and in the <i>ad hoc</i> commission on the divorce referendum.  To copperfasten independence, it is surely also essential that the secretariat should be independent. It is noteworthy that members of <Col N="220" /> the Public Offices Commission, in the Ethics in Public Office Act, are explicitly stated to be independent in their functions.  There is no corresponding provision in this Bill and perhaps in reply the Minister would refer to this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision for payments to political parties.  For many years political parties have had great difficulty in funding their activities.  However, the complexities of political activity have increased enormously over the years and there is greater need for a more professional approach.  Information must be up-to-date and it is necessary to have the back-up staff which costs money.  In dealing with the IFA, IBEC, the unions and people in opposition one must have special advisers and qualified researchers.  These people do not come cheap.  An individual, frontbencher of any political party, without the backing of an adequate research team will not achieve anything.</P>
    <P>From where does the money come? In the past it came from church gate collections. Anyone involved in a political party is aware that the church gate collections have fallen considerably.  Compared with 20 years ago, the figures have dropped 50 per cent in volume, not in value.  If inflation is taken into account the figures have reduced by, perhaps, 80 per cent.  The other sources of funding are golf classics, raffles, dances etc.  This goes on year in year out and it tires people out.  It sickens the people from whom the money is being collected since the same people support not only one political party but all political parties.  It is a heavy burden on the community.  The other source, which is referred to in the media, is the big business people who fund all political parties. The inference in many cases is that they will influence Government decisions but I do not believe they do.</P>
    <P>It is important to have confidence in Government.  Confidence in political parties and Government will grow if they are seen not to depend on any outside source.  That is why State funding is important for democracy.  All political parties in Europe, except the UK, are <Col N="221" /> funded by State sources to a large degree.  In the UK, the Tories and the Liberals are supported by business sources and Labour is supported by the unions.  I welcome the provision for funding.  It has come late in the day but it will help to instil confidence in Government.</P>
    <P>The disclosure of donations is a matter about which many peoole have raised questions, particularly the limits of disclosure.  The disclosure threshold proposed for a political party is £4,000 and for individual members and candidates £500.  The suggestion that £5,000 or £4,000 would buy off a political party deserves to be treated with contempt and that is the implication in these figures. If we were talking about £4,000 or £5,000 for an individual and £20,000 or £30,000 for a party there would be some justification for including such figures but the figures in the Bill are ridiculous.</P>
    <P>Donations to branches of parties, officers or members of a party will be deemed to have been made to a party. There are 63 cumainn in my constituency. Every parish has a cumainn and some have two or three.  Will a donation of £10 by a party worker towards the cost of petrol have to be disclosed?  That is the type of question being raised.</P>
    <P>Another question concerns the auditing of returns.  The Bill states that control of expenditure will operate through a system of agents and that an election agent will be responsible for expenditure on behalf of each candidate.  It must be remembered, however, that most election agents are politically astute.  We are in the business of politics when we are running for elections.  Our aim is to get as many votes as possible but my experience has been that votes are not won as a result of major expenditure. Our party spent less than £5,000 on the last five elections in which I ran as a candidate but we managed to win more than 40 per cent of the vote and two seats on those occasions.  I am aware that a large amount of money is spent on elections in other areas but it does not result in a large number of seats being won.  It is suggested that if money <Col N="222" /> is splashed around during an election it will result in gaining more seats but that is not the case.</P>
    <P>The agents involved in making these returns will be thinking in a political rather than a financial way.  Problems will arise in relation to returns and people will be set up with the objective of bringing down somebody who is completely innocent of any misdemeanour but who, through some technical oversight, may get into trouble.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of postal voting for people who are unable, by reason of their occupation, to vote at polling stations.  It is important that this facility be made available to people who genuinely require it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Eric Byrne made derogatory remarks about Fianna Fáil.  We are used to hearing such remarks from Deputy Byrne and I did not expect anything different from him this evening.  He mentioned various aspects of Fianna Fáil fundraising.  Did the founders of Deputy Byrne's party have any novel methods of fundraising?  It would be interesting to hear how they raised their funds in the early days.  Deputy Broughan referred to major expenditure by Fianna Fáil.  He covered himself by referring to &ldquo;alleged&rdquo; expenditure of major amounts.  People only use the word &ldquo;alleged&rdquo; when they are trying to create a smokescreen around what they are saying but they are still throwing the dirt and that is what Deputy Broughan was doing.  What he did not mention, however, was that the first person to bring out a life-size poster during an election campaign was the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, a member of Deputy Broughan's party.  The Deputy should get out of the glasshouse before he starts throwing stones.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, some aspects of which will need to be tightened up on Committee Stage.  I look forward to a further detailed discussion of the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Allen, on this <Col N="223" /> timely Bill.  It is vitally important that a commission be established on a statutory basis to revise Dáil and European Parliament constituencies; provide for payment to political parties; provide for the disclosure of substantial donations received by political party members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and the European Parliament and candidates at other elections; impose limits on election expenditure by political parties and candidates and provide voting arrangements for persons unable, by reason of their occupation, to vote at their respective polling stations.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the rejigging of constituencies that has occurred since the foundation of the State.  For too long constituencies were gerrymandered for political purposes and the time is right for this commission to be established to revise Dáil and European Parliament constituencies.  It is vitally important that constituencies be compact and manageable and not redrawn for the benefit of certain political parties.  It is essential also that rural constituencies be preserved along county boundaries and, as far as possible, the division of these electoral areas should be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to certain divisions of constituencies that occurred during my time as a Member of this House.  Some months following my election to this House in 1981, part of the Beara Peninsula, from Castletownbere to the Dursey Sound, Dursey Island, Eyeries and Ardgroom, was transferred to the South Kerry constituency to enable a certain party to hold two seats in that constituency. I had worked for the people in that area since I entered the political fray in 1960 when I stood in the local election.  I was a raw recruit from the village of Goleen, seven miles from Mizen Head, with nothing behind me other than the Atlantic ocean and the seagulls.  The only bright light behind me was the Fastnet lighthouse which provided me with four votes.  However, progress intervened and the lighthouse was automated, reducing by four the voting strength of the area.  I worked <Col N="224" /> diligently on Cork County Council for the people of that part of Beara for approximately 20 years.  Yet they were denied the right to elect me to this House.  This is a sad reflection of what has happened over the years.</P>
    <P>People who live in densely populated areas do not realise the hardship suffered by politicians who live in remote areas or peninsulas.  The total voting strength in the village of Goleen is 235, which is far short of the quota required for a Dáil seat.  My constituency includes the Mizen Head Peninsula where I was born, the Muntervary Peninsula and the Beara Peninsula, all of which are thinly populated.  As a member of Cork County Council I represent the Schull electoral area which includes those three peninsulas.  Some of the areas I represent on the council are more than 60 miles from where I live, that is Dursey Island and Dursey Sound, while the only town the Schull electoral area can boast of is Bantry.  Many Deputies do not realise the way public representatives labour in rural Ireland and the efforts they make to meet people in thinly populated areas.</P>
    <P>The constituency of Cork South-West embraces those three peninsulas and stretches from Dursey Island on the Beara Peninsula, half way up the Kenmare Estuary to midway between Ardgroom and Kilmakilloge and as far as the tunnel which marks the county boundary between Glengariff and Kenmare. The newly redrawn constituency includes the electoral areas of Ahill and Douce.  My constituency also stretches from the Borlin Valley to the Pass of Keimaneigh, down to Cousane Gap, as far as the outskirts of Dunmanway, across to the village of Ballineen, which is a co-village of Enniskean, and on to Bandon where one follows the Bandon river as far as Inishannon and to within two miles of Cork Airport where one takes a right turn to Belgooly and finally to Kinsale.</P>
    <P>I represent one of the greatest maritime constituencies on this island.  The gerrymandering over the years not only led to the inclusion of the area west of <Col N="225" /> Castletownbere on the western end of the Beara Peninsula in the constituency of south Kerry &mdash; this was to serve a certain purpose &mdash; but it also annexed Borlin, Coomhola, Cappabue and split the little village of Kealkil to gain an extra seat in Cork North-West.  Regardless of how one carves up a constituency the people will not forget their representatives if they are worth anything; it is the people who make the decisions.</P>
    <P>The villages of Ballineen and Enniskean are jointly linked and could be described as a town.  However, while the inhabitants of Ballineen can vote for me or any other candidate who stands in Cork South West the inhabitants of Enniskean are denied that privilege. This clearly shows that the time is right to set up an independent commission to redraft constituencies.  I will not support any future legislation until such time as we have set up a special commission which will ensure that it cannot benefit a certain party.  Regardless of how one looks at it, constituencies should not extend over county boundaries and council electoral areas should not be divided for party political purposes.</P>
    <P>Up to 50 per cent of the Members of this House are also members of local authorities and have served their areas well.  Despite this the people for whom they have worked so hard to have potholes filled, blue cards for cattle issued and medical cards restored, may be denied the right to vote for the candidate of their choice in Dáil elections. That is not the correct formula.  It is clearly evident that certain bodies work against what I have outlined.  I hope under this legislation that this racket will be stamped out in no uncertain terms.</P>
    <P>The time is now right to make payments from the Exchequer to each political party to alleviate, to some extent, the greed and graft in election contests. I welcome the provisions dealing with the disclosure of substantial donations received by political parties, Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, members of the European Parliament and individual candidates at election <Col N="226" /> time.  Will it be possible to monitor the payment of substantial donations from outside the State under the legislation? I have reason to believe that such donations have been forwarded by people residing outside the State to certain individuals to fight elections.  How does the Minister propose to monitor the payment of such subscriptions?  Will it be possible to make them under the cloak of anonymity?</P>
    <P>I was first elected to local government in 1967 seven years after I fought my first political contest.  I have never received any substantial gift from anyone. I walked into Leinster House through the front door on Kildare Street, not by the back door.  I received no favours, such as a Seanad nomination. I relied on the sincerity of the people I represent.  Since I was first elected to this House in 1981 I have been trying to reduce my bank overdraft. I have nothing to hide so far as secret contributions are concerned.</P>
    <P>It is of paramount importance that limits be imposed on election expenditure by political parties and that accounts of such expenditure by each candidate be furnished by election agents after each election.  How does the Minister propose to monitor the payment of donations by individuals residing inside and outside the State if they are still inclined to make subscriptions to their favoured candidates?</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions under which arrangements will be made to facilitate persons unable, by reason of their occupation, to vote at their respective polling stations.  I have been advocating for years that this right should be granted to every person unable to attend their polling station owing to the fact that they are engaged in their work in another part of the country or abroad.  I seek an assurance from the Minister that these arrangements will apply to students attending third level colleges, commercial travellers, bus and lorry drivers, fishermen, people who are ill or confined to hospital and any other section of the community absent from their usual residence on polling day <Col N="227" /> because of work commitments.  It should also be possible for elderly persons already entitled to a postal vote on health grounds to retain this right automatically.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the question of Sunday voting.  I understand this is customary in almost every European country and I see no reason it cannot be introduced here.</P>

      <P>The commission will have a difficult job because, with the best will in the world and with no axe to grind, individual candidates and parties will be discommoded by whatever boundary changes are recommended. The Minister of State was one of the people affected by the most recent changes, probably to his advantage.  It is frustrating for anyone who lives near a county boundary, as Deputy Sheehan and I do, to see people for whom they have worked so hard transferred to another area.</P>
      <P>On the question of constituency size, Deputy Sheehan made his point well in terms of the difficulties encountered by the representatives of south-west Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> Similar difficulties are encountered by the representatives of rural constituencies with no major centres of population where Deputies are expected to be in areas far apart at more or less the same time.  I sympathise with the Deputies who represent County Mayo, none of whom could be expected to provide the kind of service required.  The Deputies who represent County Clare encounter similar difficulties.  They suffered when constituency boundaries were redrawn particularly when, on one occasion Fianna Fáil was not in power, the entire Connemara area stretching up to Clifden was included in North Clare.  It was quite daft.  That would not be possible under the present commission. Nevertheless some difficulties will arise.</P>
    <P>The quality of work carried out by the public representative should be taken into account.  Almost every speaker has stated vehemently that Members are not given the resources to do their job well.  That is especially true as regards research.  Many Deputies said they have seldom come to the House having adequately examined legislation because they do not have the time or resources to do so.  Most Bills update existing legislation and it would be impossible for Members to trace the evolution and development of the legislation without specialist support.  There is no sign that such support will be made available.</P>
    <P>It is a pity we did not take the opportunity to consider the advantages and disadvantages of our electoral system. Our European neighbours use different systems such as the list system in Portugal. One element of it which would concern me is that it gives power to relatively few people in a central position. Nevertheless it would get over some of the difficulties which beset us in our system. There is much support for a single seat constituency system, but there are advantages and disadvantages.  It would be interesting to have an independent commission report to the Dáil on that aspect.</P>
    <P>People who were opposed to improving conditions for Oireachtas Members <Col N="229" /> during the Cork by-election have been converted and are suddenly in favour of improvements for Ministers of State and others.  That was unfashionable ten months ago.</P>
    <P>The status of the secretariat of the commission is unclear.  It should be independent of Government and that may well be the case.  It also seems that the commission is established only when the Minister decides rather than automatically after a new census.  That ought not to be the case.  Since the results of a census could be available nine or ten months before an election there could be a temptation to let the commission's work wait until after the election.  It ought to happen automatically and the commission's decision should be automatically enforced.</P>
    <P>Not many people outside politics understand the role of the permanent secretariat of political parties, the amount of work they do and the costs associated with having them in place. The role of the party is important in this.  The case for payments to political parties should stand alone.  Two provisions in the Bill &mdash; the disclosure of donations and the limit on spending at elections &mdash; appear to be thrown in as a sop to the public as if there were a fear the people would say payments should not be made to political parties and that the bad lads of politics, in this case ourselves, must be adequately controlled.  I have no problem with the principle of control but it will not work.</P>
    <P>As regards the limit above which a donation must be disclosed, it would have been more honest to set a limit and say any donation made above that will be put into a central fund as is the case with some anonymous donations.  Some parties receive quite substantial transfers from trade unions and other sources.  Why would they not be considered in the same light?  I do not know if the principle of disclosure addresses what the people think it ought to address.</P>
    <P>Donations include money, property, goods and services.  Occasionally some of us are fortunate enough to receive <Col N="230" /> the help of professional people.  It seems to be suggested that if such a service were provided free of charge it would not be included under the services provided for in the Bill but it is not clear that is the case.  If such services are made available Members should be encouraged to avail of them.</P>
    <P>I have sympathy with the public offices commission which must ensure that the provisions are adhered to.  At best its job will be difficult and at worst extremely frustrating.  If people receive amounts above the prescribed limits I am sure they will have ways and means of getting around the requirement, otherwise there will be many cheques for £499.99 to ensure they remain within the limit.  This area could lead to a rash of litigation or at least very wasteful paperwork.</P>
    <P>My party has 150 branches in my constituency and I feel sorry for the person who takes on the task of ensuring that the paperwork is put together at election time and presented in the prescribed form under the legislation.  It will be an impossible task.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with the limit on expenditure, probably because I will never be in a position to spend £12,000 on an election.  I have difficulty with the idea of trying to keep tabs on how much is spent where and when within 70 days of an election.  Whether or not one was successful one would have a busy two months looking for receipts, etc. and putting them in order.  I cannot help but feel that this is all a smokescreen to hide a certain embarrassment that we are bold enough as politicians to believe the State ought to make a contribution to the political system through the various parties.  We would have been much better advised to put our case for public expenditure on political parties and the political system&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann regrets the failure of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to implement a coherent strategy for the semi-State sector under his control and calls on the Minister to bring forward a comprehensive plan for the strategic development of those companies over the next five years.</P>
      <P>The semi-State sector has dominated the news for the past week but unfortunately for all the wrong reasons.  Instead of a reasoned debate on the future role of State owned companies, a debate that is urgently needed, we have heard a series of wild allegations by the Minister, Deputy Lowry, and increasingly frantic efforts on his behalf to stand them up. Teams of private accountants have been hired at enormous public expense to trawl through the State companies in search of evidence to support the Minister's allegations.  Despite their best efforts and the inordinate amount of Civil Service and semi-State officials' time that went into this unprecedented search, very little has been found.  Yet the Minister continues to dig, and the more he digs the deeper in trouble he finds himself.  I can do no more at this stage than commend to the Minister the advice of the former British Chancellor, Denis Healey, who once said: &ldquo;If you find yourself in a hole, the first thing you do is stop digging&rdquo;.  It is time for the Minister to stop digging and to get on with the job he is paid to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At times this whole episode has smacked of farce rather than serious politics.  It is surely unprecedented for a Cabinet Minister to come into this House and make a serious allegation against a named individual on a Tuesday, only to come back on the following Thursday and withdraw it completely. The process by which the Minister's <Col N="232" /> speech of Tuesday last was drafted gives me serious grounds for concern.  It now transpires that the Minister, Deputy Lowry, had to submit his speech in draft form to the Tánaiste's office to have it vetted by the so-called programme manager in that office.  It seems the Minister could not be let out on his own.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Tánaiste and his hired handlers who are now running Government policy in the semi-State area, not Minister Lowry.  It must surely be humiliating for all those in Fine Gael to have Labour Party ideologues dictating policy, even in Departments nominally controlled by Fine Gael Ministers. I would be very interested to know if Deputy Lowry is the only Minister to have been subjected to this kind of humiliation or does every member of the Cabinet now have to submit their Dáil scripts to the Tánaiste's programme manager for ideological cleansing?</P>
      <P>As I said in this House last week, the Minister will find it very difficult to reestablish his credibility in the eyes of the semi-State managers.  His authority has been substantially eroded and the Socialists and other vested interests in semi-State companies are now happy that it is their friends in the Labour Party who are calling the shots.  Unfortunately the Minister's most serious allegations that a privileged few operated a cosy cartel on contracts with the semi-State companies and their alleged initiation of private eye surveillance on him in retaliation still remain in the public domain, unproven.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four aspects of the Minister's statements in the House last week and subsequent attempted justification in the media raise questions which the Minister should address in his reply.  First, is it true that the property section of CIE forwarded its file on the Horgan's Quay sale to the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications for <Col N="233" /> approval in January this year?  Is it true that all details of the Horgan's Quay arrangements were carefully examined in that Department over a period of time and approved by the Department well before the date of 21 June mentioned by the Minister in the Dáil and well before he removed Mr. O'Leary from office on 17 April?  Second, the production of a Waldorf Hotel bill with Mr. D. O'Leary's name hand written on it was an obvious fraud.  Who decided to issue this forged document to the media and who wrote Mr. D. O'Leary's name on it?  Third, why did the Minister give Dáil Éireann two differing reasons for his decision to seek the removal of Mr. O'Leary as chairman of CIE?  Fourth, who instructed the three CIE officials to present themselves for interview by RTE's Charlie Bird to answer prearranged and pre-rehearsed questions?</P>
    <P>The Minister must realise that several major question marks hang over his performance here last week and his allegations made throughout the summer recess.  The Progressive Democrats hold no brief for any of the parties mentioned other than an interest in the truth and justice.  The Minister knows he would have the full support of the Progressive Democrats if he could substantiate his story.  He has failed to do that and we can only wonder at his motives.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to waste any more of the time available to me this evening rehashing the sterile battles of the Minister's phoney war.  Instead I want to refer to a serious issue, the development and implementation of a coherent policy in relation to the strategic management of the semi-State companies and the sectors in which they operate. Deputy Lowry is Minister with responsibility for most of the semi-State companies but there seems little chance of any such policy emerging from his Department during the remainder of his tenure of office, however long the Tánaiste is willing to tolerate him in that position.</P>

      <P>My aim tonight is to be positive and constructive and to put forward clear and workable solutions to some of the many problems confronting our semi-State sector.  One does not have to look far to apppreciate the scale of those problems.  A sum of £5 million had to be paid to foreign consultants so that ESB management could find out that it was overmanned to the tune of 2,000 people; that company's own consultancy division sells advice to clients around the world.  Recently a fierce battle for a cigarette distribution contract was fought out by two bitter rivals, CIE's road haulage division and the SDS subsidiary of An Post, two of the State backed thoroughbreds in the Minister's stable.  The artificially low prices quoted by the State monopolies could not be matched by any of the taxpaying private firms that financed them. It makes you wonder about the radio advertisement for &ldquo;Cowboy Carriers&rdquo;. If the State were to start running two below-cost operators in the retail refrigeration business it would be a poor day for the Minister.</P>
      <P>Two more of his charges, Iarnród Éireann and Bus Éireann, are members of the same CIE family but that does not stop them competing head-on with the bus company running non-stop services between Dublin and Limerick, Cork and Waterford.  No fewer than four of his companies, at the last count, were bidding to get into competition with a fifth, Telecom Éireann, for the country's second mobile phone licence. It is apparent to everybody that we cannot carry on like this.  It is vitally important that we get our house in order in terms of management of the semi-State sector.</P>

      <P>CIE as an organisation can be said to have outlived its usefulness. It may have made sense to create such an entity nearly 50 years ago but today there is no valid reason that a Dublin based State company should exercise centralised control over every aspect of public transport.  A new approach is needed.  I am advocating the dismantling and dissolution of the CIE holding company as an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy.  For bus services I am in favour of the full devolution of responsibility to local authorities, as happens in other countries.  Centralised control of all the bus services in the country by a Dublin based bureaucracy makes neither economic nor administrative sense.  Local bus services should be locally controlled.  This does not mean that every county council must splash out millions of pounds buying bus fleets.  Instead each council would act as the franchising authority for bus services in its area.  The actual services would be delivered by either public or private operators, whichever was the most efficient.  Franchises would be awarded by a system of open, competitive tendering which would take account of criteria such as fare structures and the frequency and quality of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If anyone doubts that centralised control leaves local gaps they should look at the position in north Kildare.  For instance, Leixlip and Naas are now two of the largest towns in the country, with a combined population of about 25,000. They are only half an hour apart by road, yet there is no proper bus service <Col N="236" /> between them.  Does anybody believe that such gaps would be allowed to exist under a system of local control?  One might also ask why, since the town of Enniskillen in the North with a population of 10,000, has half a dozen commuter services per day linking it with surrounding towns and villages, Carlow in the south, with a population of 14,000, has none.</P>
    <P>CIÉ and Bus Éireann have been neglecting local bus services for years. Instead they have concentrated their energy and money on fighting off private competition on long distance express services.  I have reason to fear that the onslaught on private operators who pioneered many of these routes when CIÉ had no interest in them has involved predatory pricing.  I recall a Bus Éireann official saying on a radio interview some years ago that private bus operators offering a Galway-Dublin bus service of £6 could only do so if operating at a loss yet Bus Éireann reduced its fares to these levels shortly afterwards &mdash; obviously at a loss if this official was to be believed.  It is interesting to note that return fares on the Dublin-Wicklow route on which Bus Éireann has no competition can be over 9p per mile whereas fares on the Dublin-Wexford route where there is private competition are as low as half that.</P>
    <P>The railway system soaks up approximately £95 million of taxpayers' money each year.  It is a sobering thought that every worker in the country effectively contributes about £2 per week to keep the trains running &mdash; even though most might never actually use them.  The situation is particularly galling for those living in Kilmallock, County Limerick, Monasterevan, County Kildare, Dunleer, County Louth or the Fairview-North Strand area of County Dublin. These people contribute their taxes towards the rail subsidy but can only stand back in amazement as the train whizzes through their town without doing them the courtesy of stopping.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about south-west Cork where there is no service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="237" />
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely a more market oriented approach on the part of railway management would see the sense of opening stations in locations such as these at minimal extra cost.  It seems strange also that whereas Dublin is a vibrant European capital it does not go to bed at 11.20 p.m. but the DART does.  Would a more customer focused approach not involve the provision of late night services?</P>
      <P>Another option that needs to be looked at is franchising, which I mentioned earlier in relation to bus services. Limerick and Galway are the third and fourth largest cities and there is a railway link between them but there is no passenger service.  Passenger services on the line were abandoned by CIE some 25 years ago as being hopelessly uneconomic, yet this 70 miles stretch of track links three major urban centres and three counties with a combined population of 400,000.  It may well be that CIE's high operating costs make it uneconomic to run a service on this route but that does not mean that a private operator might not be able to provide a no frills &ldquo;Ryanair&rdquo; type service on the route on a franchise basis.  A single railcar would be sufficient to operate four return trips per day between Limerick and Galway.</P>
      <P>Franchising would also be an attractive option on other lines currently without any passenger service, such as Galway-Sligo, and might even be used to revivify lines which have been virtually abandoned, such as Cork-Midleton-Youghal. In the longer term franchising could provide an alternative to line closures. Low traffic routes could be offered to franchise operators if the cash strapped State company felt that after paying for foreign trips by its top brass it no longer had the resources to operate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of service offered by Iarnrod Éireann on the Waterford-Limerick route is so abysmal as to be utterly useless to any member of the public wishing to travel between these two major urban centres.  With several major <Col N="238" /> towns on this line, such as Carrick-on-Suir, Clonmel and Tipperary, the relatively short stretch of line has a catchment area of up to 250,000 people.  I have no doubt that a private operator could surely do better than the minimalist service being provided by the State monopoly.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of creating the kind of bureaucratic nightmare that rail privatisation in Britain is turning into.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I believe that if services can be provided on a cost effective basis where none exists, then the least we should do is facilitate that process.  Clearly some service has to be better than no service.</P>
      <P>A franchising system would only be possible if the State split what is now Iarnrod Éireann into separate train and railway companies with a large part of the total subsidy being paid to the latter to maintain the infrastructure.  This is likely to happen anyway as an accounting exercise designed to make the train operating company look profitable.  The Government plans to make some £500 million available to CIE during the next few years to fund a whole array of railway projects.  I am concerned that more evaluation has not been carried out on some of these projects.  Everybody would like to see faster train services but how many millions should we pay to knock 15 minutes off the Dublin-Belfast trip for instance?  We should also ask ourselves would we go ahead with these projects if free money from Brussels was not available.  If these projects are uneconomic with our money they are also uneconomic with somebody else's money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The controversy in which the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, has become embroiled centres on the way in which CIE manages its property portfolio. This problem might never have arisen if the company had adopted a more <Col N="239" /> businesslike approach to the management of its property estate.  The company is sitting on under-utilised land all over the country.  Does anybody believe that a huge commercial site in a prime location, Donnybrook, Dublin 4, could not be put to better use than a bus garage? Instead of pursuing mobile phone licences, CIE management should immediately set about the task of realising cash for their unwanted and under-utilised property assets.</P>
    <P>The suggestions I have made in both the bus and rail areas are designed to improve and increase the level of service available to the public without additional cost to the taxpayer.  As such they should be capable of winning a broad degree of support right across this House.  We must adopt innovative and imaginative measures in the management of our public transport system.  It seems that neither CIE management nor the Minister is capable of doing this.</P>
    <P>The importance of modern telecommunications networks for industrial development cannot be over-emphasised. It is reckoned that the contribution of telecommunications to gross domestic product in the European Union will double from 3 per cent to 6 per cent during the next ten years.  This is an area where technology is moving fast.  The agenda is set not by Government but by hi-tech corporations developing even more advanced communications systems.  What we are witnessing in effect is a rolling revolution where what is modern today is obsolete tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Old style State monopolies have little role to play in this new world.  Around the world Governments are exiting from the telecommunications business as owners and operators.  Privatisation is the order of the day.  Instead they are taking on the role of facilitators, opening up their markets to competition and ensuring that proper regulatory systems are in place to cope with the technological explosion that is occurring.</P>
    <P>The investment requirements of the telecommunications industry are heavy. <Col N="240" /> There can be no question of the taxpayer being asked to fund the massive developments that will be needed in Ireland.  Burdened with debts of over £860 million, Telecom Éireann urgently needs access to external sources of capital. I believe that the arguments in favour of privatisation are compelling and if the company's management needs to be beefed up to prepare it for privatisation then so be it.  A stock market quotation would provide the company with the means of financing its long-term expansion without cost to the taxpayer. As I said in this House last week, I am not convinced of the need for a strategic partner.  My fear is that a foreign company would buy effective control of Telecom Éireann on the cheap before the company has been put on a sound commercial footing.</P>
    <P>Whatever happens Telecom Éireann needs to get its own house in order.  A former chairman of the company recently was quoted as saying that its charges were wildly excessive and a burden on the Irish economy.  He went on to add that the company was famous among industry watchers for its high prices and noteworthy for its inefficiency. The company may be overmanned by as many as 5,500.  In terms of lines per employee, Telecom Éireann is only half as efficient as New Zealand telecommunications and only half as profitable.  Major progress on cost reductions and efficiency improvement will have to be made before any involvement by a strategic equity partner is considered.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the situation regarding the new mobile phone licence.  With Telecom Éireann facing possible competition from another semi-State company we are, as I said last week, headed for a quite ludicrous situation.  At a time when other countries are privatising their phone companies &mdash; Spain being the most recent example &mdash; we could soon have a situation in Ireland where the Government <Col N="241" /> is running not one but two telecommunications networks.</P>
    <P>I am not as well versed in the dogma of socialist economics as some of the people sitting on the Government benches claim to be, but I think even the central planners of the old Soviet regime never went quite as far as creating two competing State monopolies, if it is possible to use such a term. Perhaps they did for all I know.  We need a clear statement of policy for Irish telecommunications.  The Government's strategy should be to open up the Irish market to competition to the widest possible extent and to put in place the regulatory framework needed to make that competition work.  In terms of our future job creation potential we must bear in mind that we live side by side with the country which has perhaps the most liberalised and competitive telecommunications market in Europe, namely, the United Kingdom.  Unless we here embrace the philosophy of competition, we will be placing ourselves at a major disadvantage in terms of our ability to attract job creating foreign investment into this country.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn to the electricity and energy market.  This is another area in which we should strive to create competition. Five years ago my colleague, Deputy O'Malley, established the Culliton review group, and that group stressed the importance of a coherent energy policy in our overall industrial development effort.  That group's work was welcomed by the main political parties. In its report the group highlighted the need for adequate energy provision at competitive prices.  It pointed disapprovingly to the monopolistic practices of the State-owned energy companies which dominate the sector and recommended that opportunities to increase the degree of competition and energy supply should be promoted.  Four years on I am not sure much heed has been paid to what Culliton said about competition, yet competition is essential if we are to ensure that both private and <Col N="242" /> industrial consumers get their supplies at the best possible price.</P>
    <P>We are being directed by the European Union to introduce competition in our electricity market, but the Minister's efforts in this regard have not been very impressive.  His main contribution to date has been the announcement that he would set up a power procurer to act as a central buyer of electricity for the national grid in a competitive market.  I have no problem with that.  An independent power procurer is an essential prerequisite for any arrangements where different generators are contributing to the national grid.  However, that is not quite what the Minister is proposing.  He wants the power procurer to be a wholly owned subsidiary of the ESB.  For the system to work it is patently obvious that the power procurer must be entirely independent of the generating companies and must be in a position to operate a transparent pricing policy. Otherwise the whole thing becomes a farce.  For instance, how could a power procurer, as an employee of the ESB, be expected to act fairly in his dealings with private electricity generators <i>vis-à-vis</i> his own employer?  The system, as proposed by the Minister is unworkable. It is a cop out, merely a device for getting around the European Union's competition guidelines, and I would not be surprised if the Brussels authorities rejected this formula out of hand.</P>
    <P>Under the Minister's proposals the ESB would effectively be buying electricity from itself.  It is difficult to see how such a move could do anything to introduce an element of competition into a sector where it is badly needed.  If we are serious about introducing competition into the electricity market, we must take a different approach.  The basic objective should be to comply not just with the letter but with the spirit of European Union liberalisation regulations. In short, we must aim for competition in both the generation and the supply of electricity.</P>
    <P>Any attempt to create a competitive electricity market must, of necessity, involve the splitting of the ESB into two <Col N="243" /> companies, one to handle the generation, the other to manage the national grid and handle transmission and distribution. This should not be a very difficult task to accomplish in administrative and operational terms as the ESB is already divided into separate business units.</P>
    <P>A similar demerger was carried out in New Zealand a couple of years ago. Competitive tendering for the construction of new power plants would bring new generators into the industry here.  It will be several years before these have any impact on the market, however, given the long lead-in times involved in the construction of such stations.  Construction and operation of the proposed peat-powered plant in the east midlands will be open to outside bidders, but the ESB will also be able to pitch for the contract.  In any event, the plant will account for less than 3 per cent of national generating capacity and will not be strategically significant in national terms.</P>
    <P>A great opportunity to introduce real competition in generation much more quickly has been lost however.  The decision that was made to allow the ESB to proceed with phase one of the combined cycle plant at Poolbeg in Dublin means that the board will be the automatic choice to complete the final two phases of the project on the same site.  When fully commissioned the new Poolbeg complex will account for about 10 per cent of total generating capacity which is very significant in terms of the national market.  The decision to allow the ESB to go ahead with phase one was tantamount to ruling out competition for several years to come.  The ESB would have an obvious cost advantage in building phase two and three over any outside generator trying to put the same capacity on a greenfield site.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives offer more immediate prospects for the introduction of some degree of competition.  Management of individual ESB power stations could be put up for public tender and contracted out to external bidders if <Col N="244" /> they were capable of running them more efficiently than the State company. An important source of electricity supply could be combined heat and power plants attached to major industrial installations.  There are a number of large sites which could be in a position to contribute electricity to the system once the market was liberalised.</P>
    <P>The reopening of the interconnector with Northern Ireland may not make much of a difference in the short-term as the volume of power traded is likely to be small.  I wonder if this piece of equipment should now be fitted with some kind of an ideological filter to keep the Labour Party happy, given that all of Northern Ireland's electricity is generated by privatised stations.  In the longer term, however, an upgraded interconnector with Northern Ireland could be the link through which this country is finally joined to the European grid.  This depends on the completion of the interconnector between Northern Ireland and Scotland, a project which has run into considerable environmental opposition in the Galloway region of Scotland.  The obvious alternative is the construction of an interconnector between Dublin and the Welsh coast, but this would take much time and money to construct.</P>
    <P>Whatever the source of the electricity, it is important that major industrial users have direct third party access to it. Thus, if a major industrial plant is generating electricity via combined heat and power technology, other industries should be able to buy directly rather than go through any kind of centralised power procurement agency.</P>
    <P>Implementing the TPA principle will be crucial to ensuring that there is competition not just in generation but in supply also.  In a liberalised market power generation will clearly no longer be a monopoly.  It will be capital intensive and commercially active, like the cement manufacturing and steel making industries.  As such, the rationale for retaining it in State ownership will disappear. Otherwise the State will run into conflict with itself in its role as <Col N="245" /> independent regulator and policy maker for the industry on one hand and as owner of a generating company on the other.  The kind of tension to which this conflict necessarily gives rise is already becoming apparent in the Government's deteriorating relationship with the ESB, because one cannot be the referee and play the ball at the same time. It follows that ultimate privatisation of the ESB generating arm will have to be considered.  There is nothing unusual about this in today's world &mdash; the Hungarian Government, which is probably closer to left wing orthodoxy than anyone in this country, is currently selling off its whole electricity industry.  The proceeds could be split, helping to defray both the ESB's massive debts, and make some impact on our £30 billion national debt.</P>
    <P>It may also be possible to privatise part of the generating network now, though the sheer scale and efficiency at Moneypoint make this problematic.  The Moneypoint generating station accounts for 41 per cent of all the electricity generated here.  Whoever got hold of it would be in an extremely powerful position relative to other suppliers.  The ESB itself is not unfavourably disposed towards competition in the generating of electricity &mdash; it is the operator and part-owner of the Corby power station in Northamptonshire in England.  It is somewhat ironic that an Irish-State-owned monopoly should be among the pioneers of a Thatcherite experiment in free market economies in the energy field.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, before I leave electricity and the ESB, I am sure the House is aware that the Minister has linked the ESB price increase application directly to the successful completion of the cost and competitiveness review.  All the reports on the CCR indicate that little, if any, progress has been made and it is now most unlikely this review will conclude by the set date of 31 October.  In the event of failure to meet the October deadline, it is important that the Minister outline in his statement to the House the action he proposes taking.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="246" /> I would like to refer briefly to natural gas supply.  Natural gas is a major source of primary energy here, accounting for about 20 per cent of the total.  As a clean and environmentally acceptable fuel it will play an increasing role in our energy policy in the years ahead.  It is important that Bord Gáis, as a State monopoly, operates a transparent pricing policy rather than merely publishing an indicative list of tariffs, as it does at present.  With the interconnector with Britain coming on stream next year, it is vital that large customers have direct third party access to gas from the interconnector. While the Government accepted the recommendations of the Culliton review group to this effect, there have been recent noises from the Labour Party that this may not be followed through.  Third party access is as vital a policy imperative in natural gas as it is in electricity.  We will not have a competitive market in gas without it.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the energy sector, I want to ask one question.  The Government and its predecessor spent a great deal of time talking about cross-Border bodies in the context of the peace process. Has consideration been given to the creation of a single electricity market on this island?  At present Ireland is at home to two of the smallest and most isolated electricity systems in Europe and suffers huge diseconomies as a result.  While I do not underestimate the legal and political problems the creation of an integrated single island electricity market would involve, the savings that would accrue would be considerable.  It would deliver clear economic benefits to both parts of the island and would be of much greater practical importance than the inconsequential quangos that are more likely to emerge under the guise of cross-Border institutions.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta was originally established to manage the country's international airports.  As a monopoly operator in an expanding market this has proved to be a lucrative franchise in recent years. Last year the company made pre-tax profits of £31 million and generated trading margins of 17 per cent, a figure <Col N="247" /> to which few businesses in the private sector could aspire.  Aer Rianta invest those monopoly profits in building up a considerable business empire.  For a company whose main profit base is its Irish airport monopoly, the company is developing a rather exotic corporate profile.</P>
    <P>Through its wholly owned subsidiary, Aer Rianta, the Government provides catering services at Stanstead and Southampton Airports in Britain, runs airport shops in several locations in the former Soviet Union, in Bahrain and Karachi and will soon operate a duty free store in downtown Bangkok.  Not only that, if the company's further plans are realised, it will shortly display its retailing expertise to the people of Hong Kong and China.  Given the present pace of economic reform in China, our Government may be the only Government running shops in that country.</P>
    <P>Last month Aer Rianta announced its intention to purchase a minority stake in Birmingham International, the fifth largest airport in Britain and the company, though the Great Southern chain, is one of our largest hotel operators. The more deeply Aer Rianta becomes involved in extraneous ventures, the less money it can afford to pay the Exchequer in dividends.  Last year the company paid the Government £10.6 million, 38 per cent of its after-tax profits, and, apparently, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications has agreed to peg the dividend contribution at this level for the rest of the decade.  This effectively gives the company the freedom to indulge itself by investing its monopoly profits in all manner of corporate expansion in the next five years.  For example, Aer Rianta is well advanced with plans to construct a 145 bedroom hotel at Dublin Airport, surely not good news for the hoteliers in the city who pay tax on their profits at 38 per cent.  It also plans to invest £170 million in upgrading Dublin Airport and, early in the next century, a <Col N="248" /> further £200 million in building a second terminal at the airport.</P>

      <P>Belfast, just 100 miles north of here, has two airports, both owned and managed by the private sector. Should Dublin not follow the example of Belfast, withdraw from a direct ownership role and concentrate instead on fostering competition and the provision of cost effective services at no expense to the taxpayer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be nice to think that in five years time Dublin would also have two thriving and successful private sector airports.  Collinstown, to the north, would be owned by a privatised Aer Rianta while Baldonnel, to the south, would be owned by a group of private investors.  With both airports competing <Col N="250" /> vigorously, access to Ireland would become cheaper and our tourists industry would receive a major boost as a result.  I respectfully suggest it is time the Minister re-examined his Department's policy on airports.</P>
    <P>We need a clear and coherent policy for the governance of our semi-State companies; there appears to be no policy at present.  Nudged along by directives from Brussels we make grudging concessions in the direction of greater competition for key services, such as electricity and telecommunications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>For the most part, however, we try to keep competition at bay.  We seek to protect State companies as far as possible from the realities of the market-place.  We allow them pass on the costs of their over-manning and inefficiency to Irish consumers and in the case of industrial consumers this amounts to an effective tax on exports.</P>
      <P>We have been reluctant to impose a customer service ethos on our State companies.  When we walk into our local hamburger shop we see a quality certificate hanging on the wall.  Surely taxpayers and consumers are entitled to no less from their State services but few State companies have attained recognised quality standards, such as the Q mark or ISO9002 &mdash; Aer Rianta being an honourable exception.  State companies under the Minister's control are lumbered with debts of £2.3 billion, a massive burden for any group of companies to carry and debt service charges are effectively being recouped from the consumers.  It is essential that such firms are given an opportunity to properly capitalise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The traditional approach has been the old reliable once-off State equity injection, costing the taxpayer approximately £1 million per annum.  We can no longer finance major State companies in this way.  They must have independent access to external sources of equity capital and this inevitably leads to the subject of privatisation, a successful policy <Col N="251" /> in the Irish context.  The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Coalition, of which I was a member, privatised two companies &mdash; Greencore and Irish Life. Both privatisations were successful, well received by the public and the investment community and the two companies and their workforces prospered as a result.  Since then, however, the political pendulum has swung in a different direction.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is opposed to privatisation, although Minister Quinn recently cashed in his remaining Irish Life chips and sold Irish Steel for £1. Despite this the Labour Party remains antagonistic to the concept of privatisation but at least, like the Progressive Democrats, people know where it stands.  With Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, however, it is a case of &ldquo;whatever you're having yourself&rdquo; with regard to major policy issues.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago, around the time my party was founded, privatisation was a radical policy option most notably associated in the public mind with Mrs. Thatcher.  Ten years later the world is a changed placed and privatisation is common place across the political spectrum. It is no longer a matter of ideology but one of practicality.  It is remarkable that some of the former Communist countries of eastern Europe will complete the privatisation of their public utilities before the Conservative Government in Britain.</P>
    <P>Just over ten years ago a new Government came into power in New Zealand and initiated one of the most comprehensive privatisation programmes in the Western world.  Within six years that Government disposed of State interests in steel, petroleum, finance, banking, shipping, aviation, insurance, hotels, gas, telecommunications, forestry, railways and other assets.  This &ldquo;everythingmust-go&rdquo; sale realised NZ$13 billion.  It enabled the Government in New Zealand to stabilise its country's national debt and reduce the top rate of personal taxation from 66 per cent to 33 per cent. That is the road we should go.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>This strategy is designed to ensure that the commercial State companies can meet the imminent and unavoidable competitive challenges, are a motor for growth in the economy as envisaged by the Culliton report, provide quality services at the lowest price, are vibrant, growing and profitable and provide good careers and sustainable jobs for those who work in them.  I believe that the commercial State sector is of crucial importance to the future wellbeing of this country both from an economic and social point of view.  The health of the economy and the cohesiveness of the country's social fabric depend crucially on how these companies perform.  The only long-term sustainable future for the commercial State companies is that they learn to adapt to the changing environment in which they will increasingly find themselves and that they take effective action so as to position themselves correctly in the marketplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the services provided by the State companies are competitively priced, then the Irish economy as a whole will be more competitive.  If, on the other hand, they are not competitively priced, then it will be difficult for the economy as a whole to compete.  A semi-State sector that is state of the art in terms of the range and quality of the services it offers and delivers will enhance the <Col N="254" /> ability of the entire economy to be competitive. The strategy I am implementing has five main strands: competitiveness, a focus on customers' real needs, measure of performance, attention to long-term business strategy &mdash; not short-term tactics &mdash; and effective management of change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>And surveillance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of our competitive State companies were set up in a different era from that of today.  For those companies that did not have to face direct competition in the past, the arrival of competition poses a major challenge to adapt to this new environment. However, fundamental changes are now taking place which will affect these companies and it is my policy, therefore, to facilitate this necessary adaptation in the sectors for which I am responsible.</P>
      <P>Competition can be the key to lower prices.  Without competition, lower prices and, equally importantly, better services are often no more than a pious aspiration.  With competition and appropriate regulation, the price mechanism at once comes into play and the customer benefits.  With one of the most open economies in the world we simply cannot afford that goods and services are provided at anything other than fully competitive prices.</P>
      <P>The State companies are at different stages of adaptation to competition.  Let me give the House some examples.  The painful consequences of a failure to sustain competitive cost structures have been learned in Aer Lingus.  As a result of a partnership approach between unions, management and the board, Aer Lingus is now successfully emerging from the worst crisis in its history. Moreover, TEAM Aer Lingus now has a place in a viable restructuring and development plan covering the period to the year 2000.  This plan is based on making TEAM competitive and therefore viable and profitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Telecom Éireann, increasing competition in the provision <Col N="255" /> of international voice services, particularly in the business sector, has resulted in a significant and progressive reduction in international phone costs. This has not been bad news for Telecome Éireann as the market is growing much more rapidly in response to price stimulation.  A world class competitor to Telecom Éireann in the mobile phone sector will be operational from next year, thereby stimulating Telecom Éireann to accelerate its own competitive drive.  This in turn will greatly benefit the end consumer as mobile phone costs will be dramatically reduced.  It will also assist Telecom Éireann as the market for mobile phones expands.</P>
    <P>The tripartite approach of the cost competitive review of the ESB offers immense opportunities to address the issues of competitiveness and required change in a partnership involving the unions, management and my Department. I sincerely hope these opportunities will be grasped in such a way that will be best for the economy, individual and business consumers and for the successful future of the ESB and its staff.</P>
    <P>A fundamental review of An Post, which the new chairman has carried out in recent months at my request, is now being finalised by the board of An Post. This will facilitate the company's development into a dynamic organisation focussing on the needs of its four constituents: the public, business and industry, staff and the Government.</P>

The Irish National Petroleum Company is well under way in its preparation to become a fully commercially viable company in two years' time.

      <P>The aim of the second strand of my strategy is to ensure that the commercial State companies have a customer driven ethos.  Being customer focused goes hand in hand with competitiveness and is ultimately the foundation for business success.  With this in mind, I am working to ensure that all these companies become fully responsive to the changing needs of customers.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>For instance, in the area of telecommunications, customers demand an ever increasing range of services, not least to keep abreast of the facilities their competitors enjoy.  Our telephone services must compete not only on price and quality but also on the range of services on offer and I have recently set a formal target to achieve this objective.  I want Ireland to be firmly positioned in the top quartile of the OECD countries on price, quality and the range of services on offer.  My strategy and policy in this area are geared towards achieving that goal.  This is based on securing a strategic alliance partner to complement Telecom Éireann's own efforts.</P>
      <P>The commercial State companies must, in the future, be run on the basis of customers' real needs.  If they fail in this respect, they have no future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The customer can and will go elsewhere if these companies cannot or do not respond to his or her requirements.</P>
      <P>The third strand of my strategy concerns measuring performance and acting upon those findings.  As a first stage, the individual State companies need detailed information on their cost bases. This sounds very elementary but many of our companies have traditionally lacked sufficiently detailed information on their cost structures.  This issue has already been addressed comprehensively in the ESB, Aer Lingus, Telecom Éireann and the INPC.  This must be followed by comprehensive benchmarking of all elements of their cost structure and their quality of service against best industry practice in the sector.  The companies mentioned above are examples of where this has happened.  An Post is also currently addressing these first two steps.</P>
      <P>Obviously, the third stage is to develop a strategy for change with a view to achieving a bottom line financial result which is capable of securing and sustaining the future of the company and the jobs of its workforce in the new competitive environment.  The kind of strategic review I am talking about is essentially long-term in its perspective rather than day-to-day.  This brings me to the forth strand of our approach. What we are seeking to create is strategy.</P>

      <P>Let me give three examples of areas where it is vitally necessary to take this kind of strategic view.  One can ask what the future for Bord na Móna is in the energy mix for the years ahead.  An organisation whose role was conceived in the vastly different conditions of the 1930s has an urgent need to make sure that what it is trying to do in the 1990s and beyond corresponds to today's needs and today's marketplace.  The answer to these questions is important to everyone, not just to Bord na Móna, because our total energy costs are affected by everything we do in any part of that sector.</P>
      <P>What is the future for An Post in the era of the information superhighway?  Is it to wither slowly at the risk of giving worse and worse value and service as its traditional markets move away from it, or is it to pursue new opportunities? There is obviously a viable role for An Post that can be pursued with vigour once its role has been clearly defined. As I mentioned earlier, in June last I requested the chairman of An Post to carry out a detailed review of the operations of the company.  This review will be considered by the board of An Post at its meeting tomorrow.</P>

      <P>The investment strategy for CIE is already clear.  With European Union support, over £600 million will be spent in the six years 1994 to 1999.  The Dublin Transportation Initiative provides a policy framework for investment in light rail, quality bus corridors and other public transport improvements in the greater Dublin area.  Under the operational programme for transport, the mainline railway network is being renewed and the locomotive fleet is being upgraded.</P>
      <P>CIE receives a £100 million subvention from the State each year.  This runs the risk of creating a dependency culture in CIE.  Nobody is sure what the taxpayer gets in return for this money.  I want to change that.  I plan to negotiate a series of public service contracts with CIE.  They will cover a five year period beginning with the 1997 financial year. These contracts will spell out clearly what services CIE will provide and what the State will pay to support non-commercial services.  CIE's contractual obligations will be defined in terms of both the quantity and quality of service to be provided.</P>

For this reason, the fifth and final strand of the new approach is critical.  We must organise the transport, energy and communications sectors so that they can effectively manage inevitable, massive change.</P>

      <P>And they must do this in partnership.</P>
      <P>Managing change effectively means enhanced accountability by the commercial State companies and greater transparency so that potential problems are not masked until they have become life threatening to the organisation and costly to the taxpayer.  It means putting in place a modern, businesslike relationship between the commercial State companies and the State itself &mdash; a relationship that balances the needs of the Government as owner, and the commercial State companies as provider.  In this relationship, I see the Government in the role of holding company and each commercial State company as an operating company within a larger group.

      <P>It also means a total change management process in each company that goes well beyond the traditional issues based approach in industrial relations.  Aer Lingus is an example of unions and management successfully co-operating in this way.  A similar co-operative approach is also being pursued in, for example, the ESB and Telecom Éireann.</P>

We are in the process of organising a competition for the franchise to build and operate the new peat fired power station.

    <P>The advent of competition complicates the role of Government as both shareholder and regulator. It is vital, in the interests of fairness and transparency, that the shareholder and regulatory powers are separated.  Regulatory powers which up to now have been exercised directly by the Government will have to be handed over to an independent regulatory body.  I am expediting the creation of such a body so that it can be up and running by next year when competition arrives in mobile telephones and to create the necessary environment for investment in Telecom Éireann by a strategic partner.  I also see a need to provide new regulatory regimes for other sectors for which I am responsible.  As part of this process I am <Col N="263" /> having a broad examination of regulatory systems in other countries carried out so that we can benefit from their experience.</P>

      <P>The pace at which change must take place in the transport, energy and communications sectors is more revolutionary than evolutionary.  The world will not wait for us to change at our own pace.  The companies must develop the capability for ongoing change and, where they have not already done so, they must begin the change process now.  It must be undertaken in partnership between unions, management and Government and must go beyond the traditional issues driven approach.</P>

      <P>The eight years that Fianna Fáil was in office, from 1987 to 1994, was a period of considerable progress in the semi-State companies.  The latest ESRI report on energy utilities notes that in the mid-1980s Ireland's lack of competitiveness was aggravagated by unfavourable trends in the cost of such essential services while the situation today is more satisfactory.  There was no ESB price rise during the period we were in Government.  There has been tremendous development of our airports, with traffic increasing by 64 per cent between 1987 and 1993.  Aer Rianta and the ESB have been successful in winning contracts abroad.  The taking of An Bord Gáis into the State sector and the extension of gas usage has been successful. B &amp; I, once the source of chronic financial problems &mdash; this House was asked many times to extend the limit of the taxpayers' money given to it &mdash; has been sold to Irish Ferries and is now part of a successful group. Aer Lingus was painfully restructured but is now on a much sounder footing, carrying more passengers than it did eight years ago, with the transatlantic services flourishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE's subsidy has been steadily reduced, yet the railways are carrying 20 per cent more passengers with improved services.  Major public transport investment was negotiated by the last Government with Brussels, for which the Minister will try to claim credit.  It should never be forgotten that in 1984 the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition said in its policy document, <i>Building on Reality</i>, that there would be no more investment in <Col N="267" /> railways.  Bord na Móna has been restructured and is operating commercially.</P>
    <P>The Whitegate Refinery has been operating quietly and efficiently.  An Post has been turned around and is now making impressive profits.  In the late 1980s I persuaded my Cabinet colleagues not to sell off the Great Southern Hotels group which, I am proud to say, is flourishing under the management of Aer Rianta, making sufficient profit to fund its new investment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has done little of substance in his first ten months in office.  Apart from tidying up one or two loose ends in the Aer Lingus restructuring programme, he has obtained a decision on the restructured financing of Bord na Mona, which was at an advanced stage when I left office. Otherwise there has been mostly a lot of empty political bombast.  The Minister made an ill-judged intervention in the critical ESB talks.  Even <i>Business and Finance</i> in its March edition described some of his proposals to introduce competition as naïve.</P>
      <P>Aside from his Department's remit, at last a partner has been found for Irish Steel.  In our period in office, Irish Life was disposed of profitably for the State, the sugar company was sold and is now thriving as Greencore.  The future of ACC, ICC and the Trustee Savings Bank still awaits a Government decision despite the fact that such a decision was ready for announcement this time last year.  I am not sure what has happened since.</P>
      <P>Under our stewardship telecommunications charges were reduced and restructured in the teeth of a Fine Gael campaign of opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil appreciate the dedication and spirit of public service in the semi-State sector, whose achievements have been enormous.  We want to do what is <Col N="268" /> best for their development, for the security of their employees, their customers and the competitiveness of our economy.  It is no longer possible for them to carry employees over and above their needs, as they were encouraged to do in the early 1980s.  Their real net indebtedness has been reduced significantly.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has a latent, ideological hostility to semi-State companies, already manifest in the person of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Left to itself, that party would want to privatise everything and curtail the activities of the semi-State sector whenever it threatens competition with the private sector.  I am not surprised that the Minister's Government colleagues insisted that he moderate the ideological content of his speech in the House on Tuesday last, clearly demonstrating he is no longer master of his Department.  The public would not tolerate a position in which the service provided by a monopoly deteriorated in private hands and prices charged by utilities rose so as to reward private shareholders, buying State assets on the cheap, paying inflated salaries and share options to directors.  Fianna Fáil will not go down that road, nor will we follow some of the principles enunciated in the House this evening.</P>
      <P>At the other end, the ideological attitude of the Left tends to disregard competitiveness. The Labour Party often seems to think the economy exists to service the public sector rather than the other way round.  We are a small country and, while it may make sense in a large one to have competing electricity utilities, such competition is highly artificial in an economy of our size.  The Minister rightly sought some derogation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two sets of issues need to be addressed &mdash; the survival and flourishing of the companies themselves and the <Col N="269" /> impact of their operations on the competitiveness of our economy.  We have achieved competitive prices for electricity well below those obtaining in Northern Ireland.  The problem is how to sustain that performance when addressing the question of new investment. Our telecommunications charges remain too high, as do our postal charges.  Clearly there is a dilemma about maintaining high levels of employment in a semi-State body if the prices charged are at the expense of employment elsewhere.  On the other hand, becoming more competitive, by drastically reducing service to the public &mdash; a feature of some of the proposals of An Post &mdash; clearly is self-defeating.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has the right, balanced approach to the semi-State sector and its relationship to the wider economy. Our pragmatic attitude formed part of the basis of the trust we built up with the trade union movement and of the social consensus that underpinned economic recovery since 1987.  As Mr. Bill Attley recently pointed out, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications has a lot to learn in his approach to the semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>Events have demonstrated the shallowness of the Minister's approach.  He is a lame duck Minister, lacking the necessary authority or credibility.  He has damaged confidence in this Administration by wild and unfounded charges against the integrity of respected business people under Dáil privilege.</P>
    <P>Most observers will have viewed with profound distaste the controversy the Minister initiated over the past few months.  He is a Minister whose ambitions go way beyond his proven abilities and experience, intent on establishing op"ri = "1"a reputation for political ruthlessness. Retrospectively he attempted to justify his dismissal &mdash; essentially for political reasons &mdash; of the former chairman of CIE in a manner of which the Civil Service could not have approved.</P>

      <P>It is clear also he has <Col N="270" /> been influenced by Fine Gael claims during the Cork by-election and by resentment of the forced resignation of the former Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney.  We recall the headlines of November when a prominent Fine Gael Deputy attacked the sale of the CIE site.  My colleague, the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Cowen, will have a lot more to say about the background to that.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications has allowed himself become the voice of the whinge factor in Fine Gael, listening to people, whether businessmen or politicians, who attribute the fact that they are losers to the alleged sharp practice of their opponents who want to discredit the deal for their own reasons.</P>
      <P>From time to time all politicians and a substantial number of senior public servants are presented with anonymous letters.  Anyone who has served as Minister for Finance will know that such correspondence is received daily, often about Revenue and PRSI contributions of certain individuals.  Most of it belongs in the wastepaper basket.  Occasionally it may be a sensible precaution to send them to the Garda for further action, if any, but it is dangerous, naïve and irresponsible of a Minister to give exaggerated credence to anonymous information which conforms to his political prejudices and allow it into the public domain.  He is all too likely to be left exposed, unable to have the information transmitted to him substantiated, especially when he cannot vouch for its source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister let it be known, directly and indirectly, he had been placed under surveillance by named businessmen because of his determination to seek out implied corruption or a &ldquo;cosy cartel&rdquo; in the semi-State sector. Evidence of the Minister's personal <Col N="271" /> involvement in this regard will be given by one of my colleagues.  When challenged to substantiate the charge, he fell back on the defence that much of this matter is <i>sub judice</i>&mdash; that despite the recent Dáil ruling allowing comment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister contends it is almost never possible to know for certain whether or not one is under surveillance. Senior Members of this House are constantly in the public eye; nearly everything we do or say is witnessed, noted by others and repeated. Assuming Ministers are not engaged in anything illegal, underhand or deceitful, they have nothing to fear whether under surveillance or not.  If legitimate but confidential meetings or correspondence enter the public arena inexplicably, there may be grounds for concern but the Minister has not produced concrete evidence of anything of that kind nor has he admitted to the existence of a final Garda report.</P>
      <P>The Minister spent a large amount of taxpayers' money and Civil Service time trawling for possible abuses in the semi-State sector in order to justify his charges, the sole net result being that here and there a tightening up of procedures is recommended in the Deloitte &amp; Touche report.  Most of those tighter procedures, such as the Cromien guidelines, were introduced by Fianna Fáil.  We are totally against corruption of any kind.  Let me repeat that.</P>

      <P>Despite the assistance of an army of civil servants, advisers and consultants, the Minister hung his entire case on the single thread of the Horgan's Quay site.  The businessmen involved in that deal enjoy a reputation for integrity, capability and, above all, delivery, resulting in many important developments and jobs benefiting Cork, including Merchants Quay.  It is my <Col N="272" /> understanding that the Horgan's Quay site was not especially valuable, that the proposed development, leading to some 800 jobs, could be considered as quite high risk.  Given its high risk, it is not surprising that the project has been abandoned by its promoter now that it has been rendered a matter of political controversy.  The Cork Harbour Commissioners may have had an interest in the site but gave no indication they were in a position to purchase it from their own resources.</P>

      <P>I accept it would have been more satisfactory had the site gone to competitive tender &mdash; a subject to which we might return &mdash; but I very much doubt whether CIE would have got a better price as a result.  The decision was cleared by the entire board &mdash; as was reaffirmed today in defiance of the Minister.  The charge that the public or the taxpayer lost out is unsubstantiated. Where is the evidence that anybody is prepared to pay more now than the project has been withdrawn?</P>
      <P>Did the site beside Killarney railway station go to competitive tender before the Minister's forthright intervention ordering Bus Éireann to dispose of it, despite assurances having been given the Dáil that he did not involve himself in the detail of State company property transactions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the ethics of giving away State property in a closed deal?  What price or compensation did CIE &mdash; a company strapped for cash, as the Minister said &mdash; get for the site it <Col N="273" /> was forced to give up?  The Minister could have put that property up for public tender had he wished but obviously it was valuable to a particular developer. Here is a clear case of double standards. If Horgan's Quay was a scandal, or a closed deal, so was the Minister's improper intervention in Killarney.  Bus Éireann did not get value for money &mdash; in fact it got no money at all.  Jobs were the motivation in both cases.  There is always a potential conflict between cutting red tape, getting on with projects that promise badly needed jobs, and fulfilling every possible procedure.  That has been faced by many Members over the years.</P>
      <P>It is totally indefensible that the Minister could abuse Dáil privilege to attack the reputations of individual successful businessmen who have contributed much to this country.  Fine Gael has shown itself to be a party, allegedly proenterprise, ready to kick the private enterprise sector as well as the semi-State bodies around as a political football.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil is totally opposed to extravagance in the public sector, but we must be careful when we criticise to be sure we are on safe ground.  The Minister was forced to retract his accusation about the alleged American trip by the former chairman of CIE.  I thank him for supplying the papers from which he quoted, we got them late this evening from the Dáil Library.  Has the Minister corrected in the Official Report his estimates of Mr. O'Leary's travel costs?  He could have done that tonight.  Who was responsible for doctoring the bill that purported to show that Mr. O'Leary stayed at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. Was it the Minister's office, the Department or CIE?  If a deliberate attempt was made to bolster the Minister's claim by producing falsified evidence, we should be told who was responsible.  We must have honesty in this House.

      <P>I have no intention of debating the merits or demerits of Mr. O'Leary's travel.  The new management, which displaced him, claims it was of absolutely no value to CIE, and the Minister seems to stand over that.  The old management represented by Mr. Kennedy, a former acting chief executive who worked with CIE for more than 40 years, hotly disputes this.  All that should be clarified in committee and I hope that the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies will, as another committee of the House did last year, go through all these matters. I am sure it will come to satisfactory conclusions after a week or so as 20 or 30 people must be brought before it. Mr. O'Leary gave his service as parttime chairman for a salary less than half that of a clerical assistant fresh into the Civil Service.  At least that was not extravagant and I am sure the Minister will acknowledge that.  He and Noel Kennedy, who was on half-salary as he was past retirement age, have been replaced by two people, each paid more than £80,000 per annum.  That is fairly extravagant.  The Minister sneers at Mr. O'Leary being driven around in a limousine abroad.  Is the Minister not being driven around in a limousine every day of the week at considerable public expense when he, too, presides over a CIE strapped for cash?</P>

      <P>Why not?  The Minister cast aspersions on the integrity of Mr. Ambrose Kelly.  It is now acknowledged by CIE that Mr. Kelly was not involved in financial negotiations on the Horgan's Quay site and that the Minister's claim here last week, that Mr. Kelly <Col N="275" /> acted on behalf of O'Callaghan Properties Limited in negotiating the deal with CIE, is factually wrong.  I must protest, as Fine Gael did in this House at the time of the Galmoy controversy &mdash; Deputy Hogan remembers it well&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at trying to embroil CIE officials in his defence and embarrassing them deeply in the process. The Minister misled the Dáil on Mr. Kelly's role.  He must now also correct the record on that.  The onus of proof is on the person making allegations. The other allegation about Mr. Kelly is unproven and has been contradicted by Mr. Kelly as well as by Mr. Kennedy.</P>
      <P>It was disingenuous of the Minister to make an issue of the fact that no deposit had been paid on the Horgan's Quay site, under an agreement subject to contract, when the contract was cleared by him only a fortnight ago.  I note the contradiction in the Minister's statements and replies to the Dáil as to when he became aware of the issue.  Perhaps during this debate he will say which of the dates he has given, April, May or June, not to mention last November, is correct. The Minister, of course, never misled the Dáil.  He would never do so, he just gave us a number of options on the truth.</P>
      <P>The Minister's case is threadbare. Even the Labour Party agrees that he overstated his case.  It has been claimed that Fianna Fáil is trying to split the parties in Government.  I have few expectations of doing that.  As my Deputy leader said recently, they are stuck with glue.  I am well aware that the Labour Party does not care tuppence about standards in public life unless it suits its political agenda.  As for Democratic Left, political slander has always been part of its repertoire and the Minister's rhetoric last week comes straight out of its book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health in Opposition made the infamous statement, <Col N="276" />&ldquo;heads in baskets &mdash; that's what politics is all about&rdquo;.  I reject that crude political philosophy of which Minister Lowry up until now has been a keen disciple.  Politics is about public service, not prize fights.  I did not seek the resignation of the former Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, and the record will show that.  I did not seek the resignation of the former Minister, Deputy Coveney.  It is not my duty, but that of the Taoiseach, to seek the resignation of Minister Lowry. The long drawn out episode has damaged the authority and credibility of the Minister.  He has effectively bound himself up with Democratic Left and the Labour Party.  He will carry little authority with either management or trade unions in the semi-State sector. Deputies opposite know he was quite prepared to blacken their reputations, fairly or unfairly, if it had helped to save his face.  We know that there was chaos in his Department last week about which I could go on at length.  The Minister put his staff under pressure, made them suffer and used many outsiders in the process.  The Minister has not given a satisfactory explanation in that regard.</P>

      <P>Two worker directors of CIE have demanded that Minister Lowry apologise to the workers in the semi-State sector and he should have done so tonight.  Do the Labour Party and Democratic Left stand four-square behind a discredited Minister or do they stand with the semi-State workers?  The Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, or another member of the Labour Party, perhaps the Tánaiste, may answer that tomorrow night.  The Minister has also been prepared to blacken the names of honourable and respected business people.  The Progressive Democrats' motion has given another chance to answer some of the questions raised. The Minister has not given one answer, he is not interested in giving answers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a number of occasions this year the Fine Gael Party has shown that it is <Col N="277" /> woefully short of ministerial experience and wise heads.  Some of those who have the experience have been left languishing on the Fine Gael backbenches, many of whom are here tonight.  While I might not always have agreed with their viewpoints, they have experience and would not have allowed the Minister to get into this mess.  Since mid-September he had plenty of opportunities to make his position clear before a committee or in this House, but he refused to do so.  I do not understand why he will not answer the questions we keep putting to him.  Why will he not apologise to those who deserve it?  Why will he not be upfront and helpful to the House?  He appears to be trying to force Members to table a motion of no confidence in him.  Some of his handlers would appear to welcome such a motion, they believe the matter would rest there.  That will not happen.  Tomorrow night we will vote on this issue.</P>
    <P>I hope we will then enter into long and protracted discussions at the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored bodies during which we can seek to get answers.  If the Minister does not answer questions then, there is an option to table a motion of no confidence in him.  The Minister would save everybody a good deal of trouble if he decided to restore his credibility by answering the questions, stopped hiding behind <i>sub judice</i> rules, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Labour Party and spent less time asking the three Government parties to support him.  Others have had to come into this House to answer questions.  I have had to answer questions on Greencore, the former Minister, Deputy Cowen, had to answer questions on Galmoy and questions have had to be answered about many other matters.  About 60 questions have not been answered.  We have tabled them repeatedly, but the Minister could save a good deal of time if he answered them.</P>
    <P>There are many serious issues that must be faced up to in the semi-State sector.  The Minister only touched on a few of them tonight.  Perhaps he has not <Col N="278" /> had enough time or interest to study them or believes there is no point in addressing them.  It is up to the Taoiseach and his partners in Government to decide if they should retain a Minister who has lost all public confidence and whether they prefer to give him a fool's pardon, as they seem prepared to do.  I hope we will not face turbulence in the semi-State sector and a loss of business confidence.  It can be sorted out and, if the Minister or the Taoiseach do not do that, somebody must answer for it.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, management and workers have a great sense of responsibility, maybe far more than that held by the Minister.  I hope, before the end of this debate, some Member representing the Government can give us one good reason we will not be forced to go through the lobbies to vote no confidence in the Minister, in the coming days.  On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I ask the Minister to answer some of the questions on surveillance, cosy cartels, the maligning of business people and on several other issues he refused to answer.  If he does not do so we will have no option but to force a vote in this House, which we are reluctant to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>A catastrophic situation prevailed in Rwanda over one year ago.  The international community could and should have done more to prevent and &mdash; if not prevent &mdash; contain the tragic developments there.  A year later, in October 1995, the enormity of the disaster in Rwanda still exists.  History continues to repeat itself as the international community could and should do more.  The international community includes Ireland; it includes the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, who could and should do more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" /> A tragic humanitarian disaster will occur again.  This is a disgrace solely because the international community has not exercised its resources, its personnel, its politics, its heart in a manner that could contain the escalating crisis in Rwanda.  President Robinson recently visited Rwanda, as well as Zaire and Uganda.  The President first visited Rwanda in the aftermath of the genocide that ravaged that country last year. In excess of one million Rwandans died when the Hutu extremists in the Rwanda Government incited locals to kill members of the Tutsi minority of that country.</P>
    <P>More than 12 months later, a tragic land, yet again, presented its face to the President.  As a member of the international community and as a member of the UN the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, following the example set by the President, should stand up and be counted on the action or, perhaps, inaction of the Irish Government in relation to the nightmare conditions which bedevil Rwanda.  A litany of worrying trends highlight the fragility of the conditions of Rwanda and the complexity of the problem which remains to be faced.  Two very disturbing elements within Rwanda relate to the increasing infiltration of murder by the former Government in Rwanda and increased acts of violence carried out by organised gangs of hard-liners.  We must not let the international community or the Irish Government forget the plight of more than 1.5 million refugees still living in camps along the Rwandan border and the nightmare of the grossly over-crowded prison system, which is inhabited by many who have returned across the border.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs should urgently activate and encourage the EU and the UN to implement policies which will assist in restoring a new and just society to the people of Rwanda.  The delay in restoring a judicial system in Rwanda must be addressed by the international community, including the Irish Government, <Col N="280" /> as one of pressing concerns for the immediate and long-term future of Rwanda.</P>
    <P>I have highlighted in the House, over many months, the extremely unstable and deteriorating situation in Rwanda.  I have highlighted the hypocritical stance of EU member states who vehemently protest about human rights abuses and genocide in Rwanda and at the same time supply weapons, directly or indirectly, to participants in the conflict.</P>
    <P>In response to my questioning on Rwanda in the House in June 1995, the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, stated that a proposal existed which would enable money to be spent on rehabilitation in Rwanda.  Money needs to be spent now on rehabilitation, on development of infrastructure and on a judicial system so that they can restore a new and just society to Rwanda.  The Government, and especially the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs who has been particularly silent on this issue, must bring together the heads of the EU and the international community in a bid to slow and ultimately halt the ticking time bomb that is Rwanda today.</P>
    <P>The Rwandans deserve a new and a just society.  They have suffered.  The Irish Government must show the world that this continued suffering cannot and should not be tolerated.  Our President has given a fine example as a Head of State who is prepared to act; now this Government should do something similar. This bomb must not be allowed detonate Rwanda today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have only recently returned from visiting Rwanda where I accompanied President Robinson from 9 to 13 October.  I was impressed by what has been achieved by the Government and people of Rwanda.  People who do not know that part of Africa fail to appreciate that it is probably one of the most beautiful and fertile parts of this earth and being aware of the genocide which has been committed there <Col N="281" /> adds immeasurably to the sense of tragedy one feels in that country.</P>
      <P>Given that it is only a year since one of the greatest outrages of the 20th century occurred there, they have made considerable progress in reconstruction. Planting and agriculture are returning to normal.  However, the situation is fragile and much needs to be done to avert another disaster and to restore civil society.  While substantial international assistance will continue to be required to meet the humanitarian needs both within Rwanda and in the refugee camps on the borders, humanitarian assistance alone is not enough, it is not a substitute for a political settlement.  It is essential for Ireland to work with the international community to help bring about national reconciliation, reconstruction and rehabilitation.  In all of the high level contacts during the course of the visit we were thanked repeatedly for the work Ireland, the Irish Government, Irish NGOs, individuals and personnel have done at a number of different levels.</P>
      <P>Within the context of our EU membership and our forthcoming Presidency responsibilities, it is the Government's intention to make action on Rwanda and the Great Lakes region a continuing priority.  We will continue to pursue the following broad policy objectives in co-operation with the EU and the UN as well as with the Rwandan authorities: to encourage co-operation between the Governments and countries of the region to determine and implement concerted action on the underlying problems of the region; to encourage the return of the refugees and the provision of adequate conditions for them to return safely and with dignity; to encourage the international tribunal to start putting on trial those responsible for genocide at the earliest possible opportunity &mdash; one of the great failures of the international tribunal is that with one million people dead not one indictment had yet been issued &mdash; and to provide financial and other forms of assistance to help remedy humanitarian problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="282" /> The Government has long been a proponent of concerted international action in response to the problems of the Great Lakes region and is acutely aware of the fact that previous proposals, such as the plan of action adopted by the conference in Bujumbura last February, were not implemented.  Nevertheless, I welcome proposal for the holding of a Great Lakes Conference and those put forward for a number of high level mediators to facilitate a regional solution of the problems of Rwanda and Burundi.  This is probably the most positive suggestion to emerge recenlty.  The international tribunal, an essential part of the reconciliation process in Rwanda, has been slow to begin its work.  There is a problem with resourcing, determination and addressing the question of impunity.</P>
    <P>The Government places great emphasis on the importance of the implementation of policies by the international community and the provision of adequate assistance to enable the Rwandan authorities carry out measures necessary for the restoration of order.  The Government considers that the restoration of the judicial system in Rwanda is essential to the process of recovery and in this context we welcome the recent election of the Supreme Court of Rwanda which took place towards the end of our visit.  The restoration of the rule of law is one of the essential elements in creating favourable conditions for the return of refugees.  The international community is already seized of the need to restore the judiciary and the administration of justice and to improve the appalling conditions of Rwanda's prisons.</P>
    <P>I visit Butare prison last week where approximately 6,000 prisoners are being held in an area suitable for 1,000 prisoners. That would be the equivalent of 5,000 people standing in this Chamber shoulder to shoulder.  It was clearly impossible for the Rwandan justice system to deal with the numbers currently in prison, estimated at approximately 55,000 &mdash; in the past the system could have dealt with approximately 5,000 <Col N="283" /> people.  International assistance, therefore, will be essential to deal with this problem and we will continue to encourage the provision of this assistance.</P>
    <P>The Government has provided assistance to the human rights and justice sectors in Rwanda.  I have previously provided details of this in written replies to questions tabled by Deputies Shatter and Kitt on 20 September.</P>
    <P>In regions where we made extensive contacts, there was widespread admiration for the role Ireland played and will continue to play both at Government level and at NGO level, and individual Irish people working both with Irish and international agencies.</P>

      <P>On Wednesday, 11 October, my colleague, Deputy Flood, raised on the Adjournment the collapse of a court case involving badger baiting before the Dublin District Court.  During the course of her reply, the Minister gave a version of events which was flatly contradicted by the District Justice who heard the case.  That contradiction appeared in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 15 October and I will quote a passage from the relevant article:</P>
      <P>However, <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> has learnt that Judge Hogan strongly disputes this version of events and has contracted the Department of Justice to deny the Minister's claims.  He has also demanded that she withdraw her remarks within a week.</P>
      <P>The newspaper further states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Judge has indicated that unless he obtains satisfaction from Mrs. <Col N="284" /> Owen, he will make his views public in comments from the bench.</P>
    <P>In another article in the same edition of the newspaper, a distinguished retired Circuit Court Judge, Frank Martin, described the Minister's comments as being entirely at variance with the facts.</P>
    <P>It is now patently obvious that there is not any possibility that the two versions of events, that of the Minister and the District Justice, can be reconciled.  I ask the Minister, which version is correct?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister misled this House or is it her contention that an eminent and respected District Justice has sought to mislead the country? If the Minister has misled the House, does she intend to take the only honourable course open to her and resign? That is the only effective means open to her now to demonstrate that her Government's adherence to openness, transparency and accountability is more than merely verbal.  If the Minister has misled the Dáil in a matter of this magnitude, surely she does not intend to continue to cling to office hidden behind one of her officials.  It would be most peculiar if she sought to do so given her attitude and the attitude of other members of her party to this sort of behaviour when they were in office.  I wish to give some examples of that.</P>
      <P>In the Official Report for 15 November 1994, Column 39, Deputy John Bruton, who was in Opposition at the time, stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Arcon case the Minister was unwilling to take responsibility for decisions of his Department for which he was legally responsible under the Ministers and Secretaries Act and produced, not to the Dáil but to journalists, an official who took the rap.  This is another case of evasion of responsibility, by shoving the matter into the hands of officials who will now probably be moved and it will be <Col N="285" /> implied that they are truly responsible. That is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>As reported in the Official Report at Column 1136 of 27 October 1994, Deputy Owen, in Opposition at the time, stated: &ldquo;Under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 ... a Minister is responsible for everything that happens in his or her Department&rdquo;.  At Column 1138 of the same Official Report, the Deputy also stated: &ldquo;The Minister is a coward and he is hiding behind his civil servants&rdquo;.</P>

The buck stops with the Minister&rdquo;.  At Column 1139 of the same Official Report, Deputy Gay Mitchell, also in Opposition at the time, stated: &ldquo;The Minister is hiding behind civil servants, an act of political cowardice&rdquo;.  In the same volume of the Official Report, Deputy Mitchell called for a contempt of parliament Act under which those who mislead this House, particularly office-holders, should be severely dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister's version of events last week was incorrect, any attempt by her to hide behind her officials in this matter will be &ldquo;government by scapegoat&rdquo; and will be utterly unacceptable in the light of her remarks and those of her colleagues &mdash; and there are many more <Col N="286" /> where they came from &mdash; and also in the light of the high standards set by the Taoiseach for his Government on the day he assumed office.  This Government came to office espousing transparency and accountability.  To date, it has exhibited all the transparency and accountability of a Vatican conclave.

      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to set out to the House in detail the circumstances surrounding this matter.  On Wednesday, 11 October 1995, Deputy Chris Flood raised the following matter on the Adjourment: &ldquo;The seizure by gardaí of a number of dogs at Dublin Port suffering horrific injuries and the subsequent collapse of the court case against three named individuals&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As is normal practice, a report was immediately requested by my Department from the Garda authorities and duly obtained.  The report set out the sequence of events leading to the arrest of the three persons in question and the subsequent court case.  It appears there was some discussion in the court about where the alleged offences took place. The report stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Sergeant argued on behalf of the State that the charges were adequate in substance and urged the <Col N="287" /> Judge to exercise his power of amendment to read &ldquo;within the State&rdquo; if he were not entirely satisfied.  The Judge refused the Garda's application and struck out the cases.</P>
    <P>My response to the Deputy in the Dáil that evening was, in accordance with normal practice, based on the Garda report supplied, including the above reference to the prosecuting sergeant asking the presiding judge to amend the charges.</P>
    <P>However, on the following day, Thursday, 12 October 1995, it came to my attention that the Garda report received by my Department may have been incorrect in so far as this point was concerned.  Accordingly, I asked my Department to request the Garda authorities to re-examine the matter urgently.  These inquiries concluded earlier today and I have now received a detailed report from the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>The report fully accepts that the prosecuting sergeant did not ask the presiding judge to amend the charges.  It transpires that the prosecuting sergeant had made a verbal report on the afternoon of 10 October to an inspector who, subsequently, wrote a short synopsis of that conversation.  Unfortunately, in the synopsis, the details of the submission made by the prosecuting sergeant to the presiding judge were misinterpreted by the inspector who prepared the report. It was incorrectly recorded that the sergeant had asked the judge to amend the charges.  However, as I have stated, this was not the case.  There was discussion in the court about the court's jurisdiction but, contrary to the understanding of the inspector on whose report my answer to the Dáil was based, the prosecuting sergeant did not ask the judge to amend the charges.</P>

      <P>I have already been in touch with the Judge to convey my regrets that I made a statement based on inaccurate information from the Garda.  I regret also that I inadvertently conveyed information to the Dáil which was not accurate.</P>
      <P>I also wish to take this opportunity to deal with a question raised by Deputy Chris Flood as to why the three persons were not rearrested following the striking out of the charges.  From today's report, the prosecuting sergeant states that he did not attempt to rearrest as (a) the persons immediately left the court room, (b) in view of the questions raised about jurisdiction, he believed that the best course of action was to prepare a file and await the directions of the State solicitor and (c) to effect a lawful arrest he would have been obliged to obtain individual warrants from the courts and time did not permit this.  In addition to these reasons, I am informed that official Garda instructions, dating from November 1993, stress the need in cases where the question of rearrest might arise to submit a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions for direction before proceedings are recommenced.  This instruction is, I understand, based on consultations which took place with the DPP's office and I have asked the Commissioner to clarify with the Director the propriety of applying this instruction in cases where urgent action is clearly required.</P>
      <P>I have impressed on the Garda authorities the absolute necessity of providing accurate reports in matters of this kind so as to avoid the confusion which arose in this case.</P>

      <P>Yesterday evening we heard the inevitable news that 126 temporary lay-offs in Donegal Rubber Limited would become permanent redundancies from 1 December next.  This is regrettable given that Ballyshannon is already an unemployment blackspot.</P>
      <P>Donegal Rubber Limited which has been based in Ballyshannon for many years has unfortunately had to succumb to market pressures which have led to decreasing orders for car components.  It is regrettable that only 65 jobs will be retained in this plant which was set up by a German company.  I impress upon the Minister the need to secure the 65 remaining jobs and to ensure that the IDA follows through on its contacts to attract another investor in the company. He will have to work in conjunction with Údarás na Gaeltachta in this regard but I ask him to please ensure that there is a new investor in this company.</P>
      <P>I also ask him to again consider setting up a task force in Ballyshannon with a view to attracting investment into the area.  This town has not benefited from the peace process and there is an opportunity to tap into many of the resources made available as a result of the peace in Northern Ireland.  I would appreciate if his Department and Údarás na Gaeltachta worked with the local communities in attracting industry to Ballyshannon which has many benefits such as a national primary road, an electricity supply and many other attributes necessary for investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I implore the Minister to ensure there is proper investment in Ballyshannon which unfortunately will also have to deal with a reduction in the labour force <Col N="290" /> in the ESB station.  The loss of these 126 jobs in Donegal Rubber Limited is indicative of the lack of investment in the north west region.  The great work carried out by one international company, Fruit of the Loom, distorts the IDA figures.  I ask the Minister to secure the jobs still in existence in Donegal Rubber Limited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my constituency colleague, Deputy Coughlan, for sharing her time with me.  I too was dismayed by the announcement yesterday evening that 126 workers in Donegal Rubber Limited in Ballyshannon will be made redundant.  When the announcement was made at the end of August I immediately contacted the Minister's office.  I pay tribute to him for acting so promptly at that time and for getting in touch with the development agencies, mainly the IDA and Forbairt.  Those organisations have informed the Minister that they are monitoring the situation in Ballyshannon and doing everything possible to save these jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two priorities in so far as Ballyshannon is concerned.  First, the remaining 65 jobs in Donegal Rubber Limited should be protected and every support should be provided by the IDA in identifying a new investor and helping the company to survive.  Sometimes it is much easier and more important to maintain jobs than to create new jobs. The second priority must be to attract new industry into Ballyshannon which has a skilled workforce, excellent educational facilities and a national primary route which is an attraction for potential investors.  The town commissioners and the development association are very responsible and, with the goodwill of the Department and the development agencies, it should be possible to attact a new industry into the town to take up the slack and relieve the problems caused by unemployment.  Údarás na Gaeltachta which has an interest in this industry also has a role to play in this regard.  I have been assured that there is co-operation between the IDA and workers and I hope we will be able to <Col N="291" /> deliver good news to the people of Ballyshannon who have suffered more than most areas in County Donegal in recent years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concerns of the Deputies about this matter. The Donegal Rubber plant has been in operation in Ballyshannon since 1978.  I fully appreciate that any threat to the future of the company is a matter of considerable concern not just to the workers at the plant but to the Ballyshannon area.  The company plans to introduce a redundancy programme which will affect 126 full-time and parttime workers and it will shortly commence consultations with worker representatives regarding the nature of the prospective redundancy package.  These measures have mainly been brought about by a difficult sales position and fierce competition in the European car industry.  Donegal Rubber Limited competes in the very highly competitive lower margin segment of the rubber auto components market.</P>
      <P>The world recession in the car industry in recent years has led to increasingly intense competition in the sector.  I have been advised by the IDA that Donegal Rubber Limited, in conjunction with the IDA, is endeavouring to find an investor for its Ballyshannon operation, to strengthen its market share and secure the remaining jobs. The company has stated that it is determined, with the co-operation of others, to secure the plant for the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Decisions affecting the future of Donegal Rubber Limited are, in the final analysis, a matter for the company and its parent in Germany.  I have no direct function in such matters.  I have asked the IDA to continue to work with the companies in an effort to achieve the best possible outcome for Donegal Rubber Limited and for employment in the area.  I fully share the Deputies' concerns and will impress upon the IDA <Col N="292" /> the need to pursue new investors for the plant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan raised the issue of a task force for the Ballyshannon area to attract investment.  The State agencies are committed to supporting initiatives in County Donegal, particularly in the Ballyshannon area.  I do not see fruitful progress being made by setting up task forces because, increasingly, there would be a demand to set up a task force for every town in the country. This would dissipate the efforts of the State agencies.</P>
    <P>The IDA and Forbairt are committed to working with the voluntary agencies, including the development association, the town commission and the county enterprise board on which Forbairt is represented to attract industry to the area.  I will draw their attention to the acute concerns of the Deputies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to outline the steps being taken by his Department and the IDA to find a purchaser for the Ireprod factory in Killarney which is due to close with the loss of 75 jobs.  The imminent closure of this factory is another blow to the town where the unemployment problem is serious.</P>
      <P>Ireprod Limited was established in December 1990 and employed between 90 and 100 at peak times.  The parent company has decided to close the plant and transfer all operations to France.  It appears to the people of Killarney and the staff in this industry that neither the Department nor the IDA has made serious efforts to attract a replacement industry.  This industry was granted a four month reprieve recently and its closure is now imminent on 29 February 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eighty per cent of those employed are under 30 years of age and a number are married.  Others are due to get married and many are already paying mortgages. This industry consists of a sewing section, metal fabrication area, paint <Col N="293" /> plant section and two assembly lines.  At one time there were four assembly lines. The staff are young and highly skilled. I ask the Minister to impress upon the Department and the IDA the urgent need to attact a replacement industry.</P>
    <P>We all know what happened to the Pretty Polly factory.  On Wednesday, 21 June last in a debate on the serious unemployment problem confronting the country I explained that there were approximately 1,500 people registered as unemployed in the Killarney area. The Pretty Polly factory was allowed to close with the full knowledge and consent of the Minister, the Department and the IDA.  This was a massive blow not only to the 152 employees but also the business community and the local economy.  Following the closure of Pretty Polly, the loss of Ireprod is a further bitter blow.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, many observers take the view that, because of the heavy investment in tourism and the success of the tourism sector, there is no need for industrial development in the Killarney area.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  While I accept the season is now longer, it must be borne in mind that the industry is seasonal in nature.  This has a knock-on effect in the town during the winter months.</P>
    <P>Last June I asked the Minister to set up a special task force for Killarney in order to resolve the serious unemployment problem in the area, but he rejected my proposal completely.  I ask him again to do so.  Such a task force would work closely with the State agencies to maximise the job opportunities.</P>
    <P>The live register includes many well educated young people with great knowledge in the various areas of high technology.  The experience and tremendous capacity of the Ireprod employees should also be of assistance to the State agencies in their efforts to maximise job opportunities and to attract a replacement industry for the Ireprod factory.</P>
    <P>The special task force would assist voluntary organisations in the area, such as the UDC, the Killarney Chamber of Commerce, SIPTU, the Killarney <Col N="294" /> Resource Group, the Killarney Job Creation Forum and others who are doing their best to attract industry to the area, but they lack the necessary finance and expertise to travel abroad to canvass prospective industries.  That is the reason a special task force should be established.</P>
    <P>The failure of the IDA to fill a 25,000 sq. ft. advance factory in the industrial estate in Ballyspillane must be questioned. What emphasis do the Minister and the Department place on the final destination of industrialists attracted to this country to set up businesses?  Is it the Minister's intention to find a purchaser for the Ireprod factory in Killarney, the closure of which is imminent with the loss of 75 jobs, and what efforts are being made by the IDA and the Department to fill the vacant factory space in Killarney town in industrial buildings built by Fianna Fáil?</P>
    <P>The IDA has a negative attitude towards Killarney.  The bottom line is that the number of persons employed in manufacturing industries in Killarney has dropped from 1,600 to 700 within 12 months.  The Minister has done nothing to resolve this problem.  I ask him to find a purchaser for the Ireprod factory as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireprod is a French-owned company which acquired the former Kiddieproof factory in Killarney in 1991 for the production of child care products.  I understand that the company has been experiencing trading difficulties for some time past which have adversely affected its performance and financial position and resulted in the lay off of some workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Efforts to put the Killarney operation on a sounder and more viable basis have not been successful.  Accordingly, the parent company has decided to phase out production at the Killarney plant early in 1996.  The company has agreed to this timetable with a view to allowing IDA Ireland time to market the plant as a going concern or to attract an alternative project to the factory.  In this connection everything possible is being <Col N="295" /> done with the objective of safeguarding employment at the plant.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the need for the provision of additional significant employment opportunities in the Killarney area, particularly because of the job losses in the area during the past year or so, including the closure of the Pretty Polly factory and the consequential adverse effects on employment and the local economy.</P>
    <P>The industrial development agencies are redoubling their efforts to promote the establishment and expansion of projects in the Killarney area.  In this regard every effort is being made to ensure an early and favourable outcome.  I am confident that the obvious attractions of Killarney and the co-operative efforts of all the interests concerned will facilitate the attraction of much needed new investment and jobs to the area.</P>
    <P>The Deputy again suggested the establishment of a task force for the area.  As I indicated to his party colleague, Deputy Coughlan, who suggested the establishment of a task force <Col N="296" /> for the Ballyshannon area, the difficulty is that if a task force was established in every area where a particular company was experiencing difficulty, the country would be dotted with task forces and the efforts of the IDA would be dissipated. I would prefer to work with the established networks.</P>
    <P>The IDA has good relations with the local community.  It is committed to working with them and to redoubling its efforts.  Since the closure of Pretty Polly it has been arranging visits to that factory and is determined to attract an alternative project for the Ireprod factory or find a buyer for it as a going concern. That is the best way forward.  I will draw the attention of the State agencies to the Deputy's acute concerns and insist that they maintain their strong efforts to maximise job opportunities in Killarney.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 18 October 1995.</P>

      <P>I should like to assure the Deputy that my Department's overriding objective in relation to ro-ro passenger safety is to ensure that the highest standards of safety are set and enforced.  To this end, the necessary legislative measures to give effect to the most up-to-date internationally recognised safety standards have been adopted and implemented by the State.  These standards are under a continuous process of review and upgrading, as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="62" /> Irish-registered passenger vessels are subjected annually to thorough inspection by the Department's marine survey office for the renewal of their passenger and safety certificates.  These vessels are required to be equipped, maintained and inspected to the highest international standards.  Foreign-registered vessels using Irish ports are also inspected regularly by marine survey office staff in the exercise of Ireland's port State control obligations.</P>
    <P>There is a large international dimension to maritime safety legislation and the Conventions of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) are the centre piece of maritime safety regulation internationally.  Following the <i>Estonia</i> tragedy in September 1994, the IMO ordered a thoroughgoing review of all aspects of ro-ro passenger ferry safety.  This review was carried out on a priority basis by an international panel of experts, which presented its report to the IMO in May of this year.  The panel has recommended amendments to a number of IMO Conventions, namely, the International Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), the Maritime Search and Rescue Convention (SAR) and the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping of Seafarers (STCW).</P>
    <P>The report of the panel of experts is to be considered and discussed in detail at the meeting of the assembly of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in London next month.  Ireland has already indicated its support for the broad thrust of the panel of experts recommendations, and I can assure the Deputy that I will not accept safety standards on Irish vessels, or on foreignflagged vessels operating in and out of our ports, which are inferior to the highest standards decreed by the IMO.</P>
    <P>I might add, in conclusion, the Irish passenger ferries have an excellent and longstanding safety record, and I and my officials at the Department of the Marine will continue our efforts to ensure that this is maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>None of the vessels detained for illegal fishing in Irish waters during 1994 or to date this year were found to have secret fish storage compartments.  This compares with 1993 when 16 vessels detained by the Naval-Service were found to have concealed fish holds. Some of these vessels had undersized fish stored in the hidden holds while others contained undeclared catch or nets of undersize mesh.  In the resultant prosecutions fines and forfeitures in excess of £370,000 wer imposed by the courts.</P>
      <P>The Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1994 has provided for substantial penalties for serious breaches of fishery laws including secret holds for which specific offence there are penalties of up to £200,000.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the deterrent effect of the heavy penalties (the highest in Europe) together with tight enforcement and a very effective detection record by the Naval Service is driving the message home to would-be offenders that secret holds are no longer worth the risk.  The statistics which I quoted earlier vividly confirm this.  That being said, we have not, and will not, relax our vigilance on this front or indeed in the overall ongoing effort to ensure that all vessels fishing in Irish waters comply with the rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="64" /> Ireland has been at the forefront in the EU in pressing for tighter controls and I look forward at the Fisheries Council next week to agreeing with colleagues the new rigorous control regime which will apply in Western waters from next year as well as an overall envelope of EU funding support for the costs of surveillance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, an emergency aid scheme was introduced in April 1994 in order to compensate fishermen and boat owners for loss of earnings arising from prolonged bad weather during a 20 week period from November 1993 to March 1994.</P>
      <P>A key objective of the scheme was to ensure that crew members who had suffered genuine hardship and who were not otherwise eligible for payments under Social Welfare schemes would be compensated for loss of earnings during the period.  Payments to crew members were based on what would have been the appropriate rate of support available under the Social Welfare unemployment assistance scheme.  In calculating payments to individual crew members account was taken of such matters as family dependants, income from fishing and from other sources and any Social Welfare payments received. The maximum payment that an individual crew member could receive was equivalent to what would have been his full entitlement under the Social Welfare system, had he been eligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to point out that at the time of the announcement of the scheme it was clearly signalled that payments to crew members were designed to bring their income up to the level of <Col N="65" /> Social Welfare unemployment assistance. In the administration of the scheme and in the consideration of appeals from crew members, the scheme's criteria were interpreted as flexibly as possible to ensure maximum payments within these parameters. However, no crew member would have received payments in excess of the maximum rate of unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>I have every confidence in the future of the Irish fishing industry and in the ability of Irish fishermen and processors to rise to the challenges facing the sector. I am committed to working with the industry to meet those challenges.</P>
      <P>The EU Common Fisheries Policy is concerned with the orderly management of the industry and the conservation of EU stocks so as to ensure a future for the fishing industry.  The main policy instruments used in the Common Fisheries Policy are fleet capacity reductions and quotas.  Despite the constraints substantial progress has been made in recent years to enhance the economic contribution of the Irish fishing industry within the overall framework of the Common Fisheries Policy.</P>
      <P>The operational programme for fisheries is providing for a total investment of £140 million in the industry in the period 1994-99 and will help to create up to 2,000 new jobs in processing and aquaculture, while maintaining jobs in the catching sector.  To improve the efficiency and age profile of the fleet over £11 million has been earmarked for boat modernisation and the decommissioning scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A thriving processing sector is the key <Col N="66" /> in many ways to the long-term prosperity of the fishing industry.  Increased demand for supplies of raw material will significantly underpin the economic viability of the catching sector.  The Government's investment strategy for the processing sector has sought to underline this reality.</P>
    <P>The single most serious threat to the future of the fishing industry worldwide and here at home is the depletion of fish stocks through over fishing.  We must take a long-term view.  Conservation of the resource requires careful management and constant vigilance in protecting and monitoring stock levels.  Ireland has been at the forefront in seeking to ensure that EU regulations optimise the management and conservation of the resource and in pressing for tighter controls.</P>
    <P>At next week's Fisheries Council I will again be stressing the vital need for unequivocal commitment by all member states to the conservancy and management principles, backed up by strict enforcement to ensure the long-term future of the industry.  I know that I have the welcome support of the Irish fishing industry in pursuing those aims.</P>
    <P>With their support I will continue to pursue policies both at national and EU level which will offer the best guarantee for sustainable development.  The bleak results of over fishing elsewhere leading to the closure of fisheries and fleets tied up, send us a clear message.  We must make sure that everyone gets the message and that we put in place positive steps to ensure the future of the industry.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied with the current deployment of 24 hour search and rescue facilities along the west coast which is in line with the recommendations of the Doherty Review Group on Air/Sea Rescue Services.</P>
      <P>In co-ordinating Marine Emergency Management for the west coast and elsewhere the Irish Marine Emergency Service draws on the many 24 hour declared facilities including co-ordination and marine radio communications network, helicopters, coast and cliff rescue service units, the many purpose-built lifeboats operated by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and units of the community inshore rescue service.</P>
      <P>The Irish Marine Emergency Service keeps the disposition of all these services under continuous review, in consultation with the other bodies involved, with the objective of optimising their use within the general search and rescue structure.  This ensures full compliance with our national and international obligations.</P>

      <P>Aquaculture offers important development opportunities for those coastal regions with few, if any, alternative prospects for employment.  It is still a relatively young industry in Irish terms but has grown quickly in the last 15 years to where it now accounts for 25 per cent of the value of our total fish production.  Over one thousand people are employed full time in aquaculture with a further three thousand in part time jobs.  Total output was valued at approximately £50 million in 1994.  BIM and Údarás na Gaeltachta are the agencies charged with developing the sector.</P>
      <P>Some 80 per cent of Irish aquaculture production is exported and has a high quality reputation.  The strategic objective over the medium term is to build on our strengths and success to date, over-come competitive constraints and address the ongoing challenges of quality, scale and peripherality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further growth in traditional as well as new niche markets is an achievable objective and I am committed to working with the agencies and the industry to maximise the undoubted potential.  The continued expansion of primary production and market development is being supported under an investment programme of some £40 million, over the period 1994-1999.  This is designed to support sustainable expansion of aquaculture output, productivity and jobs and to meet the growing need for raw material for the expanding processing sector.  The objective is to more <Col N="70" /> than double output by 1999 and to increase total value of fish exports, including aquaculture products, from £186 million to £276 million by 1999.</P>
    <P>A strategic fully integrated approach to market development and promotion is critical to achieving further export growth.  The export market programme focuses on increasing the penetration of seafood markets both inside and outside the EU.  Programmes are also geared to increasing the consumption of seafood on the home market.</P>
    <P>There is considerable potential for market growth.  The EU, after all, is a net importer of fish products.  A competitive, efficient, high quality Irish aquaculture and fish processing industry will ensure that we are well placed to capitalise on those opportunities. Present strategies are geared to achieving that growth potential and will be kept under constant review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 46 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994 to 1999 some £5.1 million is being invested in priority coastal protection works.  In order to identify projects for possible funding under the operational programme, all coastal local authorities were invited to submit details of their top four priority proposals.  Donegal County Council submitted proposals for coastal protection works at seven locations, costing a total of £1.041 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I am sure the Deputies will understand, the total cost of all the works proposed by the various local authorities far exceeds the funding that is available to 1999.  Therefore, all coastal local authorities were advised that there were no guarantees that any of the proposals submitted would be aided by the <Col N="72" /> Department under the operational programme. That being said, it is the Department's intention to address as many of the priority proposals as possible in the context of the funds available.</P>
    <P>All the proposals submitted to the Department by the coastal local authorities have been examined and in general they meet eligibility criteria.  Arising from the examination of the proposals and discussions with local authorities a number of projects, costing some £735,000, have been identified for undertaking in 1995.  These protection works are being undertaken directly by the local authorities and are being 75 per cent aided under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services. The projects being undertaken this year represent the start of efforts to help coastal local authorities to address priority works.  This process will continue next year and each year thereafter until 1999.</P>
    <P>I would like to make specific reference to Donegal and my recent visit there.  My visit was undertaken to see at first hand the situation at a number of piers and harbours and meet with local interests rather than to visit locations suffering from erosion.  That being said, I am aware of the erosion problem both nationally and specifically at the locations identified by Donegal County Council.</P>
    <P>The proposals submitted by Donegal County Council have not been aided this year, nor indeed have proposals submitted by Louth, Cork, Waterford and a number of other county councils. But as I have said, the process of addressing priority works is ongoing and all locations identified by the local authorities will be considered over the period of the operational programme. Therefore, the fact that no works are being aided in County Donegal in 1995 does not mean that works will not be aided in 1996 or subsequent years.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have referred to the fact that the total value of the proposals identified by the coastal local authorities far exceeds the funding available <Col N="73" /> under the operational programme.  In view of this and the seriousness of the erosion problem around our coast, I will be making every effort to secure increased funding for this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of single strand monafilament netting in commercial salmon fishing has been prohibited since 1965.  The Salmon Review Group, which reported in 1987, proposed that suspension of the ban on monafilament netting could be considered, but strictly in the context of full compliance with a significantly enhanced conservation and management regime for commercial salmon fishing.</P>
      <P>I remain to be convinced that there is, in all the circumstances, a compelling case for relaxation of the ban on monafilament. In any event it is clear to me that a further thoroughgoing review of salmon management strategies is required in light of international and national developments since 1987 and with full regard for the interests of those with legitimate rights in salmon exploitation, be they commercial or angling. This review is under way.</P>
      <P>The long-term aim of policy is to maximise, on a sustainable basis, the value to the economy of the wild salmon resource.  The basic premise underlying policy is that the balance of advantage on conservation, environmental and economic grounds will lie increasingly with redirecting salmon stocks from interceptory offshore commercial exploitation towards recreational fishing. This is supported by the international experience and trends which are driven by the conservation imperative.</P>
      <P>To take the review forward we are establishing a small task force to recommend on the necessary management and conservation strategies in line with these overall policy objectives.  The task force will consult widely with all relevant interests.  As part of its assessment of measures to manage and contain legal fishing effort, the task force will be reviewing the need for changes in the regulations relating to the nets and gears used by commercial salmon fishermen. Any such changes would have to be consistent with overall aims and objectives.</P>

      <P>Under European Union fleet policy the capacity of member states' fishing fleets is constrained by decisions taken in the context of the multiannual guidance programmes for the EU fishing fleet (MAGP's) which in Ireland's case requires a reduction of 4,000 tonnes by the end of 1996.</P>
      <P>Against this background, our sea-fishing boat licensing policy has to be geared to control entry to the fleet. Licences can only be approved on the basis of withdrawal of capacity from the Sea Fishing Boat Register at least equal to the capacity of proposed new boats.</P>
      <P>The overall capacity constraint, which is designed to bring fishing activity into better balance with available resources, does not however preclude development and modernisation of the sector as is evidenced in the success in recent years of the Irish pelagic fleet.</P>
      <P>Many young people are still entering the industry.  BIM have comprehensive training programmes for new entrants to the industry and for upgrading the skills of those already in the industry. Training is carried out at the national training centre in Greencastle and at other key fishing locations around the country.</P>
      <P>The investment programmes for modernisation of the existing fleet and the current decommissioning scheme are geared to improving the structure and age profile of the fleet within overall capacity constraints.

      <P>The development of the ferry terminal at Dún Laoghaire Harbour was identified as a priority in the development plan for the harbour at the time of publication in 1992.  The installation of new passenger terminal facilities has been completed recently.  Work will continue into the new year on berthing and other facilities.</P>
      <P>Comprehensive consultation with harbour users has elicited some possible projects for development of leisure and recreational facilities.  Information obtained from detailed site investigation studies has been made available to various parties which had indicated an interest in developing recreational facilities in the harbour.  To date, however, none of these has advanced sufficiently to proceed through the planning process.</P>
      <P>A commitment was given at the time of the planning application for the new ferry terminal development, to decommission the Carlisle Pier from ferry operations by December 1997.  This commitment was reflected in the condition attached to the planning permission granted for the development.</P>
      <P>The development of the Carlisle Pier, therefore, is contingent on the transfer of the ferry operation to the new facilities and consideration is being given to the development options available.</P>

      <P>The construction of the Loran C radio navigation station at Loop Head has not commenced due to a lengthy planning and legal process and there has, therefore, been no expenditure to date in this regard.  A recent High Court judgment held that the Commissioners of Irish <Col N="79" /> Lights, who are acting as agents for the Department of the Marine in this matter, do not have the necessary legal powers to undertake the construction of the Loran C station.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully share the Deputy's concerns in this matter.  The Deputy will be aware of the Government's strong opposition to the reprocessing facility at Sellafield. Our concerns about the shipment of spent nuclear fuel and plutonium through the Irish Sea are fundamental ones.  The implications of an accident or collision need no spelling out by me to this House.</P>
      <P>At present such shipments are governed by the requirements of the International Maritime Organisation Code on the Safe Carriage of Irradiated Nuclear Fuels known as the INF Code. Before direct shipments can begin these requirements must be met and registered as such with the United Kingdom's Marine Safety Agency. However, in my view, the requirements themselves are deficient and I wish to inform the Deputy and the House of the steps which I am undertaking to have them changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The INF Code, drawn up jointly by <Col N="80" /> the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) requires that the ships used be of a special type and construction, be in full compliance with the Safety of Life at Sea Convention, 1974, as amended, and the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code of that Convention and meet strict requirements as regards damage stability, fire protection, temperature control of cargo spaces, radiological protection equipment and management, training and shipboard emergency plans etc.  Each ship must hold a document from its Flag Administration indicating full compliance with all requirements.  The IMO adopted the code at its 18th Assembly in November 1993.</P>
    <P>The following deficiencies have been identified in the Code relating to the handling of the most hazardous of all dangerous cargoes transported by sea:</P>
    <P>&mdash; no route planning or notification/consultation with coastal and island states en route on the movement of vessels carrying nuclear cargoes;</P>
    <P>&mdash; no restriction or exclusion of certain routes;</P>
    <P>&mdash; no emergency response preparedness and reaction to emergencies should they arise along the route;</P>
    <P>&mdash; lack of data on the actual cargoes being carried;</P>
    <P>&mdash; lack of hazard assessment of nuclear cargoes or proper evaluation of the flasks used in transport;</P>
    <P>&mdash; lack of salvage equipment capable of retrieving either ship or nuclear cargo in the event of an accident occurring, particularly if the ship were to sink in deep water;</P>
    <P>&mdash; no means of locating nuclear cargoes which might be lost from the ship (or the ship itself) in the event of an accident; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; no liability regime for compensatory damages in the event of an <Col N="81" /> incident involving nuclear cargoes or leakage therefrom.</P>
    <P>These issues are complementary to the code and I am giving them my full attention at present.</P>
    <P>I am actively seeking to have some if not all of these deficiencies remedied at as early a date as possible and already my Department has instituted steps to have them looked at through the mechanism of IMO which is the international body responsible for such matters. There is a meeting of IMO next month which I propose to attend personally to advance the matter and I hope to meet IMO's Secretary-General in advance of the meeting to the same end.</P>
    <P>I am also seeking provisions for improved reporting arrangements for vessels transiting the territorial waters of EU member states generally and in particular I am seeking amendments of the HAZMAT Directive which governs the movement by ship of hazardous materials in European waters.  As the Deputy knows, it is Government policy, not to admit entry to an Irish port of any vessel carrying nuclear materials and in line with that policy I decided earlier this year to refuse entry to Dublin port of a vessel carrying nuclear materials.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office includes estimates of incomes earned in the black economy in the Gross Domestic Product.  When necessary, the basic data on incomes are adjusted upwards to incorporate estimates for hidden economic activity.  An example is the adjustment made for non-reporting and under-recording of incomes by self-employed traders where the basic data on incomes are derived from the tax collection system.  These incomes are grossed using factors calculated by comparing the numbers of self-employed recorded in the Census of Population and Labour Force Surveys with the numbers making tax returns.</P>
      <P>Income earned from black economy activities is also indirectly captured in other components of the GDP.  For instance, the labour supply approach used to estimate wages and salaries will capture earnings not reported to the tax authorities.  Also, income from agriculture is measured indirectly using the so-called output approach and is not dependent on the tax declarations of farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland is contributing actively to international action against the scourge of landmines, particularly anti-personnel landmines.  Our approach reflects our opposition to the indiscriminate nature, production, stockpiling, use and trade of anti-personnel landmines.  We are working to foster agreement on the objective of a total ban on this category of weapons. <Col N="86" /> In this context, in 1994 Ireland co-sponsored Resolution 49/75D of the United Nations General Assembly which enshrines the eventual elimination of anti-personnel landmines as the ultimate goal of international efforts to solve the problem.  We will continue to co-sponsor UN resolutions which promote this objective.</P>
      <P>Ireland deposited its instrument of ratification of the Inhumance Weapons Convention on 13 March 1995 and participated as a State Party in the review conference on the convention which took place in Vienna from 25 September to 13 October.  Ireland worked with others at the conference to strengthen and enlarge to the maximum extent possible the prohibitions and restrictions on the use of landmines contained in the convention and its Second Protocol which relates to landmines. The Irish delegation also co-sponsored proposals for the inclusion of provisions prohibiting or restricting the transfer of landmines and worked to extend the scope of the Protocol to non-international conflicts, to include provisions on verification and to provide for regular reviews of implementation in the future.</P>
      <P>Some progress was made during the conference towards agreement on practical steps which would reduce the negative impact of landmines on civilians and facilitate the task of mine clearance in the wake of conflicts.  However, the substantive positions of States Parties have not yet converged sufficiently to permit consensus on a strengthened Protocol.  The review conference will therefore resume to continue its work in January and again in April-May 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A strengthened Protocol will have to reconcile the perceptions of many countries, developed and developing, of the role of landmines in their national security policies on the one hand and the imperative humanitarian need to end the indiscriminate use of landmines on the other.  As the sole international instrument which imposes legally binding obligations on states relating to the use of landmines, Protocol 2 to the <Col N="87" /> Inhumane Weapons Convention has the potential to play a pivotal role in addressing the landmines problem. Together with its EU partners, Ireland attaches high priority to strengthening Protocol 2 and will continue to work actively to that end.</P>
    <P>The House will wish to be aware that Ireland contributed £400,000 in bilateral support for demining activities in 1994. In addition to maintaining this level of funding for bilateral demining activities in 1995, Ireland will also make an initial contribution of £100,000 to the UN Voluntary Trust Fund for Demining.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the supply of arms to factions in Liberia and Sierra Leone has been of serious concern to the Government and to the international community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerning Liberia, the Government strongly welcomed the UN Security Council Resolution 985 of 13 April 1995, which urged all states, and in particular neighbouring states, to comply fully with the embargo on all deliveries of weapons and military equipment to Liberia imposed by Resolution 788 (1992).  In Resolution 985 the Security Council established a Committee of the Security Council which would seek from all states information regarding the action taken by them concerning the effective implementation of the embargo imposed by Resolution 788; consider any information brought to its attention by states concerning violations of the embargo, and in that context to make recommendations to the Council <Col N="88" /> on ways of increasing the effectiveness of the embargo; and recommend appropriate measures in response to violations of the embargo.</P>
    <P>Security Council Resolution 1014 of 15 September 1995 reminded all states of their obligations to comply strictly with the embargo on all deliveries of weapons and military equipment to Liberia, and to bring all instances of violations of the arms embargo before the committee set up under Resolution 985.</P>
    <P>The Security Council is therefore actively seized of this question and it would be the responsibility of the Council to determine the actions to be taken in response to breanches of the embargo.</P>
    <P>I would also stress that agreement to end the nearly six-year-old civil war in Liberia has been reached with the signing of a peace agreement between the principal parties in Abuja, Nigeria, on 19 August last.  The process of demobilishing Liberia's estimated 50,000 to 60,000 combatants is a critical factor in the peace process.  The United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia, UNOMIL, in consultation with the transitional government, and other organisations, has established a task force on disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of the ex-combatants into civilian life. Ireland supported the issuing by the EU of a statement which welcomed the signing of the Abuja agreement.</P>
    <P>In regard to Sierra Leone, Ireland has raised the question of the supply of arms with our partners in the EU and we have made known the concern of the Government at the situation in that country and at the reports of widespread anarchy there in recent months. Ireland supported the EU declaration of 18 May 1995 which welcomed the decision of the Sierra Leone Government to work for the achievement of a cease-fire and a peaceful settlement of the conflict.</P>
    <P>Attempts to bring the conflict to an end continue with the involvement of the United Nations and there are hopes that the rebel Revolutionary United Front, RUF, will soon come to talks <Col N="89" /> with representatives of the Government. Presidential and parliamentary elections are due to be held next February. There are also indications that one result of the Abuja agreement has been to reduce greatly the supply of arms to the rebels in Sierra Leone.</P>
    <P>As a general principle, Ireland strives to promote increased transparency and restraint in arms exports within the United Nations as well as within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that relief in respect of home care, subject to a maximum of £5,000, is available only to a taxpayer who employs a person to care for the taxpayer or his-her spouse who is totally incapacitated by physical or mental infirmity throughout the year of assessment.</P>
      <P>This relief does not apply in this case. There are, however, other reliefs for unreimbursed medical expenses and convenanting to the aged or incapacitated and the taxpayer concerned may wish to talk to her inspector of taxes to see if these can be availed of in her particular circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73, 74 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners are fully alert to the situation concerning the sale of tobacco products, without payment of the appropriate taxes, by street traders both in Dublin city and elsewhere.  This problem continues to be tackled with vigour and success.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners have, since the beginning of this year, seized approximately 28 million cigarettes and over 600 kilogrammes of tobacco.  Revenue also liaise with the gardaí who have additional powers under the Casual Trading Act and joint operations to detect illegal street trading in tobacco products have taken place.</P>
      <P>The introduction of tax stamps on cigarettes was provided for in the Finance Act, 1994.  Since September last, all packs of cigarettes produced in or imported into the State and put up for retail sale must have a tax stamp affixed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 74 of the Act makes it an offence to offer cigarettes for sale or delivery within the State other than in a pack or packets to which a tax stamp, on which duty at the appropriate rate has been paid, is affixed.  A person who is guilty of an offence in relation to tax stamps will be liable, on conviction, to a penalty of £1,000 in respect of each <Col N="92" /> conviction.  In addition, any goods or vehicle involved are liable to forfeiture.</P>
    <P>To allow time, however, for stocks of unstamped cigarettes to clear through the retail system, the legal provision making it an offence to offer unstamped packs of cigarettes for sale or delivery will not come into operation until March of next year.  In the meantime, however, Revenue officers remain empowered to seize tobacco products on which the appropriate taxes have not been paid and to prosecute offenders.</P>
    <P>The possibility of extending the tax stamp system to tobacco products other than cigarettes is provided for in section 78 of the Finance Act, 1995.  It is intended that tax stamps for roll-your-own tobacco will be introduced in 1996 following discussions with the industry. Any further extension of stamping to products such as cigars will be considered in the light of experience of, in particular, illegal sales of such products.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the introduction of tax stamps will greatly strengthen the power of Revenue staff in the detection and prosecution of offenders including street sellers.  Furthermore, I am satisfied that the ongoing use of existing powers by the Revenue Commissioners, combined with the use of techniques such as risk analysis, intelligence gathering and profiling with a view to identifying import routes and distributors as well as liaising with the gardaí in relation to illegal street trading will continue to show results in combating illegal sales.</P>

      <P>The basis of rateable valuation is the net annual value (NAV) i.e. the rental value of a property.  Improvements to a property or a change in use may increase the <Col N="94" /> rental value and under the Valuation Acts must be taken into account in assessing the rateable valuation.  Any rateable valuations revised in these circumstances become effective in the rating year immediately after the year in which the Commissioner of Valuation issues the revised valuation.  Any rate-payer dissatisfied with a valuation assessment has a right of appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation in the first instance and, subsequently, to the independent Valuation Tribunal.  There is a further right of appeal to the High Court and, ultimately, to the Supreme Court on a point of law.  It is not proposed to change these arrangements.</P>

      <Quest>the permissible period of sick-leave for staff in Government Departments; his views on the regulation that in excess of 56 days sick-leave in a four year period would relegate an officer on the seniority and suitability for promotion list; if work-related illness is included in the 56 days permissible; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Established staff in the Civil Service are allowed full pay, or in the case of officers who were appointed on or after 1 April, 1995, full pay less appropriate deduction in respect of social welfare benefits during properly certified sick leave, provided there is no evidence of permanent disability for service, up to a maximum of six months in one year and half pay thereafter, subject to a maximum of 12 months sick leave in any period of four years.</P>
      <P>In the case of temporary or unestablished whole-time civil servants the position is as follows: Full pay, less appropriate deduction in respect of social welfare benefits may be allowed during sick absence up to the following limits in any period of 12 months service; after three months continuous service, up to six weeks; after six months continuous service, up to nine weeks; after 12 months continuous service, up to 13 weeks.</P>
      <P>No sick pay is allowed during the first three months service but previous service, so far as it has been continuous, may be allowed to reckon towards the qualifying period for the grant of paid sick leave.  Qualifying service is exclusive of any period of leave without pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the 56 day sick leave in a four year period regulation, the position is that this regulation has no implications for an officer's seniority. However, for the purpose of assessing an officer's suitability for establishment or promotion, Departments are required to examine an officer's sick absence record over the previous four years from two angles; (i) to see whether there is any indication that he or she is suffering from a condition <Col N="100" /> affecting or likely to affect his or her health; and (ii) to determine whether his or her sick absence record is such that it can be regarded as compatible with the requirements of regular and effective service.</P>
    <P>It is in regard to (ii) that the 56 day limit comes into play.  It should be pointed out at this stage that in addition to the 56 day limit regulation, officers must also not have any more than 25 sick absences in any four year period.  In applying these limits the following factors are also borne in mind by Departments: (i) absences of a minor curative or &ldquo;repair&rdquo; operations need not be counted; (ii) non-recurring illnesses may be ignored; (iii) the pattern of the absences, e.g. if most of the absences have been in the earlier part of the four year period and there has been a very significant improvement in the last two years the candidate may be given the benefit of the doubt; and (iv) if most of the absences were due to a health problem which the Chief Medical Officer accepts has been rectified, and if on ignoring such absences, the sick leave record is within the limit, the officer may be accepted as suitable.</P>
    <P>As can be seen from the above, it is likely that a non-recurring work related illness would be excluded for the purposes of assessing an officer's suitability for promotion.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>
        <b>):</b> There is ongoing discussions between my Department and the VHI across a whole range of issues, including the amount of subscriptions by members in respect of cover.  The VHI is a not-for-profit organisation and under section 4 (4) of the Voluntary Health Insurance Act, 1957, the VHI is obliged to fix subscriptions to the extent that the revenue therefrom, together with any other revenues, shall be only sufficient, after provision is made for reserves, depreciation and other like purposes, to meet its ongoings.</P>
      <P>The VHI is faced, like health insurance companies generally, with the escalating cost of healthcare and the increased volume of claims arising from a healthcare system which is ever increasing in its sophistication.  Such pressures have compelled the VHI to increase its premiums and make some adjustments in out-patient cover.</P>
      <P>Regarding balance-billing, the VHI has now negotiated arrangements whereby over 80 per cent of medical consultants participate in a full cover scheme under which their fees are met by VHI and the levying of any balancing charge on the individual member does not arise, Participation in the full cover scheme is solely a matter for decision by individual consultants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is vital that VHI, in the interests of all of its members, take all financially prudent steps to safeguard its future by addressing its financial position while maintaining, as far as possible, the <Col N="103" /> extensive and high quality service it provides.</P>

      <P>In the area of health legislation, the Mental Treatment Act, 1945 and the Health Act, 1970, refer specifically to persons with mental handicap.  However, it is envisaged that new mental health legislation, which is due for enactment in 1996, will include provisions in relation to certain categories of persons with mental handicap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of the proposed legislation is to bring Irish law in relation to the detention of mentally disordered patients, including a small number of persons with a mental handicap, into conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights.  The legislation will also reflect the UN principles for the protection of persons with mental illness and the improvement of mental health care.  The legislation will provide a modern framework for the care <Col N="107" /> and treatment of persons with a mental disorder who refuse of who are incapable of seeking treatment or protection in their own interest or in the interests of others.  The new mental health legislation will replace the current legislation governing the provision of mental health services.</P>
    <P>I have arranged for a copy of the recent White Paper, which outlines the Government's proposals for the new mental legislation, to be sent to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision of services to persons with a mental handicap in St. Ita's Hospital.  Portrane is, in the first instance, a matter for the Eastern Health Board.  In relation to the provision of capital funding and the upgrading of facilities at the hospital in the period 1990 to 1995, I have been informed by the board that the following is the position.</P>
      <P>In line with its policy to reduce the number of people with a mental handicap living in institutional settings and to relocate them to more appropriate care settings, the board has utilised both its own resources and residential facilities which it has purchased throughout the region to improve the standard of accommodation for its clients.  Since 1990 11 staff houses associated with the hospital have been made available to the mental handicap service.  This has facilitated ward closures or reductions in numbers in various wards.  The estimated value of this accommodation is in the region of £750,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition community facilities have <Col N="108" /> been provided in a further 15 houses throughout the Eastern Health Board region with an approximate value of £1.3 million.  The majority of these places have been for clients from St. Ita's.</P>
    <P>In the period 1990 to 1994, a sum of £660,000 was spent on improving and upgrading the heating system.  Between 1991 and 1992 a number of staff houses were used to provide more domestic style accommodation on the campus and the old vacated temporary buildings were demolished as they were in an unsafe condition.  In 1993 the board received a capital grant of £250,000 from the Department to assist in upgrading the hospital facilities.  This enabled unit E to be closed and substantial refurbishment to be carried out on unit B made to provide residential facilities for 14 seriously disturbed residents. Substantial upgrading was also carried out in unit A female, unit B and the hostels on the hospital campus, i.e. Rushbrook House, St. Joseph's and St. Vincent's. In addition to the capital grant received from the Department, the board contributed a further £50,000 from its own resources.  In 1994, the Department allocated a further capital grant of £100,000 to enable the programme of refurbishment and upgrading to be continued.  This funding was used to carry out the restructuring of unit 11 and to continue the upgrading of A, B and C block and unit 12.  The board contributed a further £100,000 from its own resources to assist with the cost of this work.</P>
    <P>A third capital grant of £100,000 was made available by the Department this year to continue the ongoing upgrading of the units which will be maintained on the campus on a medium to long-term basis.  A further grant of £50,000 has also been made available to the board to purchase equipment for the new gymnasium and the day care and recreational services.  A capital grant of £400,000 has also been made available to the board in 1995 for the purchase of residential facilities to allow for the <Col N="109" /> transfer of 24 clients to new accommodation and for the closure of unit K.  It is the board's intention that this unit will be closed at the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am committed to the preservation of the corncrake and take this opportunity to applaud those who have worked so hard for so long for this purpose.  What I am seeking is the best option for its preservation.</P>
      <P>In 1992 a proposal was made by the Irish Wildbird Conservancy and the Royal Society for Protection of Birds to pay grants to farmers for corncrake friendly practices pending the implementation of the rural environment protection scheme.  As the take up of REPS was slower than expected, the corncrake grants scheme was continued on a year to year basis.  It was never the intention to make it a permanent scheme.</P>
      <P>The 1995 corncrake grants scheme was operated in three areas; Shannon Callows, north Donegal and parts of County Mayo.  Where mowing was delayed until 1 August the scheme provided for the payment to landowners of grants of £80 per hectare in the Shannon Callows and £120 per hectare in north Donegal and County Mayo.  In all three areas an additional grant of £20 per hectare was payable where mowing from the centre of the field outwards was undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year the corncrake grants scheme cost some £85,000 and it received Exchequer funding of £60,000 through the National Parks and Wildlife Service with the balance coming from <Col N="114" /> the RSPB.  In addition to the £60,000 the IWC, who administer the grants scheme, have been promised funding of £5,000 and £10,000 respectively this year by the NPWS and RSPB for habitat creation measures.  I understand also that the costs of the IWC fieldworker network are borne by the RSPB and the EU's LIFE Fund.  Between 1992 and the end of 1995 Exchequer funding of £142,000 has been allocated for corncrake conservation measures made up of £133,000 for the corncrake grants scheme &mdash; £5,000 in 1992, £13,000 in 1993, £55,000 in 1994 and £60,000 in 1995, £4,000 towards the cost of a survey in 1993 and £5,000 earmarked for habitat creation measures this year.</P>
    <P>The information is not available in my Department to enable me to give a breakdown by county of the grants paid under the scheme this year.  Total grant payments in the three areas in 1995 were £63,884 in the Shannon Callows, £15,832 in County Mayo and £6,143 in County Donegal.</P>
    <P>Corncrake distribution in the three target areas since 1993 is reported as follows:</P>

    <P>I note that the greatest level of increase has been in north Donegal where actual expenditure and take-up of the grant scheme this year was lowest.  In the Shannon Callows, where take-up and expenditure was highest, the number of corncrakes dropped slightly between 1994 and 1995 with a significant drop of 28 per cent since 1993.  While the overall numbers for 1995 show an increase over the previous year, when the 1993 numbers are taken into account the increase has only been 6.7 per cent.  It would appear from this analysis that the evidence as to the relationship between the <Col N="115" /> grants scheme and corncrake numbers is still not conclusive.</P>
    <P>This year the action programme for the corncrake is operating independently of REPS.  As REPS is now operational I see no good conservation reason why we should not examine the feasibility of a transition from these annual interim payments, which have been in place since 1992, to REPS.  I believe the considerable potential presented by REPS should be examined and utilised to maximum advantage for corncrake conservation purposes.  The Deputy will be aware from recent announcements that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has been reconsidering REPS.  Officials from the NPWS along with their counterparts in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry are currently exploring the options provided by REPS for corncrake conservation.  I intend to review the situation in January 1996 in order to decide whether or not to continue the scheme in 1996.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy I do not intend to abandon the present corncrake scheme until such time as I am satisfied that REPS is capable of providing at least the same protection for this endangered species.</P>

      <P>The designated area in Sligo town was adjusted to enable a limited number of unfinished developments in the former designated area to be completed.  It was considered that designation of the limited area in question should be renewed having regard to the criteria that were originally applied and are still applied to designations generally.  These relate to the extent of urban decay in an area, its location and general character, the potential for redevelopment, the historical or architectural significance of the area, the need to promote inner urban residential accommodation and the size and status of the town concerned.</P>

      <P>Local authorities were notified by circular letter N 7/92 of amended procedures under which the Department's prior approval to the acquisition of houses is not required where: (a) the cost of acquisition can be met from a local authority's capital allocation; and (b) the acquisition represents a cost effective and economical means by which the authority can meet the housing needs of a person who has been included in the last needs assessment made by the authority, or who has been accepted for inclusion in the next assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the 1995 local authority housing programme, Ballina and Castlebar Urban District Councils each included the acquisition of six houses in their programmes.  Ballina UDC furnished details on 4 September last in <Col N="122" /> respect of the acquisition of five houses at a total cost of £219,680.  Details of 1995 acquisitions by Castlebar UDC have not yet been received in the Department.</P>

      <P>There is a wide divergence between the transfer scheme prepared by the Dublin City manager and the submission made on the scheme by the South Dublin county manager.  These managers, together with those of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and Fingal, are in contact in an effort to establish what scope there may be for achieving a greater level of agreement on the complex issues involved.  Pending the outcome of these contacts.  I am not in a position to indicate a definite time frame for final decisions but I am anxious to see the issues resolved as early as possible.</P>

      <P>The National Roads Authority is an independent statutory body with overall responsibility for ensuring the provision of a safe and efficient network of national roads, including prioritisation of projects and the allocation of grants to individual projects.  The authority is required under the Roads Act, 1993, to submit an annual report to me on the performance of its functions and copies of this are laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  In addition, I am entitled under the Roads Act to obtain such information as I may require in relation to the performance by the authority of its functions.</P>
      <P>Apart from this, my powers under the Roads Act are limited to certain broad policy, financial and quasi-judician functions. I have no function in relation to the day to day administration and management of the work programme on national roads or in relation to the supervision of individual projects.  These projects are still carried out by the local authorities concerned under the general supervision of the authority.</P>

The entrolment of the school in question on 30 September 1994 was 89 pupils.  This enrolment warrants a staffing in the current school year of a principal and two assistants.

    <P>Eligibility for school transport is determined on the basis of distance from the nearest centre with a PLC course, which in this case is Dundalk.

      <P>The total national lottery funds allocated to my Department in 1995 in respect of sporting and recreational organisations amounted to £12.225 million which represents 14.3 per cent of total national lottery allocations. These funds, which are decided by Government in the context of the annual estimates process, are expended by the sport section of my Department through programmes of capital and current expenditure.</P>
      <P>The criteria used for the allocation of funds for capital projects include the priority of the proposed improvementfacility in relation to the organisation's existing facilities; the organisation's ability to undertake the project in view of the amount of local funds available and the amount of grant aid proposed; the availability of other facilities in the area and the need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds.</P>
      <P>In regard to current schemes, funding is allocated in accordance with the terms of the various schemes which are outlined in my Department's Annual Report for 1994 <i>Sport in Ireland</i> a copy of which I am arranging to have sent to the Deputy.  For example, grant-aid is given to national governing bodies of sport under a number of headings to assist with administration, coaching, the purchase of specialist equipment, assistance for outstanding sportspersons, attendance at international events, the hosting of such events and special projects aimed at increasing participation and-or raising standards of performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Annual grants are allocated to vocational education committees for the development of Sport for All and to <Col N="137" /> assist youth and sport activities in their areas.

      <P>Under the Explosives Act, 1875 a licence is required to be issued by my Department for the importation of fireworks. It is long-standing policy that such licences are only issued for organised public displays conducted by professional operators.</P>
      <P>Despite this restriction, it is clear that supplies of fireworks continue to be imported illegally into the country, particularly around Halloween.  Each year at this time a concerted effort is made by an Garda Síochána to control the illegal possession, sale and use of fireworks and bangers.  Special measures are also taken in addition to the normal routine policing measures.  These include the setting up of a special Garda unit consisting of a garda sergeant and three gardaí specifically to deal with the fireworks problem; attention to known trouble areas; liaison with other services; and arrangements to have the dangers of fireworks publicised in the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moreover, the Garda authorities <Col N="140" /> monitor the supply and storage of fireworks. Significant seizures are made each year as a result of their vigilance. In 1993 and 1994 illegally imported fireworks valued at approximately £116,000 and £120,000 respectively, were confiscated by the gardaí over the Halloween period and subsequently destroyed.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that I am satisfied that the policy in regard to the issue of licences allied with the measures taken by an Garda Síochána is the best way of protecting the public from the inherent dangers of fireworks, while ensuring that they are not deprived of the enjoyment of the spectacle of fireworks operated by knowledgeable persons in a controlled environment.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed allocation of Garda manpower and resources to individual areas. They have informed me that there is one garda attached to the sub-station at Ballycroy which was built in 1985.  I am also informed that the same garda has been attached to the station since March 1986 and he availed of the married quarters attached to the station from that time to 1989.  In 1989 the garda concerned moved home to Achill, a distance of 17 miles from the Ballycroy Garda Station.  However, he has continued to reside at the official quarters on a part time basis for the duration of his tour of duty.  I am assured by the Garda authorities that they are satisfied that the Ballycroy area is served well by the current garda attached to the local station and he is assisted, when required, by the Sergeant and one garda who are attached to the parent station at Bangor Erris.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that there is one garda attached to the sub-station at Mulranny, which was converted from a private house in 1991 and forms part of the Westport District.  Its parent station is Achill which has a strength of one sergeant and three gardaí.  While Mulranny Garda Station has the appearance of a private house, it is unsuitable for living accommodation purposes.  I am also informed by the Garda authorities that there is no other Garda accommodation available in the Mulranny area.  I understand from the Garda authorities that the garda attached to Mulranny station resides in Castlebar which is a distance of approximately 24 miles away.  This garda works in close co-operation with the gardaí attached to Achill station. <Col N="142" /> The Garda authorities are satisfied that this arrangement provides an adequate Garda service to the area.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that members of the Force are encouraged to reside in, or close to, the districts in which they work.  However, a member cannot be compelled to reside in any particular area.  There are no regulations requiring members of the Force to reside in a specific location except, for example, where members are allocated official accommodation, i.e. married quarters or agency houses. In addition Garda regulations specify that no unmarried member of the gardaí is obliged to live in official accommodation.</P>
    <P>Of course, I am anxious to have as many gardaí as possible living in the areas in which they work, partiularly in rural areas, and there is a commitment to this effect in the programme for Government.  The question as to how this might be achieved is under examination with due regard to the right of members of the Force to choose where to live.</P>

      <P>The issue of measures at ports of entry to deal with animals entering this country is a matter for Customs and Excise and I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the importation into the State of dogs from places outside Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man is prohibited under the Importation of Dogs and Cats Orders, 1929 to 1970 and the Rabies (Importation, Landing and Movement of Animals) Orders 1972 and 1976 save under licence-permit issued by the Department of Agricultures, Food and <Col N="143" /> Forestry.  Animals imported in breach of the regulations are liable to seizure by Customs and Excise officials.  The crews of continental ferries and the public in general are alert to the dangers of the importation of rabies and frequently advise Customs of suspected breaches of the Regulations.</P>
      <P>There is no prohibition on the importation of dogs from Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man and Customs staff have therefore no direct role to play in relation to such importations.  If however, customs staff suspect that dogs from these areas are being imported for unlawful purposes, it is their policy to alert the gardaí who fully investigate all such matters which come to their attention.</P>
      <P>I have asked my Department to carry out a review of the current situation in relation to the Garda authorities' role in cases of illegal importation of animals.</P>

The reasons for failure, to complete included resignation for personal reasons, examination failure, poor performance and general unsuitability.</P>
    <P>The number of deferments at passingout stage of the course during the period concerned was, as indicated, 60.  This number was calculated by taking account of Probationers whose commencement of Phase 5 was deferred while on Phase 4 and those who were deferred while on Phase 5.  The reasons for deferment included performance related difficulties, failure to complete course work to the required standard, general unsuitability and physical unfitness because of injury.</P>

      <Quest>if supplementary welfare can be paid to employees (details supplied) on strike who were dependant for the last three weeks on tax rebates but where the employer continued to make the usual deductions leaving the employees with little or no income.</Quest>

      <P>Under section 174 of the Supplementary Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, people involved in trade disputes are excluded from receiving assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  However, supplementary welfare allowance may be paid in respect of any adult or child dependants.</P>
      <P>The personal rate of supplementary welfare allowance is paid in respect of the adult dependant and a child dependants allowance is paid in respect of each child dependant.  Any household income including social welfare payments or benefits and-or earnings are assessed as means.  Tax rebates are treated as income.  Where strike pay is in payment, the excess over the adult dependant rate of supplementary welfare allowance, is taken into account as means.  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme income from earnings is based on gross earning less PRSI and travel expenses to and from work.</P>
      <P>In this case the employer is paying tax rebates to those on strike but is contrinuing to make all the normal deductions so that the net pay may, in some cases, be minimal.  These deductions may include payments in respect of VHI contributions, mortgage repayments, savings, Credit Union Loans, sports clubs, pensions, etc.</P>
      <P>The practice in the health board is to distinguish between voluntary and non-voluntary deductions.  Those deductions in respect of savings credit union loans, mortgage repayments, sports clubs etc. are considered to be voluntary deductions which the person involved in the trade dispute could have access to if they contacted the salary section of the firm.  The practice is to treat deductions in respect of pensions and VHI as non-voluntary deductions.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Act, 1966, was brought into operation on 1 May 1967. Under the new scheme, which was <Col N="151" /> introduced to replace the earlier Work-men's Compensation Scheme, benefits are payable to people in insurable occupational injuries employment on or after 1 May, 1967, who suffer an occupational accident or disease.  Accordingly, miners who ceased to be employed prior to 1 May 1967 are not included within the scope of the scheme.</P>
      <P>While the 1966 Act repealed the Workmen's Compensation Act, the provisions of those Acts were continued so as to apply in cases where a right to compensation arose in respect of employment prior to 1 May 1967.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals at present to amend the relevant legislation to extend the scope of the existing scheme to include miners who ceased employment prior to 1 May, 1967.  I will, at the Deputy's request and that of Deputy Michael Ferris, be meeting a deputation on the matter on 9 November 1995.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 155 and 156 together.</P>
      <P>People on social welfare benefits, including invalidity pension, are required by the regulations to notify the Department, as soon as is reasonably practicable, of any change in circumstances which may affect their right to benefit.  Failure to notify the Department of a change would be a breach of the regulations.  Such failure could arise for example because of an oversight on the part of the person or a misunderstanding of the rules and regulations or by deliberate intent.</P>
      <P>Where the failure results in an overpayment to the person the Department seeks to recover the amount involved as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>There has been no recorded instance of the prosecution of an invalidity claimant since the inception of the scheme in 1970.</P>
      <P>The decision to initiate court proceedings in any case would depend on the individual circumstances of the case including whether there appeared to be a deliberate intention to defraud, previous history etc.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977 to 1993 which is the labour protection legislation which specifies that, in general, an employee must have one year's services to qualify for protection under the legislation.  The Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977 to 1993, provide that, in general, an employee must have worked continuosly for the same employer for one year before he or she becomes eligible to claim redress for unfair dismissal.  The requirement of a year's continuous service does not apply to an employee dismissed due to pregnancy or for exercising rights under <Col N="156" /> the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, or where dismissal resulted from the employee's trade union membership.</P>
      <P>The Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act, 1993, which came into effect on 1 October 1993, introduced specific antievasion provisions in relation to the length of service requirements.  The new provisions provide that a Rights Commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal, in determining if an employee has the necessary service, may consider whether the employment of a person on a series of two or more contracts of employment, between which there was no more than 26 weeks of a break, was for the purpose of avoidance of liability by the employer under the legislation. Where it is so found, the length of the various contracts may be added together to assess the length of service of an employee for eligibility under the Acts.</P>
      <P>Similar provisions apply in relation to a person who is employed on second or subsequent fixed term or specified purpose contracts with the same employer. In those cases, the Rights Commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal are empowered to add together the service of an employee, if they consider that the employment of a person on such contracts, between which there was no more than three months of a break, was for the purpose of avoidance of liability under the legislation.</P>

The dispute concerns a claim for a new pay structure for craft workers who are mebers of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union and the Technical Engineering and Electrical Union.  This dispute has been processed through all procedures including the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  A recommendation by the Labour Court to the effect that the workers' claim for a new pay structure should be negotiated within the context of the company's new rationalisation plan was rejected by the workers. At this stage it is a matter for the parties directly concerned to decide on the best means of resolving the dispute either through direct negotiations or with the help of a third party.  The position of individual employees with regard to tax rebates or supplementary welfare are matters in which I have no function and should be taken up with the relevant authorities.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the payment of industrial development grants was devolved from the Industrial Development Authority on 1 January 1994 to IDA Ireland and Forbairt in relation to foreign and indigenous investment respectively. Bearing this in mind, the information sought is as follows: 71 per cent of establishments that received IDA Ireland grant assistance between 1985 and 1994 are still in operation; and 59 per cent of establishments that received assistance from Forbairt in the same period are still in existence.  This latter figure excludes feasibility grant payments because the large volume of these applications would distort the result.</P>
      <P>The second part of the Deputy's question cannot be answered as phrased, as some establishments would have closed in this period but have yet to repay grants.  In addition, some establishments which closed prior to 1985 would also have repaid grants during the ten year period.  However, the following information may be of assistance: IDA Ireland &mdash; in the period 1985-94, a total of 161 overseas establishments, no longer operating, repaid grants.  Forbairt &mdash; in the period 1985-94, a total of 269 Irish companies, no longer operating, repaid grants.  In the time available it is not possible to be more precise, but I will forward additional information to the Deputy by letter.</P>

      <P>The measure of readaptation aid was formulated by the European Commission to ease the burden of steel workers who have been made redundant under the current restructuring of the steel industry and is administered under Article 56 (2) (b) of the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty.  Under the scheme, a worker being classified as taking early retirement (those aged 55 years and over) may receive up to a maximum amount of 4,000 ECU per workers. Those workers that have been made redundant from Irish Steel may receive up to a maximum of 3,000 ECU per workers.</P>
      <P>An application was made by my Department on 29 July 1994 under this measure for readaptation aid for 205 workers in Irish Steel Limited.  Since that date my Department has supplied full details on each of the Irish Steel workers affected so as to enable the European Commission make a decision as to the eligibility of the workers to receive these payments.</P>
      <P>I heard in the past week that the European Commission has declared 194 Irish Steel workers to be eligible under this scheme and a decision as to the amount of aid to be paid to each worker will be made by mid-November at the latest.  Notwithstanding the maximum levels per worker stated above, since a finite amount of resources is available under this measure and given that Ireland is not the only member state applying under this measure, the European Commission has signalled that it is most unlikely that each worker affected will receive the maximum levels of readaptation aid.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 169 and 170 together.</P>
      <P>The importance of plantation management cannot be overstated in the context of ensuring that as a nation we secure a satisfactory return, in terms of both timber quality and quantity, on the major investment being made in Irish forestry.  Certain safeguards are already in place in the form of particular provisions of the current afforestation grant and forest premium schemes but the key to longer term success clearly lies in the area of training and skills development. The fact that afforestation on privatelyowned lands now accounts for over 66 per cent of new planting, with planting by or on behalf of farmers accounting for over 70 per cent of this component, and that in 1994 broad-leafed species accounted for 23 per cent of private planting, highlights the importance of developing plantation management skills among those who may not have any previous experience or knowledge of forestry.  The recognition by such plantation owners that their stock of trees is an asset, the eventual realisable value of which will, as with any other agricultural or rural enterprise asset, be determined by the owner's commitment to its managmeent and care, is a prerequisite to success in this area.  There is clearly a role to be played by the farming organisations and others in fostering this kind of thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="163" /> Teagase, in conjunction with the Forest Service of my Department, has for some time past offered forestry training courses to farmers.  This has been a useful start but more needs to be done to address the issue of skills development in the context of plantation management, taking account also of the existence and very active role of private forestry contracting companies.  In finalising the strategic plan for forestry, which I expect to bring to Government shortly, I am considering a number of measures which I believe could be of positive benefit in this area.  Such measures will be announced in due course but I would like to assure the Deputy that I am particularly aware of the importance of the issues raised in his questions and am determined to ensure they are effectively addressed.</P>

      <P>The afforestation grant scheme distinguishes between unenclosed land and enclosed/improved land.  Unenclosed land is defined as land which was never improved or enclosed by man-made boundaries for agricultural use other than for extensive grazing. Enclosed/improved land is land falling outside the category of unenclosed land.  The afforestation grant payable in the case of the former is up to a maximum of £1,300 per hectare while maximum grant rates payable in respect of afforestation on the latter category of land range between £1,500 and £3,000 per hectare, depending on the mix of species planted.</P>
      <P>The forest premium scheme distinguishes between non-disadvantaged, less severely disadvantaged and more severely disadvantaged areas in so far as enclosed/improved land is concerned and where the recipient of the premium payment falls within the definition of a farmer for the purposes of the scheme. The lowest levels of premium are payable in more severely disadvantaged areas and the highest in non-disadvantaged areas.  This reflects the stated purpose of the premium under the relevant Regulation, Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2080/92, which is to cover losses of income resulting from afforestation of agricultural land.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Teagasc's research programme has a priority rating for a study of the environmental impact of phosphorus <Col N="169" /> with the emphasis on quantifying phosphorus losses from fields and farmyards to surface water, identifying the critical factors influencing those losses and reviewing phosphorus recommendations. Improved codes of practice for the sustainable use of phosphorus in agriculture will be developed.  Advisory work is aimed at encouraging good farm practice in fertiliser application by regular soil testing and appropriate use of the results.</P>

      <P>The scheme in question is the farm electrification grants scheme.  The scheme is designed to subsidise the installation of electricity supply to farms which previously had no supply or where supply is inadequate, in order to facilitate the development and modernisation of farms in disadvantaged areas of the country.  This application was recently approved in my Department.  The ESB will be in touch with the applicant to advise of the outcome and to quote subsidised terms for supply.  As soon as the ESB are notified of acceptance of these terms the applicant will be placed on the ESB's work programme.</P>

      <P>An itemised breakdown of the expenditure of £54,258 for travel expenses referred to in the statement which I made to Dáil Éireann on 10 October, 1995, is set in tabular form below.  The payments in respect of these expenses were made by CIE.  These travel expenses were incurred on trips arranged on behalf of the former chairman of CIE.  While the former chairman did drop out of one of the US trips, his late cancellation did not mean that the expenses of over £10,000 in respect of this particular trip were avoided.  I was not informed of this fact by CIE until after my statement in the House last week.  The central thrust of my concerns about the frequency, scale and cost of these overseas trips remains valid.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that Bord Gáis Éireann, BGE, will be in a position to supply the Irish market from indigenous resources for the next five years or so.  The Kinsale Head and associated Ballycotton gas fields are expected to be depleted within <Col N="172" /> this time-frame, although it is difficult to give an exact date due to technical consideration.  From 1995 these indigenous supplies will be supplemented from supplies from the UK.  According as those reserves will decrease &mdash; and it will become increasingly difficult to produce gas there &mdash; BGE will import amounts of gas through the new Ireland interconnector to meet market requirements which cannot be met by the Kinsale Head/Ballycotton fields.  In the initial few years after 1995 the UK supplies will be used for power generation and peak demand.  With the exception of supplies to the fertiliser industry all supplies are sold at prevailing market prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 193 and 196 together.</P>
      <P>The Marpol Convention came into force for Ireland on 6 April this year and to date no ship has been refused entry on the grounds of non-compliance with the Convention.</P>
      <P>The Sea Pollution Act, 1991 is the domestic legislation which gives effect to the Marpol Conventions.  Due to budgetary restrictions and the Government embargo on staff recruitment no additional marine surveyors have been recruited for enforcing those provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has adopted three of the five Annexes of the Convention which are in effect Regulations for prohibiting or controlling operational discharges of marine pollutants from ships viz Annex I (Oil and Oily Mixtures), Annex II (Noxious Liquid Substances carried in <Col N="176" /> Bulk) and Annex V (Garbage).  Under the Convention port and harbour authorities are obliged to provide adequate reception facilities for those wastes to meet the needs of ships using them.</P>
    <P>In the lead up to and following ratification of the Marpol Convention my Department has been in regular contact with port/harbour authorities regarding their waste reception/disposal requirements and has carried out inspections at 17 of the more important commercial harbours and fishery harbour centres.</P>
    <P>At this stage I am satisfied that facilities at most ports/harbours are adequate for oil/oily mixture wastes and for garbage. Special attention is being paid to those ports/harbours which having made significant progress in the provision of facilities may still have problems due to particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>Only five ports are engaged in shipping noxious liquid substances.  These operations are confined to imports in dedicated tankers so that the need for waste reception facilities for those substances does not arise for Irish ports/harbours at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has been in touch with the corresponding UK authorities over a period of time regarding these various matters and has been informed that the Ministry of Defence (MOD) used to undertake sea dumping of chemical weapon stocks and conventional munitions as means of disposing of redundant and surplus stocks and dealing with the legacy of weapons produced in the World Wars.</P>
      <P>Information has been made available as to the locations of dumpsites off the Irish coast and the amounts and type of materials dumped.  The UK authorities have given assurances at all times that no dumping of nuclear material or material containing toxic heavy metals has taken place at any stage at any of the dumpsites mentioned.  Nevertheless, I remain very concerned at the extent of the dumping, the apparent lack of management of dumpsites and the possible environmental and health hazards that may occur.  My concerns have been heightened by recent reports that radioactive wastes may have been dumped at one dumpsite <i>viz.</i> Beaufort's Dyke which is located on the Scottish side of the North Channel.  I am dealing with the issue as a matter of urgency on two levels.</P>
      <P>On a bilateral level I have written to the UK Secretary of State for Defence asking for urgent clarification of the reports in question.  I have stressed the public disquiet that the suggested disposal operations give rise to there both in terms of environmental damage and public health and have asked in particular to be provided with the following information in respect of the dumping in question, <i>viz.</i></P>
      <P>&mdash;the exact location of the dumping operation, the volumes, nature, radioactivity, casing etc. of the material involved</P>
      <P>&mdash;an assessment of their present state, their likely impact on the local and Irish Sea environment generally,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="178" />&mdash;the steps the UK Government have taken, or intend to take, to monitor the materials, sites and contiguous marine conditions, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the measures the UK Government plan to implement to minimise any adverse impact the materials are having, or are likely to have, on the areas. </P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that I will personally be following this matter up closely with a view to obtaining disclosure of the full facts.</P>
    <P>On an international level the dumping of chemical weapons is a matter of major concern to most Contracting Parties to the Oslo Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft, 1972. Ireland is a party to the Oslo Convention and the Government is actively pursuing the general issue of munitions dumpings through that forum.</P>
    <P>The Assessment and Monitoring Committee (ASMO), a scientific working group of the convention has considered studies undertaken by Denmark concerning war gas dumpings in the Baltic Sea and concluded on the basis of the best available information and technical advice that given the nature of the chemicals, seepage is not considered to pose serious hazards and efforts to retrieve or remove would be more dangerous than leaving the dumped material in place.  Nevertheless, this remains a matter of serious concern and further investigation into this whole area is required.</P>
    <P>I am, thereore, determined to ensure that a comprehensive investigation of the impact of the dumping of chemical weapons off the coast of Ireland should be initiated.  In this regard it was decided, at the April meeting of ASMO this year that, as part of a wider Quality Status Report on the maritime area covered by the Oslo Convention, the impact of the dumping of war gas ammunition would be specifically addressed.  This wider Quality Status Report is to be completed by the year <Col N="179" /> 2000.  Ireland and the UK are responsible for the preparation of that part of the report in respect of a region which covers the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and areas to the west of Ireland and west of Scotland and the aim is to have the war gas aspect addressed as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>Any development or extension of development on State foreshore requires a lease or licence under the Foreshore Acts.</P>
      <P>There is no application before me for an extension to Malahide Marina. Works on the marina development in Malahide are proceeding under the existing lease agreement.  This has involved an accumulation of dredge spoil on the site.  The developer has yet to satisfy certain requirements in relation to dumping of the spoil from his current works before a licence for dumping at sea can be issued.  My Department is pursuing this matter with the developer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy shares my concern for the safety of people who use passenger boats and ferries around our coasts. Under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992 <Col N="181" /> all passenger boats carrying not more than twelve passengers are required to hold a current, valid Passenger Boat Licence.  A passenger boat is defined under the Act as any boat used to carry not more than twelve passengers for hire or reward.  A Passenger Boat Licence is only granted after a vessel has been inspected by a Marine Surveyor of my Department and is shown to comply with strict minimum standards of safety and seaworthiness.  Similarly, all passenger vessels carrying in excess of twelve passengers are statutorily required to hold a valid Passenger Vessel Safety Certificate, issued annually on foot of a survey conducted by a Marine Surveyor of my Department.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for enforcing the legislation relating to the control of illegal passenger boat operations rests solely with the Garda Authorities.  I understand that, earlier this year, in the aftermath of the Castletownbere ferry tragedy, the Department drew the attention of Garda Stations in coastal areas and those with harbours in their Divisional areas to the operation of passenger boats.  In the light of this it appears that the Garda have increased their efforts at enforcing the legislation, which has given rise to the difficulties being experienced by the residents of the island referred to.  I must emphasise, however, that no formal application has been received by my Department for a licence to operate a ferry service to the island in question.</P>
      <P>I would also like to point out to the Deputy that an Inter-departmental Coordinating Committee on Island Development, on which my Department is represented, is currently examining all aspects of island development including the need for improved ferry services to islands and island communities.  The committee, I understand, is due to report in the near future.</P>

      <P>Cork County Council, along with the other coastal local authorities, have submitted priority coastal protection proposals for consideration under the <i>Coastal Protection Sub-Programme of the Environmental Services Operational Programme 1994-97.</i> The total value of the proposals submitted far exceeds the £5.1 million funding available under the operational programme therefore it will not be possible to aid all the priority protection proposals submitted.</P>
      <P>Some £735,000 is being invested in 1995 to address a number of the proposals submitted to the Department.  No works are being undertaken in 1995 at any of the locations identified by Cork County Council, however.  These will be considered further during 1996 and the subsequent years of the operational programme.</P>
