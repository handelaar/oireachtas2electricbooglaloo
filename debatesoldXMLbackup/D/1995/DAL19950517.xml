      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputy Ned O'Keeffe.  I call on Deputy O'Keeffe to state the matter of which he has given me notice.</P>

      <P>I request the Adjournment of the Dáil to debate a matter relating to the dumping of waste in Cork.  I call on the Minister for the Environment to advise Cork County Council to withdraw from dumping waste at Ballinguyroe Tiphead, near Kildorrery in County Cork and to withhold planning permission until a new <Col N="2" /> site more suitable for refuse dumping has been identified.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 3, 9, 10, 11 and, subject to the agreement of No. 10, the Report and Final Stages of the Stock Exchange Bill, 1994.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) No. 3 shall be decided without debate; (2) Subject to the agreement of No. 11, the proceedings on the Report and Final Stages of the Finance Bill, 1995, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion tomorrow not later than 12.45 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall in relation to amendments include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Finance; and (3) Private Members' Business shall be No. 20 and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not agreeable to me or my party in their present form because very important amendments have not yet been circulated to Members of the House.  I ask the Chair to vindicate the rights of Members of this House.  It is not proper that serious and fundamental measures are being withheld in the context of a guillotined debate.  If we agree to guillotine the debate on the Finance Bill and at the same time allow the Minister for Finance to circulate important amendments to the Bill after the debate has begun, we will do ourselves less than justice and let down our constituents and the people who elected us to this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, believe it is unreasonable to allow this to happen. Last week the Whips successfully agreed that Report Stage should be debated over two days and I acknowledge the Taoiseach agreed to that on the Order of Business last week. However, this morning he has asked us to accept on the Order of Business &mdash; before Members have ever seen them &mdash; that only those amendments set down or accepted by the Minister for Finance be passed.  I understand, probably better than most, that amendments to the Finance Bill can be tabled at a late stage but in all the Finance Bills in which I have been involved, both in Government and Opposition, I cannot recall a similar situation arising.  While the newspapers have given us some of the background to the amendments, in general we do not know what they involve. In 26 hours from now we will be asked to pass the Finance Bill, 1995 with one of the most fundamental changes in tax law for practitioners.  I am not arguing whether that is right or wrong, but the principle of being asked to accept such amendments on the Order of Business is wrong.  In fairness to Opposition parties, I ask that this provision in the Order of Business be withdrawn, but if it is not it should allow for amendments in the name of the Opposition and the Government to be accepted.  I ask that justice in this House be upheld by the Chair.</P>

      <P>The Chair has heard the views of the Deputies and when I hear the Taoiseach's remarks I will put the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This timetable has been agreed by the Whips of both Opposition parties and 80 amendments have been published, which are available for discussion over the next two days.  An amendment to one section will be published today.  As Deputy Ahern has acknowledged, it is commonplace for amendments to be produced at this stage because of the fact that, under our <Col N="5" /> Central Fund Act, there is a strict timetable with deadlines for the enactment of the Finance Bill of a kind that do not apply to other legislation.  Hence the Government is forced into a situation of having to produce amendments in response to representations made during the debate at a late stage.  If the Government were to produce all its amendments before the debate took place, the debate would be meaningless so obviously we must wait&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

      <P>We heard all the arguments last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to hear the debate to produce the amendments. There is a total of about 40 ministerial amendments and 40 Opposition amendments which will all be dealt with in the course of the two-day debate which the Opposition parties sought and which we have agreed to.  The provision in regard to the amendments put down by the Minister for Finance being those that will be taken in the event of time running out is a standard provision, as the House is well aware, that appears in all time allocation motions.  Once the Opposition Whips agreed to the concept of a time allocation motion for this, which is necessary because of the timetables that apply under the legislation and the Constitution for the enactment of the Finance Bill, by definition they knew they were agreeing to a provision of this kind.  The mock horror that is being generated at this stage is just that.</P>

      <P>Yesterday, the Finance spokespersons received the white sheet of amendments for Report Stage, and we are not arguing about that, and this morning they received the list of amendments printed on green coloured paper and we are not arguing about that.  The point at issue is that we have just passed a motion which states that former section 153, now section 171, the most controversial section which makes a fundamental change in tax law may not be debated on Report Stage and we may not know its wording.  The Government could not agree on it during the past few weeks and are now ramming it through the House.</P>

    <P Just="Right">.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I embark on this debate with a heavy heart as a result of what has transpired here today.  Some of the most important amendments to be considered by this House are still unknown to me and this House has voted to allow them to be decided by one question tomorrow, without adequate debate or notice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="23" /> This amendment proposes that over a number of years there should be a gradual but sustained programme of tax reform designed to bring the standard rate of income tax down to 20 per cent and the top rate below 40 per cent.  The necessity for this arises from the present state of our tax laws.  Even taking into account the minuscule changes made in this year's Finance Bill which add 3 per cent to the real value after inflation of bands and allowances, single workers earning approximately 80 per cent of the average industrial wage &mdash; slightly more than £12,234 per annum &mdash; are still taxed on any extra earnings they receive at the rate of 57 per cent if PRSI is included in the transaction.  This means that the total outlay for an employer who wants to give an employee earning below the average industrial wage an extra £10 in his or her pocket is of the order of £26.  That is the reality of modern Irish employment taxation under the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ruairí Quinn.</P>
    <P>We have failed thus far to address adequately this anti-worker tax system. An employee who takes home £172 per week faces confiscatory tax rates of 56.75 per cent on all his marginal earnings. This means that many employees do not want promotion or the responsibility that goes with it.  An employer who wants to give an extra £10 in overtime to an employee in those circumstances has to lay out £26.  I am talking about real people, not imaginary people.  I am not talking about statistics; rather I am talking about genuine people who are caught in the Minister's poverty and taxation trap.  If I were talking about the super rich or super wealthy, the haves in our society compared with the have nots, I imagine that a Labour Party Minister for Finance would be the first to remind me that there were people who deserved priority over others when it came to tax reform.</P>
    <P>I have looked at the budget, which the Minister claimed was radical, to see what is in it for ordinary single workers. During a year in which the Exchequer <Col N="24" /> could have permitted a radical departure in the direction of tax reform these workers got nothing except a collective insult in the form of a tiny marginal increase in the value of bands and allowances.  I am not talking about the haves, the super rich or the moderately comfortable.  I am talking about men and women who take home in their pocket £172 per week.  It is immoral and wrong politically and economically to say to people in those circumstances that they must hand up more than half of every extra penny they earn in taxation and social insurance.</P>
    <P>It is not a matter of abstract figures on paper.  This is a matter of real people suffering real deprivation and being cemented into a real trap from which they cannot escape.  These people are earning well below the average industrial wage and they are entitled to a tax system which gives them incentives, which values their work and encourages them to work harder and to take overtime, promotion and extra work if it becomes available.</P>
    <P>I am talking about ordinary people like those in Packard.  Last year the Exchequer took £5.5 million or 35 per cent out of Packard's total payroll cost of £15.5 million.  That is the reality of the tax system.  It was inevitable that Packard, a highly labour-intensive industry which has to complete with sister plants around the world, would begin to contract before our eyes and probably disappear because of the brutal anti-work tax system.</P>
    <P>If the Packard plant had been located in Newry as opposed to Tallaght approximately £750,000 less would have been taken out of its payroll costs by the United Kingdom Government than is taken each year by the Irish Government. There would have been that much more money for management to divide with the workforce to ensure decent productivity and working conditions for ordinary men and women.  Instead, £15.5 million is spent on the payroll including employers' and employees PRSI and PAYE.  Packard is effectively <Col N="25" /> in crisis and is bound to suffer as long as this tax system exists.</P>
    <P>This is radically wrong and something radical must be done to correct it.  Successive Ministers for Finance since the budget in 1993 have abandoned the process of tax reform and, on one occasion, set it in reverse.  In the 1993 budget the 1 per cent income levy was equivalent, for most lower paid workers, to a 2 per cent increase in income tax.  That was in force for one year in scandalous disregard of what was suggested in the Cullition report.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to interrupt Deputy McDowell.  I am prepared to allow quite some latitude in respect of debate on the Report Stage of this measure but I have to dissuade the Deputy and the House generally from embarking upon what seem to be wide-ranging speeches.  I ask the Deputy to confine his remarks to the amendment before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment runs to over two pages and deals with the tax rates we will charge single workers in this country over the next five years.  I am not simply dealing with paper people or paper figures, I am dealing with real people.  This House must finally face up to its own responsibility in this matter.  It is easy to evade responsibility and to say we would love to do more for lower paid workers but the facts are that we have put in place an anti-low paid worker tax regime.</P>
      <P>I make no apology for saying this is not simply a matter of economics, it is a matter of basic social justice.  If you have a system that penalises work and effort to the extent that we have in this country, and insist on keeping this in place, there will be mass unemployment, high crime and drug abuse rates, high rates of breakdown of marriages and families and all the social evils attendant on creating a huge underclass in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, Ireland is pursuing a policy of human setaside.  By our tax system we are telling not merely <Col N="26" /> 270,000 people but the people between 55 and 60 years of age who have been airbrushed out of the unemployment statistics, those on training and special employment schemes which bring the number to in excess of 350,000, to stay out of the economy &mdash; just as agricultural land is set aside for non-production &mdash; and we will give them the dole or whatever social welfare payment is available.</P>
    <P>Our tax system is fundamentally unfair, not in that it is too harsh on the well-to-do in Irish society, though God knows it is hard on them as well but it is extremely hard on those who are least capable of defending themselves, the below average industrial earner.  The budget is a disgrace and this Bill, in so far as it represents the first effort of a Labour Party Minister to put in place a system of taxation in the interests of working people, is a monument to his failure.</P>

      <P>Committee Stage of the Finance Bill was conducted in a very harmonious fashion and was worth while.  The Minister will agree it was beneficial to him, his advisers and others.  It is a pity Report Stage cannot be conducted in the same fashion.  The row about ordering Report Stage has been disposed of.  That suggestion came from the chairman of the select committee, Deputy Jim Mitchell, and was agreed to by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, Deputy McDowell and me.  I am aggrieved that the Order of Business did not reflect that this morning. It is an unsatisfactory way of doing business in that amendments will be delivered later in the day.  This proves there is a good case to be made, when dealing with the Finance Bill, for the taxation changes, as far as they relate to tax bands, allowances and so on, to be dealt with in one Finance Bill and for the technical and other changes to be dealt with in a Finance (No. 2) Bill which would not be subject to the same time constraints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware the Finance Bill must pass all stages by 8 June.  I pointed out during <Col N="27" /> the debate on Committee Stage and in a number of press releases that this timescale is not conducive to debate. The Minister would probably agree that we should move from the way in which we have been conducting business for years.  I make the suggestion to the Minister and the Government for future Finance Bills, it is, perhaps, something that should have been considered a long time ago.  I cannot understand for the life of me why something which was agreed last week, and the Minister knew it would be agreed, could not have been put in place before today.  We will discuss amendments later in the day which will not be available until the afternoon. That is most unfair and unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>The amendment tabled by Deputy McDowell &mdash; the same amendment which was tabled on Committee Stage &mdash; puts in train a programme of continuous tax relief and commits any future Government to the rates of tax which we will achieve by the end of this decade. Naturally, an idea like that is very attractive but I do not think it is responsible given the line we take regarding public expenditure.  There are two schools of thought in this regard, whether one should set rates of tax one wants to achieve and the rate of tax that should be collected from the community and base everything on that.  In a sense it is similar to a person operating a company and where one looks at either the income side or the expenditure side.  I agree it is a bona fides school of thought that one can proceed on that basis.  If we say we will have X rates of tax for the following number of years we will be able to predict the amount of revenue that will accrue and everything will be tailored to suit it.</P>
    <P>The one major disadvantage is that you have to face the pruning of public expenditure possibly to an inordinate degree that will affect many people who will be hard done by.  The experience during the past seven years is that the people in employment, particularly those in public sector employment, have benefited more from the upturn in the <Col N="28" /> economy than any other sector.  Since 1987 this country has undergone a radical change in its political thinking regarding financial management.  At that time, the Government, under Mr. Haughey, decided to get the public finances in order.  You cannot have a tax policy committing the Government to tax rates in the future unless you are prepared to say what elements of public expenditure will be hardest hit.  It is legitimate for a future Government to proceed on one road or the other but it would not be wise to commit ourselves to agreeing tax rates and bands into the future without at the same time saying what public services would be reduced.</P>
    <P>Low tax rates and an adjustment in the tax bands are very attractive to those at work, but there is a large number not in that privileged position.  If I am on any side of the economic argument, I could be fairly regarded as being to the right.  However, I have never suggested levels of taxation that would squeeze public services to the extent that people not fortunate enough to have employment or well paid employment would be left unprotected.  There is merit in the proposal to tailor measures to expected income, but in our present economic state.  I do not believe in that approach despite its political attractiveness.  For several years successive Governments have endeavoured to lower rates of taxation and remove more and more low paid people from the tax net and have succeeded in doing that.  In addition the top rates of tax have been reduced successively since 1987.  I have been a politician and an accountant for long enough to remember when tax rates were as high as 80 per cent.</P>

      <P>That included PRSI. Widening tax bands results in a greater loss to the Exchequer whereas cutting the tax rates is less expensive.  Deputy McDowell's proposal not alone cuts tax rates but widens the bands &mdash; the Deputy has been consistent in that <Col N="29" /> regard.  However, it is contradictory to preach about controlling public expenditure while at the same time advocating very low rates of tax.  The late John Healy used to say that consistency should not be a hallmark of politicians.</P>

      <P>He did not admire it in politicians, although I would have though consistency was a virtue to be admired.  However, I am consistent and I have been somewhat tough on the Minister for allowing his colleagues in Government to increase levels of public expenditure in 1995.  Given the expenditure to which the Government is committed, I see little likelihood in 1996 and 1997 of the Minister being able to keep to the proposals set out in the Programme for Government.  Although it would be politically attractive to support Deputy McDowell's amendment, it would be inconsistent with my stand and would commit future Governments to maintaining certain levels of income without knowing what levels of expenditure would be required.  It would not be proper to do that.</P>
      <P>The trade unions and other bodies argued the case for regarding PRSI as a separate entity.  I asked the Minister on Committee Stage to state his views but he did not have the opportunity to answer.  Will he agree that perhaps the time has come to regard PRSI as another form of taxation as pay-related benefit has, effectively, been abolished? I accept the arguments for keeping the social insurance fund separate, but PRSI should be regarded as another tax. Perhaps that could be discussed in the Central Review Committee between the social partners.  It is a vexed question on which I would like to see lengthy debate because there are advantages and disadvantages to not having a separate social insurance fund.  I put the idea forward to stimulate debate.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>From another perspective, perhaps it benefits the whole body politic. The amendments before us should be put in context and there is considerable pressure to increase public expenditure. In his drive for tax reformation, Deputy McDowell did not object to the £10 million made available yesterday so that people on community employment schemes, many in my constituency, can return to previous levels.  What is in question here is our concept of society. The full extent of the proposed changes would be to take about £1 billion out of the economy.  That can be put into perspective if we take into account that education costs about £2 billion, the health service about £2.5 billion and social welfare about £3 billion.  To implement the proposed changes one would have to reduce expenditure on education by half &mdash; that would mean reducing the number of teachers by half because that is where most of the money in education is spent.  Half of the hospitals would have to be closed and the services cut back by half, and expenditure on social welfare would have to be cut back by one third.  The people who make such radical proposals should say where their impact would fall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept that these changes would make for radical change in employment levels.  Most of our difficulties in the area of employment are because of a mismatch between the <Col N="31" /> skills available and those needed to produce products or services that will penetrate international markets.  We have not given nearly enough attention to that.  Reducing the tax take will not create jobs where they do not exist.  In many ways Deputy McDowell also suffers from the disorder of being consistent and radical and, in a sense, it is to be welcomed.  However, the question is whether society should be divided radically and the market let rip as happened to a large extent in Thatcher's Britain, or whether we should have some element of cohesion.  On budget day the Minister for Finance spoke in terms of social solidarity and social cohesion, and he was right.</P>
    <P>If we were to go along with Deputy McDowell's proposals there is no doubt we would have further social disharmoney. Deputy McDowell related the enormous drugs problem and other social problems, including the break-up of families, to the tax system.  That is bunkum.  A series of factors have to be taken into account.  I cannot accept that the tax system is the source of social decay which in many ways can be related to the values which now pervade society.  In that context perhaps we would all benefit if more emphasis was placed on duties and responsibilities rather than rights.  What is being proposed is impractical and would cause considerable social discord.  That is the last thing the country needs at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important amendment in that it raises the fundamental question of whether budgetary strategy and fiscal policy should be expenditure driven or whether we should consider opportunities to reduce taxation.  My colleague, Deputy McCreevy, reasonably suggested that we have to try to balance the two. However, the Minister opted for expenditure driven policies and failed to take the opportunity to reduce taxation.  This is a source of frustration and deep concern in the market place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the first time in 25 years there <Col N="32" /> was a budget surplus but the Minister unexpectedly returned to a position where there will be a current budget deficit.  There was a general expectation, having achieved a budget surplus after a long struggle, that it would be maintained. Not alone did the Minister fail to do this, he set a ceiling of 6 per cent in terms of public expenditure.  I note this ceiling is not being adhered to.  In terms of growth in public expenditure the figure of 6 per cent was the upper limit.  The Minister should have left himself room for manoeuvre if there were unexpected expenditure costs.  Clearly, there have been.  The Minister opted for the best case scenario in the hope that there would be revenue buoyancy but the gamble has not paid off.  As a consequence when he comes to prepare the Estimates for 1996 in the autumn he will encounter serious difficulties because he will not be able to maintain the same level of expenditure without increasing taxes.</P>
    <P>In the context of this amendment it is a source of frustration that the focus is on expenditure with the residual money to be used in providing for tax reductions and tax breaks.  The correct balance has not been struck; both elements should be central to the Government's strategy in terms of fiscal policy.  That is the reason this amendment places firmly at the top of the agenda the questions of tax reductions and public expenditure.  If the current levels of public expenditure are maintained we will face serious problems.</P>
    <P>It is not legitimate to say tax reductions have to be financed by serious cutbacks in public expenditure. Maintaining public expenditure at certain levels allows for more focused tax reductions which would have a bigger impact on the markets.  The problem is that expenditure continues to grow in the public sector which does not form part of the productive economy.  The greatest number of jobs are created and the greatest amounts in tax revenue are generated in the productive economy; the creation of one job in this sector <Col N="33" /> leads to the creation of jobs in other sectors.</P>
    <P>If we compare the increases in salaries in the public sector with those in the private sector in recent years there is a huge difference.  Companies such as Packard have to live in the real world where they endure pressure in terms of productivity, competitiveness and efficiency.  Despite the fact that the public sector has been sheltered there has been sustained growth in expenditure and manpower and huge increases in salaries in recent years.  The question which has to be asked is whether the State is benefiting.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage a very simple example was given.  It cost £250,000 to produce and publish the White Paper on Education.  This was an extraordinary waste of scarce resources given that the original copy was sufficient and quite acceptable.  If such largesse is available we can only look forward to further wasteful increases in public expenditure.</P>
    <P>While I acknowledge that the process of tax reform has continued in recent years and no one can deny that there have been improvements this year the Minister failed miserably to take an unprecedented opportunity to make further progress in reforming the taxation system and to make a radical and definitive statement which would have had an impact on the markets given that tax rates and employment costs are major factors taken into account by companies when deciding whether they should locate here.</P>
    <P>Given current levels of expenditure it is clear that the Government's policies are expenditure driven.  In preparing the next budget the Minister will be faced with the question of whether taxes will have to be raised if these levels are to be sustained.  These two elements are of equal importance; the Minister did not give equal importance to both, but went for policies which were expenditure driven to the detriment of tax reform.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A large number of amendments have been tabled in my name and these address many of the concerns expressed by Deputies.  I will therefore deliberately curtail my comments during Report Stage to facilitate debate.  I do not propose to respond in full for those reasons.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy asked a number of specific questions.  In relation to the social insurance fund the contributory principle has to be maintained.  How it is to be treated for the purpose of taxation has to be considered but the question of pensions in the future is a Europe-wide issue.  The current teachers' dispute is partly related to it. We have to be very careful in addressing it.  I have not yet reached a final view on the matter.</P>
      <P>In response to Deputy Cullen no one was more surprised than the former Minister for Finance that he had a current account surplus at the end of last year because he had not planned for this at the beginning of the year.  We should move towards a position where the Government plans expenditure over three or four years and, with such a track record, it could then begin to do the sort of planning to which the amendment refers.  I agree with Deputy McCreevy that one must first control expenditure planning.  Deputy McDowell's amendment is the same as his Committee Stage amendment, his speech was very similar and likewise my response is the same.  I am opposed to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Minister for his fulsome reply.  It seems the Minister and Deputy Upton who spoke for the Labour Party believe in high taxation and high spending.  That is what Labour is all about.  Deputy Upton said that the ballpark figure for the four year programme would be £1 billion.  I have no doubt that is the case, but that would mean that in every one of those four years an extra £250 million in resources would have to be made available to sustain a programme of tax reform of this kind.  If the increase in public spending is maintained within 2 per cent of the inflation rate, the Government could easily afford such tax reform over a four year period given the growth rates we are likely to experience in the next three to five years.  It could be done if the Government exercised basic self-control on expenditure.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cullen referred to the cost of the White Paper on Education, a matter I raised on Committee Stage.  That £250,000 self-aggrandizement by the Minister for Education is a scandal.  I do not know why the Department of Finance did not prevent that Minister spending £250,000 on this item.  If 400 such mistakes were made in a year, £1 billion would be wasted on worthless self aggrandizement.  There are many more examples of mistakes such as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much more crucial is the content of the White Paper on Education.  It does not mention the Department of Finance's estimate of £1.2 billion extra expenditure which it will cost to implement its provisions.  The Department was ashamed to put a price tag on this Labour Party programme for an extra £1 billion in public spending. Deputy Upton is a member of a party that will increase public spending wastefully in the way described in the White Paper.  I want to contain public spending. It is strange that not a single word in the White Paper indicates how much any provision in it will cost.  I am glad the Minister for Finance is in the House because he abdicated his position as a member of Government by allowing a White Paper to be published in the <Col N="36" /> Government's name with a huge expenditure implication without including, even on one page, the cost of the provisions. It is a scandalous abuse of taxpayers' patience and time to publish a White Paper which on the face of it is uncosted but costed in secret dossiers in the Department of Finance.  That is very bad Government.  It is very bad to create a public appetite for expenditure when one cannot deliver on it.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy McCreevy that the social insurance fund must be reviewed.  Social insurance as a concept is outdated, and I am not speaking from a peculiar economic perspective.  The Labour Party in Britain knows that the social insurance concept is dead and is preparing to abandon it.  Of course the Minister is correct in saying that the contributory principle should be maintained in some form, but he does not have to pretend there is a social insurance fund when that is not the case. He can simply set notional payments for people with certain employment records.</P>
    <P>Nothing I have heard today has deflected me from the point of view that any Government that wants to tackle the taxation of low paid employees at the rate we are doing must control expenditure and set out a programme at the beginning of its term to which it will adhere.  In that context Deputy McCreevy is not consistent &mdash; he claims to be so &mdash; because his party leader favours reducing the top rate of tax to 40 per cent and the bottom rate to 20 per cent.  At the next election Fianna Fáil may cosy up to the Labour Party again&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; and repeat its mistakes, or it will find there are other parties in this House who will insist on the delivery of tax reform.  The Fianna Fáil Party in particular must wise up in one respect and face up to the issue &mdash; Deputy Upton in particular should be concerned about this &mdash; that if a person <Col N="37" /> taking home £172 per week earns an extra £10, the State will take £5.80 of that.  That is unjust, and any socialist who has a concept of the interests and demands of the working class would not permit those circumstances to exist.  Nor would they accept the intellectual and economic cant to which we have been subjected today that that is the alternative to slicing money off public expenditure programmes.  That is not so, and a properly managed economy would not force us to make that type of choice.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has not responded to this amendment indepth because I am content to rely on what he said on Committee Stage.  As long as the Labour Party is in office and controls the Department of Finance, decisions will continue to be made to keep in place an unfair, anti-work, anti-enterprise tax system.  The Labour Party is not demonstrating consistency.  It published a document in 1988 or 1989 in which it accepted, with slight variations, the argument for radical tax reform and changes of the kind I am talking about. It got votes on foot of that argument.  It had red roses plastered everywhere demanding support for those policies, but when it went into Government it sat down on the job and started spending money as if it grew on trees.  That is the difference between the Labour Party when it is looking for votes and when it is in office.  It has surrendered in terms of public spending this year to a whole range of interest groups and the débácle of the White Paper on Education is only one instance of that.  It is piling up more and more expenditure obligations out of which it will have to reverse even this year.</P>
      <P>I do not accept there is anything wrong with consistency.  I agree that inflexibility is a vice in a politician, and no-one will be as flexible as I am in ensuring this tax package is delivered. Anybody who thinks the Labour Party will go to the polls without having around its neck the broken promises on taxation it wilfully made to the electorate is codding himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two issues involved and two ways of approaching them.  We have had a debate on education. The majority of people directly involved in sending their children to third level education and those <Col N="39" /> delivering the service have said that maintenance costs as opposed to the fees issue is the main concern.  I commend the thrust of the Minister's provision to include landlords in the legitimate economy and my amendment expands on that.  Many thousands of third level students live in rented accommodation.  The exclusion of such rented accommodation from the remit of the Bill will have two consequences. No direct benefit will be given to those struggling to send their children to third level education and a number of unscrupulous landlords will move into that market exclusively as students are not required to secure and forward those landlords' PRSI numbers to the Revenue Commissioners because they do not benefit from a tax reduction as the majority of them are not income earners.  If there is no mechanism for students to avail of a tax break those landlords will not be included in the legitimate system.  I am concerned that a number of them are unscrupulous enough for whatever reasons, tax avoidance probably being the greatest, to concentrate on the student market and this may result in a deterioration in the quality of properties rented by students.</P>
      <P>This is a reasonable amendment and will not impose a major charge on the Exchequer or force it to incur a substantial loss of revenue.  It is vital that this is considered at a time when there is such high level debate on education following the publication of a White Paper.  It is becoming more difficult for families to secure the necessary funding to send their children to third level education. Parents or guardians of non-income earning students in rented accommodation attending third level institutes should be able to avail of a tax break. That would mean a great deal to the family involved in terms of some return for the high cost of maintaining a student at third level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot remember the figure the Minister gave of the proportion of <Col N="40" /> students living in rented accommodation, but I recall it was small in terms of the total number of students.</P>

Much of that is valuable and welcome, but the Minister is missing an opportunity to include landlords in the tax net and to provide an incentive for parents, particularly those marginally above the grant threshold who do not receive any State assistance and would benefit greatly from a small tax break while sending their children to third level education. The £3 million charge may be revenue neutral as the revenue gained from the inclusion of such landlords in the tax net may offset the cost of the provision to the Exchequer.  I was under the impression on Committee Stage that the Minister saw some merit in this measure and on the basis of what I have said I hope he will consider the amendment. If the State promoted such a course of action that would encourage parents to send their children to third level education.</P>

We are already giving support towards reducing the costs of third level education to parents and students who are not able to avail of the grant system in terms of measure to abolish third level fees that will come into effect in the next two years.  The extension of relief to students as distinct from flat dwellers would be an additional cost which I regret I cannot afford.</P>

      <P>In page 19, line 38, after &ldquo;£150&rdquo; to insert&rdquo; or the amount, if lesser, of the service charge actually proven to have been paid&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have a particular reason for tabling this amendment.  I am worried that if the tax free allowance of £150 in regard to service charges is confined to only those who pay the full charge then those who have the greatest objections to paying the charges, and may by and large qualify for a waiver from local authorities, will not be eligible to claim the full allowance.  Some people do not pay service charges and others pay only a portion of them.  Under the Bill, unless a person pays the full local authority charge they are not eligible to claim the £150 tax free allowance.  The Minister is wrong in this regard because, by and large, the greatest objectors to the charges do not pay the full amount, some do not pay anything.  Local authorities are concerned about the Government's position on such charges, for example, they do not know if the charges will be abolished or if they will be given the power to turn off water supplies on those who break the law. People should not be above the law or advised to break it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the value we receive from EU structural <Col N="43" /> funds and of the importance of local authority income.  Many local authorities are generating income and are in a position to match EU funding for schemes under operational programmes and this has been beneficial to many communities.  Waterford Corporation is endeavouring to employ 250 people under the community employment scheme, a significant figure for the area. While funding is available under the community scheme, it must be prime-pumped to provide the materials to get people to work.  In Waterford we have been able to use local authority income to provide materials to carry out works. I do not underestimate the great benefit of income to local authorities.  My amendment seeks to remove the animosity of this double taxation from as wide a range of people as possible, but I am concerned that a partial waiver applies to the greatest objectors who will not benefit from the tax break, and will continue the protests.  I hope the Minister will accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>While the Deputy's contribution was very constructive, the amendment is redundant in that, as I understand it, the allowance applies to such people.  If those to which a partial waiver applies pay income tax they can receive up to a maximum of £150 tax allowance against the charge.  If, for example, they pay an £80 service charge, they will receive a tax allowance of £80. If a person pays a service charge of £200, the maximum tax free allowance would be £150.  A <i>pro rata</i> rate applies against income tax up to £150 and I understand that is the thrust of the Deputy's amendment.  If a partial waiver applies to the people to whom he refers and they pay tax, they qualify for the allowance.</P>

      <P>The maximum charge in my local authority area is £150 with different rates applying within the city of Waterford, the lowest being approximately £75.

    </Speaker>

      <Col N="45" /> (a) the amount equal to the appropriate percentage of the amount proved to be so paid or the appropriate percentage of the specified limit, whichever is the lesser, and</P>
    <P>(b) the amount which reduces that income tax to nil:</P>
    <P>Provided that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) in the case of a claimant who is assessed to tax for the year of assessment in accordance with the provisions of section 194 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, any payments made by the spouse of the claimant, in respect of which that spouse would have been entitled to relief under this section if the spouse were assessed to tax for the year of assessment in accordance with the provisions of section 193 (apart from the provision thereto) of the said Act, shall be deemed to have been made by the claimant;</P>
    <P>(ii) in the case of an individual who resides on a full-time basis in the premises to which the service charges relate and pays such service charges in accordance with the requirements of this section on behalf of the claimant, that claimant may disclaim the relief provided by this section in favour of the individual and such disclaimer shall be in such form as the Revenue Commissioners may require.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>For legal reasons this is a fairly lengthy amendment.  Deputies will recall that on Committee Stage we debated the case of a son or daughter living at home, maintaining the occupier &mdash; the person to whom the service charge is billed &mdash; and paying the outgoing costs of the household.  Deputies felt it was essential that if such a person pays income tax, <Col N="46" /> he or she should benefit from this allowance. The point was well made on Committee Stage and I am giving effect to it in this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a fruitful discussion on this section on Committee Stage and I appreciate what the Minister has done.  As he stated, the purpose of these amendments is to give sons or daughters who pay the service charges the benefit of the allowance.  In County Kildare old age pensioners and the unemployed are entitled to benefit from a waiver scheme, but if their sons or daughters reside with them and earn an income, the total income of the household is taken into account and a waiver does not apply.  The local authority in Kildare has built up a sophisticated waiver system over many years and, in such circumstances, this section, as originally drafted would not have allowed the person paying the service charge to benefit from the tax break.  The Minister's amendment solves this problem.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage we also referred to the phrase &ldquo;in full and on time&rdquo;, which has not been deleted from the section.  The Minister will be aware that most local authorities operate a weekly payment method.  For example, in the Kildare local authority area people usually pay instalments of, say, £2.50 per week.  While the charge is paid in full over a period, I am concerned that those people would not benefit for the full tax relief.  If the Minister assures me they will, I will accept his amendment.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Dempsey, made a valid point on Committee Stage about certificates being sought from local authorities to prove that people have paid their service charges.  Has further consideration been given to that matter?  Suggestions were put forward on Committee Stage to simplify the procedures so that people who pay their service charges would be given proper relief, which is the whole thrust of this section.</P>

      <P>I welcome the change which the Minister's amendment <Col N="47" /> makes because it is twofold.  It does not merely deal with the points I raised, it also raises the question of spouses.  On my reading of it, it does not require cohabitation and, therefore, it is of some significance that non-cohabiting spouses can pay their partners' bill for service charges.  In that way, it is an improvement on what I was suggesting.  Would the Minister be willing to take the view that the phrase &ldquo;of an individual who resides on a full-time basis&rdquo; is unduly restrictive?  The phrase I used, &ldquo;who normally resides&rdquo;, is fair because if somebody is away for two or three months of the year, can it be said that they reside on a full-time basis with that other person?  I believe &ldquo;normally resides&rdquo; is a more sensible phraseology.</P>

      <P>Yes, It deals with that.  In regard to Deputy Dempsey's point, as I recall he was concerned about the intrusion of privacy of giving somebody one's RSI number.  That was done at the suggestion of the Revenue Commissioners. Meath County Council, which is responsible for Deputy Dempsey's constituency, would simply give a disc to the Revenue Commissioners with the RSI numbers of all the people claiming the relief.  That information would then go into the system and I believe that is an efficient way of doing it rather than having numerous files in various locations.  The local authority will decide what constitutes &ldquo;on time&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;or any of the charities listed in the Second Schedule&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the provision in the Finance Act to give tax relief on donations to designated Third World charities.  As I am sure the Minister is aware, his noble and good idea has brought a considerable amount of controversy upon his head.  I have sat in the Minister's chair on previous occasions putting various Bills through and I know that when a Minister comes up with a good idea, some people will agree with him but it often creates controversy involving many other organisations which results in a lot of abuse being levelled at the Minister.  He probably wonders why he ever went ahead with the idea in the first place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said on Committee Stage, I can envisage the type of debate that took place in the Department of Finance when the Minister came up with the idea of giving tax relief on donations to designated Third World charities.  I referred to it some time ago as a kind of hypothetical discussion between the Minister and his officials and I am well aware of what would have taken place during such a discussion.  The Minister might have been told that if he goes down this road, he might open a Pandora's box which will never be closed.  In fairness to the Minister, he stuck with his idea of tax relief on donations to Third World charities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose the original idea was that individuals and organisations would be given tax relief on donations to Third <Col N="50" /> World charities, which other tax jurisdictions to the west of Ireland allow. However, a very smart official in the Department of Finance decided that if the Minister was so insistent on this particular idea, it could be a way to kill two birds with one stone.  The way the section is proposed has much to say for it as far as the Government is concerned because it does not give tax relief to the person donating money to the Third World charity; it puts in place a mechanism whereby the State will know the total amount of money that taxpayers give annually to Third World charities. The relief is not given to the person making the donation.  When the designated Third World charity receives a donation, the person making it will be asked to give their RSI number &mdash; some people may not be prepared to do that. At the end of a certain period the charity will send all the RSI numbers to the Revenue Commissioners who will, by their mechanism, give a grant for the amount of tax that would have been foregone by the individual concerned. That has great merit from a Government viewpoint because, at the press of a button, it will know the total amount of money Ireland donated to Third World charities.  In that way, Ireland's contribution to Third World aid will be seen to be nearer the mark set by the OECD.  I congratulate the person in the Department of Finance who thought up this particular mechanism.</P>
    <P>This mechanism, however, has made the playing pitch uneven.  It is a noble and good idea to recognise our contribution to Third World charities but we all know the phrase &ldquo;charity begins at home&rdquo;.  This amendment states &ldquo;or any of the charities listed in the Second Schedule&rdquo;.  That refers to amendment No. 77 which contains a list of organisations concerned with Third World charities that come under the National Charities of Ireland.  I believe the Minister should set a ceiling &mdash; and this was proposed by the charities &mdash; in regard to what the cost to the Exchequer would be in line with the cost of providing tax relief on donations to Third World <Col N="51" /> charities.  This is a fair proposal, I would not take from the Minister the power to come up with some other mechanism of designating Irish charities but it is unfair to ask people to discriminate between a charity here and a charity abroad.</P>
    <P>The benefits of the national lottery are there for all to see.  The idea of a national lottery was resisted initially by many people, not least by members in my party for a variety of reasons and was introduced by a Coalition Government of which Deputy Quinn was a member.  The national lottery has had the effect of lessening the take for all charities, both Third World and Irish charities.  If measures now proposed make it more attractive to donate to Third World charities, people will be encouraged to give donations to them. It is only fair to give this concession to Irish charities as well.  What is evident from the list of charities in the Third Schedule, which are under the umbrella of the national charities in Ireland, is that they are all very worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been lobbied by Members from all sides to give similar relief to Irish charities.  I am disappointed we did not convince him on Committee Stage to table an appropriate amendment which would have the same effect as this amendment which I ask him to accept.</P>

      <P>I saw a few other things that might be applicable to Deputy McCreevy but I will not go into them now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy McCreevy that it is invidious to discriminate between <Col N="52" /> charities.  It is invidious to exclude, for instance, the Irish Red Cross from this because it is not committed solely to the narrow focus which subsection (2) (d) requires.  One can either allow the Minister for Finance to designate the charities or alternatively take the view Deputy McCreevy has taken to achieve the only fair result in circumstances such as this, that every reasonable charity should be treated equally by the State and we should not make this fundamental distinction between domestic and foreign charities.  The Minister explained on Committee Stage why he did not agree with that and I will not ask him to repeat himself but to consider the point I raised on Committee Stage and which Deputy McCreevy raised today &mdash; the damage done to charities' fund raising capacity by the national lottery.</P>
    <P>It is probably three to four years since a proposal was first made to the Departments of Finance and Justice that the Gaming and Lotteries Act, or the National Lottery Act in so far as it amended the Gaming and Lotteries Act should be amended to increase the prize funds and therefore the scale of the lotteries which non-government charities can run.  I ask the Minister to indicate in principle a willingness to increase the prize funds for lotteries organised by domestic charities.  If he cannot accommodate them in the way Deputy McCreevy and I have proposed in these amendments the very least he could do is indicate that the present unreasonable limit on their capacity for fund raising by lottery should be altered and they for example should have a prize fund of £100,000 to enable them to run a decent lottery where the prize is something more than a very modest car.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I note from subsection (2) (d) that a charity must have as its sole object, relief and development in a country or countries where the country or countries concerned is or are for the time being on the list of Aid Recipients of OECD.  There are other charities such as the Society of St. <Col N="53" /> Vincent de Paul and the Irish Red Cross who work abroad as well as in Ireland and they will be excluded from benefiting from his very worthwhile section.  If the Minister will not give all charities relief under this section will he consider charities that have a commitment to countries outside this country as well as in the country?  The work they are doing is as important as the work by those who are working solely in developing countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case, presumably the Red Cross will qualify but if it is not the case it is probably an over-sight. I can understand the concerns of the charities.  The benefit does not come directly to the individual so there is no personal incentive for an individual to contribute to Third World charities.  For example, if one gives £100 to a Third World charity one gets nothing extra compared with giving £100 to a charity on Deputy McCreevy's list.  The Minister made the reasonable point earlier in the debate that we will look at this next year to see how it will impact on the income of charities.  I think he has given a commitment to review the situation if it has a significant deleterious effect.  It is worth going ahead with that measure on this basis.  It is a new idea and as Deputy McCreevy rightly said we should give new ideas a greater hearing than we have in the past.  I do not expect it will have a radically deleterious effect but if it does, there is provision that the Minister will make changes if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody is objecting to the tax incentive being given to overseas charities but what clearly is at issue is that domestic charities have been on a bad run for the past few years with none of the breaks seeming to come their <Col N="54" /> way.  The national lottery had an effect on the fund-raising capacity of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and many other organisations that provide services here.  If voluntary organisations did not provide these services, it would fall back on the State to provide them. We should be mindful of the work of the voluntary sector.  We, more so than any other country in Europe have a record of raising funds for charitable causes and using charitably donated funds to supplement what the State does or to fund activity which the State does not fund.</P>
      <P>Irish charities feel rightly that the changes in recent years have gone against them and nothing that has happened would lead them to see that the State recognises the huge volume of voluntary work they do and its impact on the deprived in our society.  This provision in the Bill highlights the impression that nothing seems to be going their way.  The issue was raised on Second Stage.  Clearly, there is a case for allowing charities to increase the prizes they offer and that could be done in this Bill.  It would be a sea change and would recognise the value of their work.  It would also enable them continue their activities on the domestic market.  It is not just one part of the world which is deprived.  All countries have difficulties and Ireland has much social deprivation with which the State alone cannot deal. Charitable organisations help to meet the need.  I listened to what the Minister said on Committee Stage.  However, it would be quite easy to include Irish charities as well.  I do not know if we asked what the expected cost to the Exchequer would be.</P>

I received correspondence for a number of organisations, particularly from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, and they point out that the success of the national lottery has affected their ability to fundraise. Over £4.5 million may be won tonight on the national lottery and it is relevant to discuss the effect the lottery has on Irish charities.  I know at first hand the great work the Irish Red Cross is doing in south Galway helping the victims of the recent flooding.  That organisation will not qualify under this Bill.  Consideration should be given to including Irish charities.  The national lottery prize fund is tempting and Irish charities find that people do not contribute as much to them as they did in the past.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister to amend this section.  In common with other Members I am sure the Minister has received representations from Irish charities.  One letter I received was from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. <Col N="56" /> I know every organisation will make its case but this letter was written by a person who worked in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners for 41 years before his retirement in 1988.  He expressed the view that he had not seen a section like this in any previous Finance Bill.  The Minister should take note of that and address the matter even at this late stage.</P>
      <P>The person stated that a large part of his work involved reading and interpreting Finance Acts.  As regards section 2 of this Bill, he doubts if any Third World charities, apart from two, will qualify given the wording of the Bill.  Such a statement from a person who held a responsible position and knows about finance deserves careful scrutiny.  Deputy Kitt also mentioned the society, an organisation with which we are familiar and support.  The Irish Society of St. Vincent de Paul is involved overseas yet it will not qualify under the Bill.  Similarly, the Irish Red Cross is disqualified because it is helping people in Galway.  I ask the Minister to ease the restriction in this area.  I acknowledge the original intention was a good and laudable one but it will cause problems for Irish charities, the Revenue Commissioners and future Ministers.  It is unnecessarily restrictive and I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to accept the amendment.  If I were to extend charitable status for tax deductible purposes to domestic charities, I would not do it in this form.  It is in a particular form and Deputy McCreevy touched close enough to its genesis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was arguing this case and the necessity for it to be ring-fenced so that it would not have a knock-on domestic effect, which is a very valid argument &mdash; one is giving substance to the wisdom of those people who predicted that it would have a knock-on effect &mdash; I said I wanted it to be done in such a way that it would qualify as an additional part of Ireland's overall ODA contribution. The OECD in Paris has indicated that <Col N="57" /> the transfer of cash will have to be from the State to the recipient body and not via an individual who has a tax allowance, as is normal in the United States and other countries.  As Deputy Upton said, there is no apparent benefit from the point of view of an individual subscriber; in other words, £100 is £100.  For example, if I give £100 to the very eminent charity, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, it is £100 to me whereas if I give it to Concern, assuming it qualifies under section 2, it is worth approximately £127 to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>One would do it under a standing order.</P>
      <P>On the general points on charities, I will consult with the Minister for Justice about lotteries and their effect on revenue. Virtually all of the charities listed in amendment No. 77 relate to some form of physical or mental illness and most, if not all, of them &mdash; I am open to correction on this point &mdash; are in receipt of direct or indirect State funding and all the people directly affected are in receipt of funding of one kind or another.  There is no similar social welfare system in the Third World.  An enormous amount of money, £3 billion, already goes into the social welfare system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy McCreevy will be aware, within the budget for the Department of Social Welfare there is a fund which is given to charities, particularly at Christmas time.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul is one of the major recipients.  It is not fair to say that this is an &ldquo;either or&rdquo; situation, that charities are not getting any help from the State and are being put at a disadvantage.  I accept the argument that this could pose a further difficulty for charities in terms of fundraising.  Deputy McDowell and others referred to the prize money they can give in competitions, and we are examining this matter.  The national lottery makes donations to many of these bodies through the Department of Health but it does not give money to <Col N="58" /> Third World charities &mdash; it is prohibited from doing so.</P>
    <P>The point I made in my Budget Statement and on Second Stage is that this is the 150th anniversary of the Famine and this system gives citizens an opportunity to indicate their priorities in terms of Third World charities.  The tax relief will go directly to the receiving charity and, as a result of the way in which the money is transferred, it will officially qualify for inclusion by way of additionality in Ireland's ODA contribution. As a member of the United Nations we are obliged to move to a figure of 0.7 per cent of GNP and, if my memory serves me correctly, we are at a figure of approximately 0.2.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the strength of the lobby by the various organisations which contacted Deputies on all sides of the House, including me.  If they can demonstrate satisfactorily next year that their income has been severely damaged then we will look at that matter in due course in the totality of Government action.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Dempsey, the conditions in subsection (2) were drafted in consultation with the ODA section.  In the normal course of events many of these bodies would receive State moneys directly under the multilateral aid programme and they would be required to have a standard set of books, accounts etc.  There were also consultations with the Revenue Commissioners who have a major role to play in the drafting of all Finance Bills. I do not anticipate the kind of difficulties to which the Deputy referred but if they emerge we will correct them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's initiative and decision to go ahead with this proposal which I am sure was tossed around for a long time.  He was probably advised that he would open up the debate we are now having.  There may be a plus factor for many Departments in going down the road of giving tax relief to Irish-based charities in that it could give the Minister for Justice, the Revenue Commissioners and other <Col N="59" /> Departments a handle on all the Irish charities in existence and the people raising money for charities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before they raise money these charities should have to get clearance from the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Justice and people should be able to examine their accounts.  This should be a condition of giving tax relief to them.  Irrespective of the arguments in favour of tax relief, there is compelling evidence of the need to do this.  For example, whenever I stop at traffic lights I am approached by people carrying buckets who are collecting for charities.  I was secretary of a Fianna Fáil Cumann in County Kildare and before we can hold a fundraising event we have to get permission from the local Garda superintendent and go through procedures which have been in place for many years.  These procedures now seem to be ignored by charities.  The Minister should liaise with some of his colleagues on the possibility of putting a mechanism in place which would ensure control in this area.</P>
      <P>I have already argued the need to give some tax relief to Irish-based charities from the point of view of equity. The Minister gave some credence to that argument and said he would look at it again next year if major distortions had taken place.  Distortions will inevitably take place as it is the Third World charities which will be designated and it is only to be expected that they will advertise this fact, thus encouraging people to give their contributions to them.  There is nothing wrong in doing this, it is a good selling point, but it will give rise to distortions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are sending an indirect signal, notwithstanding the good work done in the Third World, that Irish charities are perhaps not as worthy.  It is not a compelling point but it can be construed that <Col N="60" /> way particularly by people who work in those organisations.  Many of those people who give voluntarily of their time &mdash; not the paid executives of such organisations &mdash; may feel slighted.  I know the Minister has no intentions in that regard but the net effect may be as I stated.  The biggest crib I have is that on Committee Stage the Minister, on foot of figures given to him by the Department, said the cost of extending this relief would be £21 million.  I find that difficult to believe.  On Committee Stage I suggested &mdash; this is a suggestion from the Irish national charities &mdash; a cap on this relief of £2 million.  If the relief was given across the board I find it difficult to ascertain how the Minister's Department arrived at a figure which would cost the Exchequer £21 million.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 77 lists the 75 members of the National Charities of Ireland.  That organisation believes that not more than 100 charities in Ireland would be in a position to avail of the proposed relief as enunciated by me. For those 100 charities, 90 per cent of their income comes from sponsored events, flower days, fund-raising functions, public collections, etc., and 10 per cent comes from unsolicited donations. Included in the 10 per cent are those who donate in the region of £200 to £750.  The Minister's relief for Third World charities is only for donations in the £200 to £750 bracket.  It does not include the odd £5 or £10 which a person may put into a collection for Third World charities.  The Minister should bring forward tax relief for national charities for donations in the same £200 to £750 bracket.  If the relief was confined to donations in the £200 to £750 bracket &mdash; the same as that proposed for Third World charities &mdash; the National Charities of Ireland confidently predict they could not exceed £2 million.  I have done small sums and without being an expert in this area I cannot for the life of me understand how the cost of £21 million, as suggested by the Department of Finance, was arrived at, I humbly submit that £2 million would be closer to the figure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="61" /> The suggestion was made by the National Charities of Ireland that if the amount of relief exceeded £2 million in any one year it should be capped for that amount and the relief carried forward to the following year, a reasonable proposal.  The Minister gave some credence this morning to the figure of £21 million compiled by the Department of Finance or the Revenue Commissioners when he said there were so many thousands of registered charities in Ireland. I understand about 3,000 charities are registered with the Revenue Commissioners. Putting on my hat as a practising chartered accountant, charitable status is designated by the Revenue Commissioners to include parishes, educational and religious establishments and so on.  The main purpose of doing so is that the deposit interest earned by those organisations in bank accounts can be exempted from DIRT tax.  These 3,000 charities include a wide range of organisations which have charitable status from the Revenue Commissioners to avail of that relief but they <Col N="62" /> are not fund-raising charities, as described in my amendment, or the 25 or 35 other charities as well.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Revenue Commissioners or the person in the Department of Finance who arrived at the cost of £21 million based his figure on the 3,000 organisations which have charitable status. Perhaps the Minister's officials did not have time before this debate to get those figures.  I suggest the figure of £21 million is based on the 3,000 organisations and not on the 100 or so charities on which relief would be given.  I think I have a reasonable case.  As Deputy Upton said, capping at an amount of £2 million is acceptable where Third World charities or Irish charities are &ldquo;playing off scratch&rdquo;.  I am a great believer in the phrase: what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  It is only fair that Irish charities not be put at a competitive disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> their counterparts who do great work in the Third World.  I ask the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>We now proceed to amendment No. 13.  I observe that amendment No. 15 is related, that amendment No. 14 is an alternative to amendment No. 13, that amendments Nos. 16, 19 and 20 are alternatives to amendment No. 15 and that amendments Nos. 17 and 18 are consequential on amendment No. 20.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="65" /> In page 28, to delete lines 5 to 51, in page 29, to delete lines 1 to 55, and in page 30, to delete lines 1 to 27.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister has included a hardship clause in amendment No. 20.  It seems that this is apposite to the points raised and will definitely deal with the domestic circumstances to which Deputy Cullen and I referred on Committee Stage.  It would have been unjust if the change proposed had spelled financial ruin for certain families.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate that the hardship clause will be interpreted fairly?  Much will depend on what view the Revenue Commissioners will take in any given case.  For instance, according to the Minister's amendment, the Revenue Commissioners will have to be satisfied that hardship would be caused and will have discretion to apply the exemption to the extent they consider just.  I note that there will be no right of appeal against the decision of the Revenue Commissioners in this matter.  We will therefore be bound to accept what the Revenue Commissioners think is just and consider to be hardship.  If the Minister is in the business of granting an exemption on the grounds of hardship I seek an assurance that the Revenue Commissioners will be fair-minded and positive towards the small minority for whom this amendment is being inserted and will not be niggardly or unfair in their dealings with them.  Many people feel that the Revenue Commissioners have a bad image; I do not accept that, in general the Revenue Commissioners are fair-minded but I seek an assurance that the amendment will be operated in a just and generous way.</P>
    <P>On amendment No. 16, it is fair to insert a minimum sum in terms of covenanted income.  By definition, the 5 per cent income limit is not fair.  Before I reminded myself that it was a pointless activity I had written out a table placing an upper limit on the amount of money which could be covenanted.  It is unfair that a person with an income of £1 million per year can covenant £50,000 with impunity whereas someone with far less <Col N="66" /> is caught by the 5 per cent limit when they would be willing to be more generous. I cannot see the justice in this or the reason the limit has been set at 5 per cent.  I cannot understand why a floor and a ceiling cannot be set.  It is unfair and unjust that a millionaire can contribute £50,000 to needy relatives while someone on an income of £15,000 per annum can only give £750 to his relatives. This does not seem to be consonant with any sense of justice in the tax system that the better off one is the more flaithiúlacht one can be under the covenant system.  If one is on a modest income and has a needy relative they are stuck with this percentage.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The commencement of talks, at ministerial level, between the British Government and Sinn Féin represents an important advance in the peace process. The Government has always believed that such a development would have a consequential effect on the nature of contact between state agencies in Northern Ireland and Sinn Féin.  This was confirmed by Mr. Ancram on 10 May when he said the British Government would allow contact between Ministers and Sinn Féin councillors to take place, contingent on a continuation of the present phase of ministerial dialogue. We would regard such contact as part of the wider objective of achieving full normality.  Matters of that nature and other issues of importance to the peace process were discussed at my meeting with the Sinn Féin leader on 5 May.</P>
      <P>The British Prime Minister and I reviewed a range of developments in a most useful discussion in Moscow on 9 May.  We covered, in particular, the current situation in Northern Ireland and how, together, we can best advance it. We also discussed European affairs, details of which were given yesterday in reply to other related questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Northern Ireland.  I wish to emphasise that the over-riding objective of both the Irish and British Governments is the commencement of all-inclusive dialogue on an agreed settlement, leading to lasting peace and reconciliation.  The British Prime Minister made clear that his Government wants Sinn Féin to participate in political talks on the same basis as other parties.  The two Governments, however, recognise the reality that the Unionist parties in particular are first seeking reassurance before that objective could be feasible to them.  Within that context, the Prime Minister assured me of his Government's intention to realise genuine and productive progress in its ministerial dialogue with Sinn Féin.  For my part, I stressed that the <Col N="69" /> decommissioning of weapons, while an important issue, is not the only item on the agenda.  Matters such as prisoners, policing and recognition of political mandates would also need to be addressed in an imaginative way if the proper climate of confidence for comprehensive talks on a settlement is to materialise.  Important concerns and sensitivities exist on all sides and these need to be approached in a balanced way to move the situation forward.</P>

      <P>Mr. Adams listened carefully to what I had to say.  While there is a constitutional right in all democracies for people to demonstrate in favour of their viewpoints and against policies with which they disagree, there is a concomitant responsibility on those who organise demonstrations in what remains a divided society to ensure those demonstrations do not lead to events which could be harmful to the overall peace process which requires reconciliation as well as the absence of physical violence.  In that context I urged great care on all those, from whatever community, who may be involved this summer in organising demonstrations.</P>

      <P>I note the British Government has moved to lift the remaining restrictions.  That is a positive <Col N="70" /> development and I welcome the statement by the Minister Mr. Ancram in that regard.  Up to now we witnessed the petty position whereby Sinn Féin elected representatives could not deal with constituency matters.  On meeting the Prime Minister Mr. Major, did the Taoiseach communicate his concern at the lack of momentum in many areas of the peace process such as those he mentioned on policing and prisoners?  As we know from discussions, the issue of prisoners is attracting equal concern from loyalist and Nationalist communities because prisoners played a major part, particularly in the case of the loyalist ceasefire, in convincing militants to cease their activities.  What was the Prime Minister's response on that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's view that there is lack of momentum in the peace process.  The contrary is the case and there is sustained and responsible momentum in the peace process.  I raised with the British Prime Minister the issue of greater remission of sentences of prisoners in Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The view of the representatives of prisoners is that there is a lack of momentum.  Perhaps the Taoiseach knows something we do not know, but no prisoners have been released and the regime in prisons is tougher than it was before the ceasefire. Substantial progress on policing issues has not been made and discussion has not taken place on how we can move forward in that regard other than at the forum talks, Strands I, II and III.  On Strand II perhaps the Taoiseach will confirm whether he has issued invitations and, if so, if they have also gone to the smaller loyalist parties?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On prisoners, what progress has been made since the ceasefire last October and what has been done to increase confidence in the peace process by the loyalists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not express satisfaction with the position in regard to prisoners; I challenged the statement the Deputy made here and elsewhere of a lack of momentum in the peace process generally.  That statement is entirely unsustainable bearing in mind the Government has been successful in negotiating the Framework Document, the most comprehensive document of its kind; we have been successful in opening ministerial contacts with Sinn Féin, which never happened before; we have been helpful in ensuring access for Sinn Féin councillors to Ministers, which did not happen before; on this side of the Border we lifted the state of emergency and we organised the commemoration ceremony in Islandbridge which, without precedent, was attended by Sinn Féin representatives, Unionist representatives and representatives of Government and Opposition in a joint commemoration of Irish people who lost their lives and in commemoration of the holocaust.  In symbolic terms that was probably a major advance and is an important contribution to momentum in the peace process on a broad front.</P>
      <P>We continue to apply ourselves in a responsible and non-adventurist way to building a structure of trust and confidence which will lead to true reconciliation. As the Deputy must know, that is not achieved by hyper-active issuing of press releases but rather by solid work behind the scenes which leads to achievements such as those of recent months which I have itemised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the question of prisoners, the position on this side of the Border <Col N="72" /> is that the Government as a contribution to the peace process released a significant number of prisoners earlier than would otherwise have been the case in light of the reality that the risk of reoffence is greatly reduced as a result of the ceasefire.  On the other side of the Border and in Britain prisoner releases are governed by statutory regulations which limit the extent of remission that it is permissible for the Secretary of State or the Home Secretary to grant.  Those regulations need to be changed and I have made the case to the British Prime Minister that they should be changed.  I also availed of the opportunity when meeting Conservative MPs, Government backbenchers in the Bow group in London last week to stress that the regulations should be changed to allow earlier remission.  Furthermore, I have arranged to raise the matter with the Opposition parties in the House of Commons.</P>
    <P>I raised it with the Liberal Democrats Leader when I met him and I understand the issue of changing the regulations to allow earlier remission of prisoners was also raised at a meeting in the Irish Embassy in the past two days with the Opposition Labour Party in Britain. It is a matter we will pursue vigorously because we recognise that prisoners on loyalist and republican sides have made a significant contribution through creating the climate in which the ceasefires became possible and continue to be an important factor in the issue.  We believe early release policies should be considered on a case by case basis &mdash; not generally &mdash; in light of the reduced threat of reoffence.  That requires some change in the legislative provision now made in Britain and Northern Ireland on that matter.  I have and will continue to take up that matter in the same patient and effective way I have taken up other matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that he is becoming soft on the issue of the decommissioning of arms.  He has certainly changed his approach and his language has become even ambivalent. <Col N="73" /> Will he accept that it is not a question of simply recognising Sinn Féin's mandate which is qualified for as long as the IRA hold on to arms?  Will he agree it is paramount to deal with the arms issue if we are to build confidence and get an all inclusive set of talks under way in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy cares to look at my carefully phrased statement on decommissioning the last time this matter was discussed, she will see that I have a firm view on the decommissioning of arms.  I believe that parity of esteem will not be achieved between parties if one party at the table is associated with an organisation which has arms while another in negotiation on the basis of a parity of esteem does not have access to arms.  That issue needs to be tackled in a firm and effective way, but it is not the only item on the agenda. There has been no change in my position on this matter and there will be no change in it regardless of how many times the question is put to me.  As I said on the last occasion, I do not see particular merit in gratuitously repeating this point day in day out because people recognise it is a matter that must be dealt with, but I recognise it is a difficult one for the loyalists and republican movements.  It is not something for which there is a precedent.  While the Government should be firm in stating its views on the matter it must at the same time allow those organisations time and space to reconcile themselves to the reality that parity of esteem cannot be achieved unless the arms issue is dealt with, but they must reach that conclusion themselves.  I do not believe that the type of statement the Deputy made leading into her question is in any sense helpful, it is misleading.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned the word &ldquo;hyperactive&rdquo; in relation to this side of the House and I consider that a compliment.  Will he accept that if it had not been for the hyperactivity of the Fianna Fáil Party in Government we would not have an IRA <Col N="74" /> and loyalist ceasefire?  Regarding Question No. 2 relating to the Strand II talks the Taoiseach said in the House some time back that he would issue invitations to all the parties in the North to take part in talks.  Will he lay down the same preconditions for those talks as the British Government did in its negotiations with some of those parties regarding talks with them?  When he discussed the conflict on this island with Mr. Major did he ask him about troop reductions, particularly in the Border areas, and about the withdrawal of the large military arsenals and checkpoints in Border areas?</P>

      <P>The Government has no preconditions for talks with any of the parties of the kind to which the Deputy referred.  The matter of troop reductions was touched upon in my meeting with the Prime Minister.  We have noted that there has been a significant reduction in troop presence in Northern Ireland.  We have acknowledged that has contributed to an atmosphere which is less threatening and conductive to political progress, but we also acknowledge that further progress, particularly regarding physical installations which may be obtrusive, can and should be made.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the sense of frustration on both sides of the Border at what they consider a <Col N="75" /> lack of urgency on the part of the Government towards the peace process? When does he expect Strand II of the talks to commence?  Had he any response from the British Prime Minister when he spoke to him about policing, an issue of fundamental importance? Did he discuss the relationship between the Secretary of State and the police authority and the role of the Chief Constable in policing?  That is an appropriate matter at this time of the year when difficulties which arise during the marching season often result in street protests.  Why will the summit between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister not take place until September? In view of the urgency to ensure that the peace process moves forward effectively&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Any time I need to talk to him or he needs to talk to me we do so.  We continue to have very good communication on all relevant issues and I do not believe there is any particular significance or value in setting a date for a formal summit because contacts are so intense and ongoing that it is not a crucial question. I most certainly do not accept that there is any sense of feeling among the public on either side of the Border of a lack of urgency on the part of the Government regarding the peace process.  On the contrary, there has been a negative reaction to the attempts by Fianna Fáil to make such statement and inferences. They are not true&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Regarding policing, the House will more than fully understand that while improvements have been made in this area, there has been a dramatic increase since the ceasefire in the number of applicants coming from the minority community seeking to join the police in Northern Ireland.  I understand it has doubled, or more than doubled in proportionate terms, even in the period since last August.</P>
      <P>Further progress is necessary in the area of policing and that must be concomitant with, and to some degree flow from, a political settlement.  In terms of organisation, structure and political accountability, policing arrangements relate to political arrangements and, therefore, we will not achieve a satisfactory policing system until we have a satisfactory institutional and political position in regard to the overall governance of Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the talks process is to reach such a settlement. Members from all sides must recognise that there remains a major division of loyalty and perception between the Unionist and Nationalist communities as to the appropriate way forward.  I welcome the fact that the principal political leaders of those communities have met to at least discuss <Col N="77" /> economic issues.  This is a major step forward.  I am working with the British Government to create conditions in which we can have all-inclusive dialogue on Northern Ireland, including organisations formally associated with parliamentary activity.  Only when we hold all-inclusive discussions will we be able to achieve the necessary all-encompassing settlement which can be achieved by patient and determined work.  It will not be achieved very quickly because we are talking about overcoming a legacy of not only decades, but of centuries of distrust between the two communities.</P>

Will the Taoiseach outline who he invited and the response he has received.  I emphasise the necessity for Strand II invitations to be issued to republicans, Nationalists, loyalists and Unionists.  If republicans and loyalists were at Strand II of the talks, the Taoiseach would have an opportunity to discuss the very serious matter of punishment beatings.  The absence of shooting and bombings does not mean there is peace in some areas in Northern Ireland.

Arising from the meeting with Gerry Adams, apart from the arms issue did the Taoiseach raise in any substantive manner the continuing ferocity of punishment beatings in the North? What response did Gerry Adams give to the Taoiseach?</P>

      <P>If the Government's position is misrepresented I will correct the misrepresentation without apology. So, far as the other part of Deputy O'Donnell's question is concerned, I have repeatedly expressed my concern about punishment beatings by loyalist and republican associated groups.  It is a matter of grave concern and entirely inconsistent with the peace process that such punishment beatings should occur. It is, however, quite difficult in all cases to assign responsibility for these, to determine whether they are in any sense centrally organised or simply local events undertaken on a freelance basis by individuals or groups of individuals. Either way, it is a thoroughly reprehensible and anti-democratic practice and I will use every opportunity I can to make that view known and to discourage anybody who may be giving any kind of sympathy or understanding to those who are engaged in such practices.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the following has been the <Col N="82" /> timetable since the Downing Street Declaration 18 months ago: the ceasefires were announced nine months ago; the Forum was established six months ago and we had the Joint Framework Document, which was merely an elaboration of the Downing Street Declaration, three months ago?  Now we have a vague proposal about a summit meeting with the British Prime Minister next September.  Does all that not amount to a grave stalling of the peace process? Will the Taoiseach give this House some indication soon of the specific items he proposes to have on the agenda for the meeting with the British Prime Minister next September?  I attend meetings every week of the Forum but nothing can be achieved by these meetings because of the lack of leadership from the Taoiseach and the Government in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of <Col N="85" /> policing, I have already given a comprehensive answer to that question to Deputy O'Hanlon.  I do not think there is any purpose is repeating what I said on that subject.  In so far as the relationship between the different talks is concerned, our objective in regard to Strand I is to get all inclusive talks underway, in other words, talks involving Sinn Féin as well as the other parties. Because of the difficulties over the arms issue we cannot say when that will happen.  There are issues in regard to arms, for example, that have to be sorted out before we reach a fully inclusive position.  I am hopeful we will reach that stage reasonably soon.  We are working hard with the British Government to get to that point.  From my personal contacts with the British Prime Minister I believe he is as equally determined as I am to reach that point. That is what he is working towards and I have made that clear to Sinn Féin as I have no doubt Mr. Micheal Ancram has done also.  Obviously there are difficulties that have to be overcome and anything that can be done in this House to encourage people to make substantive progress on the decommissioning issue will be helpful towards getting all inclusive talks started in Strand I.  That has to be our common objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as Strand II is concerned, that relates to the issue of North-South discussion. Part of the component of such North-South relationships is the institutions in Northern Ireland.  There is an inevitable inter-relationship between Strand II and Strand I.  It would not be possible to complete Strand II unless Strand I was also making progress.  I am anxious to have fruitful and full discussions with all the parties in Northern Ireland, all of whom I have already met but on a more formal basis, to move forward on the issues that are relevant to Strand II.  These will feed in to the consideration of issues in Strand I.  There is not any barrier between the two Strands &mdash; they support and reinforce one another.  The third Strand which needs <Col N="86" /> to be considered concerns the East-West relationship on which much work needs to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>You call the Deputies, a Cheann Comhairle.  Despite what the Taoiseach has said, I put it to him that he has changed the position on the arms issue.  It has gone from being a primary issue to being just another issue and that is a major change.  We will not be successful with Strand I if that issue is not dealt with and I believe the pressure has been reduced because of the ambivalent language that has been used.  In his meeting with the British Prime Minister, did the Taoiseach ask him to use his influence to ensure that those who are organising parades in the forthcoming marching season do not route those triumphalist parades through areas where they are not wanted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not allow Deputy Harney to misrepresent my position on the arms issue.  I do not understand why she is trying to misrepresent my position on decommissioning. From the very first day I spoke on this issue, on the steps of Downing Street after my initial meeting with Prime Minister Major, I made it clear that the decommissioning of arms was an important issue on which substantial progress must be made but that it was not the only item on the agenda.  That is the formula I used last December, have continued to use and am using to this <Col N="87" /> day.  There has not been nor will there be a change in my position and I forcefully reject Deputy Harney's inference that there has been.  Furthermore, on the question of parades it is important that restraint be shown by all sides in regard to demonstrations and parades in a divided community.  I have conveyed that view to Sinn Féin, particularly in the light of events in Derry on the occasion of the British Prime Minister's visit to that city.  On average there are 250 parades of a Nationalist provenance and 2,400 parades of a Unionist provenance annually in Northern Ireland. Responsibility, care and restraint both in regard to the organisation and number of parades needs to be exercised by both communities.  I addressed my plea for restraint to both communities in Northern Ireland in order that both communities can benefit to the full from the peace process which is in the interests of both communities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier the Taoiseach said in relation to Strand II talks, talks between his Government and the Northern Ireland parties, that there would be no preconditions.  Later he said he would not talk to anyone who espoused violence and we on this side accept that.  Our recent history, particularly in relation to the peace process, proves our acceptance of that.  Yet there seems to be a delay in inviting people to these talks.  Am I correct in assuming the reason for the delay is that there is a precondition that the British Government has to be satisfied first in its negotiations with a party such as Sinn Féin? In effect, is the Taoiseach saying he will not send out invitations prior to the British Government entering into full talks with a party such as Sinn Féin?</P>

That is not a factor in my consideration of that matter.  I am, however, anxious and the House will understand that, to get the maximum number of parties to accept the invitation. I do not want to issue invitations to find that only representatives of one community will accept them.  That would be counter productive.  I am in a responsible way, through informal contacts taking the steps necessary to ensure that the invitations are issued at a time, in a form and in circumstances that achieve the maximum attendance rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>I believe the leaking of confidential data in the hands of the Government is wrong.  The Government is frequently involved in commercially sensitive matters, and the leaking of the information can prejudice the position of the taxpayer.  Leaking of information about issues for consideration at Cabinet can prejudice the position of individual Ministers on the issue by forcing a public reaction on matters that have not yet been fully considered by all relevant Ministers.  It also undermines the principle of Cabinet confidentiality as established under the Constitution.  All are bound to abide by constitutional provisions, unless and until they are changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For these reasons I have taken a <Col N="91" /> serious view of the leaking of confidential Government information from the outset.  I have always understood that there is no complete solution to this issue, and that it is a problem that affects all Governments in democracies. It is inherently difficult to trace the source of leaks, particularly in regard to information that is conveyed orally rather than in writing.  That, however, is not an argument for not instituting such investigations as are possible.  In two instances which are already on the public record, the Government has been able to identify the source of the premature disclosure of information and responsibility has been accepted by the parties concerned.  This is a significant and valuable development, and has few precedents in the life of previous Governments.</P>
    <P>In relation to the investigations which were instigated at my request, I have now received the report of the Secretary of the Department of Finance on the investigation into the leaking of budget material.  The report does not identify any sources of leaks other than the two sources to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>I had asked that a critical part of the investigation should be the recommendation of mechanisms designed to avoid the recurrence of incidents of the kind we had experienced.  The report contains a number of recommendations in this regard.  These are under consideration and an announcement on the action which it is proposed to take in relation to them will be made in due course.</P>
    <P>The other investigations instigated at my request were conducted by the Government secretariat and concerned incidents of premature disclosure of matters which were under consideration by the Government.  None of these investigations revealed the sources of the leaks.</P>

      <P>As regards the inquiry which the Government and the Secretary of the Department of Finance <Col N="92" /> held into the leak of the report on the third banking force prepared by Fry, Rothschild and Stokes Kennedy Crowley and about which I was interviewed by senior gardaí, how many other Ministers were interviewed?</P>

      <P>The question asks about the results of recent investigations. When the gardaí arrived at my office they did not say there was a distinction between whether it was the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance. That is not a fair interpretation of the question.  If the Leader of the Opposition is to be questioned at length about a report he might or might not have had &mdash; in this case I had it but did not leak it, as the Taoiseach knows from the results of the investigation which I am sure he has seen &mdash; it is fair that members of the Government who also had the report should be investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>As soon as it became apparent to me that the difficulties in relation to postal deliveries were not being rectified quickly enough I emphasised to the chairman and the chief executive of An Post the priority I attached to improving the delivery times of mail, particularly to business customers in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>Since then An Post has concluded an agreement with the Communications Workers Union on the introduction of operational changes to improve the quality of service.  The changes provide for an overall improvement in the next day delivery service, revised weekend arrangements to reduce delays in deliveries on Mondays when mail volumes increase and the introduction of part-time delivery staff for business areas to achieve earlier delivery times.  Implementation of the changes has already commenced and will extend to all areas involved over the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>I am assured by the chairman and the chief executive that these changes will quickly bring about the necessary improvements in the quality of delivery services and help to restore public confidence in An Post.  I have requested officials in my Department to clearly monitor the position in the coming weeks to ensure that these unacceptable delays are eliminated through the strategy adopted by An Post.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for admitting that the situation in An Post is unsatisfactory.  He has included An Post in his criticism of semi-State companies such as Aer Lingus, etc. However, that is a debate for another day.  Is he aware that the delivery service in Dublin is the subject of widespread criticism, that approximately 50 per cent of post in Dublin is not delivered before 10 a.m. and that it can take three or four days for correspondence to be received from Northern Ireland? Recently a letter containing a large <Col N="98" /> cheque for a UK supplier which was posted in Santry ended up in Dublin 15 days later.  I have dozens of other examples.  Will the Minister confirm that his policy for An Post is in shreds and that firm action needs to be taken with the board of the company?  As is his wont, perhaps he should call in the chairman and issue a few threats in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 46, 49 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>On 21 February last I informed the House of my serious concern about TEAM where, despite implementation of the Labour Court recommendations, the targets under the restructuring programme were not being met.  If the situation had been allowed to continue unchecked, the company would have had no future.</P>
      <P>In a more immediate sense, I was concerned, in particular, about the impact the situation in TEAM might have on the European Commission's decision in relation to the critical third tranche of £50 million in equity which is due for payment to Aer Lingus later this year.</P>
      <P>The commission sought a report from the Government by 30 June next on the progress of the restructuring programme at TEAM and on proposals for resolving the current difficulties in the longer term.  In the light of my analysis, I had requested the executive chairman of Aer Lingus to furnish me with a five-year business plan for Team Aer Lingus which would provide a basis for returning the company to commercial viability, in the context of current market conditions.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, I received a letter from the European Transport Commissioner, Neil Kinnock, in which he indicated that he shared my concern and that the continuing losses at TEAM Aer Lingus were particularly worrying.  He cautioned that if decisive action was not taken very quickly the Commission might find it difficult to take a positive decision on the final equity tranche.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The executive chairman of Aer Lingus has recently complied with my request for a five-year business plan. This plan was prepared in collaboration with expert business and aerospace industry consultants.  I have had a thorough assessment of that plan carried out, which has involved both my Department and the Department of Finance.  This assessment concludes that the measures proposed have been formulated in a manner which takes account of the market realities, where <Col N="101" /> overcapacity and resultant low rates are expected to continue into the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that in the absence of an agreed corrective plan projected TEAM losses would amount to more than £9 million in 1995, £11 million in 1996 and £13 million in 1997. In other words, over the next five years losses would amount to an unsustainable £60 million without a corrective strategy.  It must also be remembered that Aer Lingus has already injected approximately £100 million into TEAM. The plan provides a means of returning TEAM to profitability on a phased basis.  It does so by achieving further reductions in the cost base; mounting an aggressive, carefully co-ordinated marketing and product development programme; and restructuring TEAM's finances.</P>
    <P>Specifically, the TEAM plan provides for a cost reduction programme, yielding at least a permanent £8 million annually, affecting all areas of the business including: payroll, overheads and materials.</P>
    <P>The plan calls for a reduction in the workforce to approximately 1,500.  This reduction in staffing, amounting to approximately 200, will be effected at all levels from management to shop floor. The plan also provides for financial stability for TEAM during the early stages of the plan when TEAM's earnings are not sufficient to meet its costs. This will be done by way of interest-free loans to TEAM from the Aer Lingus Group, which will be conditional on TEAM achieving the targets set out in the plan.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the plan will require major adjustment and extraordinary effort.  It must be clearly understood, however, that this is an integrated strategy which must be implemented to protect the future of TEAM and the entire Aer Lingus Group generally.</P>
    <P>The plan provides for achieving profitability on a phased basis within this timeframe.  I stress that this is a business plan, not a cost reduction plan.  In short, <Col N="102" /> it offers a future to the workforce of TEAM, provided all the measures are implemented in a committed manner.  I have, accordingly, asked the executive chairman to proceed immediately with implementation of the plan.</P>
    <P>As I have said on a number of occasions in the past, it is not appropriate to publish the details of the plan, as it contains commercially sensitive information. Given the gravity of the situation in TEAM and its potential impact on the Aer Lingus Group, it is vital that implementation moves ahead with all speed.  As I speak, the company has already commenced the process of communicating with staff.</P>
    <P>In summary, on taking up office I identified a serious problem in TEAM Aer Lingus and took decisive action.  On my initiative, for the first time a total business plan has been developed for TEAM Aer Lingus.  The plan demands technical excellence at competitive prices, which will require state of the art work practices.  It contains aggressive targets and is realistic in that it takes account of continuing market difficulties.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the best advice available to me, this plan can be achieved.  It is therefore the first plan that realistically offers TEAM the prospect of viability and thereby offers a future for, and saves the jobs of, 1,500 people.</P>
    <P>The only chance for TEAM's future is the full implementation of the plan and it is only on that basis that the Government can make a positive report to the European Commission in June.</P>

      <P>The length of the Minister's response was unprecedented. I share his concern for the company.  He will have my support in practical measures.  Does the Minister really think he has been decisive on this issue when the matter is getting worse?  He is five months in office and if he had been decisive surely the position would be getting better, not worse.  Will the Minister ensure that the £50 million is made available without unnecessary strings attached in regard to Aer Lingus <Col N="103" /> routes?  I have heard disturbing reports that route conditions will be attached to that £50 million.  I again urge the Minister to publish the plan for TEAM.  He has refused to publish the plan for Telecom and he will not publish the plans for CIE.  Is the Minister telling the House he wants £8 million per year taken out of Aer Lingus and that he will get cuts of £8 million per year by taking 200 people out of the company entirely? That is what I understood the Minister to tell the House.  He said he would reduce the workforce by no more than 200.  I have heard disturbing reports that the 200 people he plans to let go from Aer Lingus have been offered consultancy assignments with the company after they get their redundancy money. Is the Minister satisfied that this is the case?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 17 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>The changes at top management level in CIE must be seen in the context of the Government's overall policy in relation to the semi-State sector.  The quality and cost of services provided by the commercial semi-State bodies is a major factor in determining the competitiveness of Irish industry and services and, consequently, the health of our economy.</P>
      <P>In that context, the Government accepted proposals made by me for restructuring the top management of CIE in the context of managing policies for necessary change and major new investment in public transport in the coming years.</P>
      <P>On 24 April 1995, I announced the appointment of a new full-time executive chairman of CIE.</P>
      <P>I requested the former chairman's resignation to facilitate the change in the role of the CIE chairman which the Government had decided as a matter of policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>He agreed to step aside as chairman to facilitate the Government's wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of severance terms does not arise in these circumstances.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation, and that of the Government for the former chairman's co-operation in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no reason the circumstances I outlined should cause anyone to feel concern about acceptance of positions <Col N="107" /> on State boards and I am not aware that any such concern has been expressed.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated publicly that the mandate of the new chairman will be to ensure that CIE's customers and the taxpayer obtain the maximum return on new investment in public transport.  The achievement of this objective requires a multi-skilled, top quality management team in the CIE Group.  I have taken the necessary action to ensure that this need will be met.  In particular, I have requested the new executive chairman to strengthen the existing CIE management team by recruiting necessary new skills in the areas of project management, marketing and sales, financial and treasury management and human resources.</P>

      <P>The generation and maintenance of a substantial increase in permanent sustainable employment is at the heart of this Government's economic policy. There is a wide range of difficult and complex problems to be tackled right across the commercial semi-State sector and decisive action must be taken in addressing these problems.  I fully recognise the vital contribution that sector has made and will continue to make towards facilitating the growth and development of the economy.  It is my intention to ensure that all the necessary measures are taken so that we will have a strong, vibrant and competitive commercial semi-State sector which can meet and manage the growing challenge of competition at national and international level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="108" /> In the case of CIE, the provision by the Government of very substantial financial resources in terms of Exchequer and European Union funding, which will amount to approximately £1 billion in the next five years, is the clearest possible demonstration of our commitment to a strong transport system.</P>

      <P>If the Minister chooses to fill the time with long irrelevant replies, that is an abuse of the procedures of the House.</P>
      <P>In his discussions with Mr. O'Leary, did the Minister make any criticisms of decisions he had made as chairman, or allege any impropriety on Mr. O'Leary's part?  Did he make any allegations to the outgoing chairman regarding the making of decisions where there may have been a vested interest?  It is surprising, in view of time constraints, that the Minister did not answer the question put to him rather than giving a long answer about other matters, which may be interesting but is not relevant to the question.  A precedent is being established in the action the Government has taken and if the reasons are as the Minister says, no State chairman can feel secure in his position and that will affect their confidence in undertaking the tasks thrust upon them by the State in asking them to act as chairman in the first place.</P>

      <P>In response to the question put to me by Deputy Molloy, the position relating to the previous chairman of the CIE group is clear and straightforward.  Following the Government's approval of my proposals for change in the top management structure of CIE, I asked the then chairman to meet me in my office on 25 April 1995. I explained to him that in the context of managing policies for necessary change in public transport the Government had agreed to my proposals to restructure top management in CIE, including the appointment of a new full-time executive chairman of the group.  I then asked the chairman to facilitate the Government's wishes by resigning from his existing part-time post of chairman of CIE Group and the three subsidiary companies, Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann.  I explained that the change in the chairman's role from part-time to a new full-time executive chairman was being made in the context of the reorganisation of CIE.  I emphasised that the Government's decision did not reflect in any way on the chairman's fitness for office or conduct within office.</P>

      <P>This is a very serious situation in regard to industrial relations.  No third party can solve the dispute between the two parties, only they can do that.  The State's industrial relations machinery can seek to help them, but only if there is a will to make progress.  They each met the Labour Relations Commission &mdash; separately &mdash; this morning and we had hoped that the intervention could have assisted face to face discussions to commence.  The two sides were well aware of the grave and imminent danger to the continuance of this plant if there was a breakdown in the process begun today under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission. Good sense and flexibility was required on all sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regrettably, no basis could be found in today's discussions that would enable negotiations to commence.  To enable discussions to take place on the issues in dispute I had asked the unions in particular to rescind or, at any rate, delay the implementation of their threat to withdraw the 41 hour working week agreed last January and the threat of industrial action pending talks.  Deputies will recall that it was only as a result of ministerial intervention that the company agreed to a third ballot of the <Col N="111" /> workforce in January which saved the plant from closure.  The fourth ballot last week reversing the decision of January is, as the unions are aware, a major obstacle to talks now.  That is the reason I continue to appeal for flexibility from them as a matter of urgency.  In turn, I continue to appeal to the company to show flexibility on the issues of concern to the workers.</P>
    <P>The main issues represented to me and to the company are: the position of the 42 workers laid off last year; the steps to be taken to achieve competitiveness and, as a result of achieving that competitiveness, the scope for a return to full capacity operation following the proposed lay-off of 400 workers.  Only the two parties can address these issues. I appeal to them to do so now in an open and co-operative spirit.  If they do not I fear for the future of this plant.</P>
    <P>I understand that discussions held this morning at the Labour Relations Commission did not lead to the opening of discussions between the two sides.  I have no grounds for believing that either side is in a position to alter their stance at present.  In these circumstances the Labour Relations Commission has been unable to find a basis for any form of conciliation between the parties.  The Labour Relations Commission will remain available to them but in the present situation there are few grounds for hope.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am sure the Minister is aware, a document was issued today by the managing director of Packard, Mr. David Schramm, to the employees.  This document makes it clear that the arrangement arrived at last December-January envisaged the lay-off of 400 workers.  That is stated on page 1.  As that document was signed by Mr. Schramm one assumes it is correct. Why were we and the workers, who agreed in good faith to work an extra two hours per week free on the basis <Col N="112" /> that the level of lay offs, to use the Minister's words, would be minimal, misled as a result of political mismanagement?</P>
      <P>It is clear from this document &mdash; perhaps the Minister will tell me that it is incorrect &mdash; that it was envisaged that there would be 400 lay-offs.  This is written in black and white.  In order to restore trust and confidence and it is necessary to do so &mdash; it would be helpful if the Minister and Minister of State clarified the arrangements which were worked out at that time.  On their return from their mission they told us that agreement had been reached.  Does the Minister accept that it is political mismanagement which has led to deep seated mistrust between workers and management on this serious issue?</P>

      <P>It was made crystal clear at all times to everyone concerned that lay-offs were envisaged and that the loss of the J2900 Vectra contract implied that crucial business which the company needed to secure its future had been lost.  When we travelled to Coventry a commitment was secured that the company would make every endeavour to secure as much of that contract as it could, although it had already been lost, and to secure extra business.  The purpose of those commitments was to seek to keep the proposed number of lay-offs to a minimum.  Everyone knew that there would be some lay-offs.  I expressed the view, as reported by Jackie Gallagher, the former industrial correspondent of <i>The Irish Times</i>, that if the company was successful in winning contracts the level of lay-offs in the second half of this year could be minimal and temporary.  The point was that the contract had been lost and the task was to try to win it back.  I am disappointed at the scale&mdash;&mdash;</P>

These lay-offs will be made against a background where the company has stated that it has made significant progress in reducing its costs, expresses the hope that it can bring back business and that the lay-offs will only be temporary.</P>

      <P>The present impasse has been created by intransigence on both sides in this issue.  I repeat my appeal to both sides to enter into meaningful discussions.  I have had discussions with the trade unions and the management side.  As of now, the trade unions are returning to their members. I had hoped that they would be able to arrange a postponement but under their rules they must return to their members. It is now up to the members to decide whether they can suspend the action to allow discussions to take place.  It is also up to the company to enter into negotiations in an open way to deal with the breakdown of trust between the workforce and management.  I repeat my appeal to both sides to take the opportunities which exist.  The Labour Relations Commission stands ready to assist.  I hope that both sides will avail of the opportunity to do so.</P>

      <P>The future of Packard is very bleak for a number of reasons. Does the Minister agree that the third ballot in January was successful only because assurances were given by him <Col N="114" /> and the Minister of State?  Was he told there could be up to 400 redundancies or is the management now telling a lie? Is management wrong in saying that it agreed in January there would be 400 redundancies this summer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make it absolutely clear that the agreement we reached did not specify a scale of redundancies. It was all contingent on the efforts of the company in securing the competitiveness of the plant and business. A critical ingredient in securing the competitiveness of the plant was the agreement agreed in January between the workforce and management.  The company did not succeed in winning back sufficient business to keep the level of lay-offs low.  Instead it proposes to make 400 temporary lay-offs.  These figures were not available to us in January and could not have been available to us because it was all contingent on what could be achieved in the intervening period.</P>
      <P>They were the facts as I stated them on every occasion I was asked.  We were creating an opportunity to secure the future of this plant, recognising at all times that when the votes were lost in December the critical J2900 contract had been lost and assigned to other plants within the group.  That is the way GM does its business.  There is internal competition between plants which have to be competitive in making bids for new projects.  Unfortunately, the company missed the boat on a critical contract. The best endeavour was then made to try to retrieve some of the contract and to win other business.  Unfortunately, the company has not retrieved sufficient of that contract or created sufficient new business to deliver a lower level of lay-offs but it continues to remain committed to seeking, and is actively pursuing, other business.</P>

      <P>There is no question of people telling lies.  The situation was crystal clear when we negotiated and met with management.  It had a problem; it had lost a critical contract but it also had two opportunities' to restore the competitiveness of the plant and to bid for new business.  They committed themselves to working towards both of those objectives but it has transpired that they have not secured sufficient business to maintain the workforce and they are proposing 400 lay-offs.  At all times lay-offs were envisaged.  That was set down in black and white, but no figures were mentioned in the discussions with management.  It was a question of endeavouring to win business.  That is the way business is done.  You do not forecast employment levels six, eight or ten months ahead, and it is misleading to suggest that is the case.</P>

      <P>It is easy for a manufacturing industry such as Packard Electric to cost-in the effect of the loss of a contract. Bearing in mind the existing business committed to the factory from other sources, the plant would have been well able to forecast that by June they would have to lay off 400 workers. This figure may well have been mentioned privately in the negotiations involving the Ministers but it was not made public.  If it was, and if that was taken into consideration by management and negotiators, there would have been a totally different scenario.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are the Minister and Minister of State aware of the total devastation that will be caused to the greater Tallaght area by the temporary lay-off of 400 workers, bearing in mind &mdash; the Minister of State is especially aware of this &mdash; that 42 workers in the Tallaght area have been laid off for 18 months?  That is a serious matter of contention between management and trade unions. Is the Minister aware that community leaders in Tallaght are calling on the Government to make urgent efforts to locate a major industry in Tallaght to allow for the 400 lay-offs which, due to <Col N="116" /> the activities in the company and management's approach, many of us fear will be permanent?  I do not want that to happen, nor do the community leaders in Tallaght, the trade union leaders and the workers.  Bearing in mind the catastrophic consequences of these lay-offs, what efforts are being made by the Government to locate a major industry in the Tallaght area?</P>

      <P>The issue of the 42 workers is central to the negotiations. There is clearly a lack of trust on the part of the workers which is founded on the way the 42 workers have been treated in the past 12 months.  That is an issue that must be resolved if we are to find a way out of this problem.  Bearing in mind the devastation the Deputy rightly points to in the Tallaght area from a closure of this scale both sides must take serious account of their actions.  They must avoid intransigence in their position, avail of the opportunities to negotiate and suspend action to make room for talks.  Tallaght will remain a high priority on our list for creating employment and that will be the case regardless of whether this plant runs into difficulties.  My principal concern today is not with finding an alternative industry but trying to secure the future of more than 800 jobs in this plant.</P>

The facts that have emerged today show political mismanagement of this crisis as <Col N="117" /> it developed last September and January. I do not doubt the loss of confidence on the part of the workers can be clearly laid at political mismanagement as well as mismanagement of the plant across the water.  Even though there is great unease, tension and anxiety about this matter, I would ask all concerned to give the plant one last chance of survival for the sake of the 800 jobs which are vital to the area.</P>

      <P>This is no time for cheap party political games plying. There has been absolutely no party political mismanagement in this issue and the workers know that, I have spared no effort in trying to deal with this problem. We engaged in discussions at home and abroad at the highest levels in the company, with unions, through the IDA, ICTU, IBEC, the Labour Relations Commission, the Labour Court, European management and further afield, and we have spared no effort in trying to bring about circumstances in which this issue could be resolved.  The Deputy misunderstands the position of the 42 workers.  It is not suggested that they should be brought back to the plant.  There are other remedies to deal with that problem that would perhaps be satisfactory.</P>
      <P>There must be trust in management so that people realise they are serious that these are temporary lay-offs.  They must demonstrate in a tangible way what they will do to make the plant more competitive.  They must show how they will re-engineer the plant and win back business.  They must demonstrate their good faith, particularly to the 42 workers who have been laid off.  That will prove to those who are being asked to accept temporary lay-offs that management is dedicated to providing a future for their staff.  We must not use the time of one minute to midnight in political point scoring but must try to secure a future for this plant.  I appeal to both sides to avail of the remaining time to draw back from intransigent positions and deal with the issues in open negotiations.</P>

      <P>Since the Minister lays so much emphasis on the need to restore competitiveness to this plant, does he agree it is crazy that £5.5 million is taken out of the gross payroll bill of £15.5 million for that plant?  It is uncompetitive because the Minister confiscates 35 per cent of gross employment costs every year in levies and taxes.  The crucial lesson to be learned from this is that employment-intensive industries cannot survive as long as there is an anti-work tax system, which is destroying the Packard Electric plant in Tallaght.  Would the Minister agree that if this plant was located in Newry it would be between £750,000 and £1 million more profitable than it is in Tallaght, solely because of taxes and levies?</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment.  The Minister and I are clear as to why that provision has been included in the Bill.  We are clear on the specific circumstances which have given rise to this amendment.  It will mean the Revenue Commissioners will not have to create more bureaucracy in reinterpreting how and to whom this measure will apply.  Some indication should be given to the Revenue Commissioners regarding cases involving a second relationship which is obviously permanent, involves children, a family home and mortgage repayments.  There is no need for further investigation or discussion by the Revenue Commissioners of such cases.  Such guidelines and facts should be made clear to them, that is the intent of this section.  As the Minister is aware, since 6 April such people are covered under the new tax regime. As that is a matter of severe difficulty and hardship I ask that we move with some speed on this issue.  I commend the Minister for tabling his amendment, a helpful, compassionate and correct move on his part.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled amendment No. 19 the effect of which would be to return to the position that existed prior to the Government's decision to change the legislation on covenants.  We had a <Col N="165" /> good discussion on this issue on Committee Stage.  The net point of my arguments could be summed up by saying that while the Government was entitled to decide that the fees element of third level education should be paid by the State and taxpayers, it was unfair to change the legislation governing all covenants.  The legislation should only have been changed in so far as it applied to education.  That measure was sold on the basis that the effect of the change in covenants for educational purposes would cover the bulk of the cost of the Government's decision to abolish third level fees.  The Minister's amendment No. 20 goes some way towards alleviating some of the hardship on one specific group.  The Minister should have accepted my amendment or tabled one to take account of what I have said.</P>
      <P>After the Bill is passed those who care for aged parents will be unable to avail of covenants.  We discussed on Committee Stage the definition of permanent incapacity.  I thought the Minister would have tabled an amendment on Report Stage to more or less guarantee that the incapacity of those over 65 would be regarded as being permanent and that the cut would apply.  It is not fair to leave the issue up in the air.  If we do that many middle income people who covenant moneys to keep their aged fathers or mothers in somewhat reasonable lifestyle will be affected.  On Committee Stage I said that the State should not interfere in that area as the use of covenants by such people served a useful purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is considerable merit in the suggestion put forward by Deputy McDowell, that as the Minister, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners have been determined for many years to abolish covenants, there should be a ceiling of £300,000.  I pointed out on Committee Stage that it did not appear fair that a person earning £200,000 could covenant £10,000, 5 per cent of their income, to a parent while a person earning £30,000 who might want to covenant money to their parents would not be able to do so <Col N="166" /> and would not be entitled to relief on that money.  Tax relief on covenants would mean a great deal to a person on the lower income while it would not mean the same to those on the higher one.</P>
    <P>The changes which the relevant section brings into effect go in the wrong direction.  It was justifiable to change the legislation on covenants relating to education, and that was the basis on which this measure was sold, but the Minister has taken a sledgehammer to change the basis of it.  I am mindful that I have one opportunity to speak on these amendments.  I welcome the Minister's amendment for the reasons given by my colleague, Deputy Cullen.  We had a long discussion on this matter on Committee Stage.  Separated couples will be affected by this provision and Deputy Cullen instanced a particular case in his constituency.  My understanding of the amendment is that the Revenue Commissioners must be satisfied that application of the changes would cause hardship and then this would not apply until 6 April 1998.  Will the Minister clarify if that is the net effect of the amendment?</P>

      <P>While I have some idea why 6 April 1998 is the date specified, I am sure future Minister would be able to reconsider the matter if the decision of the people in the divorce referendum is not what the Minister and I wish for.  In framing a watertight section, there is always a danger of making it so watertight that nobody could avail of its provisions.  Not only must the Revenue Commissioners be satisfied that the changes effected by subsections (1) and (2) would give rise to hardship &mdash; I am sure they will publish guidelines in this regard &mdash; but they must have been notified of the disposition before 8 February <Col N="167" /> 1995.  Therefore, to qualify a person would have to have made a covenant and claimed for it prior to 8 February 1995 and it must be in respect of a disposition of income made on or after 6 April 1993.  The Minister's amendment is so watertight that people may not be able to avail of the measure.  Having satisfied all the requirments, the Revenue Commissioners must be satisfied that the changes would give rise to hardship. While I welcome the amendment, I disagree with changing the position in regard to covenanting and if, before next year's budget, it is evident that the application of this section creates enormous difficulties, I hope the Minister will reconsider the matter.  I do not believe we have heard the last of the changes in this regard.  Application of these provisions and the elimination of covenanting will give rise to problems none of us anticipated.</P>

Would such cases be covered under these measures or must people have a mortgage?  The covenant was the only form of compensation that could be offered to such people when penalised to the tune of £80 per week for going straight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to education covenants, is anything being done for the limited number of students who, prior to the <Col N="168" /> decision of the Minister for Education, benefited from covenating and the higher education grant scheme but who are now in limbo.  All Hallows college, with approximately 100 students, and the Mater Dei college, with approximately 200 students, on the fringe of my constituency benefit from the higher education grant scheme, but because of an ideological hang-up, the Minister for Education excluded certain colleges and courses from the free fees scheme.  She excluded what she saw as philosophical-theological type courses.  While many will benefit under the scheme, why are a few hundred students being eliminated because of a personal hang-up of the Minister's colleague?  A few students have been hung out to dry and, while the Minister's amendment would not apply to them, can they plead hardship under any scheme?  Perhaps talks are ongoing in regard to including them. Having included thousands of students under the free fees scheme, I fail to understand why the Minister for Education sacrificed 500 or 600.  I accept the Minister proposes to introduce a tax free allowance provision for private colleges next year, but there is a distinction between private colleges and private commercial colleges.  All Hallows and the Mater Dei colleges have a religious background and are non profit-making organisations.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for the compliments they paid to me and my colleagues.  I listened carefully to the points made and considered the measures proposed in amendment No. 19 tabled by Deputy McCreevy but I can only do so much to address cases of genuine hardship.  People who have made arrangements for themselves as responsible as possible and would remarry if they were free to do so, would qualify under the normal structure of tax allowances.  A particular case was made in that regard and we have tried to address it in the best possible manner.</P>
      <P>To answer the specific questions, Deputy McCreevy was correct in his interpretation that Revenue will operate a hardship position which will first take into account the tenor of the debate that has been articulated here.  It will be exercised &mdash; and we will confirm this if necessary &mdash; with the degree of discretion required and it will be consistent. Deputy Cullen was concerned that there might be a lack of consistency in relation to treatment.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they would certainly <Col N="170" /> qualify for the income tax relief in relation to fees because they are private <i>pro bono</i> institutions.  They are not commercial colleges in that sense.  However, I will get advice on this matter and I will get back to the Deputy in relation to the effect of this next year.  Some categories of students currently benefiting from covenants will not continue to benefit, for example, students on post-graduate courses.  It is not possible to apply the scheme to everybody but we are making a serious change to the whole structure of the covenant scheme this year because it was necessary to so do.  The ballooning in terms of income forfeited and so on was a matter of concern.  We will carefully monitor how this will work during the year and I will be open to making whatever sensible adjustments are required.  In the nature of this business, nobody is endowed with wonderful wisdom that enables them to foresee everything in advance.  It is probable that some problems will arise but I hope to be able to address them as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>In regard to the date, Deputy Cullen anticipated the answer fairly accurately in that we hope to have a different legal and statutory regime in place by 1998. If not, it will then be up to the Minister for Finance of the day to decide what to do.</P>

      <P>I will withdraw my amendment.  I accept what the Minister says subject to this caveat generally.  The circumstances of which Deputy Cullen and myself were aware and drew to the Minister's attention in correspondence exist for other people also.  If there is not a particular response to the divorce referendum that all of us in this House apparently want in one degree or another, we will have to broaden this measure to include more people in that situation.  It is all very well to deal with the person of whom you are aware but I am sure many people are being hammered by the tax system and prevented from doing their duty by their children and their partner.</P>

    <P>This amendment concerns the BES for horticulture.  I was persuaded by the merits of the arguments on Committee Stage and I do not intend to go through it in great detail.  I will do so if the House wishes me to do so in my reply but I am conscious of the time factor on all sides.  We have confined the amendment to a number of categories, essentially greenhouse and greenhouse related rather than traditional farming of a kind that could get additional support. This is being done in the spirit of <Col N="175" /> the request made by the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Agriculture.</P>

I thank him for accepting the arguments put forward from this side of the House.  On foot of a development plan involving certain guidelines to be enunciated by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, horticultural development can qualify for BES funding.  This is proof that we can do good work on Committee Stage.</P>

I know there are criteria set down in the form of a three-year development plan which is export oriented or import substitution oriented.

In the time allotted, we were not able to go into great detail on this matter but it is my intention to work closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  If the Deputies become aware of problems I ask them to let us know.</P>

      <P>In page 38, to delete line 33, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(ii)  £15,000:</P>
      <P>Provided that this subsection shall not apply to an individual who makes a subscription for eligible shares in a qualifying company which carries on or intends to carry on such qualifying trading operations as are referred to in subparagraph (iib)  (inserted by the Finance Act, 1995) of paragraph (a) of subsection (2)  of section 16.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to the proposals in section 17 to extend the seed capital scheme to individuals who establish a company to carry on trading operations on an exchange facility located in the Customs House Docks Area.  Currently, FINEX, the financial division of the New York cotton exchange, is the only exchange facility established in the area and is not grant aided.  To qualify for the seed capital scheme an individual's non-employment income in each of the three tax years immediately preceding the year in which the individual sets up his or her new business must not <Col N="177" /> exceed the lesser of (i)  the individual's employment income, or (ii)  £15,000.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the Finance Bill it has been brought to my attention by the FINEX authorities that this requirement represents a serious obstacle to attract into the exchange, through the vehicle of the seed capital scheme, individuals suitably qualified and motivated to trade on FINEX.  IDA Ireland, who are involved in promoting the exchange facility in the Custom House Docks Area, have indicated to me that they are sympathetic to the case for altering the income limit rules. Accordingly, this amendment proposes to remove the income limit requirements in the seed capital scheme in the case of individuals who propose to trade on an exchange facility set up in the Custom House Docks Area and in that case only.</P>

      <P>The Minister has explained the purpose of amendment No. 23 which makes the seed capital scheme more attractive.  I welcome any improvements because, as the Minister and others have pointed out, although the idea of the seed capital scheme is excellent, the constraints built into the scheme meant that very few could avail of it.

I suggested that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment in consultation with the Revenue Commissioners should be responsible for decisions.  I note the Minister has come forward with amendments to insert &ldquo;following consultation with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment&rdquo; and in this era of openness, transparency and accountability it takes the spotlight off the Minister making a decision.

      <P>Amendment No. 36 is in the name of the Minister. Amendments Nos. 37, 38 and 39 <Col N="183" /> form a composite proposal and amendments Nos. 36, 40 and 41 are consequential on this proposal.  It is suggested therefore that amendments Nos. 36 to 41, inclusive, be taken together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 36:</P>
      <P>In page 64, to delete line 33.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to provide tax incentives for the construction or refurbishment of certain multi-storey car parks.  I gave formal notice on Committee Stage of my intention to bring in this amendment.  I apologise for the lateness of its circulation but I hope the House will bear with me.</P>
      <P>Multi-storey car parks already qualify for certain tax incentives where they are situated in designated areas under the 1994 urban renewal scheme.  The incentives consist of capital allowances of 50 per cent which, in the case of owner operators, may be taken in full in one year and in the case of lessors may be taken at the rate of 25 per cent in year one with annual allowances of 2 per cent on the balance of the 50 per cent.  Lessees of multi-storey car parks in respect of which capital allowances have been claimed are also entitled to a double rent allowance for rent paid on the lease of the car park.  It is now proposed that these allowances will be generally available in the case of multi-storey car parks in respect of which the relevant local authority gives a certificate in writing to the person providing the multi-storey car park stating that it is satisfied that the car park has been developed in accordance with criteria laid down by the Minister for the Environment following consultations with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of expenditure on the refurbishment of a multi-storey car park, capital allowances will be available only if the amount expended on the refurbishment equals at least 20 per cent <Col N="184" /> of the site exclusive market value of the car park immediately before the refurbishment.  The new scheme will run for a three year period starting 1 July this year.  Our rationale in bringing forward these amendments is to reinforce town centres.  Increasingly the shopping trend is to locate in peripheral areas where readily available car parking facilities facilitate shopping for a range of goods.  All urban renewal policies are aimed at regenerating the core of our cities and towns.  Strong shopping precincts are central to this policy.  We are not alone in this.  In Scotland the Glasgow Development Agency decided to grant-aid multi-storey car parks as part of its regeneration policy while in Paisley where the major supermarket chains have located in the suburbs, the local authorities also subsidise car parks.</P>
    <P>Deputies will say one gets these benefits in the designated areas.  The value of the land inside the designated area for retail activity is driving up the price in primary cost terms so there is not an economic return from a car park inside a designated area.  What we are trying to do is give value to land adjacent to but outside of the zone of a designated area so that one can park a car adjacent to an area which has been refurbished. This came to my attention through my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, and I am happy to propose it.</P>
    <P>In the first instance all car parks will need planning permission so the local authority will determine whether it wants a car park.  Criteria will be set down by the Minister for the Environment the central function of which will be to reinforce existing shopping centres in built up urban areas to offset the out of town shopping precinct which is a growing problem in some parts of the country and a major problem in the UK. It undermines the rateable valuation base of a town among other things.  That is the reason for the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it this is a new plan.  What say will local authorities have over car parking charges?  People may be exploited.  Will there be any <Col N="185" /> guidelines on this?  I do not think these charges are price controlled.  The package is an attractive one.  I appreciate that planning permission must be sought and I welcome that as it means car parks must be built according to specified criteria. I endorse the proposal and hope the public will not be overcharged.  If I understand the section correctly car parks will get a tax write-off.  Will they be allowed to write off 90 per cent of the capital allowances?</P>

      <P>It is still extremely attractive but I would not like to see signs erected to the effect that car parking charges have been increased from £2 an hour to £3 an hour.  It would be another burden hard-pressed taxpayers would have to bear.  That aspect must be looked at.  However, I welcome the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this provision. The definition of a multi-storey car park is one with three or more levels.  In <Col N="186" /> Waterford we regenerated the city centre and now have a successful development. However, we had a terrible car parking problem which we could not solve.  The corporation would not allow a company to erect a number of car parking levels so it built into the river and created space at ground level.  It was adjacent to the designated area where the new development had occurred. However, it would not qualify under the section but the validity of the development is equal to what is defined in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Inner city ports are disappearing but as the Minister knows we have a superb port down river and the possibility exists for further expansion.  The harbour commissioners own some of the land and we are negotiating with them. There is tremendous potential for other developments all of which will need car parking facilities.  The only way we can provide it is to extend into the river.  I do not mean we are turning the river into a car park.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>We are looking for further investment.  This should be included as the validity of the investment is equal to having the car park three storeys high.  Due to a scarcity of land some developments have been extended underground.  There was a major debate about the car part in the shopping centre in Waterford where two storeys are below street level and one storey is on street level.  This type of development can be much more expensive than an overground development. Will a car park which has two storeys, below street level quality?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>This brings me back to my first point about the ground space being equivalent to a normal two storey <Col N="187" /> development.  This equally applies in Cork, Limerick and Dublin.  In the case of the Point a car park may extend some distance into the river and it would not interfere with the landscape or the harmonious development of the area.  The existing amenities would be enhanced by such a development.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this provision as this sort of investment is necessary and is just as expensive.  It would be a welcome boost to inner city port areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well disposed to amending this amendment.  My officials are discussing the matter with the Department of the Environment officials to see if two or more storeys would be an acceptable formula.  Subject to getting the green light from the Department of the Environment officials, I will amend the amendment.</P>
      <P>I reply to Deputy Connolly, market forces will effectively ensure that there is no crazy price exploitation.  The facility will be costly to build and it is in the interests of the operator to ensure that he maximises the revenue.  If he charges people a rate which forces people to park on the open streets in and around the car park then it will defeat the purposes of the exercise.  The internal mechanisms of the market forces will deal with this point.</P>
      <P>It is possible for a planning permission granted by a local authority to set or attempt to set charges.  I am not sure how enforceable that is as I suspect a developer could appeal this to An Bord Pleanála with some degree of success. Even if the manager at the behest of the local members tried to fix charges I would be fairly confident in my old trade as a planning consultant or architect, of having it struck down by An Bord Pleanála or removed.</P>

      <P>If this provision is to work it must be done in conjunction with the local authority which will have land and which could take an equity interest in the car park by contributing the land.  If the land represents 20 per cent of the total cost of the project then it could be regarded as equity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This would enable the local authority to have some input in terms of management and it would address some of the potential concerns to which Deputy Connolly referred. Deputy McDowell asked if this could apply to suburban areas such as the ones in our constituency to which he referred.  The answer is yes, if they get planning permission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It relates to any area. These provisions already apply to car parks in designated areas.  Designation has enhanced the value of land in site value terms and the cost of the land may be too expensive to generate a reasonable return from a car park in normal circumstances.  We have highly designated areas, many of which are very successful but which have no place to park cars and no surrounding multi-storey car parks.  There is a narrow line in urban life which is caused by market price distortion and land on the wrong side of the line loses value.  The purpose of this proposal was to allow a person build on that land and service the designated area.  There is a need for off street <Col N="189" /> car parking in the villages to which Deputy McDowell referred but this is constrained by certain issues.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 42:</P>
      <P>In page 75, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="197" />&ldquo;46.&mdash;(1)  In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;marketing costs&rsquo; means any direct costs incurred solely in the promotion of products or services outside the State which are deducted in computing the amount of profits or gains chargeable to tax under Schedule D;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;training costs&rsquo; means any direct costs incurred solely in the provision of training to employees for the maintenance or improvement of job skills and which are deducted in computing the amount of profits or gains chargeable to tax under Schedule D.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where, in the computation of the amount of the profits or gains of a trade or profession, a person is, apart from this section, entitled to any deduction (hereafter in this subsection referred to as &lsquo;the first-mentioned deduction&rsquo;) on account of marketing costs or training costs, he shall be entitled in that computation to a further deduction equal to the amount of the first-mentioned deduction.</P>
    <P>(3)  Any claim under this section shall be made in such form as the Revenue Commissioners may from time to time prescribe.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment which I moved on Committee Stage seeks to give a double deduction in respect of companies who increase their marketing or training.  In regard to marketing costs, there has been considerable emphasis in recent years on Irish companies going abroad. Various schemes introduced by An Bord Tráchtála have been very successful. During the past number of years the Irish economy has been export led.  Our total exports in 1995 will be of the order of IR£20 billion.  If I recall correctly, about £4.6 billion relates to indigenous companies, the balance being from the multinationals.  Enormous effort has been put in by Irish companies.  The Government has spent not only <Col N="198" /> Exchequer funding but mostly European funding in producing the very progressive proposals introduced by An Bord Tráchtála.  I was fortunate to be the Minister responsible for that area for the past two years and it has worked successfully.</P>
    <P>It is doubtful whether in this day and age people will go into a job at 18, 19 or 20 years of age and remain there for the rest of their lives.  There is a constant need for training and retraining.  In the marketing and training area there will be no great loss to the Exchequer in the long term if a tax break encourages companies to spend more of their own money in that area because the long term spin offs to the State will be (a) in increased jobs when the firm does better, resulting in more taxation to the Exchequer and (b) more profits will be made by the company, thus resulting in more corporation tax and income tax to the State.</P>
    <P>It is to encourage companies to invest more money in marketing and training that I suggest a company should get a double tax allowance for expenditure incurred.  I was particularly taken by this idea when I was Minister for Tourism and Trade because, despite the best efforts in the world &mdash; and my views on marketing tourism are well known &mdash; my <i>raison d'être</i> was to get companies involved in tourism to spend their own money because there is a tremendous reliance in that industry on the State doing everything.</P>
    <P>Under the operational programme for tourism, which I introduced last year, considerable funding is available for marketing in the tourism area.  A considerable amount of tourism money could be drawn down if the companies go about spending their own money.  To kick start that area I was taken with the idea of a double marketing allowance.  It is very simple.  If a company, subject to the normal constraints spent, say, £50,000 in the marketing and training area the tax computation which it would prepare for the Revenue Commissioners would be doubled making it £100,000 of a deduction against profits.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="199" /> The take-up in the initial years would not be too heavy a burden on the Exchequer.  It is not a grant, it is merely using the corporation tax rules and the expense rules to double up on the allowance. It would allow companies in the tourism area and in the hotel business to come together and start putting up their own moneys to bring tourists into the country, it would be a further initiative. I suggest we try it for a number of years.  The amendment I put down on Committee Stage, and repeated here, is open-ended and I thought I would be able to convince the Minister that it was a workable idea.  The same arguments apply in regard to the training area.  This is something the Minister should consider as it would be of considerable benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>The point in the amendment is interesting but I am not sure that the difficulties which Irish industries experience are simply related to a lack of expenditure on marketing or for that matter inadequate levels of training. The problems are a good deal more complex and deep than that.  One of the problems which Irish companies have in relation to penetrating international markets &mdash; what Deputy McCreevy has in mind &mdash; is the size of Irish companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> Broadly speaking they are much too small to make an impact internationally. If we are to improve the extent to which we can export we need to be able to put together much bigger companies.  That is particularly true in the case of the food industry.  Irish food companies are much too small to make the type of impact needed and to develop the type of brands which will gain widespread recognition in supermarkets right across Europe and in the developed world.</P>
    <P>While this amendment is interesting it will not necessarily achieve the purpose for which it is designed.  There is already a whole host of marketing agencies: Bord Fáilte, An Bord Bia, Córas Tráchtála and so on which are spending huge sums of money in marketing Irish products and encouraging Irish companies to develop new markets.  In terms of Deputy McCreevy's objective the primary factor is that Irish companies are not big enough to make the necessary impact.  There is a gross deficiency in indigenous companies in respect of any real commitment to research and development and more is the pity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to accept this amendment on cost grounds and on the basis &mdash; as the Deputy will be aware when we spoke about this on Committee Stage &mdash; that a White Paper on training is in preparation in the Department of Enterprise and Employment. The Deputy's comments related more to marketing than to training although there is a connection.  In that context I should say that this year between Bord Fáilte, SFADCo and the Exchequer we will provide funding of some £20 million in tourism promotion expenditure.  An additional sum of £20 million will be available through the operational programme for tourism.  In addition, An Bord Tráchtála will spend £41.6 million on trade marketing promotion, of which £12.5 million will be paid by way of direct grants.  CERT will spend £12.2 million in training this year and FÁS will spend of the order of £10 million in industry based training.  IDA-Forbairt will spend some £10 million on <Col N="201" /> training grants.  The gross sum is substantial. The proposal is premature as I would like to see what the White Paper says in relation to it.  I recognise the validity of the arguments.  I have a budgetary framework within which I can move this year and, quite frankly, I cannot allow any more.</P>

      <P>I take the Minister's point.  I am aware of the figures he has given for funding.  I was responsible for both those areas.  The point made by Deputy Upton is relevant.  The operational programme for tourism &mdash; which I had the pleasure of launching last year &mdash; was part of the billions from the EU. I will not be specific about the figure because we had enough difficulties with it.  Part of that total figure, whether it was £6 billion, £7 billion of £8 billion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the money that will be spent on tourism in the next number of years will come from the EU. Some will be channelled through Bord Fáilte, some through SFADCo and some through CERT.  The same proportion of money spent by the Irish Trade Board in the next few years will come from the EU.  There are peculiar accounting methods which we have discussed in other contexts which I would like to see universally applied.  I have given some ideas to the Minister that people in the Department of Finance might find attractive.  These relate to how the agencies will receive money in an open and transparent manner which is not evident at present because various funds are treated differently.  The moneys we will spend in trade, tourism and training will come largely from the EU with some Exchequer contributions. However, the end of this decade will see the end of the European gravy train.  It is not that there will be no funds from Europe in the next millennium, but they will not be in the same proportion <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Irish economy and our gross national product as in the past.  At that <Col N="202" /> stage Irish companies in business, tourism or training will have to stand on their own.  My experience in tourism and trade has been that many companies in tourism have a mindset that is reliant on the State agencies which, no matter how good they are, will not have money to channel into those areas.  No matter who the Minister for Finance and no matter what shade the Government, they will not be able to supply large amounts of money.  The same applies to the trade and training areas. What we must do in this time span is alert everybody to start looking after themselves.  As Deputy Upton said, Irish companies are not large enough to offer their own direct marketing campaign, but there are EU schemes and funds available to groups of companies who come together.  The purpose of my amendment is to encourage companies to think about standing on their own. We are into the second half of the decade and other events will intervene &mdash; the next election is just around the corner.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCreevy will be familiar with this proposal.  It was brought in on a pilot basis and restricted originally to the West Coast.  Courtown was included following representations.  Then, for the sake of equity it was decided to &ldquo;give one to every county in the audience&rdquo;. On a more serious note, it is a pilot scheme and the take up on it may be insignificant in some areas &mdash; we do not know.  There was much representation in relation to Salthill.  We looked at the proposals but the original Salthill area was far too large and there was a dispute as to whether it qualified as a traditional seaside resort town.  It traditionally had the role, and I was a visitor there on many occasions.  It is now part of the suburb of a university town and much accommodation is taken up by students.</P>
      <P>It was argued that Galway should get a place and that the area we are now proposing in Salthill was one of seven or eight areas identified by the consultant's report.  It comprises the seafront, the leisureland complex owned by the local authority and some other land.  Clonakilty is in West Cork which touches the sea, and that is why it is included.  The Laytown, Mosney and Bettystown area is a traditional seaside resort.  Clogherhead is a traditional but now run down seaside area.  Likewise Enniscrone is off the main road.  It is an area I know and it qualifies in addition to the ones already qualifying.  I have nothing further to add to that except that Arklow was already proposed and the areas are quite tight in relation to Arklow.</P>

      <P>It would be churlish of me, in the absence of Deputy Molloy, not to thank the Minister for making this partial gesture in the Salthill area.  Half a loaf is better than none. When the Deputy moved the amendment on Committee Stage I thought he did so with a passion and a fervour which was not justified bearing in mind the cynical stare he received from the Minister at the time.  It now transpires that those who ask receive.  I am delighted for him and other Deputies, including Deputy McCormack who was of great assistance to him on Committee Stage, that the Minister has made this move to include coastal Salthill in the scheme.</P>
      <P>While it can be said that portions of Salthill &mdash; I attended a meeting there recently &mdash; are now suburbs it is equally true to say that other portions are very much dependent on the hotel business. There are areas of Salthill where hotels are shoulder to shoulder with another. The sad fact is that many premises have effectively been decommissioned as hotels.  While I accept that many students live in the area I hope there are not too many of them in the town during the summer months when this provision will come into its own.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for responding in a generous way to the case made by all the Deputies who represent County Galway, not just west Galway, for the inclusion of Salthill.  Last September or October &mdash; the Minister will correct me if I am wrong &mdash; Deputy McCreevy when Minister for Tourism and Trade suggested in an informal way that there should be such a scheme to complement what was being done in urban areas.  He felt that many of the traditional seaside resorts were dying for want of investment. The three areas mentioned at the time were Salthill.  Bray and Ballybunion. I am delighted that two of them have been included.  I am sure the Minister considered the possibility of including Bray.  Perhaps he will respond to Deputy McCreevy's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="206" /> Salthill was always a traditional location for family holidays; parents always felt that it was safe to bring their children there and they always knew where they were.  Deputy McDowell is correct in saying that the vast majority of premises along the seafront are hotels.  Many premises are no longer being run as hotels because they were owned by families who did not have the money to reinvest in the business or who were not making enough profit during the relatively short tourist season to be able to reinvest a sufficient amount.</P>
    <P>Salthill Development Association submitted an application and made a strong case long before this or previous budgets were presented in the House.  It put a comprehensive package together in the hope that financial support would be made available to the area.</P>
    <P>It has been to the disadvantage of Salthill in recent times that the area designated for urban renewal in Galway city has done extremely well.  When the inner parts of the city which were run down were designated there was a phenomenal take-up.  Visitors to the city can be very proud of the leading role played by the local authority, Galway Corporation, in encouraging developers and those wishing to invest in the city. We can be proud of the fact that we do not have a concrete mass of offices or retail premises.  With Deputy McCormack I was a member of the corporation when it insisted that residential accommodation should form part of each development.  As a result we now have a living city.  Up to then the inner city had been neglected.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the same happen in Salthill.  The Minister will find that the people of Salthill and developers in the Galway area will not be found wanting in responding to this gesture.  Salthill has lost out in terms of business because people were inclined to be drawn to the inner city which now has a pleasing ambience.  This decision to include Salthill will mean that the tremendous <Col N="207" /> work which has been done by the corporation in recent years on the promenade will be complemented by local business people reinvesting in their businesses knowing that they will receive support under this Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his generous response to the points of view expressed by Deputies on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>The Minister is more than familiar with the geography of County Louth.  I wish to make a case for the inclusion of a number of seaside resorts in the northern half of the county &mdash; Clogherhead is on the southern tip.  As the Minister will be aware, Omeath was the mecca for day trippers in the 1950s and 1960s. Unfortunately, this business dried up in the 1970s to the 1990s.  It was mainly people from Northern Ireland who visited locations such as Clogherhead and Omeath on holiday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an over simplification. The economy of Omeath benefited considerably from their presence. They came in droves on a regular basis. Unfortunately, this business has disappeared. As a consequence the business structure is now in decline.  Omeath is a beautiful village at the foot of the Cooley Mountains near Carlingford <Col N="208" /> Lough.  There is a clear need to provide incentives and an innovative scheme would be of enormous benefit to that village.  It would be a pity if it was not included in the scheme.  Its inclusion would be immensely appreciated.</P>
      <P>In making the case for Omeath I am not overlooking the importance of villages such as Carlingford and Blackrock, the home of my constituency colleague, Deputy Ahern.  In their own way they have also been a mecca for day trippers.  Tourism particularly in Carlingford has been developed.  There is a strong community spirit and its achievements are an example to other areas. This shows what can be done when people come together, organise and participate in the tidy towns competition in particular.  Carlingford was the overall winner in 1988.  This provided a stimulus for the development of tourism.  We need to ensure that we maintain the momentum.</P>
      <P>The designation of various towns will provide a dynamic for the development of the tourism industry.  This is urgently needed.  The potential of the tourism sector in County Louth has been hindered because of its geographical location close to the Border and the impact of the troubles in the North in the past 25 years.  The opportunity now exists to provide a dynamic in the locations I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that the Minister has agreed to include Clogherhead in the scheme.  It is an area with immense potential, an area which people visited in the past, I hope the urgently needed developments will be set in train as a result of this decision.  I am disappointed the Minister is shaking his head to indicate it is not possible to consider the other places for designation at this stage.  Perhaps he will elaborate when replying.</P>

Laytown and Bettystown have suffered in the last 20 years from a downturn in the tourism industry, not only because of the difficulties in the North but because of general dilapidation.  This measure will assist these areas and boost tourism, and I express my appreciation to the Minister for including them.</P>

I was lucky enough to persuade the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Enda Kenny, to meet this group and he was very impressed with its submission.  Despite what Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn said, the Galway inner city development helped our case because Deputy Kenny was very impressed with the work done by the people in that area which is also designated.

      <P>I compliment the Minister for making a number of amendments to the scheme announced in the budget.  I particularly welcome the inclusion of Clogherhead, an area that deserves designation.  I am surprised, considering the Minister's roots in my constituency, that he did not see fit to include areas in the north of the constituency such as Omeath.  Despite the fact that I live in a seaside resort I have always said that Omeath is more deserving of designation than any other resort in the constituency because it is situated on the Border.  Deputy Blaney, the longest serving Member of the House, asked in his budget speech why Omeath was excluded, particularly in view of the fact that we have peace.  One of the main reasons Omeath suffered down the years was the violence in the North, which obviously reflected on the economy just south of the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the village of Annagassan on the east coast a very good local group has been successful in putting forward a project for the area.  If that village was included the area would be much more viable.  The village of Blackrock where I <Col N="211" /> live a dormitory town of Dundalk, is a seaside resort.  The swimming pool in the town which is owned by the local authority has lain derelict for a number of years despite efforts to restore it.  Last week a proposal was put before the county council to allow developers to demolish it and build apartments on the site.  If the Minister had seen fit to designate the village it might have helped in restoring the swimming pool.</P>
    <P>The Minister and some of his party colleagues may be aware that Clogherhead pier is in danger of falling into the sea.  Even though this matter may not relate to the section perhaps the Minister would consider it.</P>

After eight barren years of Fianna Fáil rule during which the only announcement from Ministers was the odd song at Fianna Fáil dances, it is nice to see a positive measure for the county.

In the last 25 years Omeath has been virtually turned into a <i>cul-de-sac</i>.  People from the North did not visit the area due to the difficulties there.  This once thriving and popular resort has virtually foundered.  If ever an area deserved inclusion in this scheme this one does.  The village of Omeath needs to be refurbished.  I echo my colleague, Deputy Ahern's plea for something positive to be done for Clogherhead pier or otherwise it will disappear into the sea.  During the past 25 to 30 <Col N="212" /> years it has been the subject of 18 visits from Government Ministers of all hues and sizes who have made promises but have never returned.  We need a pier in Clogherhead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Tramore was already included.  I commend the Minister for extending the number of areas designated under this scheme.  When I spoke on this matter on Second Stage the Minister for Tourism and Trade was present and I made the point that from the Exchequer point of view I do not understand why it is necessary to exclude areas.  The Minister said that even today we do not know the impact this measure will have on some areas, that it may be marginal or nil.  Some areas will have the enthusiasm, co-ordination and structures and will probably do a good job.  On that basis I made the point to the Minister for Tourism and Trade that this scheme should be open and include as many areas as possible. I spoke at some length on Second and Committee Stages about the inclusion of Ardmore in County Waterford about which I received representations.  I thought I spoke most eloquently and was reasonably confident that if there were additions to the scheme Ardmore would be included for all the reasons I outlined.  Ardmore led the way like a beacon in terms of what could be done in these areas.  People in Ardmore worked hard for many years and despite many disappointments the town became a national tidy town championship title holder.  Having achieved that, they are disappointed Ardmore is being excluded when there is an opportunity for investment and improvement in resort areas.  I am disappointed that while the Minister added other areas to those designated under the Bill, he did not include Ardmore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="213" /> The same argument although in a different context could be made for Dunmore East, a beautiful fishing village in the southeast.  One of the problems facing such an area is that substantial investment in hotels is needed.  I commend the people who run the five hotels in that area for their efforts on behalf of the community to attract tourists. I have no doubt that hoteliers in the Dunmore East areas would have seized the opportunity presented by this scheme that could yield such benefits for that community.  As the Minister is aware while the fishing industry struggles as it has during recent years, areas such as Dunmore East need to create new opportunities to generate income in the local economy.  Tourism has been one of the key areas targeted by Dunmore East for investment. Indeed the village did extremely well as a result of being the film location of a book written by Maeve Binchy, the name of which escapes me.</P>

      <P>That film helped the area greatly.  I know the local hoteliers, and the areas of Dunmore East and Ardmore and there is a definite willingness among the communities to invest in their areas.  That is not to say that they have not invested in it in the recent past, but the catalyst needed to seriously upgrade those areas could have been the inclusion of Dunmore East and Ardmore in the scheme.</P>
      <P>There was not any need to exclude areas under this section.  A large number of areas could have been included without imposing a great burden on the Exchequer.  I assure the Minister we will seek to amend the Finance Bill in 1996 to include those areas.  I hope the designated resorts will avail of the opportunities provided for urban renewal under the section.  It is a great opportunity for them and they have no excuse but to forge ahead and make the necessary investment.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Nealon and the Chair for allowing me to say a few words of thanks to the Minister for including the urban area of Clonakilty and the greater part of the surrounding rural area in this beneficial scheme.  I thought during my contribution on Second Stage that my list of 27 areas to be included under the scheme had fallen on deaf ears, but I must thank the Minister sincerely for including the townlands of Dunmore, Mucross, Lonagh, Drombeg and Pallas as well as the townlands of Clogheen, Inchydoney Island, Gallanes, Tawnies Lower, Tawnies Upper, Desert rural, Youghal rural and Miles.  This is a step in the right direction. I hope as Deputy Cullen said, this important pilot scheme for the renewal of traditional seaside resorts is a forerunner of one that hopefully will include many more areas.</P>
      <P>I understand tourism will be our main industry within the next decade.  Every effort should be made to develop our facilities, make it attractive for tourists to visit this country and to ensure we benefit from that important industry.  I hope the Minister will see fit in the near future to extend this worthwhile scheme to the majority of the areas I mentioned on Second Stage in my constituency of south-west Cork.  We are not blessed with lush pastures where I come from.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the addition of Enniscrone to the designated resort areas.  We were all disappointed that Enniscrone and other resorts in County Sligo did not figure on the initial list. Enniscrone is one of the great resorts in the northwest.  Like all traditional resorts for which this scheme has been designed, Enniscrone has to an extent faded away in recent times because of a change in tourist patterns.  The local people made strenuous efforts to revive the area despite the change in tourist movements and did it with extraordinary success but they require additional assistance and are receiving it under this measure; the area will be transformed in a matter of years.  The people of Enniscrone were resilient in the face of changing tourist patterns and the Northern troubles.  As a result of the peace process many Northern people visited the area last Easter and I am sure the same will apply during the summer.  I thank the Minister for selecting Enniscrone for the purposes of this Bill and for including the townlands of Carrowhubbock North, Carrowhubbock South, Frankford, Kinnard and Trotts in the district electoral division of Kilglass and the townlands of Bartragh, Carrowcardin, Muckduff and Scurmore in the district electoral division of Castleconnor. Since the announcement was made there has been a flurry of activity seeking further information about suitable projects under the scheme.  It would be pointless introducing a scheme if nobody took advantage of it, as happened in some urban renewal areas, but the people of Enniscrone will take advantage of this scheme.</P>
      <P>A large championship golf course was developed in Enniscrone in recent times.  I invite the Minister for Finance and his colleague, the Minister for Tourism and Trade to visit the golf course next summer as my guest, and I will allow them win.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the officials sitting in what is known as the &ldquo;bull pen&rdquo; would like to strangle or praise me for this idea.  As the Minister for Finance stated on Committee Stage, I was the progenitor of this idea.  During my time as Minister we made considerable progress in this regard, but we had not decided on the resorts to be included under the scheme.  The idea was accepted by our colleagues in the Department of Finance and prior to the Finance Act, 1994 I endeavoured but failed to convince my colleague, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, that this was a good idea. However, it was agreed later that a seaside resort renewal scheme would be beneficial.  As many seaside resorts had become dilapidated I believed it would be a good idea to initiate a pilot resort renewal scheme based on the urban renewal scheme and particular resorts were selected for final approval before the budget.</P>
      <P>While I welcomed the idea on budget day, I am sure the scheme will outlive its usefulness.  The advice given to me and to the former Minister for Finance was that in initating such a scheme, regardless of the areas selected, others would also wish to be included.  The Minister adopted the spirit of my idea and on budget day announced the seaside resorts selected for inclusion under the scheme and, while they differ somewhat from the resorts I selected.  I accept it is the right of the Government to select its areas of priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, like the urban renewal scheme, this scheme is extended to include all resorts it will lose its attractiveness, but undoubtedly the Minister was under pressure to extend it to all areas; it is the right of every Deputy to make the best case possible for his or her constituency. The scheme has been extended further in the past few hours.  On Committee Stage I tabled an amendment to have it extended to Balbriggan and I have now tabled an amendment to have it extended to Bray.  As children, my brothers and I were frequently brought to Bray where we had relations.  It was <Col N="217" /> a simple matter of travelling to Dublin and getting the bus to Bray, a town which has not benefited over the years from the explosion of tourist numbers. If too many resorts are included the scheme will not serve its purpose.  It should be restricted to six or seven resorts, as announced by the Minister on budget day.  While it may be successful in some areas, in two or three years' time we will not be able to judge its overall success and because of the explosion in tourist numbers some resorts will benefit regardless of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Because people tend to take advantage of cheap air fares and go abroad on holidays the traditional seaside resort has lost its attractiveness.  Why should a person take a seaside holiday in Tramore if he or she can take a flight costing a few hundred pounds to a sunny destination in Europe?  I brought my children to Tramore on holidays for many years, but that resort has become very rundown and will welcome this scheme.  With a three party coalition Government and the normal pressures on the Minister to extend the scheme, it was inevitable the list of resorts would be long.  I welcome the inclusion of Salthill, a resort that should have been included at the outset.  However, in order to be able to determine the effectiveness of the scheme I would have preferred if the Minister had confined it to six areas.</P>
    <P>As the progenitor of the scheme I look forward to monitoring its progress over the next three years, but I am not sure how that will be done.  No doubt each resort deserves to be included, but because so many have been selected, the usefulness of the scheme might be scotched.</P>

      <P>This scheme cannot fail, but it will probably do better in some areas than others.  However, one cannot buck the market.  If certain types of holidays are on the way out no amount of tax assistance will make them attractive again.  If people no longer feel that sitting on their deckchairs at the seaside in Bray is the way to spend their summer holidays no amount of tax relief on hotels in Bray will convince them otherwise.  Perhaps the Minister should have initiated a tourism related project, not necessarily one that would qualify under a seaside resort scheme.  The future of tourism in Ireland is not at the seaside.  While seaside tourism is not on the way out, the days are gone when everyone got on the LNER train to Morecambe, sat on deckchairs on the beach, their heads covered in handkerchiefs knotted at the four corners.  We should not cod ourselves about that.  We cannot wave a magic wand over some areas if the tide has gone out permanently on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I too compliment the Minister for including in the scheme Achill. Mulrany and Westport.  Achill was one of the prime tourist destinations in the past but it now urgently needs reinvestment. County Mayo lost a Dáil seat in the last general election and that reflects on all politicians.  At one time, we had nine Deputies in County Mayo, we now have five and that speaks for itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the inclusion of the new areas in the scheme.  I am sorry Deputy Molloy is not here because he did a lot of shouting across the floor of the House the day the announcement was made about Westport.  However, although Westport is a good business town there are 1,500 people unemployed in the area.  That is a major problem and it is essential that Westport gets <Col N="219" /> this investment.  The town did not benefit under the urban renewal scheme although other towns in the county availed of it.  I have been a member of the urban council since 1979 and we have been demanding urban renewal status for Westport since that time.  Ballina and Castlebar were granted urban renewal status but Westport was excluded.  I congratulate the towns that have now been included in the scheme but it must be remembered that the people who will become involved in it will have to spend money to avail of the tax relief.  In other words, they must make a profit.  Deputy McDowell is correct when he says that the Government cannot lose on this.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to include small towns such as Newport, Louisburgh and others, where there is no employment, in the scheme.</P>

I am concerned that there appears to be numerous schemes which benefit business people and those who have money. I understand the Minister has only a certain amount of money to go around but I ask him to consider those who have been severely disadvantaged, in particular young people who buy a second-hand house.  They are not entitled to any grant-aid, they must pay stamp duty on the house and they do not avail of the first time buyer grant.

I want to see a scheme put in place next year that will benefit people who live in the country throughout the year.  Perhaps the Minister will consider <Col N="220" /> the establishment of such a scheme before next year's budget.</P>
      <P>Because of their inclusion in the scheme, new life will be breathed into Achill and Westport.  These areas need investment urgently and without this type of scheme, people would not come in and spend money in these towns. Deputy McCreevy attributed the establishment of the scheme to himself; Deputy Bertie Ahern was in my constituency some months ago and he said he initiated it and people who stood in by-elections seemed to be of the opinion that they initiated it.  However, this Government delivered on it.  I ask the Minister to include Newport and Louisburgh in the scheme next year.</P>

I am particularly pleased that Bettystown, Laytown and Mosney will be brought into the scheme but I have some questions for the Minister.  In regard to defining the boundary.  I hope that Mornington and the Gormanston area will be included in the scheme.  Laytown, which is one of the areas now being included in the scheme, is the venue for the only race meeting in this country that takes place on a beach.  It is normally held in midsummer, this year's meeting took place last Monday.  I hope the Laytown races will continue and that somebody will take on board the incentives in this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the concerns of some Members in regard to broadening the scheme.  However, this is one area that the Minister will be glad he brought into the scheme because there is a very active local development group in the east Meath area which has done a lot of work over the past number of years. This group will generate further enthusiasm in regard to the expenditure of moneys on the east coast.  This is a particularly important area because it attracts many tourists from Northern Ireland and people from Dublin who only have to travel half an hour to reach the countryside.  They can also visit the <Col N="221" /> beaches at Laytown, Bettystown, Mornington and Gormanston.  This area is the closest seaside resort for people living in the midlands and many families have caravans and mobile homes in east Meath.  The additional facilities that will be provided from incentives in the scheme are long overdue and will be welcomed by all the people who use this resort.</P>
    <P>This scheme will provide good incentives not just for the tourism industry but also for the building industry in the area.  I am sure all Members will join in the welcome for the inclusion of this area in the incentive scheme.</P>

      <P>In response to the points made by Deputy McGahon and others with regard to Omeath, with which I am familiar from the time I spent in Warrenpoint as a youngster during August, attractiveness has waned considerably now due to free trade and the absence of the distortion the Border used to cause for day trippers travelling in both directions.  The northerners came south to drink on Sundays and to buy butter and other items they could not get during the 1950s, the southerners went North to buy Mars bars, Spangles, bangers and other items that one could not get in the South.</P>
      <P>I suggest to Deputies Kirk and McGahon, and all the Louth Deputies, that the Delors peace package proposal and the INTERREG would recommend that they encourage the Mourne and District Council in the North and the County Louth local authority to prepare an integrated tourism development plan for the Carlingford Lough area.  There is probably more potential development capital available through that mechanism. For those Members who do not know the south Down area going up as far as Kilkeel, it leaves Wicklow in the shade as far as I am concerned.  I do not wish to offend anybody in Wicklow, least of all the Leas-Cheann Comhairle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but it is a most beautiful part of the world that, tragically for southerners, has been out of bounds but I hope the peace process will change all that.  In regard to Meath, <Col N="223" /> I would say to Deputy McGahon that a jointly prepared tourism development plan is the way to proceed.  I know there is co-operation between the two county councils and indeed with the Urban District Council in Drogheda.  In regard to Deputy Wallace's point, I have the map for the area and while I cannot read the full list of townlands, because it is not completed, I see that the northern side of Bettystown goes up to almost the end of the golf course.  I hope that answers the Deputy's query but I will make the map available to her later.  I understand an explanatory memorandum has been circulated in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an argument &mdash; and Deputy McCreevy referred to this &mdash; that if we widen the urban designated areas too much, we will dilute their effect.  That argument may seem valid but, on analysis, it is not because in widening existing urban areas in designated towns such as Dublin, the focus of concentration is diluted in a particular part of that town and very little benefit is gained as a result.  In this case we came under enormous pressure to extend the scheme to different constituencies and the response from Deputies on all sides of the House is testimony to that.  There is nothing wrong with that but I do not think a development in Clogherhead will necessarily compete with a development in Laytown or Courtown.  It does not have the same effect as having two hectares in the centre of Galway and expanding it to ten hectares.  There is still a point of focus in different parts of the country.  A number have referred to the fact that it will depend very much on the quality of local leadership in the area and on the county councils.  If I was a member of a local authority in any of those areas I would demand that the county manager in conjunction with the planning office and in consultation with local property owners and interests in the area, develop an integrated co-ordinated development plan for their area. Deputy Michael McDowell is right and <Col N="224" /> I agree with him that the nature of tourism will change very rapidly.  The traditional bucket and spade seaside resort is competing with very attractive guaranteed sunshine destinations in part of the Mediterranean.  Unless there are additional activities, such as golf and other types of environment related activities, the traditional seaside town as a seaside town will not necessarily prosper.</P>
    <P>There are requests for Ardmore, Bray and Balbriggan to be included which I am not accepting.  Bray must be the only place in Ireland where one can go on holidays by DART.  To suggest that we extend this pilot scheme for a seaside town which is effectively an operational suburb of the greater Dublin area is not credible.  It already has urban designation status and I am not open to that suggestion for that reason. Likewise Balbriggan which is not yet as much a suburb of Dublin but the by-pass will resuscitate it considerably.  I have also been lobbied on designating Lusk and other towns that might have benefited.</P>

      <P>I put this amendment down in conjunction with amendment No. 55 to express a view as to how the corporation tax system should be reformed.  I identify with the Minister's view that the rate of corporation tax should be reduced to less than one-third as is the case in the UK. Amendment No. 55 is part of the same proposal.  It is worthwhile giving a corporation tax break to small companies. Having thought about that and the possibility of different bands of corporation tax I was more attracted to the idea of simply giving them a tax credit. I put down those two ideas in the hope that they will be considered for next year rather than this year.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 54 is based on the same premise and we discussed it on Committee Stage.  The effect of my amendment would be to reintroduce what was known as small companies corporation tax relief.  As I explained on Committee Stage, I did not stay up half the night thinking how to word this amendment.  It is a direct cog of the relevant sections which gave rise to that relief, with some changes to bring it into line with modern day practice. My proposal is that a lower rate of <Col N="229" /> corporation tax should apply to companies with profits of £80,000 or less with a graded scale between £80,000 and £100,000 and the full scale to apply thereafter.  We had a fruitful discussion on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McDowell moved the amendment to reduce corporation tax from 38 to 32 per cent and amendment No. 55 is another way of giving small companies tax relief.  I said at the time that a more effective way would be to target companies rather than have a blanket reduction from 40 per cent to 38 per cent.  It would not incur great expense to go for either small companies tax relief or designate specific types of companies which will qualify for the lower tax rate.  I do not believe totally in applying the 10 per cent rate across the board.  There are indigenous companies with employment potential which we should target.</P>
      <P>The Minister could progress on that basis.  He made a reasoned argument as to why he decided to reduce the rate from 40 per cent to 38 per cent this year. He may previously have been of the opinion that targeting was a better approach.  I agree that it is a fine call and I have nothing against the principle of reducing the rate but I believe, and the Revenue Commissioners' records will show, that the cost of targeting will not be as great as I once thought it would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have expressed an interest in this area for some time.  I do not wish to rehash what I said on Committee Stage.  We have a 38 per cent rate this year.  There is an opportunity for targeting.  All debates and reports state that job growth will be in small and medium-sized industries.  Big companies, particularly those in the services sector, are shedding jobs.  Small companies should be encouraged and one way to <Col N="230" /> do that is to reduce the rate of corporation tax.</P>
      <P>As a member of the National Economic and Social Forum I argued that just because there was a 10 per cent manufacturing rate I did not subscribe to the view that we should have a 10 per cent rate across the board.  Every job created in the manufacturing sector has the capacity to create one or two other jobs in ancillary industries whereas the services sector does not have the same ratio of job creation.</P>
      <P>As regards job creation I do not think it is of benefit to big institutions although it benefits those with large profits.  It is legitimate to bring in a tiered rate of corproation tax which should be targeted.  That should be done as a matter or urgency and the Minister will be commended for going in that direction next year when preparing the Finance Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already had this debate.  Reducing taxation for small companies is a blanket approach.  We should differentiate between the types of company, age of the company and so on.  I appreciate the co-operation of Deputies in their approach to the Bill. One of our great strengths over the years has been the certainty with regard to the 10 per cent tax regime.  We are able to say to investors that this is fixed and guaranteed until the year 2010 and in the case of the IFFC to the year 2005. It is an extraordinary advantage in competitive terms for inward investment and a bonus for companies involved in forward planning.  There should be a consensus on whatever changes we make in corporation tax and, once agreed, we should stick with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the few things of inestimable value to a Government, regardless of its political persuasion, that an open market economy can provide is a degree of certainty in the regulatory regime and the governance of the economy.  That is why I indicated my policy in regard to the reduction of corporation tax from 40 per cent to 38 per cent over the next two years.  If we cannot achieve this over <Col N="231" /> three years we will do it over four or five years.</P>
    <P>I am not disputing the merits of what Deputy McDowell proposed at the outset of the debate &mdash; it provides a degree of certainty and enables people to plan &mdash; but this proposal would lead to windfall gains and would not necessarily address all the issues.  I will consider this point in the context of next year's budget and Finance Bill and I hope to introduce a provision which will enable us to have a comprehensive debate on the matter.  I will ensure it is in such a form that it is owned by all of us and, therefore, will not become a football. Many companies suffer considerably by not knowing Government policy from one year to another.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(1) Section 162 (as amended by section 48 of the Finance Act, 1990) of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, is hereby repealed.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is of interest to people who operate what are known as &ldquo;close&rdquo; companies.  This provision was included in the tax Acts at a time when there was a considerable differential between the corporation tax rate and the high income tax rates.  It was of benefit to journalists and television broadcasters who set up limited companies and acted as directors, thereby saving themselves a considerable amount of tax &mdash; the corporation tax rate was considerably lower than the personal tax rates.  To deal with this tax avoidance measure the Revenue Commissioners introduced a surcharge on those companies, and it has remained in place ever since.  On Committee Stage I suggested to the Minister that this provision was not worth a candle any more and the simplest thing would be to repeal the relevant section of the Act.  The Minister said that he would examine the matter before Report Stage.  The reasons I gave on Committee Stage for the removal of this provision are still valid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Having examined the issue, I cannot accept the amendment for the following reasons.  First, the main anti-avoidance purpose of the surcharge remains relevant.  In the absence of the surcharge the attractiveness of the deferral of higher tax rates payable by shareholders in the receipt of dividends would be further increased.  Profits retained in a close service company would be taxable at 38 per cent whereas if they were distributed to shareholders they would suffer an effective tax rate of 58 per cent when account is taken of both the corporation tax and income tax payable.  It is reasonable to suspect that this deferral option would be availed of <Col N="235" /> in preference to distributing profits by way of higher remuneration or dividends which would be immediately subject to the higher income tax rates in the hands of the recipient.</P>
      <P>Second, the main argument put to me for the alleviation of the surcharge was that it was having a detrimental effect on the ability of service companies and, in particular, small service companies to build up adequate capital to meet their day to day needs.  The changes in the Bill recognise that argument and reduce the impact of the surcharge, thus increasing the ability of companies to retain a higher level of resources for working capital purposes without incurring the surcharge penalty.  Although the Deputies may have had different experiences, neither I nor my Department have received representations seeking the total abolition of the surcharge. This suggests that the companies affected accept that their problem has been recognised and acted upon.</P>

    <P>This amendment proposes to insert a new section which follows closely on section 52 of the 1994 Finance Act.  That section provided that certain payments made by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry under a specific agreement to National Co-operative Farm Relief Services Limited and grants made by that body to its members under the same agreement were to be exempt from corporation tax.  This new section proposes to extend under a new agreement similar relief to the same bodies. The purpose of the new agreement is to create employment in the provision of <Col N="237" /> agricultural services through the appointment of development officers.  It has been decided to exempt from corporation tax payments made under clause 3.1 (a) of the new agreement by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to the umbrella body, the National Co-operative Farm Relief Services Limited, in respect of salaries and expenses of development officers and payments made by that body under clause 3.4 of the agreement to its member co-opertives in respect of clause 3.1 (a).</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Liz O'Donnell on 16 May 1995:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, mindful of the fact that ecstasy and other drugs are widely and cheaply available for sale to teenagers and schoolchildren throughout the country, proving a health risk to them and to society as a whole, mindful of the direct link of heroin abuse to petty crime and mindful also of the fact that there are 6,000 heroin addicts in Dublin alone with only 400 receiving treatment and that half of the prisoners in Mountjoy are IV drug users, calls on the Government collectively to respond urgently and strategically to this national emergency by:</P>
    <P>diverting adequate Garda resources to combat the drug emergency:</P>
    <P>establishing comprehensive programmes of methadone maintenance in targeted areas with known drug abuse problems;</P>
    <P>establishing a Protocol for pharmacists for such methadone maintenance programmes;</P>
    <P>the designation of more than one national custodial and detoxification centre for addicted offenders and the removal of suitable addicts from prison to those centres;</P>
    <P>the introduction of a national programme on the dangers of drug abuse in all secondary schools and a media campaign to warn young people of the dangers of substance abuse; <Col N="239" /> preventing the introduction of drugs in to our prisons;</P>
    <P>the introduction of legislation to strengthen the law and penalties for drug importers, distributors and suppliers of drugs;</P>

      <P>The increasing problem of drugs, especially among our young people, is something with which all Members of this House are duly concerned. However, there are no doubt a number of different approaches to dealing with the escalating problem.</P>
      <P>The drugs problem is a cancer eating away at the very heart of our society and destroying the lives of thousands of our young people.  Those who push drugs on young people are the greatest scourge in our communities and deserve nothing but the appropriate punishment to meet the crimes they are commiting on society.  They are festering on and destroying the lives of many of our young people.</P>
      <P>Members will be aware that the drugs problem is closely associated with many other social problems that exist in modern Ireland.  It is common knowledge that there is a close correlation between drug use and crime.  The fact that heroin users in Dublin are three times more likely than non-users to have been arrested for robbery or assault speaks volumes.</P>
      <P>The fact that another recent study has shown that approximately 60 per cent of heroin users had been arrested for robbery should clearly indicate to the House that if we are serious about solving our escalating crime problem then we as legislators, and society as a whole, must initiate measures to eradicate our growing drug problem.  One problem feeds off another and multiplies, leaving nothing but devastation in its wake.  It is up to us as legislators to come up with proposals which will adequately deal with these problems and ensure a better and safer society for all our citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am most concerned with the effects drug use has on our young people.  A survey undertaken by the National Youth Council of Ireland last year shows that 60 per cent of the young <Col N="241" /> people surveyed had actually been offered drugs.  This is distressing news. What makes matters worse is that two-thirds of the young people surveyed said they did not believe there was sufficient information available to young people on the dangers of drugs.  There is an onus on all of us to do something positive about this.  While I am aware of many worthy programmes that seek to increase awareness of the dangers of drugs to young people, it is obvious that they need to be extended radically before the situation gets totally out of hand.</P>
    <P>While rehabilitation clinics and centres for recovering addicts etc. are all very important and have a vital role to play, greater emphasis must be placed on preventative measures.  Surely it would be far more effective to prevent young people becoming hooked on drugs rather than having to treat them afterwards and all the associated problems such as drug related crime.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to call on the Government to support the introduction of national guidelines for youth workers and those working with young people who come into contact with illegal drugs.  It is surely sensible that those who are working at the coalface, so to speak, should be aware of the procedures to be followed when dealing with young people who have come into contact with drugs.  National guidelines similar to those for the juvenile liaison system would be especially effective in this regard.</P>
    <P>Apart from sensible educational and preventative measures such as those I have mentioned, effective punishment must be meted out to those animals who are peddling drugs to our young people and destroying their and their families' lives.</P>
    <P>Let us be honest about the problem. Ordinary people know the drug pushers &mdash; the Garda know them &mdash; yet they are allowed walk around our streets pushing their lethal goods on our young people. This cannot be tolerated any longer. The Garda must be given whatever authority they need to ensure that these <Col N="242" /> scum are taken off our streets and out of our communities for good.</P>
    <P>It is a ridiculous state of affairs that known drug pushers can show off their ill-gotten wealth with flashy expensive cars, large houses and lifestyles of luxury while the young people on whom they push their drugs are forced, as a result of their dependency, to eke out a miserable existence and turn to crime to feed their habit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party I wish to add what I know about the drugs problem.  I express my appreciation to the Deputies who have allowed me time to contribute.  I know of no animal, apart from some humans, who depends on drugs in the way we do: it may not be appropriate to call them animals in the sense which has been used.  All the attention which has been given to drugs in Dublin and Cork blurs the extent of the problem we are dealing with.</P>
      <P>I represent Dublin North, a largely rural area.  Schools, secondary schools particularly, clubs and some strange places are being infiltrated by people dealing in drugs.  The problem is not confined to soft drugs but involves heroin and ecstasy, which is more widespread that it was a few years ago. Drogheda has a serious heroin problem. Laytown, a small seaside resort, has a big problem with E tablets and cannabis. It is clear the problem is out of control.  Many friends of mine have said that on separate occasions, mainly on Saturday evenings, while walking down Dame Street in Dublin, it would be unusual not to be approached three or four times by boys and girls as young as 11 years of age offering ecstasy tablets. The problem is widespread.  <i>The Star</i> newspaper referred to one street nearby as E street, so notorious was it for the practice of people being offered this drug.  This is happening to everybody, not just people dressed in a certain way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that the problem of ecstasy is not an isolated one.  Because it is consumed by young people who are still in <Col N="243" /> the charge of their parents it is associated with heroin.  Young people are offered heroin to relieve them &mdash; if I can use that expression &mdash; of the effects of ecstasy so that they may go home to their parents, who can remain completely ignorant of the fact that they have been consuming drugs.  In fact they are being weaned on to heroin to replace their dependency on ecstasy. Part of the problem relates to the price of ecstasy tablets, which, I understand, has decreased from £25 to £8.</P>
    <P>If the information about the harmful effects of drugs is widespread it is not getting through.  It is clear that young people are bombarded with propaganda that one drug is the same as the other and that everything is a drug.  While I can see some perverted logic in trying to talk about the wider definition of drugs and addiction in a consumer society, it is obscene to think that drugs such as heroin and ecstasy are regarded as harmless.  That is an absolute disgrace.</P>
    <P>I watched a programme on television recently which highlighted the real effects of cannabis.  Whereas before it was considered to be a type of social drug in some parts of the world, the brain damage it causes is regarded as a crime.</P>
    <P>The Government may claim that the problem is being dealt with, but there are only 22 people operating from the Drugs Squad, all of whom are known to drug dealers.  They cannot go anywhere without drug dealers knowing where they are and assaulting them.  It is high time the Government realised that younger people would be better able to infiltrate these circles of crime than some of the old hands who are failing. As happened in the 1980s in Sheriff Street, younger people should be recruited by the Garda for undercover duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a reflection of the seriousness of the issue that so many people are eager to contribute, and I am anxious to facilitate them because it is important that we hear reports from around the country.  I recognise that we have a serious drug problem, it has been estimated that there are about 5,000 people with drug problems in Dublin. Much of the crime against people and property is related to drug abuse.  In Dublin we face a threat from drugs which is on the same scale as was posed by terrorist violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that there is no simple answer to the drugs problem.  The <Col N="245" /> causes are complex and are unquestionably related to social deprivation and exclusion.  The effects are known to everyone.  Apart from the total devastation in the lives of addicts and their families the problem affects all society and is enormously costly in terms of crime, health services, social and other services.</P>
    <P>Such a problem requires an appropriate level of response and that is why the Government strategy to prevent drug abuse seeks to address this complex and difficult issue with a multidisciplinary approach with action in the areas of demand reduction, supply reduction and increased access to treatment and rehabilitation programmes.</P>
    <P>The strategy proposes an integrated attack on the drug problem at a number of different levels to include educating young people in the dangers of drug abuse; preventing the traffickers bringing drugs into Ireland; and concerted action by the Garda, Customs Service and Defence Forces against drug criminals. In addition the threat facing society must be met by appropriate legal sanctions and reform of legal and court structures which currently inhibit effective action against drug criminals must be implemented.  Measures have already been put in place and further measures are being examined as a matter of urgency by my Department, including the question of rehabilitating addicts.</P>
    <P>In regard to improved use of Garda resources, this year the Garda are being provided with £413 million &mdash; the highest amount ever.  Over the next three years 1,050 extra gardaí will be recruited.  Gardaí currently on clerical duties will be systematically replaced by a further 200 civilian staff.  This will lead to a substantial increase in the operational strength of the force particularly in the areas of community policing and the Drugs Squad.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Garda, the Customs service and the Defence Forces are committed to an unrelenting war.  There can be no half-measures.</P>
    <P>In the remaining time available to me, <Col N="246" /> I would like to briefly mention a number of other measures being taken.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice will be bringing proposals to Government very shortly on putting in place the best arrangements for achieving a cohesive and co-ordinated response to the drug trafficking problem by the existing law enforcement agencies.  The European Drugs Unit, which became operational in 1994, is exchanging and co-ordinating drugs intelligence throughout the European Union.  Many recent finds were based on good intelligence work.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1994, provides for the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of crime, including drug trafficking.  My colleague, the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, and her Department, co-operate actively with the various agencies concerned with the prevention of drug abuse.</P>
    <P>Since 1992 special funding has been allocated each year to allow for the development of extensive prevention and treatment services by the Eastern Health Board, which, with the Drug Treatment Centre in Pearse Street and voluntary organisations, provides such services in the Dublin area where the majority of drug users reside.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board is commissioning a ten bed unit at Cherry Orchard Hospital and it is hoped to have it available in the middle of June.</P>
    <P>It is planned to carry out a full review to establish how best to manage the problems of access to drugs and the treatment of drug-addicted offenders.  In this context, the question of providing extended methadone maintenance treatment programmes in prisons, in consultation with community health agencies, is currently being explored. The establishment of a detoxification facility, with a drug free unit within the existing prison system, is under active consideration at present.  All these elements are essential in the fight against the scourge of the misuse of drugs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent RGDATA <Col N="247" /> survey entitled &ldquo;Violence in the Shops&rdquo; provides ample evidence of a deteriorating crime problem in our capital city and the need for a comprehensive plan to tackle it.  Further, the concentration on shops in daylight reflects a shift in criminal activity to small, open accessible targets.  That further reflects the epidemic of drug abuse sweeping the country.  Drug abusers are desperate and will seek the most accessible source of funding for their addiction on a day to day basis.  Therefore, small retail outlets are vulnerable and prime targets.</P>
      <P>In addition to the measures announced by the Minister of State, steps should be taken urgently to secure weapons at present in the hands of Northern paramilitaries before they begin to trickle into the hands of criminals. The internal strife between the Garda Representative Association and the Garda Federation must be resolved so that energy is not dissipated and morale undermined in the Garda at this critical time.  Furthermore, the Garda should be redeployed from Border duty, given refresher training and put back on the streets of our cities.  In line with what the Minister said, the Revenue Commissioners must be let loose on the drug barons who are known to the Garda, who have no visible means of support but who have substantial assets. The provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, which empowers the Garda to seize and freeze suspected criminal assets must be implemented.  The Department of Health must put in place a city-wide framework of detoxification units, and I am delighted with the doubling of the beds in Cherry Orchard Hospital.  Satellite clinics for methadone maintenance need to be increased, and that has been done too.  Needle exchange and counselling with in-patient and out-patient facilities must be provided and, finally, a downstream general practitioner service for stabilised drug users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The service must also be radically reformed to respond to the medical <Col N="248" /> needs of drug abusers who largely populate the prisons.  Although we have a drug epidemic, the problem is not insoluble if we take the right approach urgently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for Justice and the Minister of State for their constructive comments on the drugs emergency.  The greatest manifestation of evil in Ireland today is the drug culture.  Sadly, it is no longer confined to Dublin and Cork, it is nationwide. Ecstasy tablets and hashish are widely available on the streets of provincial Ireland, including my rural constituency. As Deputy Costello mentioned, there is evidence to suggest that paramilitaries, both republican and loyalist, made redundant in the peace process have now turned to drug trafficking. They have changed from purveying death in one form to purveying death in another.  The peace process must have released cohorts of gardaí and members of the RUC from security duty who must now be deployed to combat the drugs problem.  It is essential that there be a joint Garda-RUC cross Border drugs initiative which would be of great assistance in the detection of criminal activity with specific reference to drugs.</P>
      <P>In spite of recent successes when millions of pounds worth of drugs were seized by the Customs and Garda, this country is the gateway to Europe for many international drug rings and our coastal surveillance and protection is hopelessly inadequate.  It is estimated that 80 per cent of crime in Dublin is now drug related.  Recent happenings in Cork show that the rule of law is under threat underlining the need for the Government and the Dáil to wage war on the drug barons and remove them from our streets.  Drug related murders, stabbings, beatings and kidnappings feature daily on our streets.  In 1995 the discotheque is especially noted for drugs. This is a sad reflection on our society as we approach the turn of the century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The resource base of the Garda, the Army, the Customs Service and the Naval Service must be overhauled in so <Col N="249" /> far as budgets relate to the war against drugs.  I call for a greater level of co-ordination between the Government Departments of Education, Health, Justice and Defence.  It was pleasing to hear the Minister of State speak about this issue tonight.  Her senior colleague did likewise last night.  Consideration should be given to setting up a national drugs agency which would bring together the best available expertise not only from the State sector but also from the voluntary and community sector to eradicate the misuse of drugs within society.</P>
    <P>I commend Young Fine Gael for its recent initiative.  Its study is worthwhile and I hope it will find its way to the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>There should be specialised trained Garda units at our ports.  This is not the case at present.  International drug trafficking throughout Ireland will be overcome with expert and financial assistance from the European Union.  That the Taoiseach recently highlighted this problem, at Head of State level indicates the seriousness with which the Government views the issue.  The youth of Europe are every bit as vulnerable to this evil as Irish youth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this important issue.  Not only is this a serious problem at national level it is also a serious problem internationally. It is clear that at national level the Government is committed to tackling it. In this regard the Minister will soon present the Government with proposals. The Taoiseach indicated that he wants this issue to be included on the agenda for the intergovernmental conference next year.  It was also on the agenda at the Western European Union meeting last week.  At international level we have to ensure that economies do not depend completely on the manufacture of drugs as is the case in some countries. We will not solve the problem unless it is tackled at all levels.  It is a complex issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the time available to me I wish to focus on teenagers and to comment on <Col N="250" /> Garda numbers.  It is important that we do not alarm the public unnecessarily about the number of gardaí involved in tackling the drugs problem.  Some speakers seemed to indicate there has been a decrease in the number of gardaí involved full-time in drug duties but this is not the case.</P>
    <P>In the mid-1980s we had the central drugs squad based at Store Street and outside Dublin we had units in Cork and Limerick.  Today there are drug units in each of the five Garda divisions in the city and their activities are co-ordinated through the central drugs squad based in Harcourt Street.  This enables the central drugs squad to monitor the activities of drug dealers all over the city and has significantly enhanced the Garda's intelligence gathering capability. We have seen evidence of this in recent weeks in the number of drug seizures.  There are full-time drug units operating in Santry, Cabra and Raheny and in a number of other areas to which I will not refer.</P>
    <P>Of the number of people in Dublin addicted to drugs there are between 10,000 and 12,000 individuals attending the various drug treatment centres.  It is estimated that 20 per cent or 2,500 of these are teenagers.  Many teenage drug addicts are not receiving treatment and are not included in any official statistics. We therefore have a major problem on our hands.</P>
    <P>We need to adopt a special approach to prevent young people from developing a drugs habit.  In addition, we need to provide more specialist facilities separate from adult facilities.  It is not helpful if young people experimenting with drugs or addicted to them end up in the same treatment facilities as adults.  We will have to take extra special measures to reach out to young people.</P>
    <P>There is an enormous quantity of ectasy tablets available on our streets. Many young people in Dublin and elsewhere do not realise that when they buy ecstasy tablets they are buying a dangerous manufactured drug which often contains additives such as rat poison, heroin <Col N="251" /> and amphetamines.  Taking this drug can be extremely dangerous and even lead to death.  We have to target health and education programmes to get that message across to young people.  As the Minister suggested last night co-operation between the Departments of Education, Justice and Health is the way to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to provide a freephone advisory service for young people.  Such a service was provided during the European Week for preventing drug abuse and there was a strong response from parents and young people throughout the country looking for information.  There is evidence that young people experimenting with drugs, are under peer pressure or are being bullied and find it difficult to talk to parents or school teachers.  We ought to develop a confidential telephone service for them.  Six member states of the European Union have provided such a service and one is operating successfully in Belfast.  The Departments of Health and Justice should consider providing such a service.  Both Departments supported the provision of this service during the European Week for preventing drug abuse.</P>
    <P>In my constituency the Phoenix Centre in Fenian Street is trying to develop an outreach programme for adolescents. Programmes such as this offering specialist help will make a difference and direct young people who have become addicted on to another route. The Phoenix Centre also sends representatives to speak to young people in schools to encourage them to ask questions about the drugs they have been offered or with which they are experimenting.</P>
    <P>There is a need for action at many levels.  At present ruthless drug pushers in Dublin are exploiting young people. We are being given a lesson in marketing. The drug used to cost £25 but it now costs only £10.  I have no doubt that as more adolescents become addicted the price will increase and the inevitable <Col N="252" /> search for money to buy drugs will lead to crime.</P>

      <P>Currently 340 people in the Eastern Health Board area are waiting for life saving treatment: treatment that could not only save the life of the addict but possibly the lives &mdash; and reduce the suffering &mdash; of thousands of victims of drug abusers.  If these were ordinary patients suffering from some form of organic disease there would be a national outcry.  Instead they are drug abusers waiting for places on methadone maintenance programmes and, sadly, the response to their plight is a deafening silence.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that the Progressive Democrats have chosen to highlight the drugs issue and in particular have focused on the problems facing addicted offenders, a matter which I raised on the Adjournment last month.  I do not necessarily agree with the PD's recipe, but it has most of the ingredients right.</P>
      <P>Drugs, like any other product, are subject to the laws of the market. Esctasy is currently available on the streets of Dublin for as little as £3 per tablet and the price is continuing to drop due to what can only be termed a glut on the market.  Both the motion from the Progressive Democrats and the Government's amendment deal largely with the end of the supply chain, the drug abuser.  Before dealing with some of the issues raised in the motion.  I would like to focus on the beginning of that chain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is not a drugs producer.  We grow neither marijuana nor poppies, and we do not manufacture ecstasy.  The drugs consumed on our streets are imported.  We must address the trade both in the countries of origin and at the points of entry.  In this regard I hope that Ireland, together with our EU partners, will address the fact that ecstasy is flowing into the EU from Eastern European countries such as Czechoslovakia and Romania, marijuana and cannabis resin are being imported from North Africa and Central Asia and heroin is being imported from South America. <Col N="253" /> Nowhere is the global village more apparent than in the drugs trade.</P>
    <P>Drugs are the single greatest health issue facing society.  Because of the illicit nature of drug abuse, we do not know precisely how many people are affected. In Dublin South Central there is a serious drugs problem.</P>
    <P>In Dublin as a whole it is estimated that there are between 5,000 and 6,000 drug addicts, and this does not include the occasional users who may become addicts in the future.  Even if one accepts the figure of 5,000 addicts, just 20 per cent are receiving treatment for their addiction with 860 on methadone programmes and about 100 availing of other forms of treatment.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrat's motion calls for &ldquo;more than one national custodial and detoxification centre&rdquo;.  I am not quite sure what is meant by that.  All custodial centres are by implication detoxification centres since, in theory anyway, drugs must be left at the prison door.  We all know, of course, that theory and practice are two very different things.</P>
    <P>Detoxification simply means that drugs are flushed from the body.  There is no guarantee that an addict, once detoxified, will not resume his addiction again at the first opportunity.  The vast majority of detoxified addicts renew their addiction, which is why the methadone maintenance programme is the key to resolving this problem.  Methadone maintenance is widely acknowledged as the most effective means of breaking the dependence on heroin. Our efforts should focus on establishing as many local methadone maintenance programmes as possible, backed up by counselling, support services and rehabilitation programmes.</P>
    <P>Maintenance programmes should be available in the patient's community, and, since for many addicts the community is a prison, they should be available there.  Each day Mountjoy admits between four and 15 drug abusers. Those figures are further evidence of the incontrovertible link between poverty, drugs and crime: about 80 per cent <Col N="254" /> of drug abusers are unemployed and since it requires around £150 a day to maintain a drugs habit, about 80 per cent of crime is thought to be drugs related.  The link between crime and drugs is best and most gruesomely illustrated by the frequent use of a bloodfilled syringe as a weapon.  Unless we address these issues in an integrated fashion, we will still be debating the drugs crisis ten years hence, and by then it will be a crisis of unmanageable proportions.</P>
    <P>The priority must be the provision of more places on methadone maintenance programmes: at least 4,000 extra places are needed in the Eastern Health Board region.  Methadone maintenance, however, is of little use unless it is backed up by a comprehensive rehabilitation package.  There is a clear need not just to recruit extra psychologists and counsellors to the health services, but also to redeploy existing professionals to areas of high drug abuse.</P>
    <P>We currently have a number of excellent services operating in different fields.  However, there is little co-ordination between them.  Very often, our crisis management has been enthusiastic but diffuse and largely ineffectual.  The Eastern Health Board has developed a number of valuable initiatives such as setting up satellite clinics, particularly the Aisling centre in Cherry Orchard, but lacks the resources to build on them. In addition, its response has been handicapped by the baffling division of responsibility between the health boards and the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>In Dublin we currently have the absurd situation where the main drug treatment centre.  Trinity Court, which does not include methadone maintenance, is run by the Department of Health.  In order to obtain a detoxification bed in Beaumont Hospital the Eastern Health Board must go through Trinity Court.  Not only is this an unnecessary duplication of services and administration resources, it also involves a further delay for patients seeking admittance to a detoxification bed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="255" /> The time has come for drugs services to be co-ordinated under one authority, preferably the local health board, and for services to be developed to the lowest possible level and operated on a client-centred basis.  Ideally I would like to see the establishment of local methadone maintenance programmes backed up by at least one community drugs project along the lines of the Merchants Quay project or Community Response in each community care area.  Rather than administering a facility, as in the case of Trinity Court, the Department of Health should confine its role to co-ordination and strategy development.</P>

      <P>Last night in the House Deputy O'Donnell made a very wide-ranging and thoughful contribution to this debate.  That may sound strange coming from a Government back-bencher but I agree with most of the points she made.  Nobody would begrudge giving greater resources to the Garda, but there is no point throwing good money after bad.  Unless the priorities are right and we have a high quality of policing to tackle the problem, there is no point allocating more money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support that point. Deputy O'Donoghue may be surprised that I praise him also as I am not opposed to his suggestion of a national forum to galvanise all-party and public support on this issue.  I support his good suggestion as long as it would not be a talking shop but a guide to action to take the necessary measures to deal with this problem.  During the past few weeks I was intrigued that all of us in this House have been upbraided and severely criticised by people who claim to be pro-life, but life is being destroyed daily on the streets of our cities and towns.  It is appalling that those who profess to be pro-life do not seem to worry about the lives of people affected <Col N="256" /> by this problem.  Such people are concerned about unborn life but have no regard for born life being destroyed by this immoral, evil menace.</P>
      <P>It is important that we have co-ordination between all forces, the Garda, the Army, the Navy and customs.  We have not given this problem the priority it deserves and unless we treat it as a priority life will continue to be destroyed and devalued in our cities and towns.  Unfortunately, there is a fatalistic attitude among many in our society that nothing can be done, but I reject that.  All forces must adopt a warlike approach to tackle the drugs problem and there is no reason we cannot use all our resources to do that, even though we are vulnerable to the importation of drugs through airports and ports.  If we put our minds to tackling this problem, there is no reason we cannot succeed in turning the tide against this terrible trade.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate and I pay tribute to Deputy O'Donnell and her colleagues for tabling this Private Members' motion and to the quality of the contributions yesterday evening.  I strongly support and endorse the contribution of my colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, our spokesperson on justice.  He put forward a comprehensive and radical programme to deal with this issue, including new and different proposals representing a departure from existing policies and measures for dealing with drug abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to focus on the area of education and the absolute need for a proper education programme at primary and secondary levels.  Alcohol and drug abuse is the single greatest threat <Col N="257" /> to young people in society today.  Having spoken to many youth workers, social workers, gardaí and teachers I am satisfied that children are being exposed to drugs and alcohol abuse at a very young age.  As a society we need to give priority to tackling this problem.  We are not doing so at present.  The fact that the White Paper does not make any reference to alcohol and drug abuse illustrates that point.</P>
    <P>We need to make an alcohol, drug and substance abuse programme a core part of primary and secondary level curricula. I note the motion before us refers only to secondary education.  I am sure the movers of the motion accept that any such education programme should be extended to and included in the primary curriculum.  I am not talking about a hit and miss type of education programme whereby various experts would be employed.  We need a comprehensive programme in the first instance to give young children the self-confidence and self-esteem to withstand peer pressure in the school yard and among their school friends.  If one talks to young people who have become drug addicts or involved in drug abuse, often the initial pressure to take drugs comes from children in their age group asking them to be one of the gang and to take whatever drug is on offer.  It is important that self-confidence building programmes are introduced at primary level and they should be a core part of the curriculum, not taught once or twice a week or every now and again as part of a civics class.  The crisis is such that it is necessary to build up an anti-drug culture for future generations.</P>
    <P>Having entered public life I recall meeting a former student who had come through a treatment facility, but I did not realise that young person had been taking drugs.  That illustrates that many teachers require assistance and inservice programmes to enable them identify signs of children who may be taking drugs or indulging in alcohol.  They must be in a position to deliver effective programmes on alcohol and drug abuse. That is extremely important.  We hear <Col N="258" /> much about inservice teacher training programmes across a wide range of courses, but we never hear of them in the context of a comprehensive education programme on alcohol and drug abuse.  An inservice programme for teachers is essential.  Such a programme is also essential for parents and it should be provided in all our schools through various parent committees.  Parents are crying out for guidance and assistance. At present we are depending on the goodwill of the gardaí, social workers and youth organisations to provide education programmes through public meetings and infrequent visitations to schools.  If it were not for the contribution of voluntary groups, we would be in a poor state.</P>
    <P>I am extremely disappointed that the Minister for Education has not given this issue the priority it deserves in her education agenda.  It should be at the top of that agenda.  Personally, I would put all other curriculum issues to one side and make this my number one issue in education because the corrosive impact of such abuse on young people is so deadly.  We have seen little evidence from the Government or the Minister for Education that she or her Department consider this issue a priority.</P>
    <P>It is increasingly important, particularly at second level, that we use the experience of many young people who were former addicts or alcoholics as they have a good deal to contribute to such an education programme.  It is important that we harness their experience as they could be of great assistance to us.  I am aware various submissions on this subject have been made to the Department of Education by the teachers' unions and many professionals involved in training young people.  The response has not been great and I note from the Government's amendment to the motion that all we get is token support for the measures taken by the Ministers for Health and Education in the area of treatment of drug abuse.  The Minister of State.  Deputy Burton, stated that the Minister for Education co-operates with other agencies in this regard. <Col N="259" /> That is not good enough and it reflects an inertia and a lack of urgency in dealing with this matter, particularly in the education field.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a national forum on this issue is an excellent proposal and should be acted on immediately because that might concentrate minds on the drugs issue.  The Government should not reject that suggestion because it was made by a member of the Opposition.  It should be given urgent consideration.  We must create an anti-drug culture in our society.</P>
    <P>We need more treatment facilities. We do not have a treatment culture in our society.  We have only two treatment centres in Cork in Arbour House and Tabor Lodge, both of which use the Hazelden drug free interventionist method of dealing with drug addiction and addiction generally.  They question the methadone programme used in Dublin.  I understand why it was introduced, but addiction is the core problem which ultimately must be treated and dealt with.  We need more centres to treat addicts and the courts need to be in a position to refer addicts to such centres and, if necessary, to detain them for detoxification and treatment.  We need radical and tough measures to deal with the overall problem.  I plead with the Government to give this matter the priority it deserves in terms of education. We have had enough lip service and empty rhetoric, it is time for action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, pay tribute to Deputy O'Donnell for bringing this motion before the House and giving us an opportunity to contribute.  There is no doubt the use and abuse of addictive substances is one of the most appalling problems facing society around the globe.  Before addressing specific aspects of the problem and outlining the most promising initiative available for dealing with drug abuse, it would be useful to focus for a few minutes on the depths of despair and fear which are a routine part of daily life for the addict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us fortunate enough not be <Col N="260" /> involved in any type of substance abuse have only a superficial insight into the sheer terror and desperation of the life of an addict.  The majority of people are likely to have a range of routine cares and concerns and in certain cases such problems can cause profound distress and upset.  Consider for a moment a drug addict's quality of life.  As well as all the routine pressures of life, he or she has three further enormous and intimidating problems.  The addict has largely lost control over his or her body and the craving for the next fix overrides every other need and duty. Addicts have the associated need to acquire a steady supply of drugs and the necessary funding must be secured to enable routine purchase of fresh supplies. In his contribution yesterday, Deputy O'Donoghue outlined in sobering detail the financial resources required to satisfy a serious drug addiction.</P>
    <P>In my opening remarks I deliberately focused on the plight of the drug addict for two reasons.  It is vital that we do not lose sight of the fact that first and foremost the individual case of drug addiction represents a personal tragedy and that the damage is not confined to the addict.  It can cause suffering and distress to the addict's family, circle of friends and, in some cases, business colleagues. My second reason for focusing initially on the addict as a victim is that the overall position will rapidly deteriorate if we simply castigate drug abusers. We have a far greater chance of success if we focus on two simple core requirements. We must develop effective and comprehensive rehabilitation programmes for drug abusers.  It is unacceptable that less than 7 per cent of Dublin's heroin addicts are receiving treatment.  This is nothing short of insanity.  This core problem must be tackled immediately on a massive scale.</P>
    <P>If we combine the figure of 4,000 heroin addicts in Dublin with a daily cost of, say, £150 per person, the city's addicts must raise £600,000 each day simply to feed their habit.  If this cost is extended to a full year the overall annual bill <Col N="261" /> totals more than £200 million, much of which is derived either directly or indirectly from criminal activities.  If we ignore the human suffering caused by drug abuse the simple economics of the position are obvious.  There is a major financial incentive to rapidly develop and implement a comprehensive rehabilitation programme for drug abusers.  Such an initiative must act as a vital cornerstone in any systematic State response to the current epidemic of drug abuse.</P>
    <P>Substantial additional resources must be allocated to preventive programmes, especially in our educational institutions. If the figure of 4,000 heroin addicts in Dublin is accurate, it represents almost 1 per cent of the population between the ages of 15 and 44. The rate is probably much higher for those in their late teens or early 20s. While many have made substantial efforts to convey the appalling danger and misery of drug addiction to our school going population, their contributions have not been sufficient.  It is crucial that every effort is made to develop, implement, monitor and modify, where necessary, comprehensive educational programmes to deflect our young people from the horror of drug abuse.</P>
    <P>This programme must focus on two core realities.  It must clearly convey that drug abuse is neither clever nor fashionable, but stupid and profoundly anti-social.  Every effort must be made to strip away any element of glamour from drug abuse.  Too often a maturing teenager is vulnerable to peer pressure. Whether one is dealing with drug abuse, alcohol abuse or sexual relationships, the unprepared young person is at an increased risk.  We must do everything in our power to ensure every young person is aware that dabbling in drugs is a recipe for personal disaster.</P>
    <P>As well as accepting the need for effective rehabilitation of drug addicts and the prime requirement for comprehensive and effective prevention-based programmes, it is vital to intensify the campaign against the suppliers of drugs. <Col N="262" /> The fight against drug dealers is made particularly difficult by the fact that the drug trade is so lucrative.  Consequently, the main drug barons can afford to employ &ldquo;runners&rdquo; to carry out the more risky aspects of their business while they oversee their evil trade from a distance.</P>
    <P>Significant progress will be made against drug traders only if the resources allocated to combat their activities is radically increased.  Extra Garda activity is required on the streets and at a strategic level and the penalties imposed on those convicted of drug related crimes must be increased.  The motion before us contains a number of excellent proposals on which to base the future battle against illegal drug use in our society.  Similarly, Deputy O'Donoghue's proposal for a national forum to combat drugs has great potential to make a substantial contribution to the fight against drug addiction.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, the primary responsibility to plan and implement an all out war on drug abuse rests with the Minister for Justice and her Cabinet colleagues. While the Minister admitted the gravity and urgency of the current position, her lack of specific proposals to date has been extremely disappointing.  If, for some reason, she is not in a position to introduce such proposals to meet the escalating problem of drug abuse, she has a moral obligation to accept the well thought out proposals of the Opposition parties.</P>
    <P>I fervently hope the Minister will awake fully to the major challenge we face in dealing with drug abuse.  We urgently need twin policies to effectively tackle the problem.  On the one hand, we must make an all out effort to win the war against well organised and ruthless drug dealers and, on the other, ensure that all possible services are put in place to rehabilitate drug addicts and to prevent more vulnerable young people from falling into the clutches of this disastrous habit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues in Fianna Fáil for allocating some of their time to me.  I am always reluctant <Col N="263" /> to prepare a speech for Private Members' time because I do not know if I will be allowed one or ten minutes to contribute.  I am glad to note I have been allocated a fair share of time tonight.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputy O'Donnell and her colleagues in the Progressive Democrats on a comprehensive motion which I am happy to support.  I cannot support the Government amendment because it states that &ldquo;the Government supports the measures taken by the Ministers for Health and Education in the area of education for young people and treatment of drug abusers&rdquo;.  It is clear that in the areas I represent those measures have failed.  The drug problem, particularly in regard to heroin, is spiralling out of control and anybody dealing with it, gardaí, people working in the treatment centres, community activists or people living in the areas affected by heroin, will say clearly and without fear of contradiction that the problem is getting worse.  The measures taken by this and previous Governments have failed and will continue to fail unless the problem is given priority. It has been paid lip service for years in this House and we have been told that it was given top priority by various Ministers for Justice.  However, there is no evidence that what is stated in this House is put into practice by the allocation of sufficient resources, either at a treatment or a Garda level, to deal adequately with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to some points made by the Minister.  She stated that the drugs problem is the single greatest difficulty facing us.  I reject that out of hand.  The single greatest problem facing this country is social inequality and unemployment.  Social inequality, unemployment and the various other problems that are created by mass unemployment feed the drug problem.  They push young people into lives of despair and force them into using drugs like heroin.  To suggest that the drug problem is the source of all our difficulties in <Col N="264" /> society is incorrect.  If we do not attempt to tackle the underlying social inequities in this country and target resources on areas of disadvantage, we will never solve the drug problem, regardless of what measures are taken.  It would be instructive for anybody who disagrees to look at the areas where the use of heroin is concentrated.  It is not concentrated in the affluent middle class areas of any part of the country, urban or rural; it is concentrated in the most disadvantaged urban communities, mainly in Dublin, and the Minister of State is aware of this.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that drug dealing has replaced terrorism.  I hope the Garda resources used to fight terrorism will be transferred for use in the fight against drug pushers.  It is only through harassment by the gardaí of those they know to be pushing drugs such as heroin that the message will be sent that it does no pay to be involved in drug pushing.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that drug units have been established in the city's five Garda divisions and that this approach has enabled the Central Drugs Squad to monitor the activities of drug dealers throughout the city.  That is simply not true.  Drug dealers in my area are not monitored, let alone drug dealers around the city.  Depending on the resources available to a very dedicated drug unit which covers the north city of Dublin, two or three drug dealers, leading figures in this area are monitored. However, they are limited in the manpower available to them.  Other drug dealers throughout the north city, and other areas, are bringing in heroin which is destroying communities, and the lives of young people in the process. The resources available to the gardaí are totally inadequate for monitoring the main heroin dealers in Dublin.  My dealings with gardaí at a local level bear that out.  I do not make any statements in this House that I cannot substantiate. It is not in my interest to do so.</P>
    <P>I want to refer brifly to one of the main sections on which the Minister concentrated in her contribution, namely, seizing the pusher's assets.  The Minister continually referred to the <Col N="265" /> 1994 Act which, unfortunately, is largely confined to cases where proceedings have been instituted against persons for drug trafficking or where the courts are satisfied that proceedings are about to be instituted against persons for drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>This is a key area and I hope the Minister will keep it in mind when she announces the measures she intends to take in this area.  Dealers who are clever enough not to allow the gardaí to obtain evidence that will lead to them being charged are buying property, cars, going on foreign holidays and have accounts in banks containing large amounts of money.  All this information is known to the gardaí but there is a lack of co-ordination between the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare because most of these people continue to make a laughing stock of everybody by collecting their weekly social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>An attempt should be made to co-ordinate the activities of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Welfare and the gardaí with a view to targeting these individuals, the majority of whom are known to the gardaí.  If that happened it would deprive them of their profits but, unfortunately, it is not being done and I am not sure why.  This solution has been put forward by me and other Deputies at various times over the past year or two and I do not believe it would be difficult to implement, but it must be done because these dealers are becoming more clever.  They are using other people to do their dirty work.  The minor people are being caught and the main dealers are making huge profits and getting away with their crimes.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Eastern Health Board drug co-ordinating committee. I find that intriguing because I am not aware of the existence of this body.  I am aware of a body similar to the one mentioned by the Minister that has been set up by the Inner City Organisations Network and I wonder if the Minister is confusing what the local community in the north city centre has set up on its own initiative with an Eastern Health Board committee.  It is <Col N="266" /> nothing of that sort.  The co-ordinating committee to which the Minister refers was established by the local community and activists in the north inner city.  The Garda, the Department of Justice, the drug treatment centre, the education sector and voluntary agencies are involved in it.  It is quite reprehensible of the Minister to claim that an arm of the State was responsible for establishing a body that was set up and is being run by local community activists.</P>

    <P>One could be excused for thinking that nothing has been happening and that we are not registering success in our battle against drugs.  It is well to remind ourselves that the authorities have had considerable successes in recent times.  In January there were two significant seizures of heroin in Dublin, one seizure involving 142 grammes and the second involving 80 grammes of the drug.  In February there was one substantial seizure of 400 grammes of heroin in Dublin, an important seizure of <Col N="267" /> over 5,000 estasy tablets in Limerick, a major cocaine find of 20 kilogrammes in Clare and an additional seizure of 1,000 grammes of amphetamines in Cork.  In March there were two seizures of heroin in Dublin, one involving 82 grammes and the second involving 76 grammes and in addition, there were two major seizures of cannabis in Rosslare, one case involving 20 kilogrammes and a second case of five kilogrammes.  In April there was the biggest seizure of heroin made so far this year, 493 grammes were seized in Dublin, there were five major ecstasy seizures and 50,000 tablets were seized in one operation in Dublin, 30,000 tablets were seized in Cork, 5,000 in Limerick and over 5,000 tablets were seized in a second operation in Dublin and over 2,600 were seized in a second operation in Cork.  In addition there were two major seizures of cannabis, including the record seizure of 2,000 kilogrammes, in Dublin docks and 70 kilogrammes in Cork.  In May we have had so far three major seizures of cannabis, 68 kilogrammes seized in the Rosslare-Wexford area, 380 kilogrammes were seized in Shannon and ten kilogrammes were seized at Dublin Airport last Sunday. That is a list of successful seizure since this Government took office.  I am not suggesting that this is enough.  Much more requires to be done and more will be done but do not let anyone doubt the determination and commitment of this Government to come to grips with this problem.  The Minister for Justice has made her commitment clear and the Taoiseach has gone out of his way to emphasise his and the Government's commitment to tackling this problem in a fundamental way. I do not want anyone to try to detract from that commitment and determination.</P>
    <P>The only advice I can give the Opposition in the circumstances is to await the comprehensive proposals which the Minister has promised will be ready shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to say a few word on this most important topic which my colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, has brought before this House.  It is no exaggeration to say that the widepread drugs problem which afflicts us today and the closely associated problem of crime which it directly causes on such a broad scale throughout the country is a major national emergency, which we ignore at our peril.  When this country was afflicted by serious subversion at various times, the special detective unit of the Garda Síochána which was built up through the country to counteract that subversion was quite successful, I am aware, as a former Minister for Justice, of the substantial resources that had to be devoted to countering subversion.  I regard the problem of drug importation and distribution as no less harmful to our country and the whole of society than subversion ever was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I too greatly welcome the recent seizures of large quantities of drugs by the Garda and the Customs, however we are told, and it may well be correct, that substantial as these seizures have been they may be only the tip of the iceberg and may represent not more than 10 per cent of the drugs coming in and being distributed here.  We should look on these recent successful seizures not with any feeling of complacency, as we have just had from the Minister of State but as an indication of the vast volume of illegal narcotics to which our society is being exposed.  It should encourage the Government and all of us to seek the diversion of more and more of the resources of the Garda, Customs and the Naval Service to tackling this problem. In the past we have sometimes tried to comfort ourselves by fostering the illusion that drugs are mainly imported and distributed by foreigners but recent finds of large quantities of drugs and associated money in the past <Col N="269" /> week or so in Shannon and east County Limerick belie that belief.  While the treatment of drug addicts individually and collectively is important and must be improved the real kernel of this problem lies with the importers and distributors. These people are the foulest beings in our society deserving, on conviction, exemplary punishment.  They have hugely enriched themselves and continue to do so at the expense of the health and frequently of the lives of many of our young people.</P>
    <P>This motion calls for stronger laws against such people and I believe the laws should reflect a minimum sentence of at least ten years for such an offence by an importer or by a pusher.  Society would be better off if many of these people never walked in freedom on our streets again.  The extent of their crime deserves such punishment.  Frequently in the past 25 years we have expressed extreme outrage at many of the murderous atrocities carried out by the IRA and loyalist terrorists and have expressed the view that those who perpetrated them should never be released from prison.  Is the moral culpability of drug pushers any less than that of the IRA or of other terrorists?</P>
    <P>I am sorry to see the Government amendment drafted on traditionally complacent lines.  It betokens no sense of urgency and should not be supported by a majority of Members in this House. An example of such complacency is the official condoning of the fact that half the inmates of Mountjoy Prison are using drugs while they are there.  The introduction of those drugs could be stopped overnight.  Instead their introduction into the prison is condoned and rather disgracefuly is seen as a method of keeping potentially disruptive prisoners under control.  They are relatively calm because they are going around like zombies most of the time so heavily are they under the influence of drugs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already heard in all too clear detail the awful horrors and evil perpetrated by drug pushers in our society.  I emphasise the dangers to young people and how badly we need to <Col N="270" /> co-ordinate efforts between the Department of Justice, Health and Education. The Minister of State has what might be described as the unenviable task of trying to co-ordinate services.  It is passing the buck from Department to Deparment and he will find himself on a merry-go-round between the three of them.  The Department of Education has not faced up to the problem and I was very disappointed with the response of the Minister for Justice when she spoke about education.</P>
      <P>In the primary school system drug abuse should be dealt with in the stay safe programme, which should be mandatory at primary level.  We need to give young children a sense of worth and self-value.  Just as in the case of bullying they should feel free to seek help and reject advances made to them. We have not addressed the problem at secondary level.  The Minister mentioned the post-primary substance abuse prevention programme &ldquo;On my Two Feet&rdquo; launched last October.  It is being disseminated to post-primary schools at present which does not smack of any great sense of urgency on the part of the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gregory dealt with the problem of heroin addiction.  There is substance abuse in all areas of society and not just in disadvantaged urban communities although the problem is worse there.  The drug ecstasy is found in all walks of life.  My constituency would be considered a middle class and perhaps well off one although that is not quite true.  I have spoken to students in many schools and they tell me just how easy it is to get drugs.  If you see a group of children gathered in an estate in the city your immediate suspicion should be that there are drugs available there.  They are in school corridors in the city.  That is an acknowledged fact and it is not just in the school corridors of urban disadvantaged communities.  It is in every area of the city.  My children go into town on a Saturday afternoon.  If they go to Dún Laoghaire on a Saturday afternoon they know exactly who they can ask about drugs.  Children have no difficulty obtaining drugs, from hash to ecstasy and heroin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="271" /> We must spell out the facts about drug abuse in graphic detail.  I was discussing with school children recently the present media campaign on smoking. With no disrespect to the advertising agency, this is supposed to be a cool campaign and the children who do not smoke are the cool ones.  The children said a similar campaign in regard to drug abuse might be very good but will not work because they need to be told the effects of drug abuse, the dangers of HIV from sharing needles and to be told explicitly that they can die.  I do not say that out of my wisdom but from talking to young people who know about it.  We can talk about youth groups, the adults who led them, experts and so on but the real experts are the youngsters.  Drugs are freely available to them every single day.  I want children to be more wary.  I want the Minister for Education to be proactive and to have a greater sense of urgency about what is being done.  It is not good enough for any Minister to be passive.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed to the debate which our motion facilitated.  If the House were a House of representatives with clout and courage, Deputies who compared the Government amendment with our motion could not vote down our motion because it is a list of achieveable measures which could be taken by the Government.</P>
      <P>The Government motion reflects a lack of urgency, inertia, complacency and failure to respond to the debate in a strategic and positive way.  This is not a matter of Opposition politics.  There is consensus that our drugs problem constitute an emergency.  We have lifted the state of emergency in relation to terrorist violence but it has been replaced with the drugs emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to contributions last night but all we had from the Government was procrastination: &ldquo;the matter is being considered; I will bring forward proposals to Government shortly; we are happy with the resources at present being allocated to this emergency.&rdquo;<Col N="272" /> Basically it was a masterpiece of <i>mañana</i> from beginning to end.  In some cases the Minister's speech was technically incorrect, as Deputy Gregory pointed out in relation to resources in terms of specialist people in the drugs squad.  I spoke to members of the drugs squad and there is a palpable sense of despondency among the squad that they do not have adequate resources.  One unit has been operating without a detective sergeant for the last year.  It is a disaster. None of these issues was responded to.  I hoped to hear a realistic response from the Minister last night.</P>
    <P>I raised sections 23 and 24 of the 1994 Act which allows the High Court to restrain the assets of people being investigated for drug trafficking.  This power was passed by the House after much debate and vested in the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Only two orders have been made to restrain such assets. We do not know how successful those applications were.  The Minister said she has no role in what the Director of Public Prosecutions does &mdash; more wringing of hands and abdication of responsibility.</P>
    <P>From the time the Minister took office I cannot point to one substantive measure which she introduced or passed in the House.  She announced there would be constitutional reform of bail law but that has since been retracted as a result of the bleating of the Labour Party.  The Minister said there is a range of policies which she will shortly bring before Government but we have powers, under legislation passed in the House, to take action.  I outlined some of those last evening.  The Garda have enormous powers to search and seize under the Animal Remedies Act, 1993 for instance, but existing powers are not being used.  The Minister is full of bluster, procrastination and waffle.  The Government is marked.  It is a Government of charters, task forces, review groups, extra committees which we do not need and superfluous Ministries.  It is all sizzle and no sausage.  It is a Government which is spin doctored to the point of distraction.  If it had something substantial to say or do or real <Col N="273" /> action to take which would make a difference there would be no need for the expensive plethora of spin doctors it employs.  The Taoiseach said he intends to raise the drugs problem at the next intergovernmental conference.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Teachers' Early Retirement Package Claim.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this issue to urge the Minister for Education to take a fresh initiative to resolve the impasse between the Government and the teacher unions on their claim for an early retirement package.  The Minister should bring all sides around the table in an effort to resolve this dispute, which if left unresolved, will lead to the collapse of partnership, one of the fundamental principles of the White Paper on Education.  It is imperative that the Minister take this initiative now. Nobody, is anxious for industrial action in our schools, least of all the teachers who feel this is the last resort following two years of prevarication, obfuscation and foot dragging by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Because of this dispute in-service training courses related to the introduction of new leaving certificate syllabi have had to be cancelled and the introduction of these new syllabi in September is now in serious jeopardy.</P>
      <P>The withdrawal by teachers from and non co-operation with departmental committees will clearly disrupt and slow down the implementation of many of the proposals in the White Paper.  This dispute also has the potential to cause division among the partners in education. We have already seen signs of that.  This would be regrettable and would shatter that fundamental plank of the White Paper, the principle of partnership.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Minister that it is almost ten years ago to the day when a former Minister for Education, Mrs. Gemma Hussey, was in dispute with the teacher unions.  That was an unnecessary dispute.  It is regrettable that the Minister seems to be going down the same road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in my contribution on the White Paper, we need to avoid unnecessarily undermining the teaching profession because the teachers are an essential prerequisite to any teaching programme in our schools.  I regret the selected leaks on the integrity of the school year, which were designed to <Col N="277" /> undermine teachers prior to the launch of the White Paper.  One got the impression that there was an orchestrated attempt to sully their names in the public domain.  That is regrettable because teachers are essential to the delivery of any education programme.  It is my understanding that the gap between the two sides is quite small.  A potential solution is there, the costs of which would be within the parameters of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  It is important to stress that this claim is being pursued under the umbrella of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> which facilitated the pursuance of this issue along with others.  Failure to resolve this dispute could also have implications for the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> itself and for the social partnership agreements.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had the actuarial figures prepared by the teacher unions for a number of weeks.  Surely she must have come to some conclusions arising from her examination of these figures. It is time to bring these conclusions to the negotiating table.  There have been many misleading comments and statements about this dispute, particularly about the number of teachers who would avail of the option and the cost of such a scheme.  Not all teachers will avail of the option of early retirement. It is interesting to note that only 40 to 50 teachers a year avail of the existing scheme for primary teachers.  The vast majority of teachers would not be in a position to afford early retirement because of domestic and family commitments. Many have no particular wish to retire.  The teachers' claim is to have the early retirement option available to them.  They are satisfied that the costs of such a scheme are well within the parameters of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a solemn promise two years ago at the teacher union conferences to deliver an early retirement package and received a standing ovation for making that promise.  A year later she made another promise to have <Col N="278" /> negotiations on an early retirement package concluded by 30 September 1994.  She failed to keep those promises. Real talks only began last February. Their collapse before Easter marred what was in any event a hasty launch of the White Paper.  The ploy to launch the White Paper before the teacher conferences to divert attention from the early retirement issue did not work.  It was a cynical ploy unworthy of the Minister.  Unless this dispute is resolved quickly the world of Irish education will be divisive, troubled and strife-torn.  We need to replace political incompetence, which has dogged this dispute, with some degree of competence and leadership on the part of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach) Niamh Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of commenting on the current position in regard to the matter raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Discussions on a number of teacher union claims, including early retirement, were facilitated over a period of six weeks before Easter, by Mr. Seán Healy, director of the advisory service, Labour Relations Commission.  I appointed Mr. Healy as facilitator when talks on the claims broke down at a meeting of the Conciliation Council for Teachers on 10 February 1995.</P>
      <P>I want to stress that under the terms of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> pay agreement, the teachers unions have already accepted that their early retirement claim can only be negotiated with other claims as part of a package and in return for change and flexibility from teachers.</P>
      <P>In reply to questions on 3 May 1995 I put it on the record in this House that a very comprehensive and balanced set of proposals were offered to the teacher unions before the talks broke down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The offer comprised: a general provision of retirement at age 55 with 35 years service for post-primary teachers to bring them into line with primary teachers; early retirement with added years for teachers who cannot function at acceptable levels of professional performance because of stress or for other reasons; early retirement, with added <Col N="279" /> years for surplus teachers; reduction of the common basic scale for teachers from a 26 to a 24 point scale; phased payment of the pass degree allowance to teachers without a degree; payment of the H.Dip. allowance as well as a degree allowance to teachers holding four year concurrent degrees; increases of up to £2,500 and £1,700 respectively in allowances for principals and vice-principals of larger schools; payment of a once-off lump sum to all current post holders; full recognition for pension purposes, for existing teachers, of capitation and supernumerary service in convent and monastery schools.</P>
    <P>I still consider that the overall package of measures outlined represents a generous response to the teachers' claims.  It is a very substantial offer which addresses many of the issues raised by teacher unions, including burn out and stress.  I regret that negotiations on a wide range of issues broke down on the single issue of giving all teachers an entitlement of extra years of pensionable service.</P>
    <P>Disagreement arose between the sides on the cost and funding of a proposal put by the teachers during facilitation talks and also in regard to its implications for pension cost in the wider public service.  In response to a request from the facilitator the Department of Finance provided actuarial costings of the teacher unions' proposal. These costings were sent to the teacher unions.</P>
    <P>As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, actuarial costing of improved pension provisions is a very complex issue and costings depend on the quality of the data available and assumptions on a range of variable factors.  An offer by the official side to have a study of the unions' proposal by an independent team of experts, including actuarial consultants, was rejected by the teacher unions.  Costings produced by both sides have since been exchanged and are currently being examined.</P>
    <P>I have already stated that the teacher unions have accepted that the claims which are the subject of industrial action <Col N="280" /> must be processed under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>. Paragraph 5 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> pay agreement commits employers, trade unions and employees to promoting industrial harmony.  The agreement precludes strikes or any other form of industrial action by trade unions and employees in respect of any matter covered by the agreement where the employer is acting in accordance with the provisions of the agreement.</P>
    <P>By agreement with the teacher unions, claims including the early retirement claim were being processed under clause 2, option A of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> pay agreement. The terms of that clause require that if unions wish to process more than one claim they must seek to negotiate an agreed settlement on a package basis and the package must include contributions by workers to flexibility and change, savings and an improved quality of service.  These contributions have been generally referred to as the <i>quid pro quo</i>.</P>
    <P>The teacher unions have accepted that their early retirement claim has to be negotiated as part of a package settlement of a number of their outstanding claims.  However, they remain somewhat equivocal on the issue of the <i>quid pro quo</i>.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, it is a matter of regret to me that the teacher unions have decided to embark on industrial action in support of their claims.  I particularly regret that strikes will interrupt students' preparation for examinations.</P>
    <P>In addition, the non-attendance at in-service training courses by 7,000 or so post-primary teachers will adversely affect the introduction of the new syllabus at leaving certificate level.  The leaving certificate applied programme may also be affected.  There is general agreement on the need for these developments at senior cycle.  Any delay in their introduction, as a result of the teachers' actions, will be to the detriment of the students.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that talks would resume as soon as possible and I am continuing <Col N="281" /> to explore possibilities of establishing a basis for resumption of talks.  I can assure the House that my officials are available at any time to meet with the teachers' representatives for further discussions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1992 about 51 per cent of those committed to prison or other detention centres had already served at least one prison sentence. Unless we address the issue of rehabilitation seriously we will continue releasing offenders into the community in the knowledge that they will re-offend.  Our prison system will have failed both the offenders and society.</P>
      <P>The issue of rehabilitation is just one aspect of the comprehensive penal reform package which is necessary in order to bring our prison system into the 21st century.  Any discussion of penal reform must address the central question of the purpose of prison.  At present prison is an effective means not just of punishment but of removing offenders from society for a specified period of time, but that is all it is. Rehabilitation is not central to our prison system and the result can be seen in our high rate of re-offending.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the proposals contained in the Justice Department's policy document &ldquo;The Management of Offenders &mdash; a Five Year Plan&rdquo; published last June.  Unfortunately, that document is still largely aspirational.  The present situation is that prisoners who have completed their sentences are simply thrown back into the community.  This debate is timely in the light of the other two debates we had here this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only specialised rehabilitation programme here is the sex offenders' programme in Arbour Hill, a programme which is still in the pilot stage and which to date has treated just nine offenders at a cost of £250,000.  Other prisoners must depend on an overstretched, understaffed and under-resourced probation and welfare service. I am aware that the Minister has <Col N="282" /> taken on board the concerns of the probation service.  I welcome her recent comments in this regard and her commitment to the requirement of additional staff which is long overdue. However, the probation and welfare service was never intended to provide rehabilitation facilities as such.  Until recently their remit was to supervise offenders in the community, to provide a welfare and counselling service to those in the community and their families, and to supervise offenders on early release.  That remit was further developed in the policy document published last June but it still does not encompass all the elements of an effective rehabilitation programme.</P>
    <P>Prison officers and members of the Probation and Welfare Service must be central to any rehabilitation programme but they cannot be expected to carry out such a function in the absence of centralised guidelines, appropriate and ongoing training, adequate resources and an expanded mandate.  I am well aware there are two participants in any rehabilitation programme. As well as ensuring that prison officers are appropriately trained, each prisoner should be assessed before they start their sentence.  Various options for their stay, especially the education options, should be discussed with them at the outset and the implementation of these options should be monitored on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>One of the most disturbing aspects of the current crime rate is the high rate of repeat offending.  Our prison service as presently constituted does little to address this problem.  The prime aim of any rehabilitation service must be to enable prisoners to update their skills with a view to obtaining employment upon their release.  The education facilities offered in prison are scatty and largely unco-ordinated.  Academic and life skills education is not integrated with vocational education.  Some prisons lack the necessary facilities and in many cases prisoners are unable to obtain the vocational qualifications necessary to take up employment.  While the library service has improved in recent years <Col N="283" /> some prison libraries remain closed because of staff shortages.  These are the problems prisoners face while serving their sentence.  They are often magnified upon their release.</P>
    <P>The State's responsibility to prisoners does not end when they complete their sentence.  Despite the efforts of the prison and welfare services, released prisoners are often left to find their feet in the community with little or no help. The effect, especially on long term prisoners, can be devastating and hence the cycle of repeat offending.  To be effective rehabilitation must continue after a prisoner is released.  In this regard further links should be established between the prison service and community services such as the housing office and health board services.</P>
    <P>The possibility of establishing a prison board to manage the day-to-day running of prisons with a parole board to manage the discharge of prisoners is mooted in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>.  I understand the Minister is examining the options in this regard. I look forward to the presentation of her conclusions which should be worth listening to.  I hope before she presents her proposals she consults with the various bodies concerned.  If we are serious about tackling this issue we need to address the question of repeat offending.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter which is timely.  I accept that one of the primary purposes of the prison system, with deterrence and protection of the public, is the rehabilitation of offenders.  The five year plan for the management of offenders sets out a comprehensive programme for the development of services for offenders in order to enable them maintain a more constructive and productive life-style in the community following release.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These proposals include an increase in the number of work and training places and a general improvement in the procedures for the selection and assessment of offenders for individual courses-activities.  The prison education <Col N="284" /> service will place added emphasis on the delivery of a relevant and up-to-date programme.  It is intended to increase the involvement of outside institutions in the delivery of specific courses and to constantly review curricula in order to cater for the specific ongoing needs of offenders.  It is also intended to combine the work-training and education programme with an element of positive sentence management in order to encourage offenders to avail of the available facilities and services.</P>
    <P>Recreational, medical, psychiatric and psychological services are also vital components in the rehabilitative process. There is a commitment in particular to providing those with a background of drug-alcohol abuse with the appropriate treatment in order to enable them to tackle their addiction, which in many cases is the root cause of their involvement in crime.</P>
    <P>The probation and welfare service, which is charged with the overall responsibility nationally for guiding offenders, both in prison and in the community, towards a non-offending life-style, is to be bolstered by the recruitment of additional staff and the allocation of extra resources.  This will enable it to provide the necessary backup services both in the prisons and in the community, to encourage and assist offenders towards meaningful rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that this is all in the future.  On the contrary, rehabilitation programmes are already in operation throughout the system.  For example, in this context, Cork Prison which is in the Deputy's constituency, has taken something of a lead in terms of rehabilitative programmes for offenders.  The prison is currently running a programme in conjunction with a number of outside agencies which aims to exert a positive rehabilitative influence on offenders both during their time in custody but, more important, on their release into society.  This programme involves the joint participation of both the offender and his partner.</P>
    <P>Cork Prison has also taken the initiative in introducing a unique programme which is aimed at juveniles in the 13-15 <Col N="285" /> age brackets who are considered by the Garda to be at risk of becoming involved in crime.  The youth encounter scheme, as it is known, given the youths a glimpse of the less glamourous aspects of prison life in the hope that it will deter them from future involvement in crime.  One could say that the scheme operates on the principle that prevention is better than cure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent survey by RGDATA, the retail grocers association, makes chilling and grim reading. It showed that one in three shops experienced violent crime in the past two years and that one in four shops experienced more than one violent crime.  Some experienced more than five annually and over 40 retailers were constant victims of gangs which attacked almost on a weekly basis.</P>
      <P>Violent attacks on newsagents and grocery shops cost the trade an estimated £11 million in the past two years. When this is added to the £60 million lost through other crime, namely, shoplifting and fraud, and the countless man hours lost by staff injured in raids it becomes all too apparent that the Minister for Justice and the Government should address the problem as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>It was very interesting to read the statement issued by Deputy Eric Byrne of Democratic Left on the problem.  He stated that it was &ldquo;just one more indicator of a crime-wave which an under resourced and under staffed Garda Síochána are being asked to battle with one hand behind their backs&rdquo;.  Has it ever occurred to Deputy Byrne that his party is in Government and has one full Minister and a hybrid Minister in the Cabinet?  I suggest that he direct his comments at them and the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only response from the Minister for Justice to this extremely serious problem for members of RGDATA appears to be &ldquo;shop at Supershop&rdquo;.  I <Col N="286" /> submit that this is an entirely inadequate response to a problem which is quickly getting out of control.</P>
    <P>Recognising the seriousness of the problem Fianna Fáil introduced a perfectly constitutional Bill to restrict bail for habitual offenders and to impose stringent conditions on these offenders when admitted to bail.  The Bill was defeated by a Minister for Justice and a Government which shamefully failed to publish a Bill of its own.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil strongly supports the RGDATA demand for an urgent reform of the bail system which prevents criminals from re-offending while awaiting trial.  We acted and the Government prevaricated.  That prevarication has recently been replaced by pious platitudes and promises of things to come.</P>
    <P>RGDATA very correctly points out that there is a need for a review of the policy of concurrent sentencing.  While there is a provision in Irish criminal law that consecutive sentences be imposed on people convicted of committing crime while on bail, it is doubtful if this is being rigorously applied in courts.  I sought to ascertain the true position by way of Dáil question, but obfuscation won the day again.</P>
    <P>It is a sad reflection on our ability to beat the crime menace, when a retailer says that he has every form of security, including alarm, cameras, shutters, safes and ram bars, yet his five shops have been subjected to seven armed raids, ten needle attacks, 17 knife attacks, two shootings, 15 iron bar attacks and 20 hammer attacks.</P>
    <P>It must be abundantly clear to everybody but the Minister and this rainbow Coalition Government that our bail laws need reform, that concurrent sentencing has to be reviewed and that there must be an immediate clampdown on the illegal sale of cigarettes on the streets which represent the market for the proceeds of violent attacks on shops. In addition, I am now calling on the Minister to set up a special Garda task force to protect newsagents and shopkeepers from thugs and villains roaming the streets.  It is abundantly clear that extreme violence will drive shopkeepers <Col N="287" /> and newsagents out of business and while the Minister is giving &ldquo;close consideration&rdquo; to the RGDATA survey, robberies and assaults are happening on a daily and nightly basis.  The sheer viciousness and cowardly nature of these assaults is illustrated by the weapons being used against vulnerable people.  They include sharpened chisels, hurleys, golf clubs, planks-sticks, hammers, sprays-liquids, slash hooks, and of course verbal threats.  This type of assault is not confined to large cities. Our outlying rural towns are now subjected to nightly and indeed daily visitations by criminal gangs.  Criminals see rural towns and villages as &ldquo;soft options&rdquo; together with grocery shops.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty in standing up in this House and repeatedly putting forward positive proposals to the Minister for Justice, even if they are ignored. However, even if the Minister, for political reasons, wishes to continue to ignore me, I earnestly request tonight that she not ignore the plea of RGDATA who, like me, represents ordinary people trying to make a living in the midst of a crime wave.  This is a Government on probation intent on reoffending the Irish public.  It is a Government which commits the crime of inactivity, a Government of coalition parties which go surety for each other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to Deputy O'Donoghue and I can only marvel at the extent to which law and order deteriorated during the years of Fianna Fáil rule.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, met representatives of RGDATA last Friday, 12 May 1995 when she received a copy of the organisation's report Violence in Shops which is based on research carried out over the past two years.  At the meeting, RGDATA raised a number of important issues with the Minister, including the need to amend the current law on bail, concurrent sentencing, the pressures on prison spaces and the need to clamp down on the illegal sale of cigarettes.  The Minister was appraised of the main findings of the survey.  She <Col N="288" /> was extremely concerned, and the Government is concerned with the findings, especially the extent to which staff working in shops have experienced violent crime and the indications that a certain level of the crime was carried out by people apparently under the influence of drugs.  The meeting was extremely constructive and the Minister promised RGDATA that the report would be closely considered in framing her ongoing response to crime.  The Government regards it as absolutely unacceptable that people going about their lawful business should be subjected to attack by criminals.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice discussed the findings of the report with the Garda Commissioner who has confirmed that the Garda is taking strong action to address this increasing level of attacks. It reports a number of successful arrests of culprits particularly in the past few months.</P>
      <P>Tackling crime is a Government priority, especially drug-related crime, in which a sizeable number of other crimes take root.  As the House will be aware, the Minister for Justice will shortly bring comprehensive proposals on the drugs problem to the Government. These proposals have already circulated to all relevant Departments and I can assure the House that they will receive priority Government attention.</P>
      <P>There is already a long list of legislation which the Garda use on a daily basis, including the following Acts: the Offences Against The Person Act, 1861, as amended, the Larceny Act, 1916, the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984, the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, and the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.</P>
      <P>The Government has made it clear that the drugs problem deserves the very highest priority, not only at national but also at European and wider international levels.  In this regard, the House can be assured that the Government will make drugs a major issue during the Irish Presidency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this issue on the Adjournment.  I wish to remove the major plank of the Minister's defence, which seems to be his defence on all issues raised, that Fianna Fáil was in Government for seven years and did not deal with the matter.  Fine Gael is now in Government and the Minister is charged with responsibility to tackle the problems I am about to raise.</P>
      <P>To say that arrangements for family law hearings are in a state of crisis is a charitable understatement.  In the first 12 months after the passing of the Judicial Separation Act, 1989, there were more than 1,000 applications before the Circuit Court directly arising from the Act.  Business has increased steadily since.  For example, in the Dublin Circuit Family Court alone, the number of applications for judicial separation each year is now in excess of 400.  This new branch of law with all its attendant problems and difficulties was simply loaded on to the existing legal system without any commensurate funding to provide the facilities and personnel to cope with it properly, and successive governments were responsible for that.</P>
      <P>The physical condition of many courts outside Dublin is not appropriate for family cases.  There are many Circuit and District Court venues which do not have adequate space to accommodate family law cases.  On many occasions opposing spouses are left seated opposite each other on benches in cold and draughty corridors, as there are no proper waiting room facilities. Adequate facilities for consultation between lawyers and clients are the exception rather than the rule.  Many Circuit Court houses have insufficient lighting, leaking roofs, ill fitting windows and inadequate heating and some of them do not even have toilets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Circuit Courts are jammed with a backlog of family law cases.  The number of judges available to deal with family law hearings is grossly inadequate and, in many cases, the judge is totally <Col N="290" /> unfitted to deal with this sensitive area. Even where that is not true, judges are forced to make the impossible choice between brief and hurried hearings or intolerable delays.  In many cases hasty judgments are made after the briefest hearing.</P>
    <P>Large numbers of cases which come before the courts would be better addressed by some mechanism other than court determination, perhaps counselling, mediation or conciliation, but unfortunately the system does not lend itself to that.  In Dublin where the problems are less acute than elsewhere there is a waiting list of 15 months between the time a judicial separation application is made and when it finally comes to be heard.  In Limerick, the backlog is so great that last week Judge Kevin O'Higgins was faced with 59 cases to resolve on a one day sitting.  In Trim 69 cases were listed for hearing in the Circuit Court on the last family law sitting day and the corresponding number in Dundalk was 88.</P>
    <P>It is salutary and sobering to consider the circumstances of the applicants, almost invariably women, during these waiting periods.  Many are living in fear because they feel that if they apply for a barring order the evidence will be insufficient to enable them to succeed. Even those who are not living in fear of violence are often suffering great mental cruelty and unhappiness.  Some have abandoned the home and are living from day to day in women's refuges. Many are existing on social welfare.</P>
    <P>If the Government intends to introduce divorce into the present system, chaos will be piled upon chaos and the system will break down irrevocably. Does the Government intend to implement the recommendations of the recent Law Reform Commission report on family law prior to the introduction of divorce?</P>
    <P>I will not outline those recommendations, time precludes me from so doing.  Reform will have to be accompanied by the appointment of at least eight Circuit Court judges to deal specifically with family law, and a massive transfer of resources to upgrade and improve facilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> However, if these steps are not taken prior to the introduction of divorce and the explosion of new business to which it will inevitably give rise, then a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the forthcoming divorce referendum will not give people the right to seek divorce.  It will only give them the illusion they have such a right and for many it will be a theoretical right only.</P>

      <P>Members of the Government do not need a lecture from Deputy O'Dea on their responsibilities.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very concerned by the level of delays in the hearing of cases in the courts and particularly by delays in the hearing of family law cases.  The Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989 transferred the majority of family law business in the courts to the Circuit Court.  This factor, combined with changing social attitudes to marital breakdown, has led to a dramatic increase in the volume of family law business in the Circuit Court.  For example, in the 1988-89 legal year, that is the year prior to coming into operation of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, there were only 68 applications made to the Circuit Court for divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> while in the 1993-94 legal year <Col N="292" /> there were 2,806 applications for Judicial Separation under the 1989 Act.</P>
    <P>This very substantial increase in family law cases, combined with a concurrent increase in civil and criminal business in the Circuit Court, has resulted in serious delays in the hearing of family law business.  These delays vary from one Circuit Court venue to another and are particularly long in the larger urban venues, in some of which there are delays of up to one year.  Delays in the hearing of court cases are a very serious matter and this is particularly true in family law cases where the delicate nature of the business being transacted has life long repercussions for all members of the family concerned.  I am convinced that the present level of family law cases coming before the courts will be sustained and, indeed, may increase.  This Government is committed to addressing the problem of delays in the courts and I am committed to using the resources available to provide an efficient and effective court service.  A review of the legislative provisions of the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1994 is being carried out to ensure that the measures it contains adequately address the need to tackle the backlog of cases for hearing in the courts.</P>
    <P>This Government has also given a commitment to take the steps necessary to strengthen the family courts and in this context I am awaiting with interest the report of the Law Reform Commission on the hearing of family law cases.  The Commission is examining various aspects of family law including the type of Judicial or court structure most appropriate to deal with the matters which fall under a general heading of family law.  As soon as the final report issues it will receive my immediate attention.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 18 May 1995.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Minister for Transport Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry) Michael Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the end of January this year the European Commission published their Green Paper entitled &ldquo;For a European Energy Policy&rdquo; which will be considered by Energy Ministers at the forthcoming Council meeting on 1 June 1995.  The key aspects of the Green Paper are:</P>
      <P>&mdash; an examination of the principal challenges with which the Community will be confronted in future years, in particular competitiveness, security of supply and the environment;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; the identification of the geopolitical constants and constraints that <Col N="122" /> result from the pressures of economic and social cohesion and from the requirements of environmental protection;</P>
    <P>&mdash; an assessment of the impact of potential major developments such as technological changes;</P>
    <P>&mdash; an analysis of the current energy situation and future prospects with a view to the definition of the main principles which should govern future Community energy policy and its implementation; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; an analyses of the current responsibilities of the Community in the energy field.</P>
    <P>The objective of the Green Paper is to launch an energy policy discussion and allow all interested parties to contribute to the debate.  As a result of this debate, the Commission proposes to publish a White Paper later this year which will establish a working plan for energy in the Community.</P>
    <P>Ireland welcomes this approach and my Department has circulated the Green Paper to key sectors of the energy industry for comment and information. The purpose of the paper is not to look for national advantage or disadvantage but to examine the analyses and conclusions in order to participate in an informed manner in the consultative process which will be necessary for the preparation of a White Paper.</P>
    <P>In the discussions to date one of our objectives has been and will be to embrace Irish Energy Policy goals within the overall framework.  Matters of importance to us are:</P>
    <P>&mdash; the supply of a choice of fuels to consumers as efficiently as possible, at internationally competitive prices, taking account of supply security, socio-economic and environmental considerations;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the consumption of this energy as efficiently as possible, and</P>
    <P>&mdash; the production of as much of national energy requirements from indigenous sources as is economically possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="123" /> We also consider that determination of member states competence relative to the EU Commission in the energy field should respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and common action should only be considered where national policies alone are not capable of delivering on the common EU objectives and where such action is necessary in the interests of economic and social cohesion.  Areas for possible EU action include the completion of the internal market, trans-European energy networks, research and development, financial support for energy efficiency measures and the promotion and development of alternative renewable sources of energy and third country relations.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 16, 20 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>The feasibility of an electrical inter-connector to the United Kingdom has been examined by ESB.  While there is no technical difficulty in such a connection, the economics are unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The estimated costs of an interconnector lie between £370 million and £450 million and there is, at this time, no decision to proceed with the project, or to seek EU assistance.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the figures available that a large power station up to 500MW, could be built and located in Ireland with local value-added and employment here for less than the cost of an inter-connector to the UK.</P>
      <P>The restoration of the North/South interconnector was completed last month and it is now operational.</P>
      <P>The proposed Northern Ireland to Scotland interconnector is at present the subject of a public inquiry in Northern Ireland.  If they get the go-ahead for this interconnector, Northern Ireland Electricity expect it to be operational towards the end of 1997.  This will then link the electricity system in the Republic to the wider UK grid and will obviate the need for a direct link to the UK at this time.</P>

      <P>I have recently instructed the Irish National Petroleum Corporation to restore the oil terminal at Whiddy Island County Cork, to operational status by installing one single point mooring for the discharge and loading of crude oil.  It is hoped that substantive work on the project will commence on the island next month and will be completed during 1995.</P>
      <P>The new facility will provide ready access to oil stocks already stored at the terminal in the event of a supply disruption, and will enable the stocks there to be augmented.  It will also facilitate possible additional storage and oil trading activities at Whiddy by third parties.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 41 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>At present, my Department provides an annual subsidy for a passenger ferry service from Rossaveal to the Aran Islands.  The 1995 service is being provided by Island Ferries Teo.</P>
      <P>In order to establish more precisely the passenger transport requirements between Aran Islands and Rossaveal, my Department has commissioned a short independent study of the Rossaveal service including an evaluation of how best the transport needs of the island can be met.  The study is under way and it is expected that it will be completed next month.</P>
      <P>Since the passenger ferry service from Rossaveal was introduced in 1991 the level of usage would appear to have been very low.  In such circumstances, it may be that the transport needs of the islanders, particularly in winter months, can be more efficiently met by a reorganisation of the existing service and an improved combination of air and ferry services.  The possibilities in this regard will be evaluated in the study. I am conscious of the importance of efficient access transport services for the economic and social development of the islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of how best to meet the access transport and other requirements of offshore islands, including Gaeltacht ones, is also being considered at present by the Inter Departmental Committee on Island Development under the Chairmanship of my colleague, Deputy Donal Carey, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, with special responsibility for co-ordinating the Government's commitment to western development and rural renewal and <Col N="127" /> for the development and improvement of living conditions on our off shore islands.  The study of the Rossaveal service will also be utilised by the inter-departmental committee in the context of its wider work on island development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 35, 57 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that last week the UK Government published a White Paper on the conclusions of its year-long Nuclear Energy Review.  The review focused mainly on the future prospects for nuclear power, including plans to privatise, during 1996, some parts of the UK's nuclear generating industry.</P>
      <P>The White Paper has confirmed the UK Government's commitment to nuclear power, provided it remains competitive and is able to maintain rigorous standards of safety and environmental protection.  The two nuclear electricity generating companies, Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, will be merged and part privatised. Seven of the more modern nuclear reactors within those companies, called advanced gas-cooled reactors and the new pressurised water reactor at Size-well, will be transferred into the private sector.  The older MAGNOX stations and their liabilities will remain in public ownership under a new Government-owned, stand-alone company, which will ultimately be integrated with British Nuclear Fuels plc. (BNFL).  The White Paper states that there will be no other change in the status of BNFL &mdash; it remains publicly-owned along with its facilities at Sellafield.</P>
      <P>The White Paper emphasises that there is no case for state intervention or public funds for the construction of new nuclear plants.  It also states that payments to Nuclear Electric from the existing fossil fuel levy on electricity consumers will cease at the time of privatisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a routine meeting last week in Dublin of the Ireland-UK Contact Group on Nuclear Safety, officials of my Department emphasised the Government's concern about the safety of nuclear installations in the UK.  The UK officials at the meeting stated that safety was of paramount importance and would not be compromised, irrespective <Col N="129" /> of whether nuclear power stations were in public or private ownership.  They said that a rigorous system of nuclear licensing and regulation for ensuring a high level of safety, reliability and transparency would be applied.  I can assure the House that my Department and the Radiological Protection Institute will monitor the situation closely.</P>
    <P>In relation to future prospects for nuclear generation, I understand that during the review, the nuclear industry argued the case for more nuclear power plants.  However, in the White Paper the UK Government concluded that there was no case for state support or guarantees to one form of electricity over another.  The review has also concluded that private finance is unlikely to be available at present for new nuclear construction.</P>
    <P>I welcome these conclusions and hope they lead the new privatised entity to turn its attention to alternative sources of energy for electricity generation.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House this Government will continue to oppose any expansion of the nuclear industry in the UK.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the European Commission Proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision on the Development of a Trans-European Airport Network.</P>
      <P>This proposal provided that the Trans-European Airport Network shall comprise airports of common interest situated within the territory of the Community which are open to commercial air traffic and which comply with certain specified criteria.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>As the ESB 1994 annual report and accounts have not yet been finalised, I am not in a position to provide the information required by the Deputies in regard to 1994.</P>
      <P>ESB's total investment by way of equity and loans in subsidiaries and associated companies in respect of 1993 was £43.2 million.  The remaining information in respect of 1993 is in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  Certain information of a commercially sensitive nature is not included as it may give an advantage to competitors.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 39 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>At a meeting which I had with the EU Commissioner for Regional Policy, Madame Monika Wulf-Mathies, on 12 April 1995 agreement was reached on the provision of financial assistance of £21 million from EU Structural Funds towards the construction of the new station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that meeting, the Commissioner <Col N="137" /> and I signed a joint memorandum of understanding setting out the conditions for the provision of £21 million for the construction of the new station.</P>
    <P>The conditions set out in this memorandum concern the achievement of job targets outlined in the power station feasibility study, the development of certain cutaway bogs as wetlands and the use of the latest state-of-the-art proven technology in the operation of the station.  In addition, in order to ensure that there is an overall reduction in CO 2 emissions from all peat fired plants, the Commission has also asked that a programme be agreed with the ESB and Bord na Móna for the phased closure of the older peat stations as they reach the end of their operational lives and for the refurbishment of other stations in order to improve efficiencies from an operational and environmental perspective.</P>

      <P>I confirm that I have given approval for Aer Rianta to make a bid, in conjunction with a leading London financial institution, for a shareholding in Birmingham Airport.</P>
      <P>The bid builds on Aer Rianta's expertise in its core business of airport management and, as such, has a low level of risk attached.  The bulk of the company's investment will be financed from past profits generated by Aer Rianta International, the subsidiary of Aer Rianta which manages the overseas business activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bid has no implications for the Exchequer.  Aer Rianta International's <Col N="138" /> exposure will be limited to the extent of their shareholding.</P>
    <P>Duty free revenues from EU traffic are under threat and could end in 1999. Aer Rianta's corporate strategy includes a plan to develop alternative sources of profit to replace this significant source of revenue.  International activities will be the main source of these profits, should duty free sales within the European Union be abolished. The proposed investment in Birmingham Airport by Aer Rianta International fits in with this strategy.</P>
    <P>A further need for expansion of Aer Rianta's overseas business is the fact that aircraft landing charges and passenger load fees at Irish airports have been frozen since 1987 in order to keep access transport costs into and out of Ireland to the absolute minimum.  This highlights the need for generation of new revenues overseas to support development of the Irish airports.</P>
    <P>It is my policy that the State sponsored bodies, for which I am responsible, should source external strategic partners where appropriate, to allow the full potential of their business activities to be realised and reduce their own exposure.  I was particularly pleased that Aer Rianta succeeded in finding a suitable business partner for the bid for Birmingham Airport.</P>

      <P>The development of Aer Rianta's international business is a matter for the company's subsidiary, Aer Rianta International.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In contrast to many other airport authorities abroad, Aer Rianta provides its own duty free retailing at Dublin, Shannon and Cork Airports, together <Col N="139" /> with airport operational services.  This combination gives the company a key competitive advantage in marketing its services internationally.  Aer Rianta International now provides commercial retailing services in 12 different countries overseas mainly through joint ventures and management contracts.</P>
    <P>Aircraft landing charges and passenger load fees at the three State airports have been frozen since 1987, in the interests of keeping access costs into and out of Ireland to the minimum. Duty free sales within the European Union are due to be abolished in 1999. Taking account of these factors, I have encouraged Aer Rianta to maximise the contribution of their existing overseas commercial units, and to source strategic external partners to allow the full potential of the business to be realised.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear that this expansion must be structured so that it supports the primary requirement to develop the airports here at home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry) Michael Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The risks from the British nuclear industry, particularly Sellafield/THORP, have been identified by the Radiological Protection Institute through the results of its radiation monitoring programme. The institute monitors the levels of contamination of the Irish Sea and has published the results of a series of reports since 1982.  It has found that radioactive contamination decreased with increasing distance from the point of discharge at Sellafield.  It has also found that there have been substantial reductions in the levels of contamination in recent years reflecting reductions in discharges from Sellafield.  The institute has consistently stated that the radiation exposures arising from Sellafield discharges into the Irish Sea do not give rise to a significant health hazard to the Irish public.  It has found that the annual exposure of a heavy consumer of seafood is only a fraction of 1 per cent of the average annual exposure received by a member of the public from all sources of radiation.</P>
      <P>However, Sellafield has caused and, with THORP's commissioning, will continue to cause long-lasting radioactive contamination of the Irish Sea.  I consider that such radioactive pollution of the Irish Sea is objectionable and should be forestalled and eliminated</P>
      <P>Krypton-85 is the principal radionuclide discharged to the atmosphere and the amounts discharged annually will increase with the commissioning of THORP.  However, the institute regards Krypton-85 to be of negligible significance from the point of view of health. The institute monitors the level of Krypton-85 in the air at Dublin and has found that the levels are similar to those found in the northern hemisphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the threat of an accident at Sellafield/THORP, I would remind the Deputy that, in conformity with the Euratom Treaty, the EU Commission has issued a formal opinion that the implementation of the plan for the treatment of radioactive waste at the Sellafield/THORP was not liable, either <Col N="141" /> in normal operation or in an accident of the type and magnitude considered, to result in radioactive contamination, significant from the point of view of health, of the water, soil or airspace of another member state.  Ireland was specifically recognised in the opinion as the nearest State to THORP.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this, the Government considers that Sellafield/THORP poses a serious continuing threat to the health and safety of the Irish people. This is specifically recognised in the Government's policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>.  The Deputy will be aware that I have drawn up a blueprint for action to implement the commitments on Sellafield and the Irish Sea in the policy agreement.  This is currently being considered by an inter-Departmental Committee of Ministers and Officials who will report to the Government on their recommendations.</P>

      <P>The investment which will be effected under the Operational Programme for Transport will be focused on track renewal, £123 million, modern signalling systems, £27 million and rolling stock £125 million.

Projects approved for investment under the programme will be undertaken within the period 1994-99.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the problems arising from the heavy burden of debt carried by many Third World countries.  This is a major issue for the world community and it needs to be tackled at global level.  The role which the Government can play is to support the efforts being made by the international financial institutions to resolve the problem and we are doing this, in so far as we can, through our membership of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</P>
      <P>The most recent statement of Government policy on this matter was enunciated by the Taoiseach at the World Summit for Social Development on 12 March 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's position is that, while acknowledging the progress which has been made in recent years to alleviate the debt burden, much more remains to be done particularly for the lowest income countries.  In order to <Col N="144" /> enable developing countries to achieve sustained economic and social progress, we regard it as imperative that a definitive and lasting solution be found to the debt question.  In seeking a solution, we will need to be prepared to look with a fresh mind at all the options, including debt cancellation.  In the case of multilateral debt, options including possible sale of some of the IMF's gold reserves, will have to be considered, subject to ensuring that the effectiveness of the financial institutions is not undermined. This issue will be dealt with further in the forthcoming White Paper on Foreign Policy.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to a computerised payroll system which would handle the calculations and returns which arise under the PAYE/PRSI system.</P>
      <P>The basic record keeping and forms used in connection with the operation of the PAYE/PRSI system are prescribed by the Revenue Commissioners. However, employers may use alternative records and forms if approved by the Revenue Commissioners.  These alternatives can be either manual or computer-based and they would form part of an integrated record system covering all aspects of an employer's business.  The alternatives may be developed specifically or may include a generally available system purchased from a provider.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there are a number of computer software companies providing computerised payroll systems which cover PAYE/PRSI.  These vary depending on the type of computer in use, the number of employees and other requirements of the employer e.g. calculation of wages and overtime, production of payslips and pay cheques.  It should, of course, be borne in mind that PAYE/PRSI calculations are normally only a part of an employer's payroll requirements.

      <Quest>the views, if any, he has on the need for legislation to amend the Planning Acts, in order to legally prevent developers or their agents or third parties from demolishing or partly demolishing buildings for which no permission exists, and on which they can subsequently obtain a dangerous buildings order requiring them to demolish, shore up or restore the building; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994 provides that planning permission is required for the demolition of a building or a structure listed in the development plan or the draft development plan; for the demolition of a habitable house; where a building forms part of a terrace; where a building abuts a building in separate ownership; or <Col N="149" /> where the demolition would be in breach of the terms of an existing planning permission.</P>
      <P>Where development needing planning permission is being undertaken without permission, it is open to the planning authority or any member of the public to apply to the Circuit Court or the High Court for an order requiring the development to cease and, in so far as is practicable, requiring the land to be restored to its former state.  Where development is being undertaken in contravention of a permission, the Court may require any person to do or not to do, or cease to do, anything the Court considers necessary to ensure development is carried out in conformity with the permission.  There are, in addition, other enforcement powers available to local authorities under the Planning Acts, and a range of heavy penalties is provided for.  A person convicted on indictment is liable to a fine not exceeding £1 million, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or to both a fine and imprisonment. Where an offence is tried summarily, a maximum fine of £1,000, and a maximum term of imprisonment of six months, applies.</P>
      <P>The enforcement measures available to planning authorities are capable of being used to deter, or to penalise, where appropriate, contraventions of planning law and I have no proposals to change them.  It is, of course, a matter for the local planning authority concerned to decide whether any particular building in its area should be listed for preservation in its development plan.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the very important role the independent voluntary sector, including centres for the unemployed, have in the provision of information and advice to people regarding their statutory entitlements.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to overhaul the facilities available for community information, building on the network already in place in both the voluntary and statutory sectors. As a first step towards achieving this, arrangements are being made to transfer responsibility for the National Social Service Board to my Department and this move will enable greater consultation with that organisation on the question of supporting and strengthening the independent voluntary information sector.</P>
      <P>In my Department's experience, the vast majority of people seeking information require specific details relating to their own individual needs.  Queries of this nature can only be satisfactorily dealt with by reference to the individual case files held in the relevant section of my Department.  Consequently, the use of a centralised freephone service would not be the most effective method of providing information of a specific nature. As regards centres for the unemployed, I will ensure that staff within my Department endeavour to provide any information needed by those organisations without undue delay and in order to contain the telephone costs, return calls will be made in cases where the query cannot be dealt with immediately.</P>

      <P>Technology &ldquo;Foresight&rdquo; exercises, along the lines described in the Deputy's question, have been carried out in a number of countries.  Most recently, for example, the UK published a set of reports as part of their Technology Foresight Programme designed to identify key market opportunities over the next 15-20 years and the technologies needed to exploit them.</P>
      <P>The Tierney report on Science, Technology and Innovation &mdash; STI &mdash; which I published at the end of March, represented the most fundamental and wide-ranging review of STI in this country. Among its 160 recommendations, the report says the State should assist in identifying emerging technologies and industry niches that will have major impacts.  The recommendations are being examined by an inter-departmental task force, under the chairmanship of Mr. John Travers, Chief Executive of Forfás, the Policy Advisory Body for Industry, Science and Technology.  The task force is overseen by a Cabinet subcommittee which I chair.</P>
      <P>As the recent UK experience proved, technology foresight requires careful planning, a wide variety of inputs and lengthy detailed examination if it is to be worthwhile and valuable.  To that end, Forfás will undertake work on the requirements of a technology foresign process this year, examining <i>inter alia</i> the experience in the UK and in some small countries.</P>

      <P>There has been a very high level of interest in the Employment Initiative and this is reflected in the volume of applications which have been received.  Each application will be assessed in detail by reference to the eligibility criteria which apply.  As 196 proposals have been received to date under the Horizon (Disadvantaged) strand of Employment Initiative alone, their assessment will take some time to complete.  The intention is to have the review of all applications completed by the end of June. At that time a letter will be sent to those who have forwarded proposals to notify them of the outcome.  The proposal in question will receive careful consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Employment Initiative will be operational in the period to the end of 1999.  Pilot projects to be approved this year will be part-funded up to the end of 1997.  In the course of 1997, applications will be sought for the part-funding of projects to operate up to the end <Col N="159" /> of 1999.  Accordingly, a further opportunity to apply will exist for those promoters whose applications are not successful on this occasion.</P>

      <P>The storage and disposal of all radioactive waste in Ireland is subject to control by licence under the Radiological Protection Act, 1991 (General Control of Fissile Fuels, Radioactive Substances and Irradiating Apparatus) Order, 1993 (S.I. No. 151 of 1993).  These licensing controls are operated by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Radioactive material, in both sealed and unsealed form, is imported for use in industrial, medical and laboratory applications under licence from the institute.  At present, all imported sealed radioactive sources must be returned to the original supplier at the end of their useful lives &mdash; this is a precondition imposed by the institute prior to the issue of a licence.  In relation to unsealed sources and sealed sources imported before the introduction of regulatory controls in 1977, the licencee is obliged to store the waste material safely on his premises until the radioactive content has decayed to levels at which disposal as ordinary domestic waste is permitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" /> Inspections of storage of radioactive substances are carried out by the institute.  The institute is satisfied that the present arrangements in place ensure that all sources of radioactivity are currently stored in a correct manner which does not pose a hazard to people or the environment.</P>
    <P>The institute has recommended the establishment of a centralised waste management facility to cater for long term storage of radioactive wastes from medical, industrial and laboratory sources.  My Department is now examining this matter in conjunction with the institute.  Such a waste facility would not have any connection with any aspect of radiological protection as it relates to food.</P>

      <P>The curent Development Plans for both Ireland and Northern Ireland have paid close attention to the opportunities for expanding collaboration, in a range of areas, including the development of infrastructure networks in transport, energy and communications, in the context of European Funding.  Both the <i>National Development Plan, 1994-99</i> [Ireland] and <i>Structural Funds Plan, 1994-99</i> [Northern Ireland] contain a common chapter setting out the rationale for closer economic co-operation, reviewing the progress which has already been made and examining the scope for developing collaboration further.</P>
      <P>The <i>New Framework for Agreement</i> prepared by the Irish and British Governments envisages that, with agreement, co-operation to the mutual benefit of all living in Ireland could develop without impediment, attaining its full potential for stimulating economic growth and prosperity.  As the document makes clear, the two Governments look forward to making proposals on the functions for a North/South body in future discussions with the relevant Northern Ireland parties.  Those discussions will constitute the appropriate forum for consideration of how the objectives set out in the Framework Document might be implemented in transport, energy and communications.</P>
