      <P>Before proceeding to the Order of Business, the House will hear expressions of sympathy on the death of former Member and Minister of State at the Department of Finance, the late Deputy Joe Bermingham.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with considerable sadness but also with many happy memories that I rise to pay tribute to the late Joe Bermingham.  Joe Bermingham was, as we all know, the chairman of the parliamentary Labour Party for ten years. He was for many years Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the Office of Public Works.  He was a member of Kildare County Council from 1967 onwards and a member of many subsidiary bodes of that council.  He was also deeply involved in the Gaelic Athletic Association and was a strong supporter in every sense, on the playing field and the political fields, of his native County Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in none of those official aspects of Joe Bermingham's life that most of us who knew him well will remember him.  We will remember him principally for his fairness, honesty and humanity, <Col N="1866" /> his ability to convey his own views without giving offence and to put things as they were without any gloss or imaginary presentation.  On behalf of my party, Fine Gael, which worked closely as a party with Joe Bermingham in his work for the Labour Party over many years, I pay tribute to him and express our sympathy to his family.  I express our sympathy and shared sense of loss to the Labour Party and join with all those who pay tribute to his memory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Taoiseach's expression of sympathy on the death of our former colleague whose passing all of us on this side of the House deeply regret.  Joe Bermingham represented the constituency of Kildare for many years at all levels.  He was a widely respected and hard working public representative.  For many years he was associated with the Workers' Union of Ireland and with the GAA.  He served conscientiously as Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, a body for which he had much regard in terms of the tremendous work it did.</P>
      <P>Mr. Bermingham was always concerned with protecting the basic fabric of social services and with looking after the less well off with regard to such issues as the provision of primary schools and minimum levels of social welfare assistance, matters which he continually raised in the House.  In many debates he argued the need of ordinary people for educational and welfare services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from his interest in politics the late Mr. Bermingham was very interested in Irish poetry and in reading as were his family.  We in Fianna Fáil extend our sympathy to his family and friends.  They have the consolation of being able to reflect on a man who served the country well.  As chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party under three of its leaders, his cool management of the party's organisation won him great respect from people outside it.  The work he has done will be long remembered in the House.  Many of us <Col N="1867" /> had the privilege of knowing him as a friend and a good working colleague. Sheas Joe leis an bpobal i gcónaí agus bhain sé clú agus cáil amach dá phairtí agus dó féin.  Ar dheis lámh Dé go raibh a anam fíor-uasal.</P>

      <P>On 11 August, when we learned of the passing of our former colleague and good friend, it was an occasion of great sadness.  Joe Bermingham served the people of Kildare at county council level and in the Oireachtas for many years.  He served as a TD from 1973 to 1987 and was a member of Kildare County Council from 1967 until his death.  He was chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party from 1976 until 1986.</P>
      <P>He served his country well as a Minister of State at the Department of Finance with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works.  I know from the many former civil servants I met at his funeral that he was a respected Minister of State who took great pride in the work of the Office of Public Works which he protected in everything it did.</P>
      <P>Joe Bermingham served as chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party in a fair and even-handed way.  He was always prepared to listen and allow members make their contributions.  At the same time he would always remind us of who the chairman was and he ruled the roost at our parliamentary party meetings.</P>
      <P>He had a great sense of humour and great compassion for people.  He served the people in the Labour movement and the wider trade union movement as an effective parliamentarian and member of Kildare County Council.  We have lost a good friend but a man who has left a legacy of service to the people of kildare.  We extend our sympathy to his family.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We were all genuinely saddened to learn of the death of Joe Bermingham.  The former Deputy had a <Col N="1868" /> long and distinguished record of public service as a Minister of State, as a member of Kildare County Council and during his ten years as chairman of the Labour Party.  Many of us knew him as a lovely, decent man &mdash; one of the real characters around Leinster House, somebody whose company we all genuinely enjoyed.  To his family and to the Labour Party of which Joe Bermingham was a member for so many years, I want, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Progressive Democrats, to extend my sympathy.</P>

      <P>Like everyone else in this House, I was saddened to hear of the death of Joe Bermingham.  That Joe passed away in the middle of the summer, when politics tends not to get the same attention as it does for the rest of the year, explains perhaps why his passing did not receive the attention it merited.</P>
      <P>Joe Bermingham was an influential figure in politics over many years in this House and in the Labour Party.  He was what might be described as a politician in the traditional mode with strong links to the trade union movement and the GAA.  Most of all, he considered his obligations were to his constituents whom he served extremely well.  Joe was a man who preferred solid, low-key work to the flamboyant gesture but we all know that, at the same time, he was prepared to stand for his principles and to make sacrifices for them.  In the years in which we were both in this House together, I always found him to be an extremely kind and courteous man.  I extend my sympathy and that of my party to his family and friends.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>The death of Joe Bermingham in August marked the end of an era in politics, particularly in Kildare.  I worked closely with Joe from 1968 for 25 years.  As everybody in this House knows, he was a direct, straight and honest man who would not have <Col N="1869" /> pretended that diplomacy was his strongest point.</P>
      <P>He was a friend of mine for a long time.  He was my mentor and trained me in the art of politics.  He was an important figure at national and local level for reasons that have already been mentioned.  I regret that I had differences with Joe Bermingham towards the end of his career.  That is something I will always regret because I regarded him as a true friend and somebody who assisted and supported me on many occasions.</P>
      <P>Joe Bermingham was a champion of the poor and was concerned about them in everything he did.  He wanted to eliminate poverty and spent his life striving to achieve that.  I am pleased to have been associated with him.  I am sure he will rest in peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As a fellow Kildare man, the biggest tribute I can pay Joe Bermingham is to be as brief and direct as possible.  If he was here, I know that if the tributes went on too long he would say to the person nearest to him &ldquo;isn't that the greatest load of you-know-what you have ever heard?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am the longest serving Kildare TD currently in the Dáil who was here with Joe Bermingham.  It would probably have been easier for him to serve the people of Laois because he lived at a point in County Kildare which is furthest from any of the main population centres in the county.  It was quite remarkable that, of all the TDs in this House, Joe Bermingham was comfortably re-elected time after time whether his party was in the ascendant or in the decline.</P>
      <P>Joe Bermingham was a practical and honest politician.  We became great friends, maybe that was because we lived a long way from each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Joe was a bachelor and I spent many nights talking politics in his house in Castlemitchell.  It was strange that he and I became great friends, particularly during his time as chairman of the Labour Party because he had a deep rooted suspicion, as most Labour people have, <Col N="1870" /> of anything to do with Fianna Fáil.  He held the view &mdash; this may be of interest to the Tánaiste &mdash; that his Labour Party parliamentary colleagues who caused the greatest trouble came from a Fianna Fáil background.  I am sure the Tánaiste knows that was Joe Bermingham's view.</P>
    <P>We had a wonderful time as Deputies in Kildare.  We discussed elections before they took place and decided what we would do and we made a promise that we would not offend each other, regardless of what we did to anyone else.  He served Kildare well, as his friends and relatives around Castle-mitchell know, and he was greatly involved in the GAA.  Although he was not a member of the Labour Party at the time of his death, he was a Labour Party person in the truest and oldest sense of the word.  I do not know if he would have been comfortable with the current Labour Party &mdash; I do not say that in a denigratory manner &mdash; but Joe Bermingham came from a Labour tradition which was prominent in County Kildare.  He followed in the footsteps of William Norton.</P>
    <P>I hope, as he often said, that he is surrounded in Heaven by decent people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleague, Deputy McCreevy, I lived some distance from the late Joe Bermingham but I also got on well with him.  Joe was a hardworking, deeply committed and diligent politician who brooked no nonsense.  He had a direct approach, of which we were all aware. Those of use who served with him on Kildare County Council &mdash; I had the privilege and honour of doing so for almost 20 years &mdash; knew the depth and value of his commitment to his constituency and constituents and his ongoing concern for their needs.  He was a man who gave himself entirely to politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy McCreevy, I brought many hopeful Senators to his door throughout the years whom he interviewed with great interest.  I was an interested spectator at most of those <Col N="1871" /> interviews.  He had a wonderful way of interviewing them, which did not put aspirants at ease but sent them away in the hope that anything could happen afterwards.  Joe was inimitable in this regard.  He always gave sound and direct advice.  His entire political life was based on a direct approach.  We will miss him greatly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with sadness that I pay tribute to a former Member of this House.  The late Joe Bermingham was a Member for 14 years, during which he served the people of Kildare, particularly south Kildare, with great dedication. He lived a life similar to those he represented, which was unusual.  He was a loyal and true member of the old Labour Party and he represented them exceptionally well in Kildare.  He is and will be sadly missed.  The greatest tribute we could pay to him is to continue doing the work which he did so well and for so long in Kildare.  The highlight of his political career was when the former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, appointed him Minister of State at the Department of Finance.  I have no doubt that when he closed his eyes on 11 August, St. Peter told him he was now on the first team.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil oppose the Order of Business on the grounds that, for many weeks, we have sought a debate at the commencement of the new Dáil session on the affair involving Deputy Lowry, now better known as &ldquo;the Minister for Rumours and Anonymous Letters&rdquo;.  We do this on three grounds.  First, the Minister made serious allegations about the conduct of business people who apparently voted for Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not deal with the main subject.  Second, the Minister engaged in smearing the reputations of every employee of the semi-State company. Third, he is now involved in a witch-hunt involving hordes of accountants who are attempting to drum up some justification for statements made by the Minister.  We sought to bring the Minister before the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies but he refused.  We sought to have a debate on the matter today but this request has been refused because the Minister is apparently away on holiday. We want to have a debate on the matter next week but that has also been refused.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say, perhaps before there is a vote on the Order of Business, when we might have a debate about Deputy Lowry and the false allegations he made during the summer?</P>

      <P>The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications will speak in the Dáil and answer all questions put to him by any Member on <Col N="1874" /> the matters referred to in the week commencing 9 October 1995.  The matters concerned are inherently complex and time is required to make adequate investigations so that the report presented to the Dáil will be a full and comprehensive one.  The Minister received certain disquieting information and most reasonable members of the public and Members of this House will agree, that he had a clear obligation to have those matters disclosed to him investigated.  That is what he is doing in a responsible and appropriate manner.</P>

How does that compare with the manner in which Members of this side of the House were summoned to committees at his behest in November 1995.  Will the Taoiseach order the Minister home from holiday to answer questions before the committee and in this House?

      <P>I would explain to Deputies that it was this House which established the committees.  The Minister has a first responsibility which he will exercise, to report to and answer questions in this House on the matter in question.  There is a marked contrast between the way Deputy Lowry proposes to proceed in this matter &mdash; wherein he will answer questions in this House &mdash; and what happened in the case of Deputy Brennan's party, when not a single question was answered on the very serious matters in the beef tribunal report &mdash; upon preparation of which huge sums of public money had been spent.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the fact that there will not be any oral questions taken today, will the Taoiseach indicate when he believes the postponed summit might take place?  What progress has been made in that regard over the past two weeks?  Does he visualise himself and Prime Minister Major meeting in the next few weeks?  Will the Taoiseach outline the latest position to the House?</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact, the Deputy tabled a written question for which I had prepared an answer but I received news this morning that for some reason he has withdrawn this written question.  Therefore, the answer cannot be provided in that normal way.</P>

      <P>The best I can do is ask the Deputy to resubmit his written <Col N="1879" /> question and we will answer it.  It will then be on the record.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wants to hold over his question until Question Time next Wednesday, I will answer it then also.  To give a brief response to the Deputy's question, the position is that I came to the view that there would not be any useful purpose served by proceeding with the summit until we were satisfied it would achieve the objectives for which it was being called. I had reason to believe that in two respects that purpose would not be served.  Therefore, I suggested to the British Prime Minister that the summit be postponed and he agreed.  We have not set a new date for the summit.  We will set that date as soon as we are ready and as soon as the work and the conditions exist to ensure the summit achieves its stated objective.</P>

      <P>May I ask if the contact at official level which commenced on Monday week is still in operation or have those talks also ceased?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The contact is continuing. The date and timing of individual meetings is a matter for pragmatic decision-making from day to day and week to week.  Intensive work is being done and there are contacts on almost a daily basis between officials of the two Governments with a view to sorting out the problem.  I would have to say that it is not just the two Governments that are involved; the peace process belongs to everybody.  there are others who need to clarify their positions in regard to arms as well.  To my mind, in democratic politics the use of arms and the retention <Col N="1880" /> of arms is irrelevant.  Trust needs to be created not just among one's own supporters but amongst the supporters of one's traditional antagonists in regard to this matter.  It is not just for the Governments to devise solutions that will give others the trust and confidence they need to come to the table, it is for the parties directly involved who have contacts with paramilitary organisations to find those solutions too.  If they are not satisfied with the proposals that the Governments are putting forward let them put forward their own.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much agree with what the Taoiseach has just said.  In view of the fact that he is going to meet with the new leader of the Official Unionist Party next week does he see any possibility of either bilateral or all party talks beginning in advance of the summit between the two Prime Ministers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Contacts are continuing. I will be meeting the British Prime Minister before the end of the week in Majorca when discussing European matters.  Contacts are ongoing.  I very much welcome the fact that as a result of the change in the Unionist Party we now have a situation where the Unionist Party is willing to talk to the Irish Government.  In effect, almost every relevant party is talking bilaterally to almost every other relevant party, with one of two exceptions.  The next step is to get them all around the one table.  For that to happen and for there to be genuine negotiation, as distinct from an exchange of views, there has to be trust. The people who hold arms have a insist on the right to hold arms have a responsibility to recognise that it is not their own supporters they need to worry about in the first instance but the supporters of the people who fear them as these people need to be given confidence. Rather than saying it is a matter for the Governments to come up with a solution I challenge the paramilitary organisations and the parties associated with them to come up with answers in the present dialogue.  The arms that are <Col N="1881" /> held by the IRA are a political problem first and foremost for Sinn Féin.</P>
      <P>The arms that are held by the UDA and the UVF are first and foremost a political problem for the parties associated with those two organisations, the Progressive Unionist Party and the Ulster Democratic Party.  If the problems of Sinn Féin, the Progressive Unionist Party and the Ulster Democratic party are to be solved, trust must be built up in the minds and hearts of the people who fear that arms might be used against them.  Those parties have a responsibility to solve that political problem.  The Governments can help them and this Government has made strenuous efforts to do so.  We have said we do not believe that the disposal of arms on an instalment basis should be a precondition for talks.  That does not mean we believe there is no problem. There is a problem of trust and there is a fear that those arms will be used again. There is a fear every time the words &ldquo;the peace process is in crisis&rdquo; are used that it implies some form of threat of use of arms.  If that is being said, that creates fear and there is a responsibility on the part of people who say those things to alleviate that fear.  I want to create a situation in which everybody involved, all the parties North and South, and all the parties within Northern Ireland have a sense of ownership not only of the solution but of the problem. It is for all the parties to be creative and if they are not happy with particular suggestions made by Governments they should come up with better proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply to my question. From what he has stated on very fundamental issues perhaps we should ask the Whips to convene a debate on Northern Ireland next week.  What the Taoiseach has said is different from what we were talking about a few months ago.  It would be very useful if we could debate these issues in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with those who might say that consistency is not the only valid test of political action but in this instance I want to stress that my view and that of the Government on the decommissioning of arms has been absolutely consistent.  We believe it is an important item that must be dealt with but it is not the only item on the agenda. We recognise that other issues have to be dealt with as well as recognising that if we are to get people to the table &mdash; and there is no point in having empty chairs at the negotiating table &mdash; the arms issue has to be dealt with in a manner that satisfies the traditional antagonists of the people who hold the arms. It is not a matter of satisfying their own supporters but their traditional antagonists. That is where creative thinking is necessary.  That is why I particularly welcome Deputy McDaid's intervention at the weekend.  He has shown an ability to think.  I challenge the organisations associated with republican and loyalist paramilitary organisations to show the same degree of imagination that Deputy McDaid has shown.</P>

      <P>The purpose of amendments Nos. 4, 41 and 80 is to increase from 16 years to under 18 years the upper age limit under which a parent has a legal liability to maintain his or her child.

The Bill provides that where a child is in full time education the upper age limit is under 23 years and there is no upper age limit where the child has a mental or physical disability such that it is not possible for a child to maintain himself or herself fully.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this amendment.  As the Minister said, it raises the age for dependants from 16 years to 18 years.  It is designed to particularly benefit those not in full time education.  People are now entering the workforce at an older age than heretofore. Therefore, it is important that genuine dependence on a parent pending entry to the workforce is recognised in the maintenance code.  The amendment creates the legal obligation to maintain children up to the age of 18 years.  However, I recognise and welcome the fact that the court will have discretion to refuse maintenance or grant benefit at a very low level to those between 16 and 18 years of age if, for example, they were on a FÁS scheme.  I also welcome amendment No. 80 which raises the age from 21 years to 23 years. My party is in fundamental agreement with that change.</P>
      <P>On a slightly jarring note, we received this list of amendments at 9.45 a.m. this morning.  As the Minister is aware, while many of the amendments are technical, there are very substantial changes in the provisions relating to pensions which were quite complex in the first place. The whole concept of pension adjustment orders is very welcome &mdash; it was a lacuna in the law.  However, it is rather complex and we had great difficulty in absorbing the exact details in the short time available to us.  I recognise that this is not the first time this has happened but it is bad practice.  Ministers should be cognisant of the fact that the Opposition has to have time to prepare in order to be able to respond realistically to proposals.</P>

      <P>Section 2: In page 7, subsection (1), line 6, &ldquo;of the scheme&rdquo; deleted.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 28 is in substitution for section 11, regarding pension adjustment orders.  The main principles of the section have, of course, been in the Bill since the Bill came before the House.  I indicated in the course of the earlier Stages of the debate that I was concerned to ensure that the pension provisions in the Bill would be comprehensive and that the arrangements for their implementation would be as practical as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions, and the amendments to them, have been framed on the basis of extensive consultations between my Department, The Pensions Board, the Irish Association of Pension Funds and <Col N="1894" /> other pension experts.  Those consultations have been ongoing for a considerable time since I initiated an examination in my Department of pensions in the context of marriage breakdown.  I am glad to say that the pensions personnel associated with the work are fully satisfied with the revisions being made and have indicated that they are in the best possible shape from the point of view of the practicalities involved.  I wish to put on record my deep appreciation of their endeavours and co-operation in this area.  I have never doubted that the area is complex and the provisions of the Bill reflect that complexity. However, I have remained firmly of the view that pensions must be regarded as an asset just like any other asset, whether it be real property such as the family home, a farm or business property or whether it be personal property such as money in a bank account, shares in a company or the contents of a home.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to inform the House that the consultations have resulted in a maximum degree of consensus on the best way to frame the legislative provisions on pensions so as to meet the support that may be necessary for dependent spouses and children in that area.  I thank the Pensions Board, the IAPF and all others concerned for their helpful and valuable assistance in this complex matter.</P>
    <P>In general the amended provisions are the same as in the original section in that they provide for the earmarking and splitting of pensions.  However, the amended section provides additionally for new definitions and for situations where the member of the pension scheme dies before normal retirement age and ceases to be a member of the scheme and where the dependent spouse dies before benefits come into payment.  It also provides that the pension can be split at the discretion of the spouse in whose favour the order is made.</P>
    <P>There is no change of the main policy involved in the substitute section before the House.  What is involved is a series <Col N="1895" /> of technical drafting amendments and I will outline briefly the provisions contained in the new section.  Section 11 (1) contains the relevant definitions.  Subsection (2) allows the court, following the grant of a decree of judicial separation and on application to it by either of the spouses concerned, to make a pension adjustment order designating a portion of the retirement benefit of a spouse who is a member of a pension scheme &mdash; that is, the member spouse &mdash; for payment to a dependent spouse and children.  Such an order would have the effect of preserving for a dependent spouse an interest in the member spouse's pension benefit and the proportion of the pension benefit which would be paid to the dependent spouse and children will be determined by the court.  Subsection (3) has a similar effect in so far as a contingent benefit under a scheme is concerned.  A contingent benefit is a benefit payable under a pension scheme to a member spouse's dependants where the member dies before retirement.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) provides that, where the court makes a pension adjustment order, the spouse in whose favour the order is made may be entitled to the payment of the proportion of the benefit specified in the order to another scheme or arrangement so as to create an entitlement to an independent and separate benefit &mdash; that is, splitting of the pension benefit.  Subsection (5) provides for the mechanism whereby the pension benefit can be split on application by the person in whose favour the pension adjustment order is made. Subsection (6) provides in so far as specific schemes are concerned that the trustees may at their own discretion transfer the proportion of the benefit payable to the dependent spouse to another scheme so as to create an entitlement to an independent and separate benefit for the dependent spouse.</P>
    <P>Subsections (7), (8), (9) and (10) provide for special circumstances where a member spouse leaves a scheme or where a dependent spouse dies before <Col N="1896" /> the pension benefits come into payment. They provide that where the member spouse dies or leaves the scheme before the payment of any benefit is commenced the trustees must, within three months of the death of that spouse, transfer the proportion of the benefit payable to the dependent spouse to another scheme so as to create an entitlement to an independent and separate benefit for the dependent spouse. Where the member spouse ceases to be an active member of the scheme the trustees must inform the dependent spouse and the court concerned that the member spouse has ceased active membership. Where the dependent spouse dies before the payment of any benefit has commenced the trustees must pay to the personal representative of that spouse the proportion of the benefit ordered by the court to be paid to the dependent spouse.</P>
    <P>The remaining subsections provide for notifications to the various parties to proceedings for technical arrangements relating to the making of guidelines under the Pensions Act, 1990 for the calculation of the value of pension benefits. The guidelines for the calculation of the value of pension benefits are to be drawn up by the Pensions Board and the board is commissioning pension consultants to undertake this work.  In relation to notifications, notice of any application in relation to a pension adjustment order must be given to the trustees of the pension scheme and the court in making a pension adjustment order must have regard to any representations made by the trustees.</P>
    <P>The section also provides that the court, in making a pension adjustment order, will give pension trustees such directions as it considers appropriate to the order.  I trust the House will support these amendments, which are aimed at improving the operation of the pensions section.</P>
    <P>It has been a bone of contention for some time in this and in other jurisdictions that there is an absence of legislation to enable the courts to adjust the rights of spouses in pension schemes on <Col N="1897" /> the breakdown of a marriage.  I have made it my business to ensure that a mechanism is provided on the matter.  It has taken considerable time and effort to provide that but the Houses will agree that it has been worthwhile.  In separation proceedings, the court is already obliged, in making provisions for a spouse and children, to take the financial and other circumstances of the parties into account.  The section on pensions will ensure that pensions can be taken into account by the court in the same way as any other asset.  I commend the provisions to the House.  Amendments Nos. 6, 7 and 37 are consequential on amendment No. 38.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to understand all the Minister said.  As has been said, a pension is an asset.  It was undesirable that there was no provision for the division of this asset in the same way as other assets such as shares, property, etc.  Now that we are coming to the end of the legislative process, which it was necessary to put in place before a divorce referendum, I am somewhat reassured &mdash; and this Bill was debated at length in this House and the other House &mdash; to hear the Minister say substantive changes were not proposed in relation to pension adjustment orders. As I understand it, this long and detailed amendment is simply to make technical changes, tighten up definitions and to provide for a number of matters which had not been envisaged, such as the death of people before they qualify for a pension, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note, in looking through the definition section, that all the definitions seem to be tied into the Pensions Act, 1990, which, as the Minister will be aware, deals only with private occupational pension schemes.  What is the situation in relation to public sector pensions? How do the changes being introduced by the Minister today relate to public sector pensions?  Do I understand the amendment correctly to mean that a pension which has been the subject of a pension adjustment order can only <Col N="1898" /> come into payment when the pension has actually accrued?</P>
    <P>In relation to what the Minister said at the end of his explanation of the amendments about the pension scheme trustees dealing with payment to the personal representatives of a deceased person, is there provision for payment of a lump sum in such a case?  Is there provision for the conversion of the pension into a lump sum when the personal representatives of a deceased person are being paid?  Did I understand correctly what the Minister said in relation to that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Dea for his comments.  Public sector schemes are included in the Bill.  They and defined contribution schemes come under the category of defined benefit schemes.  The Bill will cover the broad spectrum of pensions in the private and public sector.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Dea asked about the timing of payment.  Payment only comes into play when the pension accrues. Payment cannot be brought forward because of a split.  It would only come into play when the retirement age is reached or as the case may be.  The lump sum would depend on the terms of the pension scheme.  Some schemes would have provisions for lump sums in certain circumstances and others would not. People would be dependent on the terms and conditions of the applicable pension scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his explanation.  The Minister said a pension cannot be payable until it has accrued.  Section 11 (3) deals with contingent benefits under a scheme of which one of the spouses is a member. The application must be made to the court within one year of the decree being granted.  If the scheme member dies more than one year after the decree has been granted, would this preclude somebody from applying under the section?</P>

      <P>We dealt with substantial <Col N="1899" /> amendments on Committee Stage and discussed a number of these points.  I am confused about the point made by Deputy O'Dea with regard to one year after the making of an order.  Will the Minister clarify this?  I agree with Deputy O'Dea that there is an enormous difficulty and I recognise the amount of work put in by officials in the Department.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been in the making for more than a year and a half.  It is extremely difficult for Opposition spokes-persons, who do not have expertise in this area, to consider substantial amendments. We had a great deal of debate in the Dáil Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  At this stage we are nit picking to an extent and trying to ensure that the Bill is the best available, but the Opposition parties do not have the necessary expertise.  At a private meeting we were fully briefed but as amateurs we have to take on board what is presented to us.  I do not find this the most satisfactory way of dealing with legislation.  Notwithstanding the constraints on the Minister, we are presented with difficulties which we should not have to face.</P>

      <P>A contingent benefit is a benefit which arises if the member spouse dies while in the relevant employment, before he or she has attained the normal pensionable age. There are obligations of notification to the interested parties when that happens. The beneficiary, who has become entitled by virtue of the court order to a split portion of the contingent benefit, can apply for payment for that spouse or other dependants as the case may be. The payment can then be made but the application must be made within 12 months, which seems reasonable because there is an obligation under which people must be given notification of what has happened.  After they are given this, they have 12 months to make the application if this is what they want to do.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister that 12 months to make the application is a reasonable time, but should it not be 12 months after the contingency, namely the death, has occurred?

      <P>The contingent benefit is defined as meaning a benefit payable under the scheme where the member spouse has died while in the relevant employment before attaining normal pensionable age.  Subsection (3) states:</P>
      <P>Where a decree of judicial separation has been granted, the court, if it so thinks fit, may, in relation to a contingent benefit under a scheme of which one of the spouses concerned is a member, on application to it in that behalf not more than one year after the making of the order for the decree by either of the spouses or by a person on behalf of a dependent member of the family concerned, make an order providing for the payment, upon the death of the member spouse while in the relevant employment for the payment to either or both of them in such proportion as the court may determine.</P>
      <P>They have 12 months to do it and that seems appropriate.  That was discussed at some length with the pensions people who are happy that it will operate properly. They are the people who have to operate the scheme at the end of the day.</P>

Circumstances of remarrying could arise where one or other of the spouses obtains a foreign decree of divorce that is entitled to recognition in the State.

      <P>(b)  the person refuses or neglects to comply with the direction or, for any other reason, the court considers it necessary to do so,</P>
      <P>the court may order another person to execute the deed or instrument in the name of the first-mentioned person; and a deed or other instrument executed by a person in the name of another person pursuant to an order under this subsection shall be as valid as if it had been executed by that other person.</P>

    <P>This amendment provides that where a property adjustment order is made by the court and a person is directed to execute a deed or instrument in relation to land which is the subject of the order and that person refuses or neglects to comply with the direction, the court, where it considers it necessary to do so, may order another person to execute the deed or instrument.  The amendment <Col N="1908" /> also makes clear that any costs incurred in complying with a property adjustment order will be borne, as the court may determine, by either of the spouses concerned or by both of them.  The existing law under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, is silent in these two areas and Deputies will recognise the need for expressed provisions to deal with these two important matters.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see these amendments to the Bill.  While not exactly the same, they are pertinent to another provision of the Bill relating to disclosure which I would like the opportunity to discuss.  There is a difficulty on how this will be implemented and the Minister might give us some information on that later.  There is also a difficulty in relation to sanctions in the context of disclosure and so on.

      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment which deals with another lacuna in the law.  The amendment states that the court may order another person to execute the deed or instrument in the name of the first mentioned person.  What does the Minister have in mind?  Can it be anybody or must it be an official of the court?  Will there be special rules of court to enable the operation of the section and provide, as Deputy Keogh mentioned, for sanctions and so on?  This provision seems to be confined to land and real property. Would it not be advisable to extend it to other items such as shares?  What will happen if somebody fails to complete a share transfer certificate?  Should it not follow logically that we should have a similar provision for that type of situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Any person can be designated by the court to sign in the name of the other person.  However, I envisage it would be the county registrar of the <Col N="1909" /> court who would be deputed to do so. This arose from my practical experience in dealing with these cases.  There are cases where the court orders one spouse to transfer a half share in the property, or indeed the entire home, to the other spouse.  If the court order is not complied with, that is, the deed is prepared but the person simply does not sign it, there are certain procedures for dealing with that involving contempt of court proceedings, notices of motion and other legal processes.  This has been devised arising from practicalities which I experienced in practice.  The court simply deputes another person to sign on the persons behalf and in their name and that is the end of it.  It is very simple and effective and little or no cost is involved.  It is a simple, practical procedure.</P>
      <P>The difficulty really only arises in connection with land.  Theoretically it could arise in connection with shares but the same degree of urgency or pressure would not arise.  The pressure usually arises in connection with the family home or land.  It is not envisaged to extend the provision beyond land at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his explanation and I welcome what he said.  I do not agree that the same degree of urgency would not arise in relation to something like shares.  The value of shares can fluctuate quite suddenly and dramatically.  It is something we will have to look at in the future.  I accept the amendment which is a vast improvement in the law in so far as it goes.  This is thanks to the Minister's personal experience in this area.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(4) This section shall not apply in relation to a family home in which, following the grant of a decree of judicial separation either of the spouses concerned, having remarried, ordinarily resides with his or her spouse.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to protect a family home from becoming the subject of a property adjustment order in cases where, after obtaining a decree of judicial separation, a spouse may happen to remarry.  That circumstance could arise where one of the parties to a separation may subsequently obtain a foreign divorce which is entitled to be recognised in the State and that party remarries.

      <P>Section 13: In page 17, line 6, &ldquo;shall&rdquo; deleted and &ldquo;may&rdquo; substituted.</P>
      <P>Section 13 provides that where certain conditions apply, the court must, in cases of judicial separation, make an order extinguishing the succession rights of either spouse.  This amendment allows the court discretion in the matter. The aim is to allow for a degree of flexibility in the operation of the section having regard to the specific criteria set out in the section and those set out in section 15.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments No. 72 is purely a technical drafting amendment.  Amendment No. 73 provides that the court will have power to direct persons to comply with the provisions of section 37 for disclosure of information and, where they fail to do so, they will be in breach of a court order which, as Deputies will be <Col N="1938" /> aware, carries its own penalty.  Amendment No. 81 provides that the important provisions which are in section 37 be also incorporated in the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976 which will provide for the first time that parties to maintenance proceedings under the Act will be required to make full disclosure of their property and income.  The proposed amendment of section 37 provides for full disclosures of information in relation to the parties' property and income which disclosures can be enforced by the court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome these amendments. The Minister and I had an interesting discussion on this point on Committee Stage when I suggested an amendment to the effect that parties to an order shall be required to make full financial disclosure to include income and property of the parties.  In fairness, the Minister has gone as far as he is prepared to go but I would have preferred the amendment to read &ldquo;shall&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;may&rdquo; direct the person, although I am sure the Minister would argue that point with me.  I must emphasise the importance of this because this morning I became aware of a case where full disclosure had not been given and where every device is being used to avoid giving disclosure of assets.  Unfortunately, many people are of the opinion that the sanctions that can be imposed are laughable. In this instance I am talking about a woman whose husband seems to be riding a coach and four through these procedures.  She wants to know how a court will know that he is complying and also how she can get the information she requires to ensure that her husband is not fooling the Department of Social Welfare or other relevant authority. This issue causes great angst between separating couples.  The Minister said that rules of court have their own sanctions but how can we ensure that this is implemented?  What sanctions are available? I know a number of people who are at their wits end because of this and who are being given the run-around.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Keogh.  I am aware of a number of cases where it was evident from the outset that the party against whom the application was made was determined not to make full disclosure.  I am not satisfied that the sanctions in place were sufficient to force that party to do so.  As Deputy Keogh said, the sanctions seem to be honoured more in the breach than in the observance.  I am aware of cases where people have got away without making full disclosure which caused great distress to the aggrieved party. The whole concept of a property adjustment order becomes meaningless if there is not full disclosure.  The court is adjusting part rather than the entirety of the property.</P>
      <P>Regardless of what rules, regulations or orders of court exist to compel people to make full disclosure they are not working in practice.  I am sure that is something the Minister does not like to hear and does not agree with.  He would be horrified to learn it was not working in practice.  I can send him cases to indicate it is not working.  I do not like sending reports about civil law cases to Ministers but I can send him examples of cases before the Limerick Circuit Court where I am perfectly happy there was not full disclosure.  I can send him statements from lawyers representing parties who went before that court where there was not full disclosure. The person who should have made the disclosure was determined from the outset not to make full disclosure. Regardless of what regulations or sanctions exist, in the cases with which I am familiar they did not work.</P>

      <P>This is a new format.  As the Deputy rightly said, we had an interesting discussion about it.  There is <Col N="1940" /> every reason to believe that this amendment will radically improve the position. If either party suspects that full disclosure is not being made they can make an application to the court for a court order directed to that person to disclose. If the person fails to comply with that court order that is a very serious matter because the person would then be in contempt of court.  The penalty for contempt of court is, theoretically at least, unlimited fine and unlimited imprisonment. It is a very serious matter and this highlights the seriousness of the issue. We cannot make it stronger than that. We have not even fixed a penalty.  It is an unlimited penalty because we have put it into the ambit of a contempt of court.  We must wait and see how that works but I believe it will bring about a radical improvement.</P>

      <P>I agree that the Minister listened to the points made to him on Committee Stage.  I am glad he put forward this amendment.  In a case where the spouse does not disclose, is there some method which can be employed to ensure he is investigated?  If, for instance, the person is in receipt of social welfare payments or is claiming for somebody else and has not declared them, is there interaction between Departments or some means by which an investigation can be initiated so that the onus is not on the other spouse?  I am thinking of a particular case where the spouse has defaulted and has not made full disclosure.  In this instance the onus has been on his wife to follow him through the courts.  This keeps a very difficult situation bubbling but it is also causing her huge financial problems. She is just above the limit for free legal aid and, therefore, cannot apply whereas her husband can apply.  Is there any mechanism for dealing with such a case?</P>

      <P>Following on the introduction of this amendment the matter will come within the ambit of the court and the court will be making an order directing a full disclosure.  The matter <Col N="1941" /> would then come back before the judge. If the judge was not satisfied that full disclosure had been made or had suspicions that the matter was not in order when the case came before the court he could say that he was not satisfied and the person might be asked to produce a letter from the Department of Social Welfare or take the necessary steps to satisfy the judge that the court order had been complied with.  We are not talking about a request by the parties <i>inter se.</i>  This amendment will put the matter on a different basis altogether and it is now a matter of compliance with a court order so the person is answerable to the court and has to satisfy the judge that the court order has been complied with.  If a judge has reason to suspect that the court order has been flouted or denied, he can take whatever steps he deems appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>In my initial contribution I omitted to welcome the Minister's amendment which is necessary to improve the situation.  I do so now.  It is not as simple as bringing the matter back into the ambit of the court.  The Minister will be aware that judges are busy people who have not much time and are disinclined to get involved in long investigations about whether a person has money hidden.  There may be cases, as Deputy Keogh mentioned, where somebody receives an income from social welfare which they do not wish to disclose but that can be easily checked out.  I have come across a number of cases involving business people where the wife knew money had been salted away in bank accounts not in the immediate region and sometimes abroad.  The spouse may very well know the person against whom the property adjustment order is being sought has salted away money at home or abroad. It would be unrealistic for a judge to ask a person in that situation to produce a letter from every branch of every bank in Ireland and England confirming that he had no money.  I think Deputy Keogh is suggesting that there should be a mechanism whereby the judge is given <Col N="1942" /> discretion to order an investigation into this, perhaps through the Revenue Commissioners.  I think that is desirable. It is very well to say that the court can order somebody to make full disclosure and if the person does not do so he is subject to the draconian provisions of contempt of court.  There may be simply no way to know whether a person has told the truth.  The person may say he has made full disclosure on foot of such an order and still not make it.  If one convicts somebody for contempt of court one must prove the case beyond reasonable doubt.</P>
      <P>The Bill is fine in so far as it goes.  It brings in the threat of contempt of court and the consequences of it hang over somebody's head.  Nevertheless there is no follow-up procedure.  The Minister knows perfectly well that a judge who has a great many cases to hear will not get involved in an endless investigation about somebody's assets.  It leaves the aggrieved party with a sour taste.  There are cases before the courts as I speak where people have salted away money, have got rid of assets and have transferred them abroad.  Their spouses are aware of this but they will get away with it in spite of the good intentions behind this amendment.  There is no procedure for checking the veracity of what they say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy O'Dea on one point at least in his last intervention.  Courts and judges are very interested if they come to the conclusion that their orders are not being complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are rightly very insistent that their orders be complied with and if they come to the conclusion that they are not being complied with they will take whatever action may be appropriate in the circumstances.  As I am sure Deputy O'Dea well knows, at the end of the day it is a matter of evidence and the courts adjudicate and make their decisions based on the evidence before them.  It is very easy for one party to a claim to say that the other party has X pounds salted away but the court has to <Col N="1943" /> weigh up the evidence and assess its veracity. It does not have teams of detectives at its disposal to check out these matters, even assuming that was possible. It depends on hard evidence for example, a bank book or something specific rather than surmise, expectation or belief based on little or nothing.</P>
    <P>Every case is different.  The court will assess the case and if it comes to the conclusion that a full disclosure has not been made it will have the power for the first time under this amendment to order that person to make a full disclosure. If necessary the matter would then come back before the court which would re-examine it, hear the evidence of the parties and examine and cross-examine them.  It will arrive at its own conclusions and decision.  It it comes to the conclusion based on evidence that full disclosure has not been made, then the person could be held in contempt under this amendment.  This is a new and progressive power and we will have to wait and see how it works.  We will keep the situation under review and if further reasonable and practical improvements are found to be necessary at a later date, they will be considered. This important new remedy will substantially improve the situation and I am grateful to the Deputies for their support for it.</P>

      <P>Will the onus of proof be shifted from the aggrieved spouse?  Difficulties will arise in cases where a person saw a bank book or suspects that their spouse has one but cannot prove it.  It is not intended to set up a moral police force, but a separate investigative body would be necessary in such cases. The Minister has accepted that this problem exists.  Does he know the number of people charged with perjury or contempt of court?  In very busy courts, particularly family courts where there are long waiting periods, the focus of attention is not necessarily on these issues which create great hardship.  I am glad the Minister has put down these amendments but I am worried that they <Col N="1944" /> do not go far enough to alleviate the difficulties which undoubtedly exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to know how much further one could go at this stage. The balance of probability rules apply here as they do in any civil proceedings. One must be realistic and practical about this issue: it would be impossible for any person to prove that a person does not have money salted away, and all the investigatory processes in the world will not help in that regard.  A person can say that but nobody can prove that he does not have it.  It is a matter of the evidence adduced before the court in a particular case.</P>
      <P>Before making such an order, the court would have to have some basis for so doing.  If it was alleged by the other party that the order had not been complied with, that would have to be based on something.  No court will hold a person in contempt of court unless the allegation is well based.  Nor can we expect any law to be brought in that would compel a court to do that.  These things are always based on evidence, on the balance of probabilities.  People are committed on occasion for contempt of court, but it does not happen very often for the simple reason that it carries such a draconian penalty and the potentiality of it is so vast that people are fearful of finding themselves in contempt of court because they leave themselves open to an indefinite or unlimited fine or unlimited imprisonment.  Sometimes people are ordered to do something by a court and do not do it, and are imprisoned until they do.  We are giving an important new remedy and we must wait to see how it works out.</P>

      <P>I understand the sense of what the Minister has said.  Nevertheless, I return to my original point that busy courts will not give an inordinate amount of time to one aspect of a particular family law case, and I have no doubt that if the referendum is passed their work will increase.  Let me make a practical suggestion.  A member of the court staff could be designated to do it <Col N="1945" /> if he had sufficient staff &mdash; I am aware that the staff who are there at the moment are overworked but members of the Government have stated that there will be improvements in that regard.  Another way would be to increase the number of judges.  I hope the Government will implement its promise in that regard because the backlog in some Circuit Court areas in regard to family law cases is nothing short of a disgrace.  In conjunction with the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform has substantially improved funding for the free legal aid service with the result that delays have been reduced from 18 months to six weeks in the South Western Circuit. However, there has been a corresponding increase in the time within which a person can get into court because of the growing backlog in family law cases.</P>

However, such work could be done by a designated member of the court staff.  Within the realm of property adjustment orders, I have one further technical question which is already being asked of me.  What will be the effect of prenuptial agreements which are an increasingly important feature of divorce regimes in other countries? People are asking me this question, and I do not say that their vote in the referendum will depend on the Minister's answer, but I presume they have some reason for asking the question.

      <P>Section 51: In page 43, between lines 45 and 46, the following inserted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) A copy of a statement made for the purpose of subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (b) and certified by, or by the successor or successors in title of, the party or parties concerned (&ldquo;the person or persons&rdquo;) to be a true copy shall, before the expiration of the period referred to in that subparagraph, as appropriate, be lodged by the person or persons in the Land Registry for registration pursuant to section 69 (1) of the Registration of Title Act, 1964, as if statements so made had been prescribed under paragraph (s) of the said section 69 (1) or be registered by them in the Registry of Deeds.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 51 provides for a number of amendments to the Family Home Protection Act, 1976.  Section 51 (1) (b) proposes a new subsection (8) in section 3 <Col N="1954" /> of the 1976 Act.  Subsection (8) provides that proceedings may not be instituted to have a conveyance of a family home declared void by reason of the absence of a spouse's prior consent any later than six years after the date of the conveyance, unless that spouse is then in occupation of the family home.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 92 requires that rules of court be made to require the plaintiff in such proceedings to register a notice of the proceedings in the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds, as the case may be, so that any purchaser of the property concerned can be aware of the proceedings.  The amendment is intended to facilitate conveyances and is in response to representations made to me on the matter.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 93 also relates to subsection (8) where it provides in paragraph (b) that a conveyance is deemed not to be void by reason of absence of consent unless it has been declared void by the court or unless it is void and the parties to the conveyance are the successors in title so stated in writing within six years of the conveyance.  The amendment requires registration of any such statement in the Land Registry or Registry of Deeds, as the case may be, before the expiration of six years.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 94 relates to the new subsection (9) which is proposed to be inserted in section 3 of the 1976 Act. That subsection enables a spouse to give a general consent in writing to any future conveyance of the family home. The subsection might, however, be interpreted as applying only to consents executed after the Bill comes into force. The amendment makes clear that the consent may be one given before or after the passing of the Bill.</P>

      <P>This Bill is the culmination of work done over the past three years, building on the groundwork laid by the White Paper on marriage breakdown of September 1992.  I pay tribute to the successive Administrations, including all the political parties, who <Col N="1956" /> lent their efforts to the task of modernising our family law.  This Bill is one of the most far reaching reforms of family law in recent years.  It overhauls the law in relation to the financial consequences of marriage, pensions, maintenance, the effects of foreign divorce and separation, the age of marriage, tax treatment following foreign divorce and in many other areas.</P>
      <P>This Bill puts in place one of the final elements of the preparations for the referendum on divorce in November.  It demonstrates that all of the financial consequences of breakdown have now been catered for and the sole remaining issue issue is the right to remarry.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputies on all sides of the House for their support.  I look forward to a constructive and informative debate inside and outside this House on the Fifteenth Amendment Bill in the weeks ahead.  I also wish to thank all the staff of my Department who worked so hard and for such long hours to prepare this Bill through all its Stages, not least this Final Stage today.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister and his staff for the work they have put into preparing this legislation.  Naturally, we agree with its provisions since they were agreed between the Fianna Fáil and Labour parties when they were in Government.  These proposals emanated from that Government.</P>
      <P>A number of issues are still outstanding as a result of changes made during the passage of the Bill.  The law on nullity, for example, has not been changed. The Minister said that it would be the subject of separate legislation.  We should have some indication of the Minister's proposals in that regard before the divorce referendum.  In addition, as Deputy Keogh said, legislation on joint ownership of the family home has foundered on constitutional grounds.  Has the Minister any other proposals in that regard?  He indicated that he has administrative proposals and we are entitled to know what they are in advance of this matter being put before the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1957" /> I regret that the Minister for Social Welfare did not accept our proposals for changes in the social welfare code.  Only the bare minimum has been done in that area to cater for divorce.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister, the officials of his Department and the many other people involved in framing this Bill.  It is complex and far-reaching and I hope it will be the basis for a constructive debate on the forthcoming divorce referendum.  We must focus on the importance of this Bill and not only in relation to divorce.</P>
      <P>I am sorry the Bill is considerably different from the one we worked on a couple of years ago &mdash; it seems like ten years ago now.  The provisions regarding nullity have been excised from this Bill. I thank Deputy O'Dea for his support on the issue of joint ownership of the family home, although it was not forthcoming when I needed it.  That subject should be revisited with, perhaps, a different formula to deal with it.  It is a subject I will never drop until joint ownership of the family home comes to pass.</P>
      <P>I am glad we have this Bill.  It has been a tortuous process.  On behalf of Opposition spokespersons I appeal to the Minister to give us due notice of amendments when a Bill comes before the House.  This is an important Bill and I always have great difficulty in satisfying myself that legislation is perfect. While it is probably impossible to ensue that a Bill is perfect, the more notice we receive of legislation and amendments the better such legislation will be from our examination of its provisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to inform the House about the proposed sale of Irish Steel Limited to ISPAT International.  I was particularly pleased to visit Cork on 6 September last to sign the contract for sale.</P>
      <P>As this House will be well aware, Irish Steel's troubles have been going on for decades.  Successive Governments have invested substantial amounts of taxpayers' money into the company with no return on the taxpayers' funding. Irish Steel has only made profits in three years out of the last 20 and these profits were never of sufficiently large amount to protect the company in its years of poorer performance.  Its consolidated profit and loss account to the end of June 1995 shows an accumulated loss of some £145 million.  The experience over the years has demonstrated that the State was far from the ideal partner.</P>
      <P>We have seen employment levels in Irish Steel drop from a level of over one thousand two decades ago to a level this time last year of 561.  In the trading year 1993-94, Irish Steel was losing well over £1 million a month and total losses for the year amounted to over £20 million. Figures for the year to the end of June 1995 show further losses, although on a scale considerably less than the previous year, with losses approaching £6 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish Steel is a small stand-alone company within a much bigger European and worldwide steel industry.  The international steel market that the company serves is cyclical and in the early 1990s the steel industry experienced a downturn in both price and sales volumes. Selling prices were lower than they had been for 20 years and raw material prices were high, leading to immense pressures on margins.  Most steel companies in Europe found the going tough and as a result, with the support of the <Col N="1959" /> European Commission, a massive restructuring of the steel industry in Europe was undertaken.  Following the lead taken in Europe and in the light of the huge losses being made &mdash; £13 million on a turnover of £58 million in the year ended June 1993 &mdash; it was imperative for Irish Steel to implement cost reduction and restructuring measures.</P>
    <P>During 1993, the company unsuccessfully tried to negotiate a cost reduction package with its workforce.  A new viability plan was drawn up in early 1994.  This was an absolute precondition to the very survival of the company. This plan provided for, <i>inter alia</i>, a reduction of 205 workers, the introduction of new totally flexible work practices, the achievement of efficiencies and a pay freeze.  There were extreme difficulties in reaching agreement with the unions on the implementation of the plan.  Industrial relations difficulties beset the company throughout the summer of 1994.  Following difficult negotiation &mdash; that saw the company on the verge of closure on a number of occasions &mdash; each of the trade unions and all employees in Irish Steel indicated their acceptance of the company's survival plan.  The plan allowed for cost improvements and savings of £8.8 million per year.  I am pleased to acknowledge the tremendous sacrifices and efforts made by the workers of Irish Steel in the implementation of the viability plan.</P>
    <P>This survival plan has been vital in securing a prospect of achieving a viable future for Irish Steel.  Without the achievement of cost savings under the plan, it is unlikely that any company would have been interested in Irish Steel, but there were considerable doubts that the company could achieve and sustain viability on its own.  For example, the European Commission and others expressed considerable reservations about the ability of Irish Steel to provide adequately for the next downturn in steel markets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1960" /> Faced with the high losses that had occurred in 1993-94 and the implementation of the survival plan notwithstanding, Irish Steel was still not in a break-even situation as a stand-alone enterprise.  The board of Irish Steel submitted, on 28 November, 1994, a final viability plan to return the company to profitability within three years.  This plan included a request for £50 million, including £40 million in equity and £10 million in guaranteed borrowings.</P>
    <P>The Government, following discussions with the European Commission, was faced with three options: to seek EU approval for the £50 million State aid package, to close Irish Steel, at a conservative cost of over £40 million, or to find a suitable strategic partner who, with experience in the wider international market place, would be able to bring their knowledge, marketing and production resources to bear on Irish Steel and turn the company's fortunes around, so that it would have the strength to prosper in the market.</P>
    <P>In the event, the Government decided, in February 1995, that negotiations with the European Commission for approval of State aid to Irish Steel should be on the basis of £50 million and negotiations could be opened for the possible sale of shares in, and control of, the company.  Indeed, the European Commission has notified us that it is in the process of opening a legal procedure, to be published shortly in the Official Journal, against Ireland for giving a Government guarantee on a loan advanced by the ACC in 1993 and for the proposal to fund all of the £50 million restructuring plan.  However, those proceedings will be dropped if the current proposal to sell Irish Steel to ISPAT is approved by the Council.</P>
    <P>Following the Government decision, an application for State aid approval was lodged with the European Commission and I appointed Investment Bank of Ireland Corporate Finance Limited to act as advisers on the sale of Irish Steel.  Five parties were quickly <Col N="1961" /> identified as being interested in purchasing part or all of Irish Steel.  Applications were made by each of these five companies in the first round of offers. It is common knowledge that these five companies were ISPAT International, Riva, Aicher, Nippon Denro and Nucor/Yamato.  Each of their offers was weighed up on its respective merits.  In some cases companies were even invited to improve on their offers.  All the offers, save one, were for the purchase of 100 per cent of the shares in Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>A short list of companies was drawn up after the final first round offers were received and a number of companies were invited to submit further more detailed offers.  Following receipt of these further offers, the Cabinet subcommittee, comprising of myself, the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State with responsibility for science, commerce and technology, which had been formed to oversee the sale process, selected ISPAT International, following recommendations from my Department and the advisers, as the company which would be granted exclusivity of negotiation to purchase 100 per cent of Irish Steel.  It was considered that ISPAT International had the necessary experience in turning around steel companies. The financial commitments they were proposing were the strongest of the remaining bidders.</P>
    <P>During the summer ISPAT concluded detailed due diligence with their own professional team, in co-operation with IBI Corporate Finance Limited, Irish Steel Limited, and my Department.  The due diligence process was conducted on the basis of the normal process of disclosures and representations made by Irish Steel, in the main, but also by the State, on foot of which ISPAT decided to purchase Irish Steel.  Negotiations with the company continued during and after this process and led to the conclusion of the contract documents.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to give a brief pen picture of ISPAT <Col N="1962" /> International.  It is a multinational corporation, founded in India, with manufacturing facilities in Mexico, Canada, Trinidad and Tobago, Germany, the USA, the UK and Indonesia for the production of steel and related items. The group is the largest producer and consumer of direct reduced iron, that is iron produced from iron ore, in the world.  It is also one of the world's largest producers of liquid steel, employing a total of 6,500 producing more than 6.5 million tonnes worldwide.  The total assets of the group exceed US $3 billion and annual revenues exceed US $2 billion.  Most of ISPAT's acquisitions have been former state-owned steel-works in the process of privatisation and it has a proven track record of turning around all its major acquisitions, usually within a year of purchase.  This is rapid by steel industry standards.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel will be able to benefit from the experience the new owners will be able to bring to bear and the economies of scale that also derive from a group of such size.  The Government is satisfied that, through the proposed sale of Irish Steel to ISPAT International, it has achieved the best possible deal for the State, the company and for the workers of Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to the details of the deal to which the Government gave approval on 5 September, the contract for sale of which I signed on behalf of the State on 6 September last.  ISPAT International is to buy Irish Steel for a nominal sum of £1.  The sale will be finalised following the receipt of European Coal and Steel Community approval.  The agreement will involve a certain level of expenditure by the State and by ISPAT International.  The State has agreed to pay £10.636 million to Irish Steel Limited and ISPAT will invest £5 million in working capital into the economy immediately following EU approval.  The State's contribution of over £10 million includes provisions to provide for charges and expenses identified by ISPAT in the due diligence process, to fund a deficit in the staff pension fund, to fund necessary <Col N="1963" /> environmental and other remedial works and a small matching contribution towards an ECSC staff training grant.</P>
    <P>This purchaser is also committed to a significant level of capital expenditure. This will see investment of £25 million over the next five years, allowing Irish Steel to produce products more efficiently and thus more profitably than at present.  These funds will be spent on the re-equipment of the mill and the melt shop.  About half of the capital spend will, it is planned, be devoted to enabling Irish Steel to make higher grade, added-value raw steel.  Ultimately, under ISPAT, Irish Steel will produce a more extensive range of finished steel products, which will, because of the higher grades of steel they will be able to make, add to the value of output. In addition, ISPAT has agreed to maintain production at least at present levels.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the deal provides undertakings from ISPAT to take over all loans, debts and liabilities of Irish Steel with the exception of an old Government loan of £17 million made in the mid-1980s.  That will be extinguished by the Government as part of the sale.</P>
    <P>Among the issues at the forefront of negotiations has been the Government's concern for the workers of Irish Steel and the protection of their jobs and rights in the new Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>Under the deal, ISPAT International has entered a contractual commitment to employ a minimum of 331 full-time workers in Irish Steel for the first five years of their ownership of the company. This number was arrived at, as 331 is the level of employment that Irish Steel would have attained under its agreed restructuring plan as a result of some further investments.  ISPAT International has also agreed to honour in full all commitments of Irish Steel with regard to labour contracts and pension plans.</P>
    <P>I am confident that Members of the <Col N="1964" /> House will agree that this situation contrasts very favourably with the situation 12 months ago when the plant was on the verge of closure with the likely loss of all employment in the company.  The contractual commitment with ISPAT International also provides that it will pay to the State specified liquidated damages in the event that the number of full-time workers falls below 331.  There was understandable concern among the workforce of Irish Steel and their trade unions that the sale of the company would be prejudicial to their interests and that the job guarantees were not real.  I have assured the unions that the guarantees given by ISPAT are real and substantial and I am satisfied that the trade unions are now fully committed to a new Irish Steel in the full ownership of ISPAT International.</P>
    <P>In the period between the agreement and the EU approval process, a new interim management structure has been formed to oversee the daily operations of the company.  This will allow ISPAT to start work immediately to bring Irish Steel back to profitability, a goal which 12 months ago would have been almost impossible.  Already, the signs are that Irish Steel will be in the black for the first time since 1990.  The position is now much brighter and more hopeful than before.</P>
    <P>This deal which we agreed with ISPAT International is only the first step on the road to privatising Irish Steel, albeit a major step down that road.  Now that the Government has secured what we feel to be the best partner for the company, its next task is to receive the consent of the European Commission, the Council and the unanimous consent of member states on the Council of Ministers to this deal.  On the basis of the contractual agreement between the State and ISPAT International, my Department has submitted a revised State-aid package to the European Commission.  This supplants our earlier application for a £50 million State-aid package.</P>
    <P>A number of parties are unhappy that we have found a partner for Irish Steel. <Col N="1965" /> They were quite confident they could have blocked the approval of the 1994 restructuring plan that required a further £50 million investment. Deputies will be aware that it only requires one dissenting voice in the Council to block it.</P>
    <P>State aid to steel mills is banned by the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty.  The provisions of the treaty for granting a derogation are the strictest in European Union law in enforcing that ban.  It is enforced to ensure that operators, particularly state-owned operators, cannot get unfair advantage over commercial operators through gifts of state funding.  That is why complete unanimity in the Council is required on a positive recommendation to the Council by the European Commission.</P>
    <P>Those who oppose us were confident that they could block Irish Steel's plan because they believed the company would require continuing State support in the years ahead.  They are unhappy because the commitments ISPAT are making to Irish Steel are the strongest and most convincing evidence that this can be a viable, commercial operation. Those parties would be so much happier if they could argue that this was not a real privatisation, and that it will go on needing State cash.  A continuing State involvement would have most assuredly suited them for this purpose.  Already, I know there has been lobbying in an effort to make out that the State continues to be involved even after the sale.</P>
    <P>My Department, with my full support, is pressing the case with the European Commission and the member states for their full and unanimous agreement for the State-aid package to Irish Steel and its full privatisation.  At present discussions are taking place with the EU Commission.  The Commission's consultants must satisfy themselves that ISPAT International's plan for Irish Steel meets their criteria for viability.  It must be proved to the Commission that the company can produce the income and cost structure that would ensure it is self-sustaining.  The Commission must <Col N="1966" /> satisfy itself that the gross operating margin will be adequate, that the depreciation provision is reasonable, that State subsidies do not result in an unfair removal of financial charges and that the return on investment will be reasonable.  If they are not satisfied on these matters, they will not make the necessary recommendations to the Council.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently working with the Commission and I am confident we can convince them that the ISPAT deal meets their criteria so that they will make the necessary recommendations to the Council.  The next meeting of the Council of Industry Ministers is scheduled for 7 November next.  I will push hard for the Council's approval of the Irish Steel deal at that meeting.  Once the EU approval process is completed, I propose to introduce the necessary legislative proposals to enable the sale to be concluded.</P>
    <P>This landmark achievement in the history of Irish Steel has by no means been an easy achievement.  Many people have worked hard for this deal, not least Irish Steel itself.  The Government is committed wholeheartedly to this agreement with ISPAT International.  It is the best possible deal for the company and the Government is confident of a prosperous, profitable future for Irish Steel. I thank the board and the employees of Irish Steel for the hard work they have put into getting the company to the stage where it is possible to attract such a suitable purchaser as ISPAT International.</P>

      <P>I requested this opportunity to discuss Irish Steel when the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, announced the deal on 6 September.  I asked our Whip to get in contact with the Government Chief Whip in this regard.  I am glad the Government agreed to my request for a discussion on this issue on the Dáil's first sitting day after the recess because it is a matter of great importance, both historically and commercially.</P>
      <P>I requested a debate because the sale of Irish Steel is a major issue.  It represents the privatisation of a State company which was founded almost 50 years ago.  Such privatisations of major State companies do not take place on a frequent basis or in the same manner as the sale of Irish Steel with the State selling its shareholding all at once.  For example, the sales in Irish Life and the Irish Sugar Company were on a gradual basis.</P>

    <P>The sale of Irish Steel also takes place against the background of the commitments in the Government's programme which state that State assets will not be <Col N="1968" /> sold except where it protects employment. I agree that vigorous attempts have been made to protect such employment in Irish Steel and it is in the long-term strategic interest of the company and its shareholders.  The programme also states that the Government will retain majority State ownership in those companies and that change in State companies will be managed in the best interests of the employees.</P>
    <P>I have stated publicly that there is broad agreement in my party with what the Minister has done.  My party was part of a Government which lived through many tribulations and vicissitudes in Irish Steel.  However, such broad agreement does not preclude us from asking questions.  The purpose of democracy is to give Governments and Opposition the opportunity to ask those questions in the Dáil.  Political and economic commentators have said that it is great to see the end of what has been debated for so long.</P>
    <P>They ask what is the point of troublesome Mary O'Rourke or anybody else asking questions in the Dáil today?  I say clearly that I have a right to ask questions on behalf of my party and on behalf of the taxpayers and voters who contributed considerable amounts of money and I will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>Not least of the reasons for discussing the sale of Irish Steel is the fact that the company has been a major part of the State for 50 years having been established in 1947.  It is interesting to read about it in the Dáil official reports of that time.  Its role was to supply the domestic and export markets and it quickly became a major employer with over 550 people employed up to June 1993 when the last rationalisation plan began.  As we all know such things are cyclical and Irish Steel was no different from any other producer in Europe.  It enjoyed good times but many bad times.</P>
    <P>In the years after its establishment, Irish Steel enjoyed reasonable success but, as the Minister said, not very dramatic success in any one year.  There were boom times during the 1950s and <Col N="1969" /> 1960s which were the great construction eras.  However, in the 1970s difficulties began to emerge.  Despite the investment by various Governments of £185 million between 1980 and 1993 &mdash; that is a significant amount of money &mdash; Irish Steel recorded losses of £135 million. The investment in Irish Steel was substantial, representing several times the IDA's annual budget.</P>
    <P>The biggest single investment made by a Government was in the 1985 to 1986 period when £24 million was invested, £18 million of it in loan form. That is the £18 million referred to in the Minister's speech and to which I will return.  The current Taoiseach was Minister for Industry and Commerce when this major loan was given and he was succeeded in 1986 by Deputy Noonan, the current Minister for Health.  They will both remember Irish Steel and its trials and tribulations.  The rationalisation of Irish Steel was initiated in 1993 by the Fianna Fáil/Labour Government which considered how the plant could be modernised.  Consultants were appointed and the Minister of the day expended much time and effort on that mission, as indeed we all did at various consultative meetings on the workings of the Department.</P>
    <P>The consultants recommended sweeping changes in work practices, a cut in the size of the workforce and the establishment of a strategic partnership between Irish Steel and another steel/finance company.  I am referring to the Vincent Xavier report.  The rationalisation programme was successful.  To its credit the workforce has been robust and indomitable throughout this saga and despite the presence of some horrendous items on its agenda over the years, it swallowed hard and got on with it.  The workforce accepted major changes and Irish Steel managed to move from a loss of £20.7 million in 1993-94 to a loss of £5.8 million in 1994-95. I am informed by the chairman, Mr. Dineen, that the company is on track to make a small profit of £1 million in this financial year.  This led me to ask whether it is the right time to do what <Col N="1970" /> we are doing but I will address that later.</P>
    <P>I commend the chairman of the board, the board members and the workers for whom that period was difficult. I am broadly supportive of what is happening now but those two years were difficult.  I remember stark meetings, as will the Minister for Finance, when things seemed bleak in the Department of Enterprise and Employment. We wondered where the company was going but the chairman and the workers buckled down to the task.  It is to their credit that we have arrived at this position.  It struck me that considering the company made a small profit of £1 million in this financial year because of that dogged determination, perhaps it was time to let the matter go ahead. That is just a side issue now.  Somewhere in that rationalisation the seeds of the current sale were sown and it is on this that I would like more information.  Will the Minister answer some specific questions about the sale and about his actions?  The reason I seek the information is that I have concerns about the terms which have been agreed.  If the Minister can give satisfactory responses he can allay all concerns about the sale.</P>
    <P>My concern relates to the safeguards which the Minister in his speech says have been built into the deal to protect the workers and the Exchequer. Workers form a key part.  They were instrumental in turning Irish Steel around and preparing it for the sale. Sadly, over 230 jobs were shed.  Major work practice changes were accepted; that was very difficult.</P>
    <P>While ISPAT International guarantees to maintain the employment numbers for five years, what will happen if there is a bad downturn in the world steel industry between now and the end of the decade?  Will there be layoffs or redundancies?  If so, could the State be liable?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to comment on an article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 10 September, 1995, in relation to the Irish Steel deal, to which he referred in his speech.  According to the article, ISPAT <Col N="1971" /> has promised to pay the penalty of £10,000 for every Irish Steel worker made redundant in the next five years and all such payments will go to the Irish Government.  Is this accurate?  If it is, what does it mean for the Exchequer?  Does it mean that the State will have to pay out further redundancy money in the event of ISPAT International letting people go?  Are the Irish Steel unions aware of this arrangement and have they accepted it?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to explain why the Government decided to sell all of the company.  With privatisations, there are often opportunities for the Government to hold a share so that it can have some influence over the future of the company. Was this considered on the agenda for Irish Steel?  Given the commitment in the Government's programme to maintain assets in State ownership and to manage change in the interest of the workforce, how does this Irish Steel sale fit into this scenario?  If the workforce's interests are supposed to be to the fore, how come they do not have a shareholding?  In the case of Aer Lingus, the staff received shares for accepting major changes.  Why is that not the case here?</P>
    <P>I am keen to hear the Minister explain how the deal will be monitored. Will there be an early warning system? Must ISPAT International consult with the Government and/or the workforce before making major changes?</P>
    <P>There is also an onus on the Minister to explain &mdash; and, as I was not present during the Minister's speech, I have been trying to check this &mdash; why ISPAT International was selected and what other offers were received.  I think I received phone calls from interested parties saying that they had submitted proposals for Irish Steel but that these had not been taken up.  Will the Minister explain in his reply why the ISPAT International offer represents the best deal for the State and Irish Steel workers?</P>
    <P>He must also explain why the <Col N="1972" /> Government has gone the route of complete sale rather than taking ISPAT International as a strategic partner, as was laid out by Simpson Xavier report of 1994.  Why has there been a change of tack?</P>
    <P>I noticed when the Minister made the announcement that he hoped Irish Steel would increase in value after the State sold it.  I thought it was a daft statement to make.  One would wish them well but if the Minister expected Irish Steel to increase in value, why should the State not benefit?  This goes back to the tentative doubts which I expressed that we are selling it in a period when it has made a profit, albeit a modest one.  It has recorded a profit due to stringent management and a generous workforce.</P>
    <P>Did the Minister's Department and the Government consider a strategic alliance with ISPAT International?  Various Governments have invested £185 million in Irish Steel over the last 25 years.  The Government has now agreed to write off £17 million of that loan and invest £10.4 million.  The Minister rather blithely said in his speech, &ldquo;Furthermore, the deal provides undertakings from ISPAT to take over all loans, debts and liabilities of Irish Steel with the exception of an old Government loan of £17 million made in the mid-1980s.&rdquo; That was the Government loan made by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, the present Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton.  That is lovely as a throwaway sentence.  Why this loan?  I understand it was supposed to be repaid.</P>
    <P>Everyone knew this would not be repaid.  It is a rather cavalier paragraph. It refers to the exception, which is an old Government loan of £17 million made in the mid-1980s.  One would think from the tone that this was only 17 pence.  The loan is to be extinguished by the Government.  I cannot remember from my time in Cabinet whether such a loan carries on, exists as a debit or a credit, or where it stands in Government expenditure.  A sum of £17 million would pay for much worthwhile work in Departments or help people waiting to <Col N="1973" /> enter VTOS and Youthreach programmes. If one could blithely extinguish all one's debts in this fashion, the Minister for Finance and his successors would have an easy time.  The Minister does neither himself, his portfolio, or his Government justice by inserting this paragraph and I want a better explanation of it.  It appears the legislative proposals will have to be introduced by the Minister to give them effect.  This does not indicate what proposals are planned and when they will be introduced.  I would be glad of answers to those queries.</P>
    <P>It is easy for the Minister to say this is a troublesome child and it is useful for the State to be rid of it through this deal but I do not take such a debonair view. When we needed steel, we set up this company.  Many people spent their lives there, working long hours in dirty, undistinguished circumstances to provide steel when we needed it for building during a good stage in our development. In the 1970s it got into great financial difficulties.  From time to time industries become obsolete and must change tack.  I accept that but I have legitimate questions and a right to have them answered.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Whips were able to arrange this debate and I thank the Minister for giving the details.  Nonetheless I ask him to answer my questions.  I wish Irish Steel, its workers and management many fruitful years ahead.  I thank them and their predecessors for their work in Irish Steel, which in its day was a major State company giving a fine product to this country.</P>

      <P>I am delighted Irish Steel has been saved and privatised.  I am pleased for the 331 workers and their families and those involved in ancillary industries in Cork harbour. Having said that, the Irish State's involvement in steel making has been unhappy.  Whatever about the justification for getting involved in steel in 1947 in the European post-war economic boom when steel became a readily <Col N="1974" /> available commodity on the open market, there was no justification for continued State involvement and the rationale for it soon disappeared.</P>
      <P>It is a pity Irish Steel was not privatised earlier.  Who knows how it might have fared?  There may have been job losses but the management, free from political direction, would have been able to make the changes which would have allowed the company to cope with international competition.  However, that did not happen.</P>
      <P>The decision to privatise Irish Steel is an important ideological departure for this Government, especially for Labour. I remember the Tánaiste saying that if privatisation was countenanced, his party would withdraw from Government. I welcome the conversion of Labour and hope we can all learn lessons from the State's involvement in this company.  As expensive as our experience in Irish Steel may have been, if we learn a lesson which can be applied in other State companies it may have been worth it.</P>
      <P>There has been an ill-fated attempt especially since 1981, to prop up Irish Steel.  At 1995 prices, £200 million has been spent.  That is £600,000 for every job now maintained at Irish Steel, enough to allow all the employees set up their own business.  We should not forget the expensive cost of maintaining those 331 jobs.  It is interesting to note &mdash; and I have seen comments, particularly from local constituency TDs &mdash; that this is a strategic industry.  I do not believe we have maintained a stategic industry.  There are fewer people working in Irish Steel now than there are in the McDonald's hamburger chain of restaurants.  If that is strategic, I do not know what strategy is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of this Government seem to take the view that bureaucrats can pour money into industries and in that way create jobs.  I want to refer in particular to an unusual but blistering attack made by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry on the IDA.  The IDA reports to both the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the <Col N="1975" /> Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry. I do not know if the Minister's comments were a condemnation of his own efforts or the efforts of his colleagues but it was a very unusual statement. If any Minister says that because there are three Ministers in his constituency the IDA should get its finger out what does that say to the 28 constituencies that do not have a Cabinet Minister? Does it say that there is to be a two tier approach by the Government whereby public money is sent in the direction of those constituencies represented by Cabinet Ministers while ignoring constituencies unfortunate enough not to be so represented?  The Minister should come into this House and withdraw the comments he made.  They were unfortunate and particularly regrettable from a Minister who has responsibility for the IDA and to whom the IDA has occasion to report.  They also underline an attitude that exists in certain Government and other circles that if money is thrown at constituencies or industries, that is the only way to create jobs. Bureaucrats, the IDA or any body of that kind will not generate employment. In this and other countries employment is generated by opportunity.  Investors invest where there is an opportunity for them to make a profit and job creation and employment flow from that.  If we really want to encourage investment in Wexford or any other area we must change, in particular, our anti-work taxation system.  That is the single greatest vehicle available to the Government to generate employment.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that I welcomed the privatisation of Irish Steel.  Unlike Deputy O'Rourke, I do not think it would have been either desirable or feasible for the Government to have maintained an interest in this company.  The Government is right to get out of Irish Steel and I regret that previous Governments, including one in which my party was involved, did not avail of the opportunity to exit from this company a long time ago.  Privatisation improves competition, increases efficiency and reduces <Col N="1976" /> costs for domestic and industrial consumers of the products of the particular companies.  It saves the taxpayer from having to invest in capital expenditure &mdash; in the case of Irish Steel it would have saved £200 million &mdash; and it boosts public finances because money is paid to the Exchequer.  However, this is an unusual privatisation because instead of being paid money for what would normally be regarded as an asset, we are forced to pay almost £10.5 million to the investor.  We are boosting the pension plan and writing off the £17 million debts of Irish Steel.  In all, this privatisation is costing the taxpayer £28 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Privatisation normally involves privatising an asset.  The point I am making is that this is not an asset and has not been for some considerable time.  If it were an asset, we would not be paying money to somebody to take it; we would simply write a nominal cheque for £1.  I would like the Minister to explain what other interested parties were approached.  I presume the Government took the best investor both from the point of view of jobs and the future of the company.</P>
      <P>If the Government can justify the privatisation of Irish Steel, how can it justify the continued participation in the Great Southern Hotels, the National Petroleum Corporation, NET, and other State companies?  We should learn some lessons from what is currently taking place in Hungary, a former Communist state.  The Hungarian privatisation authority is currently privatising its entire electricity generation and distribution system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A London merchant bank is handling it and is seeking interested bidders.  The company is being broken up into 13 subsidiaries. If the former Communist blocs can make such sound commercial decisions then we should not be running away from making the obvious commercial decisions in Ireland.  We have to be <Col N="1977" /> pragmatic when it comes to these matters. The question of privatisation is not an ideological issue, it is a pragmatic one.  I should say at the outset, because it is often misunderstood, I do not favour the privatisation of State companies. I do not favour private monopolies taking over from State monopolies: that is even more sinister and more damaging. The consumers and the taxpayers will benefit only if there is competition and only in that way is there efficiency.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain if his Department has plans in relation to any other companies under the auspices of the Department of Enterprise and Employment?  Has the Government appointed consultants to companies other than Telecom?  What is the Government's attitude to privatisation? Are we likely to see a change?  Are we likely to see a pragmatic approach being adopted at a time when the State has enormous debts?  I am pleased to see the Minister for Finance in the House. It is not satisfactory that a country that owes £28 billion, has such high levels of tax on work and such a small productive base can maintain an interest in companies that are in no sense strategic to the development of this economy.</P>
    <P>I welcome and support what the Government is doing and I hope we all learn lessons.  I hope the management of State companies generally will benefit from the experience of Irish Steel.  I wish Irish Steel and its workers well with the new company ISPAT International. I hope it thrives and succeeds and, freed from political involvement and political direction, that the best commercial decisions can be made.  At the end of the day that is the only way to maintain real jobs that can benefit the economy nationally and the regional economy in Cork harbour and the east Cork area generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, as Minister for Finance and as a former Minister for Enterprise and Employment I am pleased to be in a position this afternoon to address the House on what is a <Col N="1978" /> very positive outcome.  Efforts to secure a future for the Irish Steel company as an economic entity and, in particular, to secure the jobs of those employed at the plant have absorbed much of my time and political energy over the last two years &mdash; a matter referred to by Deputy O'Rourke.  I am delighted that this effort, together with that of many others, has now borne fruit.  I pay tribute to my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, for the successful conclusion of that difficult task.</P>
      <P>Those involved in mapping out a new future for Irish Steel have travelled a long road and have had to overcome many obstacles, both those of an impersonal, economic nature and those of a very personal, human kind.  At times these obstacles appeared well nigh insurmountable and the successful conclusion now in prospect is a tribute to the tenacity and hard work of all those who refused to give up.</P>
      <P>Deputies may recall that in late 1993, in my capacity as Minister for Enterprise and Employment, I commissioned a consultancy report on the future viability of the company.  I was convinced at that time of the need for a fundamental reappraisal of the company's strengths, weaknesses and prospects. The results of this exercise made it quite clear that, without a radical reorganisation of work practices and a lowering of the cost base, the company had no economic future.  Even with those measures in place, the preferable course was to find a strategic partner who could provide both capital and expertise in the years ahead.  Acceptance of these findings led to a recovery plan spearheaded by Mr. Pat Dineen whom I appointed as executive chairman in April 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now a matter of history that initially agreement proved virtually impossible.  The measures proposed were too unpalatable and there was no general agreement that they were necessary. However, believing that recovery depended on their successful implementation, I gave the management of the <Col N="1979" /> company my unequivocal and total support. In that respect I wish to respond to a matter alluded to by Deputy Harney. State companies have managed to be immensely successful in a variety of different countries where they were not subject to unwarranted and, in particular, non-commercial political influence. Nobody would say Renault is an unsuccessful company in commercial terms &mdash; and it is state owned.  There are many successful state banks in Japan and Germany and it was the private ownership of the British car industry, particularly British Leyland that brought that company to the point where it had to be rescued by the state.  As Deputy Harney said, this is more a question of pragmatism rather than ideology.  There is a lesson for all of us and this is not to interfere politically in the commercial running of any company, be it publicly or privately owned.</P>
    <P>It was a very difficult job and it was essential to identify the long-term interest and not be deterred by short-term difficulties.  I pay tribute to the work of two bodies which were crucial to the successful outcome of the negotiations and to the agreement of the workforce to the very difficult package arrived at in August of last year &mdash; the Labour Relations Commission, led by Mr. Kieran Mulvey and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and in particular Mr. Kevin Duffy.  Both paid a key role in securing agreement from the workforce. I pay tribute also to my colleague, Deputy John Mulvihill for his tenacity and behind-the-scenes work and for his constant intervention on behalf of the workforce.</P>
    <P>Despite further difficulties the agreements eventually arrived at enabled me to secure the support of the Government to approach the EU for approval to invest up to £50 million, if necessary, in Irish Steel and I was able to authorise a new search for a strategic partner for the company.  Not only would such a partner help to win the unanimous agreement necessary from our EU partners for new investment but it would <Col N="1980" /> place the company in a much better position to develop its business in a broader economic context.</P>
    <P>The recent agreement reached with ISPAT is the outcome of this later stage of the recovery plan.  It is quite clear that without the successful changes painfully implemented at the company from late 1994 onwards, it would not have been possible to find a partner. Furthermore, it would have proved extremely difficult to win approval for investment by the State in the company on a &ldquo;go-it-alone&rdquo; basis.  That ISPAT wished to negotiate for a 100 per cent shareholding is indicative of its faith in its capacity to develop the company successfully as part of a wider group.</P>
    <P>The agreement reached with ISPAT is a very good one from the perspective of the company and its employees, of the wider community in Cobh and of the taxpayer.  It is fully in accord with the principles set out in the programme a Government of Renewal negotiated by the three parties in Government.  It achieves the objectives set out.</P>
    <P>My colleague the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, will address the question of 100 per cent ownership.  I can speak only for the Labour Party which with the other parties in Government signed up for the programme a Government of Renewal and we are quite satisfied as indeed are the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that this is in accord with the policy principle set in the Programme a Government of Renewal.</P>
    <P>I compliment the management of the company, in particular Mr. Pat Dineen, executive chairman and Mr. Leslie Buckley, acting chief executive who without faltering together steered through the recovery plan in circumstances where others may have thrown in the towel.  We owe them a substantial vote of thanks.  I pay tribute also, to the effort of the many officials in the Departments of Finance and Enterprise and Employment especially two people without whose tenacity and dedication this deal would not have gone through, that is the Assistant Secretary in the <Col N="1981" /> Department of Enterprise and Employment, Mr. Ronald Long, and a senior official in my Department, Mr. Michael Cunniffe.  I commend the workforce in Irish Steel for their perseverance and commitment during the past 18 months and for their bravery in facing up to the challenges necessary to ensure a viable future for the Cobh plant.  Together they have helped to put in place a deal which augers well for the future.</P>
    <P>I hope this company is successful.  I wish it well.  I hope it becomes a very profitable entity and that we get a flow of tax income that will enable us to do other things.  There are lessons for everyone from the experience of Irish Steel and they have to be applied to every other enterprise irrespective of the nature of its ownership.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on what hopefully will be the last saga for Irish Steel.  Since I became a Member of the House in 1982 there have been many crises in this company which has absorbed £185 million of taxpayers' money.  However, it should also be said that Irish Steel has given gainful employment to many people over the years &mdash; the workforce of 1,000 when the company was set up 20 years ago was first reduced to 561 and then to 331 &mdash; and provided a living for associated businesses and suppliers in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As time went on it was correctly decided that it was unsustainable to maintain a company with such losses and the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Albert Reynolds, tried very hard to get someone to invest in Irish Steel.  However, there was a change in Government and, contrary to what Deputy Harney said, the new Minister, Deputy O'Malley, decided not to sell the company.  I am not sure what he wants because he spends all his time talking about privatisation but when he had an opportunity to privatise a company he shut the gate on this idea.  Since then the leadership of the Progressive <Col N="1982" /> Democrats seems to have had a different view from what we heard this afternoon.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel continued to go down the tubes and when it finally came to the wall last year the Minister for Enterprise and Employment set up an investigating body.  Even though its recommendations were tough they were the only viable ones if the company was to survive.  The workforce knuckled down and there was a change in practices; it was accepted that in order for the company to survive there had to be change.  If those changes had not occurred it would not have been possible to sell the company.</P>
    <P>I hope the European Commission will allow the Government to proceed with the project, without which Irish Steel will not be able to survive.  Regardless of what Deputy Harney said, it is vitally important that the jobs in this company and related companies are maintained in the Cobh and Cork Harbour areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke referred to the fears expressed by some people about, for example, the safeguards built into the deal to protect Irish Steel workers and the Exchequer.  While ISPAT has guaranteed to maintain the employment numbers in Irish Steel for five years what will happen if there is a severe downturn in the world's steel industry between now and the end of the decade? If there are lay offs will the redundancy sums paid to the workers be calculated from the date they were first employed by Irish Steel or will the State have to pick up the tab?  It has been reported in the newspapers that £10,000 will be paid to all Irish Steel workers made redundant during the next five years.  Will the Minister expand on that point?  Does the State have to pay the redundancy if these people are laid off?</P>
    <P>The decision to sell Irish Steel is a very important one for employment in the Cobh area, and it must have been a difficult one for the Labour Party whose philosophy is not to sell any State industries. I compliment the Minister for Finance who, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, looked at this <Col N="1983" /> problem in a practical way and gave the type of support necessary to the management, the chairman and the acting chief executive to carry out the necessary works to make the company acceptable to a purchaser.  I hope it will be successful and that, in the years to come, we will not have to come here to make a case for the granting of aid to keep that industry going.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put on record my acknowledgement of the role played by the former Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn.  I was pleased to pick up the baton for much of the work he put in.  I would also like to associate myself with the unusual acknowledgement of the service of particular public servants, most notably, Ronald Long, and the many people, including Pat Dineen and Leslie Buckley on the board and the workers in Irish Steel, who put in a huge amount of work to get us where we are today.  However, I would like to devote most of my attention to the issues raised by various Deputies.</P>
      <P>As to whether this is timely, the last 12 months or so have been a period of high steel prices.  Breaking even this year is a feature of a particularly good period in the cycle.  Unfortunately, the track record of Irish Steel over earlier years was far from successful during the troughs, and the viability plan, which would not have involved the sale, would have run into severe difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies need not worry that we are missing out on the opportunity of retaining an interest in Irish Steel.  They wanted to know if we could not have kept some shareholding, either a strategic partner or worker sharing.  The companies who made a bid all did so on the basis of a 100 per cent shareholding &mdash; they were not interested in a minority shareholding.  All but one did not measure up on many other more important criteria relating to employment and capital investment.  The quality proposals were for a 100 per cent <Col N="1984" /> shareholding.  Let it be said also that the biggest fear the EU would have in examining a package such as this would be that there would be an opportunity for continuing State aid.  The 100 per cent sale puts us in a much stronger position to deal with the EU in the context of approval of this deal.</P>
    <P>The issue of what would happen in the event of a downturn was also raised. We have enforceable contractual commitments with ISPAT within this deal so that in the event of a downturn and their being unable to meet their employment commitments they would be bound by the contractual terms.  The State would not be liable for redundancy payments but would realise liquidated damages if they failed to maintain employment.  The Government would address the needs of workers in such a context where it received such damages.</P>
    <P>The monitoring of the deal was also raised.  We have detailed monitoring arrangements worked out whereby the company will provide us with all information we require relating to employment, maintenance of the business, capital expenditure, profit and loss, balance sheet, financial ratios, etc.  We will monitor any major change in the business.</P>
    <P>This path was selected against the background of a number of criteria, most important of which were security of employment, quality of investment being made for the future and the strength of the company coming forward. Across a range of carefully appraised measures it was clear that this path scored highest.  It gave a firm commitment to employment levels and to a £30 million investment made up of £5 million working capital and £25 million capital investment over five years.  This company has a broad range of experience in the business and a track record of turning around companies it has acquired, many of them from State ownership.  It has a deep resource in terms of its net value and turnover.  It is an outstanding company with the capacity to bring many strengths to Irish Steel to restructure its product mix and <Col N="1985" /> add value to its product base.  That will greatly strengthen the company.</P>
    <P>Regarding why £17 million was written off, the Deputy will have to study the company's background.  It had sustained losses of £145 million and we faced a closure cost of £40 million if we decided to close it.  If we proceeded with the restructuring plan proposed by Irish Steel, it would have cost £50 million in terms of investment and we would have run a serious risk that such a plan would not meet with EU approval.  We had received indications that it would run into severe difficulties.  It is costing us money to put in place a long term viable package for Irish Steel, but the package offers the very best chance of success and minimises the exposure to the taxpayer compared to either of the other options.  Against that background it is a good deal.  I understand legislation will be introduced when EU approval is secured.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy Ahern that redundancy sums will be calculated on the basis of full service.  ISPAT has undertaken full labour contracts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney raised an extraneous question concerning comments made by my ministerial colleague, Deputy Yates, about the IDA's performance in Wexford. While no doubt he can speak for himself, he was playing for the local team in his constituency when he made those comments.</P>

      <P>The IDA has an independent statutory remit.  It is not prone to Government influence and I am steadfast in my belief that it must pursue its independent remit.  It has an independent board which jealously protects that independence.  I am impressed with its recent performance.  Its quality performance deserves credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased we have had an opportunity to have this debate.  The Opposition has a right and a duty to raise questions about proposals such as this.  I hope I have dealt with the questions <Col N="1986" /> asked and I ask for the support of all Members of the House &mdash; and I am sure I have it &mdash; in our endeavours to secure EU approval for this deal.  It is a good way forward for Irish Steel.  It meets the EU requirements and is a credit to many present today who contributed a good deal and to the workers who made so many sacrifices over a long period.</P>

    <Title>Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1995: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg) Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would like to put the Bill in context. This Bill has its origins in a proposal for a Bill to provide for a variety of issues including, principally, measures to facilitate the construction by Bord Gáis Éireann, BGE, of the Ireland-UK natural gas interconnector.  In the event, the provisions relating to the construction of the interconnector became urgent and it was necessary to proceed with these on their own, culminating in the passage of the Gas (Amendment) Act, 1993.  The remaining issues had to be deferred and these, together with a number of additional issues which have arisen since then, form the subject matter of the Bill now before the House. As a result, the Bill contains a range of provisions relating to BGE specifically, as well as provisions relating to other aspects of the energy sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As its Title indicates, the Bill deals with a variety of energy issues relating to the production, supply, sale, transmission, distribution and use of certain forms of energy and matters incidental to those activities.  The Bill provides for measures to facilitate the activities of BGE and ministerial control thereof, regulation of the operation of gas pipelines and electricity cables offshore, inspection of energy infrastructural facilities, investigation of accidents involving those facilities, extending and strengthening the Minister's powers to grant offshore licensing and-or lease <Col N="1987" /> undertakings, amendment of legislation relating to superannuation in the ESB, measures to deal with the theft of electricity and gas and recoupment from the ESB of the cost of reviews of the provision and regulation of electricity services carried out by or on behalf of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I know it is a coincidence but it is also somewhat appropriate that the House is dealing with this Bill today in the middle of Energy Awareness Week. Energy plays a major role in our economy, with both economic and social implications; the annual final energy demand bill, at approximately £2.5 billion, is about 10 per cent of GNP. Our energy policy has three primary objectives, namely, the supply of a choice of fuels to consumers as efficiently as possible, at internationally competitive prices, taking account of supply security, socio-economic and environmental considerations; the consumption of this energy as efficiently as possible; and the production of as much of national energy requirements from indigenous sources as is economically possible.</P>
    <P>I include in the final objective what are now called &ldquo;renewables&rdquo; and &ldquo;alternatives&rdquo;&mdash; wind, hydro and biomass. For example, some months ago I announced the results of the alternative energy requirement scheme.  Assuming that all the projects proceed, 111 megawatts of capacity would be installed under this heading.  The electricity generated would represent a 35 per cent increase on present production from alternative sources and alternative energy would then supply about 10 per cent of our total electricity needs.</P>
    <P>The facts that our total final consumption of energy is increasing and that more than half of the fuel for this is imported highlight the need for measures to achieve efficiency in the use of energy.  This can be achieved by raising awareness of the importance of energy efficiency, by ensuring efficient and rational use and by providing incentives where appropriate.  Ensuring that <Col N="1988" /> energy is consumed as efficiently as possible is one of the three main pillars of Irish energy policy.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Irish Energy Centre and the development of a cohesive national energy conservation policy recognise that in order to promote energy efficiency, it is necessary to create a new culture in relation to energy consumption.  It is necessary also to provide sound advice and expert guidance in relation to best practice in individual sectors, to encourage the development of companies offering energy audit facilities and to provide incentives to companies to invest in new systems and technology.  Initiatives in this area must be linked with EU targets and objectives within the Union's energy and environment policies.</P>
    <P>It is also accepted that proper infrastructure is needed to develop and coordinate activities within this programme. The Irish Energy Centre, coupled with the active participation of the member organisations of the Energy Advisory Board, is responding to that need and the benefits to the Irish economy are now becoming apparent.</P>
    <P>In regard to energy costs, consumers here face a number of competitive disadvantages compared to elsewhere in the EU due to the characteristics of the Irish energy sector.  Our geographical situation on the periphery of Europe, for example, adds to the costs of energy supply, particularly electricity and gas. Being isolated, our national electricity system must maintain excess standby capacity as spinning reserve, so adding to costs.  Our population settlement pattern is also an important factor, our population density, at 51 per square kilometre, being low by comparison with the EU average of 151 per square kilometre.</P>
    <P>A number of sections of the Bill deal with BGE.  Accordingly I propose to give the House some information about BGE's performance and the major issues affecting the board at this juncture. BGE is a highly successful State body which has performed satisfactorily <Col N="1989" /> since its establishment in 1976.  It supplies a varied market, including domestic and industrial-commercial users, the ESB and NET.  Domestic and industrial-commercial users account for 35 per cent of gas sales and 61 per cent of revenue.  Gas deliveries to the ESB account for 42 per cent of total deliveries while deliveries to NET account for 23 per cent.  In terms of revenue, the ESB contributes 31 per cent and NET 8 per cent.</P>
    <P>BGE has developed the gas industry so that gas now contributes 17 per cent of our total primary energy requirement, as against 6 per cent in 1980.  It also contributes 26 per cent of the fuels input to electricity generation.  Domestic customers have increased by an average of 9 per cent per annum over the last three years and now stand at 233,000, representing over 30 per cent of all Irish homes.  Bord Gáis Éireann plans to have natural gas available to 40 per cent of all Irish homes by the end of this decade, which would be the equivalent of 75 per cent of all homes within the area of the gas grid.</P>
    <P>All this progress has been achieved without the need for any State investment in BGE.  On the contrary, the Exchequer has benefited to the tune of a total of £394 million in contributions from BGE.  Therefore, not only gas consumers but the whole economy has reaped the benefits of BGE's success. This success story is due in a major part to the expertise and resourcefulness of the chairman, Dr. Michael Conlon, the board, the chief executive, Mr. Philip Cronin, and the management and staff of BGE.  I congratulate them on their continued success.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis Éireann has a statutory obligation to develop and maintain a system for the supply of natural gas on a commercial basis and any proposals for extension of the gas grid are assessed by the board in the light of that obligation. Only projects which meet the board's economic criteria are undertaken.  In that context, I have asked the board to investigate the economics of extensions to Shannon, Ennis, Tralee, Galway and <Col N="1990" /> other towns, as I am anxious that the network should be extended to other areas of the country where that would be commercially viable.</P>
    <P>The gas industry has reached an important milestone in its history, with the construction of the Ireland-UK natural gas interconnector.  This major addition to the gas infrastructure comprises onshore pipelines and facilities in Ireland and Scotland, an undersea pipeline and a compressor station in Scotland. All the onshore and undersea pipeline elements of the project have been completed, while the compressor station is expected to be completed shortly.</P>
    <P>The interconnector was built by BGE to provide gas supplies when the Kinsale and associated Ballycotton gas fields are depleted, which is expected to be in the next five years or so, and to provide an alternative supply in the event of any disruption of that source prior to depletion.  BGE will then have to purchase all of its gas requirements on the UK-Norwegian markets unless &mdash; as I hope &mdash; adequate further indigenous supplies are discovered and developed in the meantime.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis Éireann informed me that it is in negotiation for the import of gas from the UK through the interconnector on behalf of a third party.  In addition, BGE will import gas from the UK to meet other market requirements which cannot be met by Kinsale Head-Ballycotton gas fields.  From October 1996 BGE will start to import gas to meet peak winter requirements for the domestic, industrial and commercial markets.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that since December 1993 small volumes of gas have been imported through the pipeline. Also, the pipeline has provided security of supply facilities to protect BGE's core market of 240,000 customers should there be an interruption in supplies of gas from the Kinsale Head-Ballycotton fields.  I should add that if further indigenous gas supplies are discovered, the interconnector could <Col N="1991" /> be used to export any gas surplus to our requirements.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis Éireann expects to conclude negotiation shortly for the sale of capacity on part of the Scottish onshore pipeline, from Moffat to Twynholme, to a subsidiary of British Gas which will be involved in the transport of gas to the Ballylumford power station in Northern Ireland through its own subsea pipeline on and from October 1996.</P>
    <P>European Union proposals pose a further challenge for BGE.  In 1992, the European Commission produced two proposals for directives concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and common rules for the internal market in gas.  Following amendments proposed by the European Parliament, the Commission reissued an amended version of the draft directives at the end of 1993.  Since then, the draft directive concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity has been extensively discussed, while the draft directive on gas has been put on hold until the draft directive on electricity has been finalised.  However, it is likely that the draft directive on gas will be considered by the EU Council in the near future.</P>
    <P>Among other things, the draft directive proposes the introduction of arrangements for the use of gas networks by large industrial consumers for the transmission of their own gas at negotiated charges, a facility normally referred to as third party access.  The draft directive also proposes that gas undertakings must keep separate accounts for the divisions dealing with production, transmission, storage and distribution activities, in the same manner as they would be required to do if the divisions were separate companies.</P>
    <P>The draft directive is at an early stage and will certainly be fully debated and probably amended before its adoption. I assure the House that I will strive for a final directive that will safeguard the interests of the Irish consumer, the Irish economy and the livelihoods of those <Col N="1992" /> employed in the gas industry.  I am consulting with interested parties on the draft directive in that regard.  Against that background and recognising the challenges which face it, BGE engaged consultants to advise it on the enhancement of the key business processes and greater customer focus.</P>
    <P>Sections 7, 8, 12 and 13 of the Bill are relevant to BGE.  These provisions are designed to enable BGE to function more effectively.  I will explain the purposes of these provisions later in my speech.  If a need arises for further legislation to facilitate BGE in coping with the challenges of the future, I will, of course, bring forward such legislation at an early date.  The Bill includes provisions relating to exploration for oil and gas.  The promotion of hydrocarbon exploration is an activity to which the Government attaches considerable importance in the context of national economic development.  Further petroleum production from the Irish offshore would add to the immense benefits bestowed on the national economy arising from the production of our own natural gas.  With that in mind, it is my intention that every effort should continue to be made to make further commercial discoveries a reality.</P>
    <P>The current taxation measures and licensing terms are specially designed to attract the interest of exploration companies in the Irish offshore.  These measures have placed Ireland in a competitive position on the world scale for attracting exploration interest.  In recent times, stringent efforts have been made to highlight the benefits that can accrue to companies which discover petroleum in Ireland and I am happy to record that substantial progress has been made in enticing companies to explore in our offshore.</P>
    <P>A strong interest has been stimulated in exploration and currently there are 24 exploration licences in place.  There has also been a steady increase in licensing options and at present nine options covering 34 blocks or part blocks thereof are in force.  It is expected that a <Col N="1993" /> number of those options will be converted to exploration licences carrying well-drilling obligations.  The number of major exploration companies now turning their attention towards offshore Ireland gives me confidence that this renewed interest will result in a significant increase in exploration activity in the coming years.  In 1993 the frontier licensing round in the Slyne and Erris troughs off the north-west coast of Ireland resulted in a very positive response with ten exploration companies in five groups being awarded licences over 28 blocks.  The Slyne-Erris round signalled the return of a number of oil companies to Ireland and introduced a number of new companies to Ireland in addition to providing opportunities for established companies to expand their interests here.</P>
    <P>The interest shown in the Slyne-Erris round was surpassed by the Porcupine licensing round which closed on 15 December 1994.  Some 16 exploration companies submitted 11 applications for 35 blocks in the area and last March eight licences were awarded to groups representing 15 companies in respect of 32 blocks.  Ireland now has a very good coverage of licences and effective exploration programmes have been committed over Ireland's prime prospective acreage, ranging from the Irish Sea across the Celtic Sea to the Porcupine and Slyne-Erris basins off the west coast.  The licences represent a good balance between shallow water and frontier areas.  I am hopeful that the efforts in these basins will prove fruitful.</P>
    <P>The frontier licences facilitate companies to work in deep water and provide opportunities for Ireland to gain from the rapid technical advances that enable hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation in deep water and hostile environments.  Nowadays smaller fields can be economically exploited due to the recent evolution in low cost, fast track development.</P>
    <P>In addition to awarding licences under rounds, it is my policy to operate an &ldquo;open door&rdquo; licensing system for acreage which is available for licensing. <Col N="1994" /> The use of both licensing rounds and the open door system has served Ireland well in recent years and it is my intention to continue with this policy. However, I have decided that two areas should not be available for the present. The Porcupine Basin was not reopened following the close of the round in December 1994.  In addition, the Rockall trough has been closed to encourage acquisition of data and preparation of assessment reports so that its hydrocarbon potential could be properly assessed.  I expect to be in a position to make an announcement of future licensing opportunities in the Rockall trough in May 1996.</P>
    <P>I take particular pleasure from the announcement of the test results of the recent appraisal well, drilled by Marathon just 4.5 miles south west of the Kinsale Head Gas Bravo platform.  The initial results appear to indicate the presence of &ldquo;new&rdquo; gas, that is gas that would not be possible to extract through the existing Kinsale Head field facilities. This encouraging news endorses the confidence already shown by oil companies in Ireland's offshore and further enhances the attractiveness of investment in it.</P>
    <P>The test results are now being analysed with a view to establishing the feasibility of extracting the gas. Although further analysis of the data acquired during the testing period is required, the fact that the well has been suspended gives hope that it may be possible for Marathon to declare commerciality later this year.</P>
    <P>At this point I will outline the main provisions of the Bill.  Under section 40 (1) of the Gas Act, 1976, persons other than BGE may not construct or operate a gas pipeline over or under the surface of land, without the giving of previous and reasonable notice to the Minister. Section 2 of the Bill will extend that restriction to the seabed in the territorial seas of the State or to a designated area within the meaning of the Continental Shelf Act, 1968.  The need <Col N="1995" /> for the provision arises from the growing international trend towards the construction of international energy inter-connectors.</P>
    <P>The Continental Shelf Act at present covers only pipelines laid in connection with the exploitation of the Irish continental shelf.  Section 3 of the Bill extends the relevant provisions of the Continental Shelf Act to apply also to pipelines crossing the Irish continental shelf carrying gas and to electricity cables.  The opportunity is also being taken to amend section 7 of the Continental Shelf Act in order to provide the Minister with the powers to make regulations to control the discharge of polluting substances.  As a consequence of this amendment, section 6 of the Bill amends the Sea Pollution Act, 1991 so as to exclude pollution from pipelines and cables from that Act.</P>
    <P>Section 4 amends sections 5, 6 and 12 of the Continental Shelf Act so as to control the construction, alteration or improvement of any structure or works in a designated area and the removal of any object or material from a designated area without the consent of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and the Minister for the Marine. The functions of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications relate to the orderly and proper use of a designated area while the Minister for the Marine's functions relate to safety of navigation.</P>
    <P>Section 5 amends section 48 (1) of the Safety, Health and Welfare (Offshore Installations) Act, 1987 so as to extend that section to cover any provision of the Continental Shelf Act, 1968 rather than just section 3 of the 1968 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the extension of the powers of BGE to effect certain commercial transactions, e.g. to establish subsidiaries and to lend or advance money or guarantee repayment of moneys by subsidiary companies.  For the most part, this section incorporates into statute the provisions of section 9 of the Gas Act, 1976 and the Establishment of Subsidiaries Order, 1990.  The <Col N="1996" /> powers in the order are being extended to include the power to guarantee the contracts and obligations of third parties. This is deemed necessary to ensure that BGE is not placed at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> its competitors at home and abroad.  BGE operates in a competitive energy market and should have powers equivalent to those of a company incorporated under the Companies Acts to engage in commercial transactions. From time to time in the course of negotiating its contracts, the board is required to give valid and effective guarantees and indemnities as a matter of commercial bargain and necessity.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is being taken to clarify the arrangements for BGE in relation to the establishment of subsidiaries, lending money or guaranteeing repayment of moneys by subsidiaries by providing that the exercise of such powers by the board shall be subject to the prior written consent of the Minister, given with the approval of the Minister for Finance.  Sections 18 and 21 make similar provision in respect of the Electricity Supply Board and Bord na Móna, respectively.  These controls already apply in the case of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for an extension of BGE's borrowing powers for capital purposes to enable the board to issue securities, e.g. the creation of stock or other forms of securities.  BGE has informed me that the absence of these powers has caused some difficulty for the board in arranging for borrowing on the most attractive terms.  For example, some bodies wishing to deal with BGE in this regard cannot do so because of the constitution of those bodies.  The provision in section 8 will overcome this problem.  All proposals in this area will be subject to the consent and approval of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>There is a need to strengthen the Minister's powers regarding the inspection of energy infrastructures.  The Minister's powers to inspect energy infrastructures such as exploration and <Col N="1997" /> production platforms at sea, electricity plants, powerlines, gas installations, oil refineries and pipelines are fragmented at present.  The Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960 contains some powers in relation to petroleum leases and licences.  Energy infrastructure is likely to become more widespread and diverse in nature and may increasingly be operated under the control of non-State bodies.  It is important that the Minister should have a power, through authorised officers, to oversee all energy operations capable of being a source of risk to the public or the environment and to ensure that they are conducted in conformity with good industrial practice and in accordance with statutory requirements.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides the Minister with the power to appoint authorised officers to inspect energy infrastructures and to oversee all energy operations capable of being a risk to the public or the environment. Authorised officers would be appointed following consultation with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment where appropriate and the powers and duties of authorised officers are set out in the Bill.  The authorised officers will be empowered to enforce industry standards and statutory duties in the construction, operation or decommissioning of energy infrastructures.</P>
    <P>Section 10 will empower the Minister to order an investigation into an accident or incident involving an energy infrastructure.  Apart from existing law relating to safety in workplaces, to the holding of inquiries, and in the case of the gas industry, to the investigation of gas related incidents by BGE on his behalf, there is no power available to the Minister to examine the causes of major or serious incidents involving, for example, drilling rigs at sea and gas or oil production platforms.  The powers under this section would be used where the procedures under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 are inappropriate and would provide also for ancillary powers relating to the holding of investigations, the protection of <Col N="1998" /> life and property following such incidents.</P>
    <P>Section 11 details a number of restrictions on the exercise of powers in relation to holding investigations. Where power is vested in a person other than the Minister under any Act to conduct an investigation, the Minister is required to establish whether that person proposes to hold an investigation.  If that person proposes to hold an investigation and if the Minister is satisfied that such investigation will give enough information and facts as regards the matters of concern to him, the Minister would not hold a separate investigation. This section is designed to avoid duplication of investigations.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the formal vesting, by ministerial order, in Bord Gáis Éireann of the assets of the former town gas utilities acquired by BGE to consolidate ownership of BGE's assets. The conveyance of these assets would normally give rise to the imposition of stamp duties, which could amount to nearly £3 million.  Section 12 obviates the need for BGE to rely on a legal conveyance and thereby avoid the payment of duty.</P>
    <P>The utilities in question are: Dublin Gas Company; Limerick Gas Company Limited; Cork Gas Company; City of Waterford Gas Company; and Clonmel Gas Company Limited.  Bord Gáis Éireann took over the assets of the Dublin Gas Company to secure the continued distribution of gas to Dublin in a safe, efficient and progressive manner. Likewise, BGE acquired the other four town gas utilities to ensure that their customers continued to receive gas supplies.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides for the creation of offences and associated penalties relating to the theft of electricity and gas.  The relevant provision of the existing legislation, the Larceny Act, 1916, relating to this subject, in so far as electricity is concerned, is being repealed. The legal experience of bringing prosecutions under the existing legislation <Col N="1999" /> was most unsatisfactory and much difficulty was encountered in securing convictions. Accordingly, new provisions are required in a single statute.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to strengthen the Minister's powers in relation to undertakings to grant exploration licences, known as licensing options, undertakings to grant petroleum prospecting licences and undertakings to grant petroleum leases. The existing provisions of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960, do not specify that the Minister may impose conditions when granting these authorisations and do not refer to their revocation where the holder fails to comply with the conditions attached.  The amendment to the 1960 Act in section 14 of this Bill will enable the Minister to issue these undertakings subject to such terms and conditions as may be necessary.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 15 is to extend the scope of the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Acts to broaden the definition of petroleum to include, for example, natural gas and to include the production of petroleum as well as the exploitation of the fuel resources of a designated area.  These Acts provide for the regulation and control of the acquisition, supply, distribution and marketing of fuels, as well as the control of the import and export of fuels.  The Minister's powers under these Acts can only be exercised when the Government has declared by order that the common good warrants such action, in other words, these powers are designed to deal with an energy supply emergency.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for the removal of an anomaly in the ESB superannuation schemes in respect of staff seconded to the Oireachtas.  When an ESB staff member is seconded to the Oireachtas he or she has to pay both the employer's and employee's superannuation contributions to the ESB for the period of the secondment.  This amendment proposes that in the event of the member being awarded an Oireachtas pension, the secondment period will be disregarded for ESB pension purposes <Col N="2000" /> and on retirement he or she will receive a refund of all contributions paid during the secondment period, rather than just a refund of the employee's superannuation contributions as heretofore.</P>
    <P>Section 17 amends the Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Act, 1942, to provide for the establishment of a single fund to cover all employees and to provide for trustee discretion on fund investments.  The Bill provides for the amendment of the Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Act, 1942, so as to provide for the amalgamation of the manual workers' superannuation scheme and the general employees' superannuation scheme.  This was to be achieved by revoking the former scheme and transferring the moneys in that fund into the fund in respect of the general employees' superannuation scheme.  This amalgamation actually took place in 1981.</P>
    <P>Until 1981 superannuation contributions were divided on a 50:50 basis between employees and employer.  Subsection (4) provides that this equal divide need no longer apply.  The rationale behind the change was to allow the board to take on a greater proportion of the cost in order to fund the changes required by the amalgamation of the two schemes.</P>
    <P>Section 19 enables the Minister to recover from the ESB the cost of any reviews and consultancies which may be undertaken to advise on the provision and regulation of electricity.  In the short term the provision will allow the Minister to recover the cost of three consultancies, one which commenced in December 1993 and has since been completed and the two others which are at present under way.  The combined costs of the three consultancies should not exceed £1 million.  Since the reviews concerned all share the common purpose of improving the welfare of the electricity consumer, it is only reasonable that the cost of such reviews should be recovered from the ESB's revenues rather than be borne by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The most significant of the consultancies relates to major restructuring of the <Col N="2001" /> electricity sector approved by the Government.  This exercise is designed to stimulate efficiency and create a market which will respond effectively to the wide variety of customer needs.  The most significant changes would involve the facilitation of competition in power generation and electricity retail supply. Restructuring is also an essential response to current proposals on the liberalisation of the European energy market. Work on the appropriate legislation and regulatory changes necessary to give effect to the proposals approved by Government is continuing with the advice and assistance of consultants.  I hope to introduce legislative proposals in 1996 with a view to achieving a new regulatory framework in 1997.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides for an amendment to the Turf Development Act, 1946, consequent on the moving of the headquarters of Bord na Móna from Dublin to Newbridge, County Kildare.</P>
    <P>Section 22 is a simple amendment proposed by the Attorney General and agreed by the Department of Health to resolve a conflict between a section in the Radiological Protection Act, 1991 relating to the medical use of ionising radiation and provisions of European Union legislation.  Advice given to my Department was that legal difficulties could arise from a conflict between the primary legislation which prescribes the role and functions of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the European Communities (Ionising Radiation) Regulations, 1991 if this conflict was not resolved.  Briefly, section 7 (2) of the Radiological Protection Act, 1991, as it stands, imposes a general restriction on the functions of the institute by excluding the medical use of ionising radiation from these functions. However, the Union legislation on the other hand places no such restriction on the institute's functions in respect of the use of radioactive substances and appliances other than that the institute should consult with the Department of Health in respect of medical use.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Union legislation is considered to be more appropriate <Col N="2002" /> and the legal advice is that it must prevail over alternative provisions which conflict with Union legislation.  Therefore, section 7 (2) of the 1991 Act is being amended, as proposed in this Bill, to remove the inconsistency between the two pieces of legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides for necessary repeals and revocations, including most of the Turf Development Act, 1981. That Act provided for payment of bog development grants, which have now been discontinued.  The private bog development grant scheme was introduced by the Turf Development Act, 1981.  The scheme was designed to stimulate the development of private peat resources and provided grants towards access roads, drainage and machinery for bog development.  Under the scheme, which was funded by my Department, applicants submitted development plans to Bord na Móna who administered the scheme on behalf of the Department.  The scheme proved successful as it brought private turf production to an annual level of approximately 1.5 million tonnes from a previously very low base.</P>
    <P>The scheme was terminated in October 1987 having been deemed to have achieved its purpose and Bord na Móna has not accepted any new applications since that date.  It has not been possible to terminate financial outlay as there remains work approved which has not yet been completed due to delays caused by bad weather and also a shortfall in funding in recent years.  Only when work has been completed can the funds be paid to projects.  I understand from Bord na Móna that all outstanding grants will be paid during the current year.</P>
    <P>I will be bringing forward a number of amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.  The bulk of these amendments will relate to the role of the Minister for the Marine in relation to the control of energy-related activities in the marine environment.</P>
    <P>Deputies are already aware of the decision to introduce competition in the electricity sector.  The recently <Col N="2003" /> announced 120 megawatt peat-fired power station in the east midlands and the 30 megawatt biomass station will be the first major tranches of electricity generating capacity to be selected by open competition under the new regime.  In preparation for these competitions, I am considering introducing a provision in this Bill for the setting up of a power procurer, who will be responsible for negotiating and concluding power purchase agreements with generators and for the subsequent operation of those contracts.  Substantive legislation providing for the restructuring of the electricity sector will be introduced at a later stage.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, the Ireland-UK natural gas interconnector is nearly completed.  This new facility will have capacity for qualified third parties to transmit their own gas through the new pipeline at a charge to be negotiated with BGE.  There is also capacity on the Ireland onshore high pressure transmission system for the grant of such access.  Bord Gáis Éireann's objective is to earn revenue from the interconnector at the earliest possible date.  Provision of such access to the BGE network will fulfil the Government's commitment in relation to the Moriarty Task Force on the implementation of the Culliton report.  IBEC has been pressing for the early introduction of third party access to the gas network in accordance with the commitment on the Moriarty Task Force.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier in my speech to an EU draft directive which proposes the grant of such access to gas networks for large scale gas users.  My first priority in relation to the development of the gas industry is to ensure that BGE remains a vibrant and progressive State body, with adequate financial resources providing a first-class gas supply to its customers. The position is that third party access to the BGE network is already available on a non-mandatory basis.  I am not satisfied that it would be in the best interests of BGE or the gas industry generally that BGE should grant <Col N="2004" /> unlimited access to its network for gas transmission.  Therefore, BGE should have discretion in relation to the extent to which it is prepared to provide third party access.</P>
    <P>I am considering the possibility of including a provision on Committee Stage to allow BGE to provide that facility and to set out the proposed powers and functions of the Minister in that respect.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I commend the Minister of State and his Department for bringing it forward.  It makes major amendments to many of the Acts pertaining to energy supply, distribution and management.  However, it alarms me somewhat that a Bill of this magnitude should not be handled by the senior Minister in the Department.  The information available to me is that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, had intended to present this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State can respond to my speech when concluding Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in my area of responsibility. That is why I am introducing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a complex area with many responsibilities.  The information available to me is that the Minister was to be here but that his Cabinet colleagues, party advisers and highly-paid personal advisers felt he should take early political hibernation at this time.  They feel he should take an autumnal retreat away from the pressures he has brought upon himself in the last few months during a period of summer silliness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret he has had political hallucinations, daydreams and nightmares which have shadowed his political career.  I hope he will recover.  It is vitally important that he address the <Col N="2005" /> allegations before the nation and parliament which appointed him.</P>
    <P>These unsubstantiated allegations reflect badly on excellent staff in most of the semi-State organisations throughout the country, many of whom are covered by this Bill.  The time has come for the Minister to unequivocally answer questions.  It is unfair to make terrible unsubstantiated allegations against excellent public servants who have served the country with distinction and managed semi-State organisations and delivered tremendous service to our country over many years.  Deputy Lowry has a responsibility to be frank and open and to substantiate his statements on his own behalf.  In my efforts to become a politician I too received many anonymous letters.  Deputies receive anonymous letters on many occasions.  If one was to worry about them, one would not make any decisions and might not do any work at all.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lowry must come back to this House, sooner rather than later, to substantiate his allegations.  While he may have a number of motives for his actions, it is obvious that he is now engaging valuable public sector time trying to ensure that the allegations he made can be substantiated.  He has bought time until next month to see what the professionals, both within the public sector and outside it, can craft together in an effort to protect his political career.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lowry may have aspirations for greater office.  If he has, we wish him well but there are ways in which he can go about this rather than cast mud on many decent people and, indeed, make charges against my political party, whose record of service to this country is unequalled.  I am sure we will continue to enhance and expand that record in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Lowry will be back soon to clarify the situation and that he will no longer engage the professionals in the public sector, the external accountants and others trying to justify his claims.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2006" /> This Bill is timely.  It is important and positive.  I welcome it and give my party's support to it.  I will raise a number of issues and we propose to table amendments on Committee Stage.  We hope the Minister will be able to come back on Committee and Report Stages, or perhaps at the end of this debate, with answers for us.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's contribution and endorse what he said about Bord Gáis Éireann, an excellent semi-State organisation which is young by comparison with other such bodies and has done a good job in a short period in successfully managing a vital national resource. Perhaps at the end of this debate or later the Minister could confirm the exact position pertaining to exploration, the record in that area and any proposed exploration to see what other gas reserves may be available in our territorial waters in the years ahead.  The information available to me is that we have gas reserves to take us to the end of the century and I hope that can be sustained.</P>
    <P>The gas interconnector is a major piece of infrastructure which puts us in a strong position <i>vis-à-vis</i> energy supply for the future.  It gives us an opportunity to have access to the international gas network.  The interconnector links us with the United Kingdom and from there we can be connected to Europe and ultimately to Russia and other places containing vast gas resources. Consequently we should not find ourselves isolated in the future because adequate and sustainable gas reserves will be available to this island.</P>
    <P>I compliment and congratulate the Minister, his Department and Bord Gáis Éireann on the tremendous work over the years.  I was pleased to have served in that Department and I know the great work which has been done.  I hope there will be continued success in that area and it would be advantageous to know the possibilities for positive exploration in the future.</P>
    <P>Some people, including myself, doubt whether there is absolute transparency and equity in the value being received <Col N="2007" /> by BGE for the reserves and the gas it makes available to Irish industry, especially to another semi-State organisation, Nitrigín Éireann Teoranta.  From legislation and the financial environment in which NET operates through Government diktats over the years, it appears BGE must supply gas at a particular price and NET has the protection of the State and Government Departments for what it does in response and in utilising those resources.  There may be a distortion in the competitive position which prevails in the manufacture and distribution of fertiliser in this country as a result of that environment.</P>
    <P>People have raised this on a number of occasions and perhaps the Minister and his Department, in co-operation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Department of Finance, will critically examine the issue to ensure the taxpayer is getting value for the national resource of gas and that there is absolute transparency and accountability by one semi-State organisation in the utilisation of that resource and in the payment of a proper and equitable price for it to another semi-State organisation.  That would ultimately be of benefit to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that we are debating this Bill in Energy Awareness Week and I compliment everyone associated with that, including the energy unit in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and the ESB, which has piloted and managed Energy Awareness Week up to this year.  I also welcome the establishment of the Irish Energy Centre and I wish everyone involved with it &mdash; its chief executive, board of directors and staff &mdash; every success in the future.  They are a confident, professional group of people who know they have a key role to play.  They have received great support from the Department and have collaborated with various organisations both inside and outside this country.</P>
    <P>Now that it is formally established in a new centre currently being constructed in Glasnevin, I am confident <Col N="2008" /> the Irish Energy Centre will make a major contribution to ensuring that we are all fully aware of the vital importance of energy as a resource, that we use it wisely and well and that we maximise its efficiency to create the greatest economic output, thereby providing the greatest benefit to all its users be they workers, elderly people, residents of homes, etc.  Energy is vital to the success and well being of our nation and I wish Energy Awareness Week, and in particular the Irish Energy Centre, every success in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that Ireland is on the periphery of Europe. As an island nation, energy is of vital importance to us.  This is an opportune time for co-operation and collaboration between the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and its equivalent in Northern Ireland and with the various semi-State organisations here.  As a small island nation on the periphery of Europe it is important for us to realise that our population and our energy demand are small in world terms and that we must utilise all our resources to the maximum benefit of all our people.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that we might unnecessarily spend money creating energy infrastructure to supply two different parts of this island rather than working on a joint plan to have a composite supply, involving the minimum expenditure for the maximum use, which would be of great benefit to all the people on the island.  During my time at the Department in the Government of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, much work was done in every Government Department to ensure that plans and programmes were put together so that we could have an all-island approach to all the problems in this country, be they economic, political or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give an indication at the conclusion of this debate or at a later stage that some progress has been made in this area.  I know much progress has been made with the <Col N="2009" /> reconnection of the electricity interconnector, which I welcome.  I raised that issue in this House some time ago and work began shortly after that.  That interconnector operated in the past and it is now operating again.  I hope it will continue to operate in the future without any interruption.  That is due to the peaceful environment now prevailing on this island.  I hope there will be further collaboration between North and South. I note the Geological Survey of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Geological Survey have enjoyed great co-operation during the past 12 to 18 months and much work is being carried out in that area.</P>
    <P>I have had the privilege of serving in six Government Departments in eight years as a junior Minister.  Of all the Departments in which I have served, the Department which can underpin the value of the peace process to our country and ensure that there is positive and practical co-operation between all the State agencies is the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications. I hope that co-operation will continue into the future in various facets of activities.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister has asked Bord Gáis Éireann to investigate the economics of extending the gas pipeline to Shannon, Ennis, Tralee and Galway.  I welcome that.  I have some information on it and if the Minister has a detailed conversation with the excellent officials to his right&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take a global view of problems on this island.  If it comes to Galway, the towns of Ballinasloe, Loughrea, Athenry and Gort will benefit. Will the Minister report back to the <Col N="2010" /> House on the information available to his Department on some of these locations?  That information would be a pointer to us regarding the direction it may take.  I admire the Minister's ambitious request but I am not sure if it will be fulfilled in one fell swoop.  Will the Minister indicate what might be done and how soon the neglected peripheral people of the west might expect connection?</P>
      <P>Many of the legislative proposals result from EU directives on competition and availability of supply to third parties.  The Council of Ministers is discussing various aspects of gas and electricity at this time and the Department and the Minister are planning to be ahead of the posse and to be ready when these changes are agreed.  It is obvious that there will be major changes in the way some of our semi-State organisations are run, managed and structured.  When we go to Europe to conclude negotiations it is important that we are in a position to say that we have changed our structure to what we believe is best for our island and we expect that Europe will acknowledge that if a derogation is needed for particular aspects, it will be granted thus ensuring no inhibitions or impediments to our economic development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 refers to the amendment of section 48 of the Safety, Health and Welfare (Offshore Installations) Act, 1987.  I am pleased with the progress made in Irish offshore exploration.  Last year as a result of a successful international conference, the first of its kind held here, membership of the Irish offshore operators group increased from about five in 1994 to in excess of 30. That indicates the level of commitment and international interest in the licensing and taxation regimes operating here. I hope those who have taken the risk, made the investment and taken out exploration licences for the sake of the island and its economic well being, will benefit from a positive response, sooner rather than later, when various wells are spudded in the Irish offshore area.  That is their due reward.  It is obvious that if <Col N="2011" /> there was a positive response and we were fortunate to strike oil the economy would be able to sustain itself well into the future.  We could then tackle our serious debt problem in a more meaningful way and it would be easier to meet our commitments to the various agencies from which we have borrowed heavily.</P>
    <P>I wish all those who have taken out exploration licences in the Irish offshore exploration area every success.  They are professionals involved in probably the biggest risk industry in the world.  As one who held the same portfolio as the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, I had the privilege on a number of occasions of visiting the Irish offshore exploration area and some of the rigs.  I compliment everyone associated with that industry on the professional standards operating on those rigs.  It is vitally important that the State, the Government of the day and the Department are protected in the event of a difficulty at any time.  I welcome the amendment which proposes to take account of the safety, health and welfare of people working in Irish offshore installations and the proposed changes to the 1987 Act.</P>
    <P>I found also to my amazement that due to the irregular nature of work offshore Ireland, the cadre of Irish people with the skills and expertise to work offshore did not get regular work and if they worked in other parts of the world they were not always available when opportunities arose at home.  At that time we had very difficult and sensitive discussions and FÁS, in co-operation with the Irish offshore operators group and the Department, were to provide structured and professional training for the various types of workers who would work offshore.  Will the Minister report on the progress that has been made in this field, the extent of employment opportunities available and the number of Irish people working offshore at present?</P>
    <P>It is proposed in section 7 to extend the powers of Bord Gáis Éireann to <Col N="2012" /> effect certain commercial transactions.  I welcome the proposed changes because it is vitally important that the semi-State bodies be able to operate in a sensible and structured regime.  Obviously parameters have to be laid down both in law and by regulation because at the end of the day Parliament is responsible for all public sector agencies.  Ultimately the Minister, the Minister of State and the relevant Department are responsible to answer to this House.  It is vitally important to have sensitive and flexible arrangements so that the State agencies are able to do business in a commercial way and are able to take advantage of the prevailing financial environment.</P>
    <P>The proposal that the semi-State bodies can make certain changes only after reporting to the Minister, getting his permission in conjunction with that of the Minister for Finance, is welcome. That is practical and establishes a clear reporting structure ultimately to Parliament. There will be absolute transparency in decision making.  It is not possible for Members to be aware of decisions being taken even though they are agreed with various Ministers unless there is some system of notifying the House of those decisions.  Whether it is a decision of the semi-State organisation to acquire a company, to be part of a joint venture or to borrow money, Members would not know about it and I would like the Minister to establish a procedure for notifying the House, perhaps by circular, so that when certain decisions are agreed and signed into law a document would be circulated to Members of both Houses to ensure they are fully <i>au fait</i> with the decision.  This would be good for democracy and for the health of the semi-State sector.  It would make transparent the semi-State sector, the Government Department, the Minister of the day and Parliament itself.  If this information were made available to us, fewer silly articles would be written without factual information. Such a procedure would clarify the position for everyone and I ask the Minister <Col N="2013" /> and his officials to consider this proposal between now and Committee Stage.  I hope to table an amendment which will be of assistance in this regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions dealing with financial management and flexibility in the semi-State sector.  However, there is already tremendous expertise in the areas of industry and finance in the public sector and it is important that we avail of this.  Any in-house committee, subsidiary body or group representative of the Departments of Finance and Transport, Energy and Communications in a semi-State organisation should include at least one professional from the National Treasury Management Agency.  If any organisation has made a major impact in dealing with the problems facing us in recent years and ensuring that we as a small nation can manage our mammoth national debt it is the National Treasury Management Agency.  I would like this agency to be given a major role in the financial management, particularly the treasury side, of the semi-State sector.  Many semi-State bodies, particularly the ESB, have tremendous treasury operations and it is important to duplicate these in other semi-State bodies so that there is consistency throughout that sector, the Department of Finance, the National Treasury Management Agency and ultimately the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes pertaining to Bord na Móna and the ESB.  In fulfilling commitments given by its predecessor, the Government has generously wiped out Bord na Móna's huge debt.  While this will obviously be added on to our already high national debt it is only correct that Bord na Móna should be allowed to operate in a new environment as this is the only way forward for it.  I commend the chief executive, management, board and staff of Bord na Móna for the flexible way they have responded to the company's difficulties, some of which were inherited.  They have managed their way out of these difficulties with the help of the Government and it is important that all future financial decisions are sustainable and <Col N="2014" /> positive from a commercial point of view.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes many changes in the structure of the ESB, one of our greatest semi-State companies.  It has given great service and provides a resource which is utilised in all homes and factories.  When one looks at its performance over the years one will see that it has been a leader in every facet of commercial management and corporate performance one could think of and has responded in a solid way to any opportunities presented to it.  I accept that change is inevitable and commend the management, board, staff and unions, in co-operation with the Department, for planning a way forward which has proven satisfactory not only for that organisation but for Ireland as a whole.  It is important to recognise that the ESB has the capacity to respond to and create economic opportunities in other areas. We cannot cut off an organisation with vast resources from the opportunities that exist, or curtail its further contribution to the economy of this nation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and, through the Minister, I compliment the management and staff in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications who were involved in its production.  They are an excellent group of people, dealing with many semi-State companies and vital national resources.  I wish them continued success in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>I welcome this complex Bill and I have every confidence that it is in very safe hands with the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the latter part of Deputy Treacy's contribution.  As to the earlier part of it, I found it very hard to catch his drift.  I do not know what its relevance was to this Bill.  However, I can assure him that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Michael Lowry, is in extreme good health, that I look forward to his coming into the House to answer any question on any matter in which he was involved over the summer months, and <Col N="2015" /> that he has the support of many decent people in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy over many years of leaving well enough alone and not rocking the boat led to many downfalls. It is time that policy was abandoned and every organisation under the control of the State examined, not to criticise it but to see how it is developing and make the people fully aware of what is happening.  If people are travelling abroad on the pretext of representing their company to destinations which are of no relevance to the company, questions must be asked, and the taxpayer should know.</P>
      <P>This Bill deals with three companies which are of great importance to this nation.  They are the relatively new Bord Gáis Éireann, the ESB and Bord na Móna.  The ESB would be the major player.  I will deal with it first because it is particularly relevant in my constituency, although Bord Gáis Éireann is penetrating and expanding its network which is to be welcomed.  I agree with Deputy Treacy that the ESB is to be complimented on being a very professional organisation which has given marvellous service to this nation.  No matter where a house was situated a source of supply was available to it.  The ESB did not make the excuse that the house was too far from the main line. Lines were brought to the house and a supply was laid on.  Rural electrification opened up rural Ireland to everybody. Every home could have a supply equal to that in the town or city.  The ESB achieved that without major cost to anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that that development is in place and rural Ireland is becoming more populated the question of cost has arisen, and that is only right and proper. The supply comes at a cost and we must be competitive and look at new developments. I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, will visit my county tomorrow for Energy Awareness Week, <Col N="2016" /> to address a seminar.  He might see on the horizon the wind turbines built by a private concern, the Sean Quinn group. I understand that the group intends to supply the network in Northern Ireland and buy back from them.  This is a major developing company in the northeast and north-west of the country with many different developments, all of them successful.  If this company can produce energy from a wind farm, other companies might benefit from having a similar licence to generate energy and sell it on to the ESB or supply it, in competition with the ESB, to major industries. Competition can only sharpen everybody's edge and give better value to the customer.</P>
    <P>Regarding the North-South interconnector, living in a Border region I am aware that now peace and harmony are prevailing there is tremendous goodwill for ongoing co-operation North and South.  It is an area we should consider and one on which we could work together.  As a small nation, we are minor players in an international market, but if we join with the North in purchasing our needs we could secure a more competitive price in the international market.  We should consider that option and it is one in which people would be extremely interested.</P>
    <P>I am very interested in a problem concerning the ESB generating station at Ballyshannon.  There have been ongoing problems regarding drainage from the river Erne and water levels. Drainage of the river Erne in low-lying lands of Cavan and Monaghan is affected by that generating station and the water level of its sluicegates at Ballyshannon.  The ESB has been reluctant to lower the water level of the sluicegates and run off excess water during the winter months.  If those sluicegates can operate in the summer months with a lower water level than in the winter months without complaint, why must a high water level be maintained during the winter months?  There was no difficulty with the operation of the sluicegates at Ballyshannon this summer when there was an extremely low water <Col N="2017" /> level.  Surely a low water level, which would benefit farmers and land owners in the Cavan and Fermanagh region of the Erne catchment area, could be maintained all year round.  I have raised this point on numerous occasions, but have received a poor response.  It is an issue that should be seriously addressed because it would provide economic benefits for farmers and land owners in the region.  Apart from that, I do not have any criticism to make of the ESB or its work.  I have found its staff professional. Any complaints I, as a public representative, reported to it have been addressed immediately.</P>
    <P>Regarding Bord Gáis, it has expanded greatly in the market.  It has made major strides since 1976 and is a net contributor to our economy.  Deputy Treacy mentioned a point that people have raised with me on a number of occasions regarding Bord Gáis's operation and that of the fertiliser company, NET.  The Minister might clarify the cost at which gas is supplied to that company as against its competitors. There appears to be an anomaly in this area about which people are unhappy. There is talk about openness and transparency and taxpayers and consumers should have a clear picture of the energy costs borne by industries and home owners.  Such clarification would enable people to draw comparisons and understand price variations.  There are price differentials among major consumers, smaller enterprises and home owners, but the advantage gained by and reasons for price differential should be spelled out.  People would welcome such clarification and be satisfied that everything was above board.</P>
    <P>Regarding Bord na Móna, it is a long established organisation that has played a major role in energy supply. Its products are still very much in demand and it has a good deal of development work to pursue.  There is tremendous potential for the development of our bogs as an energy source.  The approach to their development must be reappraised. <Col N="2018" /> Much afforestation is taking place in boglands which could be more usefully developed as an energy source.  There is still a great demand for turf among private householders and the ESB is a major player in that market, but there appears to be an ongoing policy of planting boglands that could be more usefully utilised.  Afforestation development should be investigated as it could prove a worthwhile energy source.  The type of forests being planted, evergreens, does not provide the most appropriate timber for heating and we should consider that in the context of afforestation development.  Those are the two points I wanted to make &mdash; the development of a privately owned wind farm and the need to address why the levels in Ballyshannon cannot be adjusted from summer to winter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State said the Bill is largely about the natural gas interconnector with the UK.  That covers a multitude, including the ESB and Bord Gáis Éireann.  I am concerned at developments in the energy area as are many ESB employees.  A favourite Government line, regardless of who is in Government, is that it is not the Government's job to create employment. However, of late some Ministers seem to think it is their job to do away with employment.  This is particularly the case in the Department sponsoring this legislation as there are 2,000 jobs under threat in the ESB and 2,000 jobs under threat in Telecom Éireann.  Jobs have already been lost in Aer Lingus with the threat of more losses and CIE is also being trimmed back.  There seems to be a general squeeze on jobs in State and semi-State companies.  As someone said to me a couple of weeks ago, if the Government feels that it is not its role to create employment, perhaps it should leave things alone and stop trying to create unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise there is a great deal of EU legislation, that matters could not continue as they were, that we are in a new competitive world and that the Department must face reality.  Many semi-State <Col N="2019" /> employees also understand that and that changes have to be made.  I have a slight interest here as I worked in a semi-State company for 25 years and I am in tune with their concerns and fears.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Boylan said, the ESB has done a great deal of work since the 1920s.  It has created employment and brought its services to homes and industries throughout the country.  However, Bord Gáis Éireann seems to be moving in on the ESB now and seems to be the main player.  Presumably, the interconnector will mean that the ESB's traditional means of generating electricity will not be as efficient as some of the more modern means, such as natural gas.  I saw figures some months ago which indicated that electricity manufactured from natural gas is much more efficient and economical.  Many ESB employees fear there will be a drift from the traditional means of generating electricity, due to this policy of allowing private firms to supply electricity to the national grid.  The ESB will be left in a time warp manufacturing electricity with antiquated equipment and will not be able to compete with the more modern methods.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago a colleague who works in the ESB in Ringsend told me about the major changes there and the big cutback in staff numbers.  He talked about a new turbine that had been introduced and how efficient it was in producing electricity from gas.  However, while the union has gone along with this and has made the required savings, my colleague said the Government has now blocked phases 2 and 3 of the turbine. The men have seen the turbine and are now able to produce electricity in a more efficient way.  They fear that in future they will be left making electricity in the old fashioned way and new private entrepreneurs will become involved and be given the natural gas whether it comes from Kinsale or Siberia. They fear that in time the ESB simply will not be able to compete because it will not be given the machinery to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2020" /> I understand the Government's policy of trying to talk to the unions and the board in the ESB to achieve cutbacks in staff numbers and improvements in efficiency and work practices in order to compete.  However, the ESB cannot be tied to the extent that it will be sidelined and not given the opportunities to develop and compete with the private entrepreneur.  My colleagues' fear is that not only will it try to compete with Kinsale but also it does not know who it will have to compete with in the future.  In time, gas will not only come from the North but from the North Sea and even Siberia.  My colleagues are very concerned about being sidelined and unable to compete.</P>
    <P>In the ESB and other semi-State bodies there is a willingness to change but there is a great fear that morale will be reduced.  People in semi-State bodies have given loyal service to the State.  As they perceive it &mdash; and I am not saying that it is entirely true &mdash; the Government is squeezing them unfairly and they will not be allowed compete on a level playing field.</P>
    <P>When I worked in CIE we believed an equivalent employee in the ESB, regardless of grade, was at the top of the market.  ESB employees were not seen as a deprived workforce.  They were probably in a privileged position.  On the other hand, CIE was probably nearer the bottom of the pile.  We looked on ESB workers as having the premier salaries and working conditions in the semi-State sector.  Those workers understand that efficiencies have to be achieved but the realisation will have to be brought home to them slowly.  We cannot be seen to throw a couple of thousand of those workers on the scrap heap and push them aside.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a lack of trust between the ordinary employees in the ESB and the Minister.  The Minister of State might not wish to talk about the Minister, Deputy Lowry, today because of his background and what has happened in the past few months.  There is a fear that these private entrepreneurs will be allowed cream the market and <Col N="2021" /> provide electricity for the big multinational companies or parts of residential Dublin.  I wonder who is going to supply the western seaboard in this new tomorrow.  Will these private operators be let cherry-pick customers and supply electricity from the best source, natural gas, to the easy market, be it the big multinational companies or the residential areas, with the ESB sidelined and producing electricity by old-fashioned means and supplying to scattered parts of the country?  That is not in accordance with EU regulations.  It would be an abuse of them.  The workers have to be reassured in that sense.</P>
    <P>I could comment on worker morale.  I am not aware of the state of morale in Bord Gáis Éireann.  It seems to be an expanding company and, from what I know, the staff are quite happy.  In the ESB and CIE, given the sort of verbal abuse that workers and, indeed, their management have taken over the past few months, these people are deeply offended and hurt.  These workers are genuine.  They have been doing their best.  Profit and personal gain has not always been their main pursuit.  Most of them are dedicated public servants, who are just trying to earn a week's wages. The way they feel they have been undermined in recent times has been a body blow to them.  It has hurt to the core.</P>
    <P>Other matters in the area of energy were in the news in recent times, including the amalgamation of some of the oil companies.  I do not know if that is relevant to this debate.  The amalgamation of some of these oil companies might lead to a monopoly.  We have seen the problems of monopoly in the newspaper industry.  I am sure the Minister will comment on the amalgamation of JET Petroleum Products and Statoil Ireland Ltd. at the conclusion of the debate, if it is relevant, and say whether it gives him concern or if his Department is looking at it, whether it has been reported to the monopolies commission or whether it has been given a clean bill of health.  I would like to have heard the Minister's speech but I was attending a <Col N="2022" /> committee meeting.  In reply to a parliamentary question which I tabled some time ago, the Minister spoke about the cost of electricity from various sources. Natural gas seems to be the way of the future.</P>
    <P>I wish to express the great concern being felt by workers in the ESB, even though this legislation may not deal with all of the changes in the company.  In the past the Minister and his party saw themselves as the champions of semi-State workers.  Perhaps the burdens of office do not allow the Minister to express himself fully in that regard anymore. As somebody with a long record in a semi-State body, I wish to convey to the Minister that the workers are very concerned and feel lost.  They feel that the Labour Party, to which they gave great support in 1992, is moving away from them and that its promises that privatisation would not take place now seem just a bag of smoke.</P>
    <P>The outdoor advertising section of my own company, CIE, was put out to tender to be privatised.  My impression is that, because this was a commercial decision of CIE, the Minister would not become involved, although soon afterwards he seemed to say the opposite in relation to other matters.  If we made promises to semi-State employees that their jobs would not be privatised, these must be kept or the privatisation should take place slowly and after full negotiations. The employees should not be given deadlines or timetables and pressurised into making decisions.  While it may be said that the ESB is not being privatised, in effect it will be if private companies with state of the art generating facilities become involved with it. There is deep concern among employees who feel the position the Minister and his party adopted on their behalf for a few years is now forgotten. Their morale is low and they feel nobody cares about them.  They feel the company will be privatised and that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, will allow wealthy people to take it over and will give them modern machinery.  The <Col N="2023" /> workers feel they will be squeezed out over a number of years by having to produce electricity by antiquated methods without the Department giving them the means and investment to compete with these people.  They are looking for an even playing field and proper investment from the Department to allow them compete with best international practice.</P>
    <P>I hope negotiations with the ESB will not be rushed and everyone's concerns will be heard.  It is clear from newspaper articles in recent days that not only employees but also the board are unhappy.  There is no point in the Department or the Minister trying to force something on the employees or the board which does not have their support and leaves their morale in shreds.  I hope the Minister takes these concerns on board.</P>

      <P>Concerning the Bill itself, I am pleased to report a healthy level of exploration activity in our continental shelf area.  This year alone, four wells were drilled and another company is preparing to drill a further well.  The issuing of 11 exploration licences this year is a firm indication of the confidence that the exploration industry has in committing investment to Ireland. This leads me to expect that there will continue to be a satisfactory level of offshore exploration for the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With this increased activity I am confident that it is only a matter of time before these exploration efforts will lead to a successful outcome.  I want to acknowledge the role of Deputy Treacy in the area of oil exploration when he <Col N="2025" /> was Minister of State in my Department, granted with a much tighter remit than I am being given.</P>
    <P>At present the Porcupine Basin is closed for applications for any type of authorisation.  It will, of course, be open again in the future but not until all our options regarding the future of the basin have been examined.  This is a basin with vast potential and I must be satisfied that, whatever course we take, future activity will lead to having the basin fully explored.</P>
    <P>The major oil companies are now involved in exploring that area and in making huge investments they are putting their money where their mouths are.  These are not just wild guesses, of course.  They have an amount of information and knowledge available to them from the studies they have carried out.  I consider that to be the best indication that there is something worth getting in that area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Deputy some history lessons as well if he likes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to be associated with positive developments geared towards opening up new horizons for the exploration industry.  I am referring to the Rockall Trough.  I have already referred to the plans I have put in place to obtain data in the area.  The Rockall Trough is the largest of our basins extending about 100 to 650 kilometres from our west coast.  It is in deep waters ranging down to in excess of 2,000 metres.  The greater part of the trough has sparse seismic coverage and in May this year I announced that it was closed for licensing options or exploration licences at present.  This move was to encourage <Col N="2026" /> geophysical contractors to acquire special data and for technical reports to be prepared.  These measures will lead to greater exploration activity in the Rockall Trough and will facilitate the development of its hydrocarbon potential. I expect to be in a position to make a further announcement on the future licensing of the trough by May 1996.</P>
    <P>A significant portion of the offshore area to the east and south of the country is currently subject to authorisations. This area is the easiest to explore, being in less than 200 metres of water.  In some places the geology is complex but it is attractive because our commercial gas developments are located in the Celtic Sea and nearly every well has oil or gas shows.  The basin has not been fully explored but many areas have been tested.</P>
    <P>To deal with the specific point Deputy Treacy raised, we expect the Kinsale Head amalgamated finds in the area to supply our indigenous needs to the end of the century.  In the meantime, as I said in my speech, we will be importing gas on an increasing level each year starting this October.  Some small amounts have been imported already on a test basis, but we will be importing gas on an increasing level. That will also possibly stretch the use of our own indigenous resource and will continue to give us two sources.  The interconnector is in place to do that.</P>
    <P>A quarter of all our gas goes to NET and BGE gets 8 per cent of its income from that quarter.  That tells its own tale. It does not give Irish farmers cheaper fertiliser, but a profit is made in between.  I am concerned that such an amount of gas, which was required by contract and signed, sealed and delivered long before my time or Deputy Noel Treacy's time in the Department, must go to that source at that price.  We are examining that to see how not only the future supply to NET but the current supplies can be considered with a view to the long term supply of gas to NET at reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>There is extensive co-operation with Northern Ireland, particularly in the <Col N="2027" /> areas of energy efficiency and renewal and there is a joint approach on EU funding.  There is significant co-operation on electricity and the interconnector has now been re-established.  We are looking at further possibilities in that regard.  We are also looking at the possibility of a gas connector between Dublin and Belfast.  I thank the Deputy for his support in this regard.</P>
    <P>The EU directives will have major implications for the ESB and BGE.  We are working to ensure that they work to our national advantage, which is the object of the exercise.  Much work has been done to meet the likely outcome of the electricity directive, particularly in the planned restructuring of the ESB. My proposals in relation to gas are in line with the EU proposals, but I assure the House that the Irish gas consumer and BGE will be the beneficiaries of any new directive.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noel Ahern dealt with matters outside the scope of the Bill. However, what he said should not go unanswered.  He poured scorn on the ESB, in particular, which it does not deserve.  The workers, management and board of the ESB are not as pessimistic or downhearted as he suggested.  I am confident that the ESB, through its management, unions and the cost and competitiveness review which we hope will be successful, is capable of dealing with and beating any competition which comes its way.  The new structures will facilitate the ESB in taking on and beating the new challenges.  I do not envisage a situation where the ESB would be left with a few outdated turf burners in the midlands, while whiz kids would produce electricity for the country.  I reject the Deputy's pessimistic remarks. I thank the Deputies for their contributions to and support for the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this important issue.  It would be hard to gauge the degree of anger and extreme disappointment at the decision to close the branch office in Castletownbere. This office has been in existence since the foundation of the State and is located at the very end of the Beara Peninsula.  It is one of the most remote regions in the country and has been designated as a severely handicapped area.  There are over 300 people on the dole including small farmers, a number of fishermen and others who cannot find jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to listen to a fair amount of lip service about peripherality and cohesion.  If there is a way to show in the most callous fashion that one does not mind about these people, it is to close down the dole office.  The two staff will be replaced by a computer.  What <Col N="2030" /> will happen to the unfortunate people who come in from fishing on a Wednesday night and want to sign on for Thursday, Friday and Saturday? Will they talk to the computer in the dole office and say they want a short week?  An unfortunate person may be looking for some information.  Where are the information centres we were promised would reduce peripherality and the imbalance of the regions?</P>
    <P>I fail to understand this extremely harsh decision and I know that if the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, was representing the area, there is no way it would have been taken.  I call on the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister of State, from whom I expect fairer treatment for people in such an outlying, severely handicapped area, to reverse this decision.  Not only should they retain the existing staff but they should expand the office and provide people with the information services to which they are entitled.  The letter sent out on 14 September stated that in the continuing review of services, in the case of Castletownbere the Minister has decided that the best approach is to close the branch office.</P>
    <P>When travelling from Cork to Castletownbere and back, they probably stop at some of the nice restaurants and get expenses to which they are entitled.  I am sure if the Minister looks at the file, he will see that the cost of servicing Castletownbere from Cork city will be far more expensive than keeping the people there.</P>
    <P>I am mainly concerned about the slap in the face to the people of west Cork. Will the three Deputies from the area take up this matter to reverse this quite outrageous decision?</P>
    <P>I look forward to some good news from the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Durkan, in this regard.</P>

      <P>In the normal course when a branch manager retires, the Department reviews its arrangements for the delivery of services in the area concerned. The Department has made considerable progress in recent years in modernising and localising its services through the use of technology and changes in its organisational structure.  The majority of unemployed people are now paid their weekly entitlements at their local post office and they are required to sign on only once every four weeks.  The expansion and development of the information service is another area that has progressed in recent years.  This policy continues the policy of previous administrations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Tá mé fíor buíoch duit go bhfuil an deis seo agam daileáil leis an fhadhb seo.  I regret I do not have the facilities of the O.J. Simpson trial, because I have a map, which is difficult to depict, but I will use the Dáil Chamber by way of illustration. If one takes the Opposition benches as the first section of Carlow town which received urban renewal &mdash; the Opposition being more in need of renewal than the Government side &mdash; the podium on which you sit, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, is the building left out of the scheme.  One must also imagine the River Barrow flowing behind the doors beside the podium, so there is nothing behind that chair.  In 1994, the area represented by this side of the House became eligible for urban renewal, but the building in question was left out, isolated in its magnificence.</P>
      <P>This building was erected in the 1700s and used by the canal company as a hotel, or an inn, as it would have been referred to then.  If urban renewal means anything, this building should have been included but it was left out on both occasions.  I still do not understand how anyone who looked at a map of Carlow or walked on its streets could have omitted it.  To do so would not have opened up a vista; if one included buildings across the street from it, that would open up one side of the town but this building was backed by the Barrow, so no new options were being included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed this out to the Minister and presented him with a map which was coloured in to show the glorious isolation of this building.  I spoke to his officials and explained it so well I thought no-one could possibly allow this dreadful mistake to continue.  I felt confident it would be included when renewal came.  I am devastated that neither logic, common sense nor justice prevailed in the urban renewal review. Half of Cork city and Cobh were included in the scheme.  I called for the inclusion of an 18th century building <Col N="2034" /> which was used as an inn and was probably written about by Goldsmith, but it was left out.  I explained everything and wish to know what logic was used in deciding this mistake could not be rectified, once it was pointed out.  I told the officials what they said to me was completely illogical.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why a building with such an historic background can be omitted while other places are included. The site stood on its own, with the river behind it, so it did not cause a major problem for the Department &mdash; there was no question of another 200 houses becoming eligible through its inclusion. What measure was used to ignore the advice I gave the Department?  I was quite pleasant to the officials but in the summer, when I discovered what happened, I was far from pleasant and I notice the wording for this motion is much calmer than the text I submitted. Can this undoubted wrong now be righted?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy said, Carlow has had a designated area since 1990.  The original designated areas in Carlow were located around Centaur Street-Castle Hill; Kennedy Avenue-Hanover; and Tullow Street-College Street.  The scheme has been a tremendous success in the town and I congratulate the Deputy on the progressive and forward-looking nature of the people he represents.  Private sector investment has amounted to £13.5 million in residential and commercial projects.  Some of the more noteworthy developments are the new cinema and shopping centre.  While a number of developments have taken place within the designated areas there have also been spin-off developments on the periphery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the new urban renewal scheme which came into effect on 1 August 1994 a new area was designated, bounded by Castle Hill, Bridge Street, Chaff Street, Leighlin Road and the River Barrow.  I understand the house the Deputy has so eloquently defined in the Chamber is <Col N="2035" /> located in Governey Square-Centaur Street and is adjacent to an area designated under the previous urban renewal scheme.</P>
    <P>While formal criteria for selecting urban renewal areas are not set out in legislation, a number of factors are taken into account in deciding areas to be designated.  These factors include the extent of urban decay; the location and general character of an area; the potential for redevelopment; the historical or architectural significance of an area and the need to promote residential development.</P>
    <P>Areas of designation are drawn up after careful consideration and extensive consultation with the local authorities. That was certainly the case in Carlow as is the case in all other areas of designation.  To be effective, however, the scheme must be limited in scope and therefore targeted at the areas most in need of renewal.  The Deputy may be aware that I am currently commissioning a review by consultants of the effectiveness of the urban renewal scheme to better inform future policy decisions in this area.  I recognise that no scheme is infallible and I take on board the points made by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>I have had many requests for the extension of designated areas and for the designation of new areas in other towns.  I regret I cannot grant these requests, including that of the Deputy. Widespread extension of designated areas would be totally counter-productive. The purpose of an urban renewal scheme is to target small pockets of the most severe dereliction in cities and towns.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also be aware that there were recent minor changes to the number of areas already designated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to highlight transparent incompetence in relation to the Leader II programme arising from the matter raised by Deputy Ryan concerning urban renewal.  On 31 December 1994 the Leader I pilot programme ended and the Leader II programme, which was to be a national programme, was to begin.  With the energetic new arrivals in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry one would have expected the Leader II programme to come on stream fairly quickly, particularly since my constituency colleague, Deputy Hyland, had been so instrumental and successful in adopting a bottom up rural development approach in Leader I.  That was acclaimed by everybody in the areas concerned and highlighted the need for Leader II to begin immediately.</P>
      <P>I awaited with great trepidation this major announcement which finally came in May, four months later, that 36 areas were to be part of the new Leader II programme.  The Minister of State will recall that I was upset about the delay in getting this programme under way.  That was in May last and another four months has now passed.</P>
      <P>During the week a press release was issued from the Minister of State's office to the effect that the first of these 36 groups had finally signed a contract. This contract with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, is the required legal instrument that allows the Leader programme to begin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now nine months since this <Col N="2037" /> Government of all the talents came into office.  We were told the Minister and his team were very busy in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. We had the most successful pilot programme for rural development under way but we have yet to see, apart from this one contract out of 36 groups, the continuation of the excellent work done under that programme.</P>
    <P>We also know &mdash; this has been confirmed by the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan at Question Time &mdash; that the money that will be available to the individual groups will be less than that provided under the pilot programme.  A sum of £75 million for the programme is to be spread thinly over many areas. Leader boards are in place and meetings are taking place.  I have met Leader boards formally and informally and I am sure the Minister has made it his business to meet many of them.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the Comptroller and Auditor General's office, on foot of his report, has been used by various Departments to take away the local discretionary powers which were available under Leader I.  There is such a range of bureaucracy that in some cases junior and senior counsel have been sought by Leader boards to ascertain what exactly the Department is asking of them in order to get down to the basic business of producing rural development programmes. I have a great personal regard for the Minister of State but the urgency for this issue in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry under his predecessor is not there.</P>
    <P>We are two-thirds into the year 1995 and are supposed to have a national programme in place, yet only one contract has been signed by the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan.  I understand the signing of contracts by many boards is imminent.  The Leader network has been involved in negotiations with the Department and has attempted to outline the difficulties due to the increased bureaucracy arising out of the new criteria. This overhang of central bureaucracy is responsible for the failure to entrust to prudent members of each of <Col N="2038" /> these boards the responsibility to spend taxpayers' money wisely.  The reason given was that two or three projects from the previous pilot programme of 19 were not as successful as one would have wished.  I assure the Minister of State and the Department that Leader boards, under Leader I, have a much better record than many central Departments where there has been waste for many years.  Frequently this is brought to the fore by diligent members of the Committee of Public Accounts and various other committees of the House.</P>
    <P>I understand many Leader boards have revised and submitted their business plans to the Department, having had further discussions and checked out all the legal issues in order to satisfy officialdom.  The Minister of State, I am sure, would like to go around as Ministers are doing in other areas, to areas where work is proceeding in order to be associated with the good work being done by Leader boards under Leader I and Leader II.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State in dealing with the logjam eight months later, go back to his Department and inform officialdom that he is the political head of the Department with responsibility for rural development and is not prepared to accept any further delay? These contracts should be signed within the next week or ten days so that the national Leader II programme, which has been heralded by the Minister of State and the Minister for the past eight months, will be in operation in October 1995.</P>

      <P>We are trying to ensure the integrity and credibility of the Leader II programme and I am sure that by the end of it, it will be very good and an instrument for future rural development in the EU.  We must ensure that we get it right before it starts.  Leader I was a pilot programme. We have to accept that mistakes were made but we do not wish to repeat them.  The Government is committed to the Leader programme and there has not been nor will there be any undue delay in implementing the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have approached the implementation of Leader II in a carefully planned manner to ensure that the programme makes the maximum contribution possible to the development of rural areas.  The preparatory work is an essential element in ensuring that groups approach the implementation of their plans in a strategic, focused way <Col N="2040" /> and as a result, we can look forward to a more effective and efficient programme.</P>
    <P>This week, I signed the first agreement for the implementation of a local plan with one of the approved Leader II groups.  I will sign another agreement next Friday and a further one in the coming week.  We are at a very advanced stage in processing material submitted by several groups and I expect many more agreements will be signed during October.  The procedure we have followed since Leader II was first published by the European Commission on 1 July 1994 is that my Department immediately published the new programme by way of circulating a detailed comprehensive note for the information and guidance of potential applicant groups.  A number of public briefing sessions were held during July and August 1994 and my Department also advised applicant groups on an individual basis on the requirements of Leader II.</P>
    <P>Applicant groups were allowed three months up to the end of September 1994 to prepare and submit their business plan applications.  Given the work involved this was the minimum period groups would expect.</P>
    <P>Based on the requirements of the European Commission my Department was obliged to submit to the Commission by end of October 1994 an operational programme for the implementation of Leader in Ireland based on the business plan application received.  This deadline was met.</P>
    <P>The operational programme was approved by the European Commission as part of the first tranche of Leader II approvals on 29 March 1995.  I met Commissioner Fischler and senior officials of the Commission in February this year to expedite approval of the operational programme.  My Department had in the meantime carried out an assessment of the business plan applications so that once the operational programme had been approved, the Government was able to make an early decision on the selection of the approved groups.  That decision was <Col N="2041" /> taken on 2 May 1995 and the groups were informed immediately of their selection.</P>
    <P>In early June my Department issued the detailed rules for the implementation of the new programme.  These were based on the terms of the programme as published by the European Commission, the findings and recommendations of the independent evaluation of Leader I, the Comptroller and Auditor General's value for money report and our experience of implementing Leader I.  Following a consultative process with the approval groups the definitive operating rules, which incorporated a number of changes suggested to us, issued on 21 July 1995.  The purpose of the rules was to set out clearly and comprehensively for the groups the terms and conditions under which they will be required to operate to enable them to plan their affairs.  The rules are designated also to ensure a high standard of accountability and transparency in the administration of the programme.</P>
    <P>By the end of July, therefore, the framework for the implementation of the programme had been settled and I am satisfied that no time was lost at any stage of the preparations.</P>
    <P>In informing groups of their selection in early May, my Department set out a number of requirements with which they must comply before proceeding to sign agreements for the implementation of the programme.</P>
    <P>They were required to submit a detailed statement on how precisely they intended to co-ordinate their activities with other official bodies and programmes.  This requirement was essential to avoid duplication of effort. We also sought a statement of objectives from each group to be accompanied by a fairly detailed indication of output targets and a financial plan.  As well as providing a basis for subsequent evaluation this data will ensure that the groups engage in strategic planning to identify the activities they wish to participate in so as to best <Col N="2042" /> contribute to the local development process.  These requirements are essential in ensuring proper planning and a structured approach to implementing the local plans.  It is by determining their role in relation to other programmes, clearly identifying the opportunities for development and targeting their activities in a deliberate way that groups can best serve the interests of their areas.</P>
    <P>Leader II is a five year programme and groups are acting in a mature and responsible way by undertaking careful preparation rather than rushing ahead in an unfocused manner.  In addition to the planning process, many groups are concentrating on recruiting staff and the process of legal incorporation before seeking to sign the agreement with my Department.  My Department is dealing with the responses of the groups as a matter of priority and I am determined to sign agreements with them as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Leader is a vitally important programme for rural development.</P>

I assure the House that my Department and I will do everything possible to ensure the smooth operation of the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The continuing problems in the British nuclear industry are a source of major concern to all Irish people.  When the Government came into office it told us it was so concerned about this issue that it would set up a committee to deal with it.  However, we <Col N="2043" /> are not too sure who is on the committee or who is leading it as both the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, and the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, are claiming it.  All I know is that it has no ideas, plans or strategy. We have been told that the matter has been referred to the Attorney General. The Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, told us he had initiated a diplomatic offensive.  This offensive is so diplomatic nobody has heard about it and nothing has happened.  That is the record of the Government on this issue.</P>
      <P>I welcome the statement by the Minister that letters have been sent to their counterparts in the British Government. I am not saying the Government is not concerned about this issue but despite its statement on taking up office, that it intended to tackle it immediately and set out a strategy, absolutely nothing has been done to date.  Stronger action needs to be taken and the issue needs to be raised at the highest level in the British Government.  It is unacceptable that the British nuclear industry should try to cover up accidents, as has been revealed in the past few weeks.  The Government is obliged to convey the fears of Irish people on this issue to the British Government but it does not seem to have done this.  Maybe it has done so and the Minister may be more open in his reply than has been the case to date.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the question of the Wylfa nuclear plant in Wales.  This plant is 25 years old.  It is an ageing Magnox reactor, and one of the differences between it and other Magnox reactors is that the pressure vessel is made of concrete. Nuclear Electric, the operator of the plant, is saying it wishes to extend the life of this plant to run for over 30 years.  I have it on good scientific basis that there is no way to safely extend the life of such a plant, but that is what the company intends to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the British Government said it was going to privatise the nuclear industry, I raised the matter in the House.  I was particularly concerned that we did <Col N="2044" /> not protest when Mr. Michael Heseltine said in the House of Commons that the safety record of the British nuclear industry was second to none and an example of the world.  I asked the Government to protest about that statement but it did not do so and Mr. Heseltine got away with it.</P>
    <P>The Government seems unaware that when the privatisation takes place and the name on the licence changes there must be a public consultation period. Between now and 4 October the Government must inform the nuclear inspectorate that it intends to object to a new licence.  In that way we can stop the plant getting a new licence and thereby close it.</P>

      <P>I have checked it twice, and it is not wrong.  Once the name on the licence changes there is a public consultation process in which our Government could become involved. The Government must do that and must raise this at the very highest level with the British Government.  The Government does not seem to have done that. I asked the Taoiseach about it this morning and he did not answer the question.  There seems to have been no consultation with the British Government except through letters.  This is a very serious issue and it should be raised at the very highest level.  I will not say the Government is hiding behind the committee because that would be inconsistent of this side of the House, but the Government is getting the same advice we got when we were in Government. When he was Minister, my colleague, Deputy Cowen, was told that it was very difficult to make a case that would stand up.  That is what the Minister has been told.  He did not believe it when we were in Government.  Now his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, believes it because he has been told it clearly, although he did not believe it nine months ago when he was telling us all what he would do.  We <Col N="2045" /> should work together on this.  I do not believe we cannot do it.  It was confirmed this afternoon that 4 October is the date if we want to be in on the consultation process and thereby object to the extension of a licence for this plant.</P>

      <P>It is traditional to thank a Deputy for raising a matter in the House and I genuinely thank Deputy Ryan for raising this matter.  I regret that he availed of the opportunity to be partisan and used this opportunity for cheap point-scoring.  This issue is much too important for that.  It is a matter for consensus and unity on this side of the Irish Sea.</P>
      <P>Last week in a UK court, Nuclear Electric, the Operator of the Wylfa Magnox nuclear power station in Anglesea, Wales was fined £250,000 and costs for waiting nine hours before shutting down a damaged reactor.  To put that fine in context, they made profits of £1.3 billion last year.  The company pleaded guilty to four charges under the UK's Health and Safety at Work Act following an incident in July 1993 when part of a refuelling crane fell into the nuclear reactor.</P>
      <P>The judge involved said he was satisfied that there had been no danger of a meltdown such as happened at Five Mile Island and Chernobyl.  The worst possibility was the melting of Magnox fuel cranes in one of the reactor's 6,000 fuel channels, a problem that would have been confined to that channel. Notwithstanding the judge's opinion, it is my view that Britain's chief nuclear installations inspector in his tough condemnation of the Wylfa operators placed a huge question mark over the continuing statements emanating from the UK's nuclear industry about its safety culture.  On hearing of the case, I was deeply disturbed at the extent and seriousness of the incident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case there was a blatant failure to meet the high safety standards required in such a hazardous industry with the potential for an accident with <Col N="2046" /> transboundary consequences.  The chief nuclear installations inspector in the recent court case revealed a situation whereby a significant debris source was confirmed as not being in its only safe location.  Furthermore, it then took the management several hours to decide to shut down the reactor.  This represents a failure of Nuclear Electric's safety policies and it serves to highlight that while the regulations are there to prevent such accidents, they may not always be adhered to.</P>
    <P>This incident, described by the chief inspector as the most serious during his tenure, raises wider concerns about attitudes to safety in the UK nuclear industry ahead of its proposed privatisation next summer.  The nuclear review and privatisation proposals presented in the White Paper, &ldquo;The Prospects for Nuclear Power in the UK&rdquo;, place great emphasis on the importance of safety, but the Wylfa incident and a more recent one at Dungeness, to which I will refer later, serve to fuel the Government's continuing fears about the safety standards of the British nuclear industry. These incidents show that commercial considerations can outweigh safety considerations in the industry and that commercial pressures might become greater after privatisation.</P>
    <P>The seriousness of the Wylfa incident should not be understated, and it is clear that there was a potential significant risk to the health and safety of the Irish public and to the Irish environment.  Based on this, I have written in the strongest terms to the UK Minister for Energy, Mr. Tim Eggar, and to the Secretary of State for the Environment, Mr. John Gummer, expressing grave concern about the safety and reliability of the ageing Magnox nuclear reactors and on the adequacy of safety in the UK's nuclear industry generally.  Some of these reactors were built as far back as 1956 and are clearly not as reliable as more modern reactors.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Attorney General has been asked to examine the scope for taking action under the EURATOM Treaty in respect of the Wylfa incident.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2047" /> I make no apology for using the expertise of the Attorney General's office to advise me, as Minister, on what legal action I can take.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The onus for granting operating licences to nuclear power stations lies with the nuclear installations inspectorate of the UK's Health and Safety Executive, which require that the strict safety standards are met before a licence may be renewed.  The older Magnox reactors, like Wylfa, receive a licence renewal every two years, upon which the NII require that the station be shut down and subject to full examination.  The inspectorate then set out the safety requirements that a station must fulfil in order to be allowed to operate again.  There is no formal machinery available for public involvement in the renewal of a licence. However, I requested that the UK Government should immediately phase out all the existing Magnox reactors in the interest of nuclear safety, radiation protection and for avoidance of a similar incident.  I have sought an immediate <Col N="2048" /> review by the nuclear installations inspectorate of the closure and decommissioning strategies of the nuclear companies and stressed that decisions on the defuelling and shut down of individual stations, particularly those Magnox stations at Sellafield and Wylfa, should be taken as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>On a more general level, the Ministerial Task Force on Sellafield and the Irish Sea is examining all possible avenues open to the Government to reduce the serious threat by the UK's nuclear industry.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that Nuclear Electric has shut down another Magnox reactor at Dungeness in Kent in south-east England on 6 September in order to carry out precautionary checks following the discovery of some external damage to one of the metal standpipes which form part of the fuelling system.</P>
      <P>I was informed yesterday that the UK's Health and Safety Executive's nuclear installations inspectorate completed its preliminary investigations into the facts pertaining to this particular event.  It is satisfied with Nuclear Electric's response to the discovery of the problem.  Nuclear Electric is currently producing a safety case to justify the restarting of the reactor.  This is expected to be submitted to the nuclear installations inspectorate around the end of September.  Nuclear Electric will require the nuclear installations inspectorate's acceptance of the case before the reactor can be restarted.  It is likely to be several weeks before this can happen because of the need to undertake more detailed inspection work and to assess the safety case.  My Department has sought a full report on the Dungeness incident.</P>
      <P>Nuclear safety is a matter of concern to all Irish people and is one issue about which there is consensus among all political parties here.  That consensus ought to be reflected in the various parties cooperating in what is, after all, a national attempt to remove the threat imposed on the Irish people by the UK's nuclear industry.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>While the Government wish to see the decommissioning of all illegally-held weapons, they remain of the view that the decommissioning of weapons by the IRA should not be a precondition to participation by Sinn Féin in all-party talks &mdash; particularly in view of the very strong guarantee by the Irish and British Government in the Joint Declaration and Joint Framework Document that no change will be made in the status of Northern Ireland without the consent of a majority of the people there.  At the same time, as I indicated in the Dáil on 24 January, the Government recognise that the position of some other parties would show that progress on decommissioning is required in advance of all-party talks.  The idea of an International Commission remains under active consideration as a way of moving matters forward in these circumstances.</P>
      <P>I suggested the postponement of the Summit to allow some more time to attempt to resolve outstanding differences. The British Prime Minister agreed to my suggestion and the date of the Summit will be announced as soon as we are in a position to do so.</P>

The Programme stipulates that Partnerships are legally constituted under the Companies Acts and limited by guarantee and comprise of a board of directors, drawn at local level from representatives of: (i) The social partners, that is employers, trade unions and farming organisations where appropriate; (ii) State Agencies such as Forbairt, FAS, Teagasc and relevant education sector interests, local authorities and other regional public agencies as appropriate; (iii) community and voluntary organisations, active in economic and social development in their areas and which will contribute effectively to the local development initiative (paragraph 7.6).  The Operational Programme also stipulates that the directors will be selected on the basis of a balanced tripartite representation (paragraph 7.7).</P>
      <P>Copies of the Operational Programme have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Directors of partnership companies are appointed on the basis of nomination by the State agencies and social partner organisations and a process of nomination from among the community groups active in the economic and social development of the area and which can contribute to the local development process.</P>

It is ADM's responsibility to guide the establishment of the Partnership Companies and oversee the appointment of the boards.  Changes to boards are required as a result of extending partnership areas and these have occurred in all but one extended partnership area.  I have no involvement in making appointments to partnership boards.

      <P>While there are ongoing contacts between my Department and many of the companies, no formal meetings have taken place between myself and the Chairpersons and Chief Executives of the semi-State companies to date.  The first point of contact with Government for each State company is through its parent Department and Minister.  Each Minister is responsible for the bodies under his/her aegis, and for ensuring the delivery of efficient, minimum cost services to the public.</P>
      <P>Individual Ministers are also responsible for pursuing the commitments in the&ldquo;<i>Programme for Competiveness and Work</i>&rdquo; and the Government's programme &ldquo;<i>A Government of Renewal</i>&rdquo; in relation to using the expertise of State companies to develop new business opportunities, products and services which will lead to commercially sustainable employment.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Minister for Finance has general responsibilities for the semi-State sector as a whole in relation to issues such as public service pay, borrowings and related matters.</P>
      <P>I am willing to meet the management of both commercial and non-commercial State bodies, where appropriate. While no such meetings have been scheduled as yet, I would envisage that as the Strategic Management Initiative which is currently being pursued within the Civil Services is extended into the broader public service over the coming months that such meetings will arise.</P>

      <P>The European Commission on 26 July, approved a joint Operational Programme submitted by the Irish and British Governments for the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation for Northern Ireland and the Border counties of Ireland, (PEACE Programme).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Total EU funding available to the PEACE Programme over the three <Col N="2059" /> years 1995 &mdash; 1997 is 300 million ECU (approx £240 million).  This will be subject to review at the end of that period. Depending on the success of the Programme, further funding, taking the Programme up to the end of 1999, could be provided.</P>
    <P>The National Authorities responsible for the implementation of the Operational Programme are the Department of Finance in Dublin and the Department of Finance and Personnel in Belfast.  In the Border counties of the Republic, the delivery mechanisms will ensure the fullest local involvement. Accordingly, in addition to central Government and its agencies, delivery of some 50 per cent of the measures under the Programme will be implemented through the use of intermediary bodies, funded by means of global grants.  They will also assist in the overall co-ordination of the Programme. In this jurisdiction, it is proposed that the intermediary bodies of the Employment, Urban and Rural Regeneration, Cross-Border Development (Reconciliation), Social Inclusion and Productive Investment sub-programmes will be Area Development Management Ltd. (ADM) and the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
    <P>In respect of the cross-Border development sub-programme, it is proposed that Co-operation North in association with IBEC/CBI (NI) will be the intermediary body for the Business and Cultural Linkages measure.</P>
    <P>It is the firm intention of the two Governments and the Commission that funding will reach groups on the ground in Northern Ireland and the Border counties at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>Interested groups should now submit applications for funding under the various measures covered by the Programme.</P>

      <P>The Government has consistently emphasised to the British Government the importance of prison issues in the context of the peace process, and the need to respond positively to the new situation in the aftermath of the paramilitary ceasefires.</P>
      <P>I have devoted particular attention to these matters, including the question of release and prison conditions, in the discussions which I have had with the Secretary of State in the framework of the Anglo-Irish Conference.  In this regard I have consistently underlined the crucial importance of all cases in Northern Ireland being treated with rigorous impartiality, both as regards the due process of the law and any executive decisions which may be taken in relation to sentences handed down by the courts, after the law has run its course.</P>
      <P>The concerns aroused by the handling of Private Clegg's case have been repeatedly conveyed to the British Government at the highest levels, including the Anglo-Irish Inter-Governmental Conference on 30 June and in the Taoiseach's statement following the release of Private Clegg.  In view of the particular need to foster confidence in the process of justice in Northern Ireland we stressed the damage which would be caused by any perception that there is one set of rules for members of the security forces who are convicted of offences, and another for everyone else.</P>
      <P>It is essential in the context of the peace process that prison issues should be dealt with in a sensitive and flexible manner.  I can assure you that the Government will be raising these matters with the British Government, and in particular the implications of the Clegg decision for other prisioners to whom similar considerations should apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indeed read the particular article in question.  In the Government's view, it gave a completely inaccurate representation of the International Fund's financial position. A central allegation of the article &mdash; namely, that the Fund was &ldquo;in debt&rdquo; and in &ldquo;financial crisis&rdquo;&mdash; is quite simply untrue.  The Fund has always operated within the limits of its committed resources.  Its annual accounts are independently audited and are presented to the Irish and British Governments as well as to the Fund's international donors.  Contrary to the suggestion in the article, the Fund's receipts to date exceed its commitments to specific projects and initiatives.</P>
      <P>Many other assertions of the article were factually incorrect and at least three third parties who were allegedly quoted have challenged the newspaper on the accuracy of the attributed remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for the opportunity to associate myself with the Fund Chairman's effective rebuttal of the article and to again place on the record of this House the Government's deep appreciation of the work being undertaken by the International Fund <Col N="2062" /> for Ireland.  Since 1986 the Fund has made a major contribution towards the economic development of the 12 northern counties and has been very successful in promoting dialogue and reconciliation between the two traditions on the island.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the recent evaluation of the Fund carried out by KPMG Management Consultants has conclusively demonstrated the success and effectiveness of the Fund.  It showed that the Fund's total commitment of £263 million had levered an additional investment of £450 million from the public and private sectors; that it had provided assistance towards some 24,000 jobs; that it was instrumental in supporting over 440 organisations which operate on a cross-community or cross-Border basis; and that it had sponsored North-South business links involving over 1,000 companies.</P>
    <P>I have also had the benefit of witnessing for myself the positive impact which the Fund has made on many disadvantaged communities.  In places like Clones, Ballinamore, Lifford and West Belfast I have seen how the Fund has given new hope and encouragement to local communities to take responsibility for the regeneration of their own areas. The Fund has been a wonderful success story which, through careful use of its resources, has achieved outstanding results on the ground.</P>
    <P>The International Fund and the communities it serves should be very proud of what has been achieved through their many partnerships.  The Government is very pleased to endorse and support all of this good work.  None of these achievements would of course be possible without the enabling resources provided by the international donors to the Fund.  The Government and the people of Ireland owe a considerable debt of gratitude to the United States, the European Union, Canada, New Zealand and Australia for their generous support of the International Fund over the last nine years.</P>

      <P>Last month's forced repatriation of up to 15,000 refugees from Rwanda and Burundi by the Government of Zaire is a matter of grave concern to the Government.  This action, which the Zairean Government suspended on 24 August, was clearly contrary to international conventions on the status of refugees and posed a serious threat to the stability of the Great Lakes Region.  In suspending its action the Zairean Government has given an end-of-year deadline to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to complete the repatriation of refugees from its territory.  According to the UN High Commissioner, who travelled to Zaire and neighbouring states to allay the crisis, this deadline would require a repatriation rate of about 20,000 refugees per day to be met.</P>
      <P>Ireland supported the initiative for a demarche by the EU to the Zairean Foreign Minister on 1 September which was followed by further demarches in Rwanda and Burundi.  An EU Ministerial Troika also visited Rwanda and Burundi on 14-16 September.  In addition to voicing its concerns about recent developments the EU has sought to use these opportunities to secure the full participation of countries in the region in an action-oriented international conference on the Great Lakes Region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government considers the safe, voluntary repatriation of refugees to their home countries essential to any lasting settlement of the crisis in the Great Lakes Region.  It strongly supports the holding of an international conference on peace, stability and security in the region as soon as possible to <Col N="2064" /> prevent any further deterioration in the situation.  It also considers it imperative that the EU intensify its efforts to rehabilitate the Governments and administration of both Rwanda and Burundi so that proper conditions for the return of refugees can be created, including the establishment of more adequate judicial and penal systems.</P>
    <P>Since April last year the Government has disbursed a total of £4.2 million in emergency assistance to the Great Lakes Region.  This has included £153,000 allocated to the International Committee of the Red Cross to relieve the appalling humanitarian conditions in Rwanda prisons.  A total of £250,000 has been given in funding for the UN Human Rights Monitors Team and to the International Tribunal which is investigating the genocide in Rwanda.</P>
    <P>The Government continues to support efforts to restore civic institutions and the rule of law in Rwanda.  Of the £1 million it pledged in rehabilitation to the Rwandan Government at last January's Round Table Conference in Geneva, a total of £479,000 has been allocated to date.  This has included £100,000 channelled through the UN Trust Fund to restore the legal archive of the Rwandan Ministry of Justice and a further £25,000 in support of a training school for communal police.</P>

    <P>The debate in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and its Resolution reflected a deep felt desire to ensure the <Col N="2066" /> protection of the inhabitants of the designated safe areas.  I fully share this objective.</P>
    <P>In light of the inability of the United Nations to deter the aggression against Srebrenica and Zepa, and with a view to considering the most appropriate response by the international community, including President Chirac's proposals, an international meeting was convened in London on 21 July.  The participants included France and other major troop contributors, the European Union, United Nations and NATO.  A number of important conclusions emerged from this meeting:</P>
    <P>&mdash;It was agreed that any Bosnian Serb offensive against Gorazde would be met with a substantial and decisive response.  The sense of the meeting was that, rather than deploy UNPROFOR personnel to the isolated safe areas, the use of air power was the most effective deterrent.  The Bosnian Serb forces, which were then threatening to over-run Gorazde, did not subsequently proceed with their offensive.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The London meeting also reaffirmed the importance of UNPROFOR's mandate and its presence in Sarajevo, and its determination to ensure access to Sarajevo for the delivery of provisions to the civilian population.  It was also agreed to support UNPROFOR's continuing role in Bosnia and its rapid reaction capacity, but noted that if the arms embargo were lifted, UNPROFOR would have to be withdrawn, and a vacuum thus created with tragic consequences for the region.</P>
    <P>I welcomed the conclusions of the London meeting at that time.</P>
    <P>Following that meeting, detailed arrangements for the protection of the civilian population of Sarajevo and the other safe areas were elaborated.  The Bosnian Serb leadership in Pale was warned that threats against safe areas would be countered by significant air <Col N="2067" /> strikes.  The action taken by NATO on behalf of the United Nations in response to the 28 August massacre in Sarajevo was in response to the strong desire of the international community to ensure the protection of the civilian population of the safe areas.</P>
    <P>These developments will not, in themselves, bring peace to Bosnia.  The United Nations and the various security organisations which have been engaged in the former Yugoslavia consider that only on the basis of a negotiated political settlement will all of the peoples of Bosnia be able to live in peace and security.  I fully share this view and earnestly hope that the ongoing diplomatic initiative of the Contact Group will engage all parties in an urgent commitment to a peaceful resolution of the conflict.</P>
    <P>The renewed peace initiative currently under way to achieve a negotiated outcome was the centre-piece of my discussions with my colleagues during the Ministerial meeting in Santander earlier this month.  The peace process will be reviewed during the informal meeting of European Union Heads of State or Government later this week, together with the dramatic events which are now unfolding on the ground in Bosnia.</P>
    <P>With regard to humanitarian assistance and the admission of additional refugees proposed in the Joint Committee's Resolution, I wish to recall that the Government have made a significant contribution to the relief of distress arising from the situation in former Yugoslavia. This has included support for humanitarian programmes in the region and the admission of refugees to Ireland.  Since the beginning of the crisis, £2.5 million has been allocated to emergency humanitarian assistance programmes in former Yugoslavia.  In addition, a total of 435 refugees from the area have been admitted to Ireland, including both medical evacuees and programme refugees accepted as a result of specific Government decisions.</P>
    <P>On 28 July of this year, the United <Col N="2068" /> Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) appealed to 34 countries, including Ireland, to accept 5,000 refugees as a matter of urgency.  In response to this request, and taking account of the Resolution of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Government decided on 29 August to admit a further 250 refugees.  In addition, this decision also envisages that close relatives of the basis group will be admitted.  Thus, the total number to be admitted as a result of this decision is likely to be well in excess of 250.  It is estimated that the cost of resettling the basic group of 250 refugees in Ireland, in the first year alone, will be in the region of £2.8 million.  I am satisfied that the measures approved by the Government on 29 August represent a positive and significant contribution by Ireland to the international response to the current humanitarian situation in the former Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>The Government remain open to considering the admission of further refugees in light of the requirements identified by the UNHCR and our ability to cope in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee's Resolution also referred to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The Deputy will be aware that the Government have strongly supported the Tribunal's work since its foundation in 1993.  Ireland was one of a small number of UN Member States to make a voluntary contribution to the Tribunal when it was being financed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and has worked to ensure that the Tribunal was placed on a firm financial foundation.  Agreement on the financing of the Tribunal was finally secured at the United Nations in July.  We will continue to co-operate with the Tribunal and to support its work in order to ensure that those responsible for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia will be brought to justice.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 21 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, Ireland has consistently condemned the abuses of human rights in East Timor.  We express our concerns directly to the Indonesian authorities on every appropriate occasion.  We raise the issue of East Timor in international fora and with friendly countries which are closely involved in the situation.</P>
      <P>Last May I raised the question of East Timor with the Indonesian Ambassador and again expressed our concerns to him.  I also met with the Australian Foreign Minister, Mr. Gareth Evans, in New York on 18 April, when East Timor was one of the issues we discussed. As an important Pacific neighbour of Indonesia.  Australia can play a significant role in influencing the Indonesian authorities in regard to East Timor.</P>
      <P>I wrote the following article setting out in some detail the Government's policy and actions in relation to East Timor, which appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 13 July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2071" /> I can assure the House that the Government will continue with its policy of active engagement on the issue of East Timor at the international level, including within the appropriate UN bodies.</P>
    <P Just="Center">IRELAND TO THE FORE IN SEEKING INTERNATIONAL ACTION ON EAST TIMOR.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>The Government is one of the main advocates of East Timor's struggle for justice, writes the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dick Spring.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Times</i> in its editorial last Friday called on the Government to reinforce its diplomatic pressure on Indonesia to change its policies on East Timor.  <i>The Irish Times</i> is right.  The Government should, and will, do more to assist the suffering people of East Timor in their struggle to achieve justice and the basic human rights to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>What Ireland has done already is substantial and, I believe, has contributed to the new signs of movement on the issue outlined in the editorial.  The fact is that Ireland has been and will continue to be one of the foremost international advocates of East Timor's case.</P>
    <P>That case is a compelling one.  A small territory has been invaded and annexed by a powerful neighbour in defiance of international law and the United Nations.  The Indonesian military administration of East Timor has been widely condemned, including by the Irish Government, for its gross abuses of human rights that have involved extrajudicial executions, torture, disappearances, unlawful arrests, and arbitrary detentions.</P>
    <P>The most horrific and widely known incident was the cold-blooded killing of up to 270 people in November 1991, when Indonesian troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration at the Santa Cruz cemetery in the East Timor capital of Dill.  A UN investigation has concluded that members of the Indonesian security forces were responsible for the <Col N="2072" /> killings, and has criticised the Indonesian Government for failing to satisfactorily investigate the fate of those who were killed and those who have disappeared as a result of the massacre.</P>
    <P>More recently, in January of this year, Indonesian soldiers shot and killed six men in Liquics outside Dill in an incident which is seen as part of a broader pattern of abuse and which has reinforced the need for international action.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been pressing for such action at the UN and within the EU.  We have maintained contact with those who may be in a position to influence events, including the Portuguese Government, the Australian Government and individuals inside East Timor and we have taken up the issue directly with the Indonesian Government.  Almost all the proposals contained in the action plus adopted at the recent Parliamentary Forum in Lisbon, from which incidentally Deputy Tom Kitt seems to have drawn most of his ideas for <i>The Irish Times</i> last week, are Irish Government policy and are being actively pursued.</P>
    <P>In recent months I have had discussions about East Timor with Gareth Evans, the Australian Foreign Minister. As an important Pacific neighbour of Indonesia, Australia can play a significant role in influencing the Indonesian authorities to change their policies.  We will continue to encourage Australia to do so.  In May I took up the matter personally with the Indonesia ambassador, so that the Indonesian authorities can be in no doubt about the depth of feeling in the Government and among the broader Irish public about his government's actions.</P>
    <P>At the recent session of the UN Commission on Human Rights Ireland was active in ensuring that the issue was given proper attention both by the EU and by the UN Commission itself.  One of the positive outcomes of this pressure was the agreement by Indonesia to invite the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit East Timor this year, and to report to the UN on his <Col N="2073" /> findings.  This is a significant commitment and one which we expect the Indonesian authorities to keep to.</P>
    <P>The work of the Irish delegation won public praise from the leader of the East Timor delegation at the UN Commission earlier this year &ldquo;for its firm stand within the EU and in the UN in support of the legitimate rights of the East Timorese people&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Last week my colleague, the Minister of State, Joan Burton, had discussions with Bishop Belo of Dill &mdash; one of the courageous churchmen working for a political solution &mdash; about the situation in East Timor and the ways in which the Irish Government can help.  Bishop Belo played a positive role in the first intra-Timorese dialogue meeting, which had just taken place and which we strongly support.</P>
    <P>Ireland has consistently condemned Indonesia's policies in East Timor.  But, as the recent activities mentioned above show, our policy goes beyond condemnation to include active international engagement on the issue with clear objectives.</P>
    <P>We want Indonesia to end its illegal occupation of the territory.</P>
    <P>We want to see a political solution on the basis of International law and justice.</P>
    <P>We want to see the people of East Timor enjoy their full human and political rights.</P>
    <P>We want to stop the supply to Indonesia of arms that could be used as instruments of oppression in East Timor.</P>
    <P>We want to see the release of Xanana Cusmao and other political prisoners.</P>
    <P>We want Indonesia to co-operate fully with the United Nations, with the UN Commission on Human Rights and with international NGOs.</P>
    <P>I believe that these objectives have overwhelming public and political support in Ireland, where the plight of the people of East Timor has evoked a concerned and sympathetic response.  As Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I will continue to work to ensure that that concern and sympathy <Col N="2074" /> are translated into effective action at international level.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 23, 28 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is totally opposed to all nuclear weapons testing and they view with deep concern and dismay the resort to renewed nuclear testing in recent months by the French and Chinese Governments.  The Government's concerns at the French and Chinese actions have been made quite clear to both Governments bilaterally and in the appropriate multilateral fora.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2075" /> I set out the Government's concerns at the two Chinese tests in my statements of 16 May and 17 August.  In addition, our views were conveyed through diplomatic channels to the Chinese Government in Beijing.  On 17 August, the Irish observer delegation to the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, on my instructions, raised these concerns at the Chinese tests during a Plenary session of the Conference.</P>
    <P>Following the announcement by the President of France in June that France would resume testing, I urged the French Government, in public statements and in my bilateral contacts with my French counterpart, to reconsider this decision and I appealed to France to set an international example in support of continued moratoriums on nuclear testing with a view to early progress towards a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.  In this House on 27 June, and in public statements on 14 June, 10 July and 1 September, I set out the strong concerns of the Irish Government over the planned French action.  In these statements, I particularly emphasised the commitment, which had been made by the nuclear weapon States at the NPT Review and Extension Conference, to exercise &ldquo;utmost restraint&rdquo; pending the entry into force of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.  In addition, I invoked the wider interests of general nuclear disarmament and of the environment.</P>
    <P>I pressed these points in strong terms at a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in the margins of the EU summit in Cannes on 26 June, and at the General Affairs Council on 17 July.</P>
    <P>Following the French decision to proceed, on 5 September with a test at Muroroa Atoll, I expressed the Government's dismay and deep concern that France had proceeded with its action in the face of unprecedented opposition on the part of countries of the Pacific region and despite numerous appeals to desist addressed to France by friendly countries, including Ireland.  I appealed again to France to bring to an end its <Col N="2076" /> nuclear testing and to mitigate by all possible means the health and environment effects.  I stressed in particular that the commitments to nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament which were given by all participants at the Non Proliferation Treaty Review Conference must be upheld; and I restated our resolute and unwavering opposition to all nuclear testing.</P>
    <P>I availed of the informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Santander ten days ago to emphasise the concerns of the Government, and the strength of opinion on this issue within Ireland, to the Foreign Minister of France.  A number of my EU colleagues, indeed the majority, also made clear their opposition to the French testing.  I will continue to avail of every appropriate opportunity &mdash; both bilateral and multilateral, including meetings within the framework of the EU &mdash; to raise the issue.</P>
    <P>The French Government, for their part, have implied that their testing programme may not extend to the full series of eight tests originally announced. For my part, I wish to see no further tests and I have made that perfectly clear to the French Government.  Having said that, I regard the recent French assurance that France will support a fully comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which unequivocally applies to all nuclear testing of whatever scale, as an important commitment in the context of the objective of concluding a binding Test Ban Treaty next year.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that our contacts with the French Government and the strong public interest in the issue in Ireland have left the French authorities in no doubt about the opposition in Ireland to the resumption of nuclear testing.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has strongly supported the establishment of an International Tribunal for Rwanda which was set up under UN Security Council Resolution 955 of 8 November 1994 to prosecute persons responsible for genocide and other serious violations of international humanitarian law in Rwanda.  The process of investigation into such violations has begun and is dealing with approximately 400 identified suspects.  The Tribunal opened its first Plenary Session in The Hague on 26 June and will bring cases to trial in the near future.</P>
      <P>The Government considers the work of the International Tribunal essential to the process of national reconciliation in Rwanda.  Ireland was one of the first countries to contribute financially to the UN Trust Fund for the Tribunal and we encouraged the commencement of its work at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>The common position on Rwanda adopted by the EU Council of Ministers on 18 October 1994 stressed the importance of bringing to justice those responsible for the grave violations of humanitarian law, including genocide.  In this respect the EU considered the establishment of an international Tribunal as an essential element to stop a tradition of impunity and to prevent future violations of human rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The restoration of a functioning and independent judiciary is necessary for the Rwandan Government to bring to trial those accused of taking part in the genocide, and is central to the country's long term stability.  We understand that together with the UN, the Government of Rwanda is completing a plan of action for its prison and judicial system. We have joined with our EU partners in confirming our preparedness to assist the rehabilitation of the Rwandan judicial system and have asked the Rwandan Government to inform us of <Col N="2079" /> their needs.  The EU Ministerial troika that visited Rwanda on 16 September was to have raised this matter with the Rwandan Government, and we await its report of those discussions with interest.</P>
    <P>Bilaterally, Ireland has contributed over £500,000 to the human rights and justice sector in Rwanda.  This includes: £100,000 to the Ministry of Justice for the restoration of the country's legal archive; £100,000 for the International Tribunal; £150,000 for UN Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda (HRFOR); £175,000 for the International Committee of the Red Cross, to help relieve the humanitarian crisis in the prisons.</P>
    <P>In addition, a further £50,000 has been approved for a study unit on genocide and the response to it, in which the Rwandan President's office and human rights monitors are participating; and £75,000 has been approved for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to support a technical co-operation unit in the Ministry of Justice.</P>
    <P>The EU has provided a contingent of human rights monitors for the UN field operation.  The Government regard the work of the human rights monitors as very valuable both in helping to create a climate of confidence in the country and in regard to the investigation of genocide and other major violations of human rights and humanitarian law. Three of the EU team, including its coordinator, are Irish.</P>

However, it is envisaged that the visit will take place during <Col N="2080" /> the period between 29 November and 2 December, 1995.</P>

      <P>Apart from employees of the Irish Government who are serving with the UN peacekeeping forces and some of our citizens working with non-governmental relief organisations in the former Yugoslavia, there are about 50 Irish citizens in Croatia and Slovenia, the former Yugoslav Republics to which we have accredited ambassadors.</P>
      <P>Eighteen members of the Gárda Síochána and nine members of the Defence Forces are serving with the UN peacekeeping forces in the former Yugoslavia; in addition, five members of the Defence Forces are serving with the European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM), two with the European Community Humanitarian Assistance Task Force (ECHATF) and two with the border-monitoring mission of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia (ICFY).  Two Irish Customs officials are serving with the OSCE Sanctions Assistance Mission monitoring the implementation of UN sanctions.</P>
      <P>Three Irish citizens are working in the former Yugoslavia with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.</P>
      <P>Seven of our citizens are working there with non-governmental organisations: five with the Red Cross and one each with Refugee Trust and International Medical Corps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our embassies in Berne and Vienna, in co-operation with other EU embassies in Ljubljana and Zagreb, are responsible for the protection of Irish citizens in Croatia, other than those serving with the UN and in Slovenia.  In accordance <Col N="2081" /> with long-standing arrangements with regard to Irish citizens in countries where we are not represented, the British embassies provide consular protection for the very small number of our citizens in Bosnia-Herzogovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, including Irish members of the ICFY monitoring mission.</P>
    <P>The protection of Irish Government employees serving with the UN peacekeeping forces is the responsibility of the United Nations.  The ECMM and ECHATF liaise closely with the UN about the protection of their staff.</P>

      <P>I have already made clear, as has the Taoiseach, that the question of action to combat illegal drugs is a matter which Ireland will continue to pursue as a priority at EU level, including during our Presidency.</P>
      <P>The theme or themes of a Presidency must take account of the full agenda of the European Union.  It is the Government's intention that the fight against drugs will be a theme of the Irish Presidency in 1996.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to say that Mr. Trimble was quick to respond positively to the Government's invitation and has signalled his willingness to come to Dublin in the near future.  You will also be aware that he has already met the Minister for Social Welfare in Belfast.</P>

      <P>In 1979, when Ireland established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, the Irish Government recognised the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China.  The Chinese position at that time was and still is that China included Tibet.</P>
      <P>In relation to Tibet, a central concern of Government policy has been and remains the respect and protection of the human rights of Tibetans.  This is an issue which I raise with the Chinese authorities at every appropriate opportunity.</P>
      <P>At the UN Commission on Human Rights this year, Ireland, together with our EU partners, co-sponsored a draft resolution on the situation of human rights in China, which indicated concern at &ldquo;the inadequate protection of the distinct cultural, ethnic, linguistic and religious identity of Tibetans and others&rdquo;.  In the event this draft resolution was defeated by the narrowest of margins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government will consider the terms of any draft resolution concerning <Col N="2088" /> the Tibetan people which may be tabled at the forthcoming UN General Assembly in the light of the above.</P>

      <Quest>the contact, if any, he has had with Carlo Trojan, the EU official who stated at the Slieve Russell Conference that he would look favourably at a cocktail of Delors Peace Initiative and IFI funding as matching funding, in view of the difficulty experienced by Local Authorities and community groups in drawing down EU funds due to their inability to provide matching funding.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the autumn of 1994, shortly after the cessation of violence in Northern Ireland, the European Commission created a special task force under Carlo Trojan to look into further ways of giving practical assistance to Northern Ireland and the Border counties of Ireland in consultation with the national authorities.  The creation of the task force was a practical expression of the European Union's commitment to the peace and reconciliation process, which had been underlined in the statement of then Commission President, Jacques Delors, welcoming the cessation of violence.</P>
      <P>The task force carried out a very wide ranging consultation process in the course of which the views of all relevant parties were canvassed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the report of the task force the Commission adopted a proposal for a Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties of Ireland, to be implemented in the form of a Community initiative under the Structural Funds.  The initiative will run for five years, from 1995 to 1999, equivalent to the remaining period of application of the current Structural Funds programmes. Community funding amounting to 300 million ECUs is being provided initially for a three year period, from 1995 to 1997.  Further financing for <Col N="2089" /> the last two years will be subject to a review based on an evaluation of the programme on behalf of the Commission.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland and the Border counties funding to match the EU contribution will come from a variety of sources.  However, as indicated in the overall financial table attaching to the programme, the bulk of the matching funds will come from the two central Governments.  The remainder will come from a variety of sources including local authorities, the private sector and community/voluntary groups.</P>
    <P>Due to the nature of this programme, many projects will be submitted from disadvantaged groups or individuals who may have extreme difficulty in making a direct contribution to the financing of their proposals and this will be taken into account in deciding the level of funding from the programme. Account may also be taken of resources in kind, for example, premises and human resources.  It is expected that the International Fund for Ireland will also cofinance some of the projects under this programme.</P>
    <P>All matching funds provided by central Government will be fully additional.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that work is continuing on building up the register of landlords.  This work has been helped by the changes in this year's Finance Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 of the Finance Act, 1995 provides, with effect from the current tax year 1995/96, tax relief for all tenants living in private rented accommodation. Under this section, in addition to the tenant furnishing the name and address of the landlord to an inspector <Col N="2090" /> of taxes in support of a claim, he or she is also asked to furnish the landlord's tax reference number.  Landlords are required to include this information in any receipt or acknowledgement for rent which is given to tenants.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, section 14 of the Finance Act 1995 also provides that certain public bodies, including health boards and local authorities, who make payments of rent subsidies are required to make automatic returns of such payments to the Revenue Commissioners, including details regarding the address of the premises and the name and address of the owner of the premises.</P>
    <P>The Special Enquiry Branch in Dublin conducted 760 visits in connection with rental income in the period 1 October, 1994 to 31 August, 1995.  In the same period the Special Enquiry Branch identified 399 new cases of undisclosed income, 72 of which were not on Revenue records previously and the balance of 327 were on record but had not disclosed their rental income.</P>
    <P>I trust that the Deputy will understand that on the grounds of confidentiality the Revenue Commissioners are precluded from giving details concerning the addresses mentioned by him.</P>

      <P>A clerical officer who transfers to another Department will retain service for such purposes as superannuation and eligibility for interdepartmental competitions.  With regard to seniority the practice in general is that a clerical officer would retain seniority on compulsory transfer but would lose it if the transfer were voluntary.  Issues relating to seniority are however a matter for determination by the head of each individual Department.</P>

      <P>The need to provide additional space to the Houses of the Oireachtas has been apparent for some time and was recognised as a priority objective by the Government.  A number of options for addressing this matter has been under review and the Government recently decided that the best of these options was to allocate Agriculture House, which is adjacent to Leinster House, to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transfer will be affected on a phased basis over the next few years.  It is expected that the first of the Oireachtas personnel will move into the <Col N="2092" /> building by early 1997 following the relocation of the first units of Department of Agriculture personnel from the building and completion of adaptations to the west block by the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that headage payments form part of a farmer's taxable trade income whether or not it is the farmer's sole source of income.  Consequently, it is also &ldquo;reckonable income&rdquo; for the purpose of determining whether a person is liable for the health contribution of 1.25 per cent under the Health Contributions Act, 1979 and the employment and training levy of 1 per cent under Employment and Training Levy legislation.</P>

      <P>In the event of a constitutional change allowing for divorce legislation in this State, the pension position of divorced spouses of public servants would fall to be catered for under general legislation applicable to all occupational pension schemes, both public sector and private sector.</P>
      <P>In this connection, I would point out that the Family Law Bill, 1994, contains provisions enabling the courts to make orders in relation to the maintenance, property and pension rights of spouses following the granting of a decree of judicial separation.  The Bill provides that court orders relating to pension benefits will have direct applicability to all pension schemes, including those for public servants.  In the event of a constitutional change allowing for divorce in this State, I understand that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform would then introduce similar legislation in relation to divorce, which would also have direct applicability to public service pension schemes.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are satisfied that the most effective means of providing a Customs Service in the Bantry Bay/Beara Peninsula area is to have staff centralised in and operating from Bantry, and deployed on a flexible basis to various locations, including Castletownbere, as required, to meet the needs of the work.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners recognise that because of the large concentration of fishing vessels in Castletownbere at certain times of the year, the full time assignment of an officer of Customs and Excise during the peak period is warranted. Full time attendance has, in fact, been given from March to the end of August, to cater for the peak fishing period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Outside the peak fishing period, the Commissioners cannot accept that a sufficient volume of work exists to justify the full-time attendance of an officer of Customs and Excise.  In the off peak season, therefore, the best means of providing a customs service, is as already stated, by the deployment of staff from Bantry on a flexible basis.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55, 56, 57 and 58 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, State Body Guidelines which dealt with the underlying principles which should govern relationships between Departments of State and State Bodies were issued by the then Minister for Finance on 11 March, 1992.  <i>Inter alia,</i> these guidelines covered the issue of competitive tendering. However, prior to this, in September 1986, the Government had approved the publication of standard Government contracts procedures to be followed in the public sector &mdash; including State Bodies &mdash; in a booklet entitled <Col N="2100" /><i>An Outline of Government Contracts Procedures.</i>  This publication set out procedures for the award of public contracts and the disposal of public property and drew attention to the requirements under EU Directives and GATT obligations.  The booklet was replaced in 1994 by a new Guide entitled &ldquo;Public Procurement&rdquo;, which updated the procedures and again emphasised the relevant obligations and requirements.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking the State Body Guidelines lay down general principles to be followed and do not specify the number of tenders to be sought and received; however, the Public Procurement booklet, whose principles the State bodies are also expected to comply with, indicates that not less than five firms should be invited to tender and not less than three realistic tenders received.  The State Body Guidelines provide that competitive tendering should be normal procedure save in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Guidelines provide that, if for some compelling reason, a significant contract is awarded without competitive tendering this should only be done with the express consent of the board.  In this regard &ldquo;significant&rdquo; means any contract in excess of £100,000 for construction work or the purchase of goods and equipment and in excess of £25,000 for financial or other professional services, from a single supplier in any one year.</P>
    <P>State Bodies were asked, under the aforementioned Guidelines and booklets, to observe the general principles of Government contracts procedures in their purchasing, of which competitive tendering is the central pillar.  The manner in which the day-to-day commercial business of these bodies is discharged is a matter for their Boards &mdash; the type of procurement procedures to be adopted in any given situation will be a matter for the board to decide in the light of the principles referred to above and would have regard to managerial and legal advice and would depend on the value and type of procurement.  In addition to the Government Guidelines, in cases where the value of a contract <Col N="2101" /> exceed a certain amount, a number of State Bodies are subject to certain provisions of EU Procurement Directives.</P>
    <P>No breaches of my Department's guidelines for the award of semi-State contracts have been notified to my Department.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is also aware, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications has recently established a Task Force to review certain procedures in relation to, <i>inter alia,</i> the procurement of goods and services by the State Bodies under his aegis.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>the reason for the apparent fall off in consumer expenditure so far in 1995; if he expects the original budget projection of private consumption growth of 5.25 per cent to be met; if not, the current official projection; and the budgetary and employment implications of this projection.</Quest>
      <QRef>[13270/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The forecast increase in consumer <Col N="2102" /> spending for 1995 contained in the budget projection was 5.25 per cent. This was consistent with a projected rise in the volume of retail sales of about 5 per cent.  Retail sales account for only about 60 per cent of personal consumer spending and, crucially, do not include spending on services which tends to grow faster than spending on goods.</P>
      <P>Strong growth in consumer spending was expected this year because of rising employment, continuing low inflation and higher take-home pay &mdash; all leading to a substantial increase in real disposable incomes.  With relatively low and stable interest rates a modest fall in the personal savings ratio was also expected to boost consumption.</P>
      <P>Retail sales data are available for the first half of the year and show a rise in the volume of sales of only about 1½ per cent.  Clearly a considerable acceleration in sales is needed over the second half of the year if the forecast growth rate is to be reached.</P>
      <P>There are a number of grounds for expecting that consumer spending will be much stronger in the second half of the year.  Many of the measures taken in this year's budget which will boost real disposable incomes &mdash; e.g. social welfare increases, child benefit from September, &ldquo;equal treatment&rdquo; arrears etc. &mdash; are having their effect only in the later months of the year.  Car registrations were very strong in July and August and full year growth in total car registrations should be in the region of 7 per cent, assisted by the £1,000 scrappage refund scheme.  The increase in interest rates in the first half of the year may have adversely affected consumer sentiment but this should be largely offset by recent interest rate reductions.  The strength of retail sales in 1994 was concentrated in the first half of the year so that stronger year-to-year growth in the second half of the year is likely.  After declining in the first half of the year, consumer sentiment indicators have resumed an upward trend in May and June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite these positive influences, the budget forecast growth of about 5 per <Col N="2103" /> cent in retail sales may not be fully reached.  However, this does not necessarily mean that total consumer spending growth will be lower than forecast although its composition would be different.  Stronger growth in spending on services &mdash; which is not captured in retail sales data &mdash; could compensate for lower than expected sales of goods.</P>
    <P>This interpretation is supported by indirect tax inflows which, over the year to date reflect slightly weaker than expected Excise receipts, where VAT receipts are a little ahead of expectations. Over the year as a whole, overall indirect tax yields seem set to turn out above the budget target.</P>
    <P>The strong growth in tourist numbers in the first half of the year and anecdotal evidence of a continuation of this over the summer months is unlikely to have been picked up in retail sales data, which would not capture the large services element of spending by tourists.</P>
    <P>Buoyant payroll tax returns suggest that employment growth over the year to date is at least in line with budget-time expectations.</P>

      <P>The latest forecast for the average level of unemployment in 1995 is that published in <i>Economic Review and Outlook 1995.</i>  It is estimated that the Live Register average for 1995 will be about 274,000 &mdash; a fall of 8,000 compared with 1994.  The fall in unemployment does not reflect the growth in employment, which is expected to remain strong.  The decline in unemployment is markedly slower than the growth in employment because, with increasing employment opportunities and less emigration, the labour force is expanding.</P>

I indicated in my reply to the Deputy on 29 June 1995 that the board is in the process of expanding its range of services available for drug misusers. The board will also be keeping the situation under continuous review to ensure it is in a position to respond to needs as they emerge.  As part of this response the board will be keeping a number of options for the delivery of <Col N="2108" /> services under consideration.  The introduction of a mobile methadone clinic may arise in that context.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> As the Deputy will be aware the provision of services for drug misusers in Dublin, including Community Care Area 8, which includes north east Dublin, is a matter for the Eastern Health Board in the first instance.  I understand that the board formerly had a community addiction counsellor employed to work with drug misusers in the area.  The board has recently recruited one additional counsellor and two additional Outreach workers, who will service the needs of drug misusers in Community Care Area 8.  This will bring the total number employed to four.  I am confident, that these appointments will lead to an improvement in the services for drug misusers in the area.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board will be keeping the situation about drug misuse under continuous review to ensure that it is in a position to respond in an effective manner to any needs.</P>

      <P>I am informed by an tArd-Chláraitheoir that the regulations for Registrars of Marriage specifically require Registrars to obtain the authorisation of an tArd-Chláraitheoir where notice is served for the marriage of a divorced person before issuing a licence or certificate Registrars require the person serving notice to provide information regarding the parties to the previous marriage through the completion of standard inquiry forms and require them to provide copies of the relevant divorce decrees absolute.  Registrars are obliged to forward such information to an tArd-Chláraitheoir so that he may determine, having regard either to the Rule of Law or the provisions of the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act, 1986 &mdash; depending on the date the divorce was granted &mdash; whether he should authorise the Registrar to issue a licence or certificate in respect of the proposed marriage.</P>
      <P>Registrars of Roman Catholic marriages and Licensers of Marriages, in the case of other denominations, are required, similarly, to consult An tArd-Chláraitheoir to ensure that the marriages and proposed marriages are registerable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse was originally established in March, 1985 to advise the Government on general issues regarding the prevention and <Col N="2110" /> treatment of drug abuse.  The Co-ordinating Committee met on a regular basis to monitor national developments and trends in drug misuse.  It was representative of Government Departments including Health, Justice, Foreign Affairs and Education as well as the Gardaí and Customs authorities, voluntary agencies and trade unions.</P>
      <P>In 1990 the committee was reconstituted and strengthened to ensure that services were co-ordinated at the highest level.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health was appointed Chairman and the committee was asked to develop a set of recommendations which would form the basis for a National Strategy to prevent drug misuse, dealing with all aspects of the problem, with particular emphasis on demand reduction.  The committee then made its recommendations to the Government in 1991.  These were accepted by the Government and formed the basis for its Strategy to Prevent Drug Misuse which was published in May 1991.  The Strategy contains recommendations to deal with the areas of supply reduction and increased access for drug misusers to treatment and rehabilitation programmes, together with a comprehensive co-ordinated structure geared towards their implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its reconstitution in 1990 the committee has met on a regular basis. For example, it met twice during 1991, twice during 1992 and twice during 1993.  The committee did not meet during 1994 or 1995 because its role was being considered in the context of the examination of the drug problem by the Department of Justice which culminated in the recent Government decision on measures to combat drug abuse.  As part of the decision the role of the Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse is being more clearly defined.  Consultations are in progress between my Department and the <Col N="2111" /> Department of Justice in relation to the implementation of this decision.</P>

The scheduling of surgery is a matter for the clinical judgment of the consultant concerned, is based solely on the patient's condition and not on the length of time of the waiting list.  Emergency cases are given priority.  The patient's general practitioner should, accordingly, keep the consultant informed on a regular basis of the patient's condition.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74, 91 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>I am very aware of the need to highlight the dangers of drug abuse.  The Health Promotion Unit of my Department is involved in the development and dissemination of a wide range of substance abuse prevention programmes targeted at selected groups. These include:</P>
      <P>Drug Questions Local Answers &mdash; a community-based training programme which examines drug problems at local level and seeks to provide local answers.</P>
      <P>Parent Education on Alcohol, Drugs and Family Communication &mdash; a programme developed by the Health Promotion Unit with the Cork Social and Health Education Project of the Southern Health Board, which aims to enhance the skills and personal attributes of parents and their children with a view to the long term prevention of drug and alcohol misuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2113" /> Solvent Abuse &mdash; a programme developed in association with the National Youth Council of Ireland, which aims to assist young people in personal skills development thereby enabling them to be informed and decisive in relation to solvent abuse offers.  It is suitable for use by the informal education sector such as youth and community leaders and also in the formal education sector, special schools and by the juvenile liaison scheme of the Gardaí Síochana.</P>
    <P>
      <i>On My Own Two Feet</i>&mdash; a programme developed in conjunction with the psychological service of the Department of Education with assistance from the Mater Dei Counselling Centre.  It is a comprehensive drug education programme, with the overall aim of enabling students to develop their ability to make informed decisions about the use of drugs in their lives.</P>
    <P>The Health Promotion Unit also develops and distributes a wide range of materials for both the professional and the general public, including leaflets, videos, and posters.  The literature and posters are available free of charge from the unit's public office, and the videos are available on a two week loan basis.</P>
    <P>The drug awareness campaign of my Department is not just about highlighting the dangers of drug abuse, but also about giving people the opportunity to develop and practise the skills necessary to resist pressures to use various substances of abuse.  My Department's Health Promotion Unit is considering what further appropriate initiatives can be taken to heighten drugs awareness, particularly among groups most at risk.  I have asked the officers concerned to give this matter a very high priority in the programme of work for next year.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> Setting up a successful transplant programme for any specialty is an extremely complex and difficult task.  It is essential to have suitably trained staff, infrastructure and back-up resources to ensure a successful outcome. The Department's recent experience with the liver transplant programme and its establishment in Ireland bears this out.</P>
      <P>The feasibility of commencing a lung-heart lung transplant programme in Ireland is being examined by my Department.  The question of a commencement of such a programme must take account of the views of appropriate clinicians in the area and the availability of resources in the context of the many competing demands for developments in the health services.</P>

    <P>The underlying philosophy governing the operation of the home help scheme is that it is a community based &ldquo;good neighbour&rdquo; scheme which would attract people primarily motivated by the desire to engage in community services. Volunteers who work as part-time home helps are paid a stipend or gratuity for the service they provide.  This gratuity is meant only as a contribution and is not intended to compensate fully for the task undertaken.  The issue of payment for part-time home helps has been raised on a number of occasions in the recent past.  I have asked the chief executive officers of the health boards to review the differences in arrangements between the boards for providing the service.  I am in the process of establishing a working group to examine the question in greater detail with a view to developing a more rationalised approach to the delivery of this service.</P>

The North-Eastern Health Board is addressing its waiting list by issuing additional authorisations for dental treatment.  The South-Eastern Health Board has informed the Department that the average waiting time for authorisation under the scheme in its region for routine dental treatment is two months.  The Department is monitoring the position with a view to further reducing this waiting time.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 85, 86 and 87 together.  Community ophthalmic services are provided free of charge by health boards to eligible persons.  The persons eligible are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  pre-school and national school children, in respect of defects discovered at child health or school health examinations,</P>
      <P>(2)  persons in eligibility Category I (medical card holders and their dependants).</P>
      <P>All eight health boards are providing ophthalmic services through hospitals and ophthalmologists directly employed by the boards.</P>
      <P>In addition the Eastern, Midland and Western Health Boards are providing services through sight testing by opthalmologists, ophthalmic medical practitioners and ophthalmic opticians in private practice who have entered into agreement with the boards to examine eligible patients in their private practice premises.</P>
      <P>The difference between the provision of optical services to medical card holders under the Health Acts and the Department of Social Welfare's optical treatment benefit is that the optical treatment benefit scheme is an entitlement based on PRSI contributions with direct access to services and has no restrictions with regard to overall cost. The provision of optical services to medical card holders is, however, constricted by the need to contain health expenditure and the competing service demands.</P>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy with regard to funding is not readily available to my Department.</P>
      <P>Information received from the health boards recently indicated the following waiting times in respect of eyetesting and spectacles, including those who are being recalled for follow up on foot of an initial examination.</P>

    <P>All the boards operate a system which affords priority to applicants with special needs such as persons with medical conditions and national school children and every effort is made to ensure that urgent cases are processed without delay.</P>
    <P>I am concerned with the delay in the provision of sight testing and spectacles. Accordingly, I am making available an additional £500,000 this year to health boards for the provision of services to adults on their waiting lists.  My Department is currently in discussion with the boards regarding their requirements.  I also made an additional £250,000 available to the Eastern Health Board earlier this year which reduced the length of time medical card holders were waiting for eye testing and spectacles.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> Beta-interferon is a new drug which has been developed for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis.  The drug has not yet received a product authorisation and has, therefore, only been made available through the <Col N="2122" /> hospital system, under the control of a specialist, in a setting which has the necessary facilities to diagnose and monitor the patient and to ensure that there are no adverse reactions or side effects.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that beta-interferon should be available to individual patients where it is considered appropriate and is prescribed by the relevant specialists.  In this context, my Department has already been in contact with the main tertiary referral centres concerning this matter.  In addition, I understand that the practice has arisen whereby this drug is prescribed by a consultant in a tertiary referral hospital and administered elsewhere under the supervision of another hospital consultant. Where such an arrangement exists, my Department will be discussing the implications for financing this treatment with the agencies concerned.</P>

      <P>The remaining sum of £1.378 million in 1995 is available to support discretionary type grants.  The procedures involved in relation to the allocation of these grants are briefly:</P>
      <P>(a)  A standard application form must be completed.</P>
      <P>(b)  The completed application form is referred to the relevant division within my Department for assessment and recommendation having regard to the nature of the service being provided by the organisation seeking the grant.</P>
      <P>(c)  The various requests and recommendations are submitted to me for my approval.</P>
      <P>(d)  Each organisation receiving a grant is informed in writing.  A lottery grant may only be used on the project or for the purpose in respect of which it was approved and each organisation is requested to submit a certificate of expenditure to the Department on completion of the project or as soon as possible after the end of the financial year in which the grant was issued, whichever is the earlier.</P>
      <P>(e)  Where a project is not approved the organisation is informed of this in writing.</P>

      <P>The report of the investigation into the operation of Madonna House has been completed and submitted to the Department of Health and the Religious Sisters of Charity, under whose aegis the home operated.</P>
      <P>Following a preliminary examination of the report by the Department of Health, the advice of the Office of the Attorney General was sought as to whether the report could be published. The advice received was that the report could not be published in full because of the need to protect the identities of certain parties and to avoid interference with ongoing investigations and legal proceedings.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding this the Minister is anxious to honour the commitment given to the House on 12 October 1994 by the then Minister that it was his wish that as much information as possible should be made available.  Following consultations with the Office of the Attorney General, it was decided to commission a barrister to examine the report with a view to publishing as much as possible without undue risk of legal complications.  I understand that the barrister concerned is finalising his review and we expect to receive his report shortly.  It is intended to make a fuller statement on the matter at that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Eastern Health Board has informed me that in July 1995 <Col N="2132" /> a member of the public alleged that an animal in the zoo had been diagnosed as having tuberculosis.  The board's Director of Public Health contacted the Director of the Zoo and was advised that an orang-utan had recently given a positive reaction to a Tuberculin test, that their vaternity staff were satisfied that the animal had not got active tuberculosis infection and that the advice of an expert from the International Zoo Veterinary Group had also been obtained.  The Director of Dublin Zoo further advised that positive or suspicious reactions to tuberculin testing without tuberculosis infection was recognised in an orang-utan and was referred to in the relevant international literature.  A copy of the relevant article was supplied to the Director of Public Health.</P>
      <P>Before it was established that the animal in question was not infected the Zoo offered screening to all its staff who came into close contact with the orang-utan. The medical adviser to the Zoo informed the Director of Public Health that all the staff in question took up the offer and that nothing was found on such screening that would relate to contact with the animal.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the foregoing the Director of Public Health was satisfied that the orang-utan did not, at that time, constitute a risk to the public of tuberculosis infection.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that a full range of tests on the same animal, including a tuberculin test, were carried out throughout August on the advice of an international veterinary consultant all of which proved negative.</P>

    <P>The paper at 1 above details the legislative framework and the support services (mediation, counselling and legal aid) which are in place <i>vis-à-vis</i> marriage breakdown and which would apply on the introduction of divorce.  The paper also contains the text of the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1995 as well as the text of the Family Law (Divorce) Bill which will be introduced in the event of the referendum proposal being carried.</P>
    <P>A contract for the consultancy services of the Quinn, McDonnell and Pattison Group has been approved by the <Col N="2134" /> Government Contracts Committee. Their fee is £34,000.  The Government has announced that it proposes to provide a facility to groups representative of the arguments for and against divorce to make their case to voters.  The Minister for the Environment is in the process of making the necessary arrangements. A Cabinet sub-committee is considering all forms that expenditure should take on the information programme.</P>
    <P>The Government has a duty and responsibility to inform the public about its proposals and is taking into account the fact that there are opposing views. The Government parties will, of course, be inviting the people to vote in favour of its referendum proposal, as in the case of Governments in previous referenda. The Government, as Government, will be providing information in its campaign.  The advocacy in regard to voting intentions will be a matter for the political parties supporting the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the particulars of any individual film project certified by my Department.  However, I can state that, to my certain knowledge, the Deputy's inference regarding the project referred to by him is incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2138" /> With unprecedented levels of film production here at present, we sometimes do not see as many Irish personnel in the production crews as we would ideally wish. However, the certification process is being used to ensure that all productions will provide ample opportunity for the training and upskilling of Irish personnel in all departments of production.  Some 260 trainee positions have been established under the conditions of certificates issued by me to date.</P>
    <P>On 28 June, 1995 on receiving the STATCOM report on the Independent Film and Television Production Sector in Ireland &ldquo;Training Needs to 2000&rdquo;, I announced the establishment of a National Training Committee for Film and Television Production, comprising a wide range of interests and under an independent Chair.  The final composition of this committee, which will report to the board of FÁS, will be announced soon.  I also announced the allocation of substantial resources to provide the committee with a practical means to implement the report's recommendations in the most cost-effective manner consistent with the overriding objective of providing quality vocational training.</P>
    <P>Under Ireland's Operational Programme for Industrial Development 1994-1999, I have been allocated £2.58 million less for film industry human resource development.  I propose to assign these funds to the National Training Committee for the period up to 1999, and they will be topped up by FÁS mainstream funding of a further £250,000 annually, subject to demand.</P>
    <P>Many film and television productions being undertaken here are co-productions with producers from other countries.  This element of the industry serves to bring additional finance, expertise and marketing opportunities, as well as affording opportunities for Irish personnel for skills training and experience in working with personnel from abroad.  I would mention in particular the assistance offered by Eurimages, which is the Council of Europe <Col N="2139" /> production fund of European film co-productions and which requires three European co-producers for each project. To date, some 10 co-productions with an Irish involvement have been supported by Eurimages.  Accordingly it would not be appropriate to limit co-production to just one other country in view of the wide range of co-production opportunities now available to Irish producers.</P>
    <P>A gratifying feature of the high level of production at present is the increasingly strong representation of indigenous productions.  At least five films with first-time Irish directors will go into production in 1995.  These films generally offer openings to a wide range of Irish crews who might not have sufficient experience to gain positions in the larger &ldquo;blockbuster&rdquo; -type projects, thereby contributing to the pool of indigenous skills competences available to those wishing to produce films in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I understand that at present there are approximately 750 fallow deer in the Phoenix Park of which an estimated 155 are fawns.  During the fawning season, which lasts from early June to July, priority is given to keeping the deer herd under surveillance.  The park rangers are on duty from 6.30 a.m. to 11.30 p.m. each day while the gardaí in the course of their duties patrol the park at night.  To date there is no firm evidence that fawns have ever been stolen from the Phoenix Park.</P>
      <P>The park staff are acutely aware of the potential danger posed by dogs to the deer, especially during the fawning season.  Although some losses due to dogs cannot be ruled out especially during the night, these losses would be extremely small in the context of the overall deer numbers.  All possible steps are taken by park staff to prevent maurading dogs posing a threat to the deer.</P>
      <P>The management and conservation of the deer herd is one of the principal objectives of the staff in the Phoenix Park and I am satisfied that they carry out their duties to the highest professional standards.  The Deputy will be aware that the Phoenix Park is the largest enclosed park in any capital city of Europe, being some 700 hectares in area.  Because of its size and the presence of substantial wooded areas the possibility of theft can never be ruled out fully.</P>

      <P>The Royal Canal bank at Portland Place consists of a 3.5 metre wide surfaced towpath which is not in need of upgrading.  I understand that the properties adjoining the canal bank are privately owned and accordingly the Waterways Service has no power to remove the dumped trailer and cabs on the derelict site opposite the junction of Portland Street North and Portland Place.</P>

      <P>Certain lands have been identified, on the basis of scientific criteria, as proposed natural heritage areas and I will be introducing legislation in due course to enable them to be statutorily designated.  A draft scheme of a Bill to amend the Wildlife Act, 1976 is at an advanced stage of preparation.  I hope to submit proposals to Government shortly and to publish the Bill early in 1996.</P>

      <P>Bíonn soláthar mar seo a leanas i Vóta mo Roinne as fáltais an chrannchuir náisiúnta ar mhaithe le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge:</P>

    <P>

    <P>Maidir le Bord na Gaeilge agus na heagrais dheonacha Gaeilge, bunaítear deontas mo Roinne ar riachtanais na n-eagras sin agus ar bhonn pleananna oibre uathu.</P>
    <P>I gcás na dtograí ilgnéitheacha Gaeilge cuirtear fógra sna nuachtáin náisiúnta ag lorg iarratas faoi spriocdáta áirithe.  Breithnítear na hiarratais uile a fhaightear i gcomhlint lena chéile, ag féachaint don soláthar teoranta airgid a bhíonn ar fáil le caitheamh ar na tograí sin agus ceadaítear cúnamh i leith na dtograí a mheastar go bhfuil an tábhacht is mó leo maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>An allocation from national lottery funding of £1.55 million is provided in the current year under Subhead D of my Department's Vote for the National Heritage Council and the new Heritage Council which succeeded it on 10.7.95. The allocation is used to provide grant-aid for certain Heritage projects and for The Discovery Programme.</P>
    <P>The allocation for heritage grant-aided projects is £1.05 million, which includes administration expenses, while The Discovery Programme, which is an archaeological research programme, is in receipt of £0.5 million.  Applications for heritage grants must be made on a prescribed form and all such applications are assessed and decided upon by the council on their merits from the heritage perspective.</P>
    <P>National lottery funding provided under Subhead C1 of my Department's Vote (£3.81 million in 1995) is allocated directly to the major cultural institutions coming within the remit of my Department and is not used to finance schemes of grants.  The same is true of the national lottery funding provided under <Col N="2144" /> Vote 43 &mdash; National Gallery (£0.245 million in 1995) and Vote 44 &mdash; An Chomhairle Ealaíon (£3.707 million in 1995).</P>

      <P>I understand that the Irish Women's Archive and Resource Centre Limited is an independent private entity formed as a company limited by guarantee in 1994. In making its submissions for grant assistance to my Department it submitted an intention of investigating the feasibility of creating an enabling body to collect and store records of sources revealing the experiences of women within society, to provide access to these records for educational and research purposes, and to provide an educational, information and publicity service on women's resources, associations and individuals.</P>
      <P>I provided a special grant of £50,000 in 1994 to facilitate an examination of the feasibility of the project.  Subsequently in this year's budget a further grant of £100,000 for the organisation was announced by the Minister for Finance. The statutory collecting function of the National Archives is not affected in any way by the establishment of this organisation.  The structure of the management of the company is a matter for the company itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Department has made no commitment to funding the organisation <Col N="2145" /> on a continuing basis I will examine any funding requests within the overall framework of the funds available to me, taking into account the proposed work programme and the broader context of policy in this area, including the roles of State collecting institutions, and other institutions collecting cultural items. While it would not be appropriate for me to comment on how professionals in the historical and archives sector might regard the organisations, any views expressed to me on the matter will be taken into account in this examination.</P>

    <P>The annual allowance comprises three elements to meet general representational expenses, subsistence costs, and travel expenses based on the member's home location relative to council headquarters.  The allowance is <Col N="2155" /> not intended to constitute a salary or remuneration, but only to meet expenses incurred under these headings. The travel, element would, of course, tend to be lower in the case of urban-based local authorities (such as Dublin Corporation), where the distances which have to be travelled are less.</P>
    <P>The recent adjustments, <i>inter alia,</i> have automatically linked travel and subsistence rate alterations to those for senior officers.

      <P>The rate support grant replaces in part the income from rates formerly applicable to domestic dwellings, agricultural land and rates on Government property.  The initial method of calculating the grant reflected that income &mdash; which varied from local authority to local authority because of differences in valuation levels and in the rate poundages determined by local authorities over the years.  Adjustments in rate support grant allocations to individual authorities over the last decade arose from the elimination of certain levies and statutory demands, the writing off of loans from the local loans fund, and, in the past two years, measures to reduce debt levels and to deal with other structural problems.</P>

      <P>Recent reports from the World Meterological Organisation, which indicate a continuing depletion of ozone layer over Antartica, further underline the need for intensified international action on the control of ozone depleting substances.  The EU and its member states, including Ireland, have been taking a lead in seeking international agreement for stricter controls on these substances.</P>
      <P>The seventh meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, which is due to be held in Vienna from 5-7 December 1995, will review progress with the implementation of the Protocol and consider, <i>inter alia,</i> stricter measures in regard to methyl bromide and HCFCs. I intend to lead the Irish delegation at this meeting and, in consultation with my EU colleagues, I will support the intensification of action to deal with depletion of the ozone layer.</P>
      <P>The Montreal Protocol, to which both Ireland and the EU are parties, provides for the phase-out of the production and use of ozone depleting substances.  In addition the European Union adopted a regulation in December 1994 providing for stricter control and faster phase-out of the production and use of these substances within the EU.  The table below gives details of the phase-out dates involved:</P>

      <P>I am aware that the school in question has applied for inclusion in the Early Start Pre-school Programme.  The Early Start Pre-school Programme is currently focused on schools that have been included in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  The programme has recently been extended by the inclusion of a further 32 schools. This brings the total number of schools covered by this service to 40.</P>
      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is included in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  However, I regret that it was not possible to include it in the Early Start Programme for the current school year.  The programme will continue to focus on schools in the disadvantaged areas scheme and the needs of all schools in that scheme, including the school referred to by the Deputy, will be considered in the context of any further expansion of this programme.</P>

      <P>The position is that Coláiste Íde, an all-Irish secondary boarding school for girls, is owned and managed by the Mercy Order of nuns.  In 1990, the order took a decision to withdraw from ownership and management of the school at the end of the 1995-96 school year.  They cited a shortage of religious personnel as the main reason for this decision.</P>
      <P>At that stage, the Mercy Sisters had hoped that the school could continue in operation after 1996, under a different management.  The order subsequently informed the Department that, despite protracted discussions with local groups regarding a future alternative management structure, no satisfactory proposal had been received by them.  Accordingly, the Mercy Order announced that it had decided to close the school at the end of the 1995-96 school year.</P>
      <P>As the school is a private secondary boarding school run by a religious order of nuns, any decision in relation to the future of the school, including a decision to close, is essentially a matter for the management authorities of the school.  I am satisfied that the two remaining all-Irish secondary schools in Dingle can adequately cater for the school-going children in the area.</P>

      <P>The Youth Encounter Project to which the Deputy refers was a special education facility established to cater for up to 25 children from the north inner city area who had become alienated from the mainstream school <Col N="2184" /> system.  The project was closed with effect from the end of the 1994/95 school year.  At the time of closure, a total of 13 children were enrolled in the Project.  The total funding allocation to the project in 1994 was £89,000.</P>
      <P>The educational needs of the children in question are now being addressed by a range of alternative provisions.</P>
      <P>The majority of the children who had attended the Youth Encounter Project have been enrolled in a new special school facility which has been established in co-operation with the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul at Henrietta Street, Dublin 1.</P>
      <P>The project will initially cater for up to 12 children but it is expected that this number will increase as the project develops.</P>
      <P>The new special school has been allocated two teaching staff.  This represents a pupil teacher ratio of 8 to 1 which is similar to that which applied in the case of the Youth Encounter Project.</P>
      <P>Like the Youth Encounter Project, the school will also have the full-time services of a social worker and a housekeeper. Also, like the Youth Encounter Project, the school will have access to secretarial and maintenance services. These latter services were already in place in the Henrietta Street complex.</P>
      <P>Important additional services which had not previously been available, include an allocation of additional teaching hours to facilitate extra curricular activity and the provision of a part-time psychological service to the school.</P>
      <P>As with the Youth Encounter Project, the salary costs of the teachers involved in the new school will be met directly by the Department of Education.  The other support services referred to will be funded through an initial allocation of £50,000 to cover operational costs for the current school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of a small number of children who previously attended the Youth Encounter Project, enrolments have been arranged in selected national schools in the area.  The schools in quesiton are part of the recently introduced <Col N="2185" /> pilot projects aimed at addressing the problems of disruptive and disenchanted children.  Under this project, eight special teaching counsellor posts were allocated to selected schools in the north inner city area.  The role of the teaching counsellors is to co-ordinate the schools' approaches in devising and implementing special support programmes to help prevent the occurrence of disruptive behaviour and to teach and counsel small groups and individuals who exhibit persistent behavioural difficulties in the classroom.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the measures which I have outlined will ensure the delivery of a comprehensive and effective education service for the children in question.</P>

Certain of the <Col N="2187" /> regional health boards provide support for primary, as well as second level, schools in the area of health promotion, including education about drug abuse.</P>
      <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is reviewing the provision of health education in primary schools, including the provision of education on substance abuse.  Related to this review by the NCCA, my Department will consult with the Departments of Health and Justice about the further development of a substance abuse education programme in primary schools.</P>
      <P>A major programme of substance abuse education for second level schools has been developed jointly by the Departments of Education and Health and the Mater Dei Counselling Centre. I launched this programme in October 1994 and since then it is being disseminated to second level schools generally with associated in-career development for teachers.  At present the programme has been introduced to about 50 per cent of all second-level schools and the dissemination and in-career development will continue during the current school year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards a retrospective grant towards fire damage repairs in 1988, the <Col N="2188" /> position is that because of the limited resources available and the ever increasing demands for accommodation and other capital resources, it is not possible to accede to requests for retrospective funding.</P>

      <P>As part of a package aimed at achieving savings necessary to meet Government requirements in 1996 for the curtailment of public expenditure, the question of limiting the number of places available on VTOS in 1996 arises. An indication has been given to vocational education committees of what their allocations are likely to be for 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2196" /> It is a matter for the vocational education committees to utilise the number of places available to them having regard to demand and local priorities and circumstances.  In this context the City of Dublin vocational education committee indicates it is not in a position to start the new course mentioned in the first two questions above.  It also indicates that it is allocating 95 places this autumn to the centre concerned which had 106 participants in the 1994-95 academic year.</P>
    <P>The estimated saving to the Exchequer on 1,000 VTOS places in 1996 is £2.5 million.  It will be appreciated that the number of places available to VTOS has increased substantially in the last three years.</P>

      <P>The Higher Education Authority has the statutory responsibility to advise me on the need and demand for higher education.  The authority has recommended that 800 Higher Diploma in Education places be provided in 1995-96 and I have accepted this recommendation.</P>
      <P>There are five colleges in the university sector with education departments. Each of these colleges is involved in the provision of Higher Diploma in Education courses.  Data are not readily available in my Department about the number of applications and the breakdown of places by discipline.  I will however arrange for the information to be collated and conveyed to the Deputy.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2197" /> The college authorities reserve the right to select the students they admit to any course.  With regard to the selection of students for admission to the higher diploma in education course I understand that criteria such as academic attainments, the appropriateness of a student's degree subjects, relevant teaching experience and the quality of the student's application are taken into account in determining whether a student's application will be successful.</P>

      <P>National lottery funding is provided to my Department to finance a number of schemes of grants.</P>
      <P>The youth affairs section of my Department receives national lottery funding for the provision of a number of grant schemes.  The main areas of funding include annual grants for national voluntary youth organisations under the youth service grant scheme and a grant scheme of special projects for disadvantaged young people throughout the country.  Total funding in respect of these schemes amounts to approximately £12.5 million in 1995.</P>
      <P>The sport section provides annual grants to a number of organisations including national governing bodies of sport and vocational education committees to assist in the promotion and development of sport.  The section also administers capital schemes to aid in the provision of sport and community recreational facilities, for which application forms are available in sport section.  The total provided for sport in the 1995 Estimates is £13.45 million.</P>

    <P>The Department has a scheme of grants towards tuition costs in colleges that organise Irish language courses, <Col N="2198" /> mainly during the summer months. Applications for recognition and the schedule of proposed courses are evaluated by the Department's inspectorate.</P>
    <P>Grants are paid up to certain maxima based on the type and the length of the course, the number of students and the individual attendance records of those students.  The total amount provided for this purpose in the 1995 Estimates is £550,000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 223, 238 and 240 together.</P>
      <P>The 30 posts to which the Deputies refer were part of a total of 100 extra childcare assistant posts which were originally intended for deployment in the special education area with effect from September 1995.  The 100 posts in question were allocated in June of this year and schools were selected for receipt of these posts on the basis of priority of need as determined by my Department's inspectorate.</P>
      <P>However, as a result of the recent Government decision to curb the growth in public expenditure, it became necessary for my Department to reduce the proposed level of growth in childcare assistant posts in the current year. This resulted in the withdrawal of 30 of the 100 posts originally allocated.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to point out that while the Government's decision has resulted in a reduction in the level of growth in childcare assistant posts originally intended, it remains the case that an additional 70 such posts have been deployed in the current year.  This is on top of an extra 50 such posts allocated in 1994.  Indeed, the number of childcare assistant posts in place has grown very significantly in recent years from 82 in 1993 to 202 in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2200" /> I assure the House of my ongoing commitment to further development in this area and the needs of the 30 schools from which posts were withdrawn will be given particular consideration when I am next in a position to allocate childcare assistant posts.</P>

School transport is still available to the family in question, who reside 1.2 miles from the current pick-up point.</P>
      <P>As this is considered to be an adequate level of service in the context of the general operation of the scheme, and as additional State cost would be involved, it would not be open to my Department to restore the former level of service to the Inishnee area.</P>

      <P>My Department has already notified vocational education committees of their grant allocations for 1995 under the youth and sport scheme. Grants approved for vocational education committees in 1995 under the above scheme were generally in line with amounts approved in the previous year.  The position will be reviewed again towards the end of the year having regard to funds at my disposal.</P>

      <P>The educational needs of primary school pupils with a specific learning disability are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the assistance, where appropriate, of a remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>Fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties.  In addition, the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability.  Where more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in one of four special schools dedicated to this area.  Three of these schools are located in Dublin and one in Cork.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years I have implemented a range of measures to further improve educational provision for children with special needs.</P>
      <P>I recently appointed 55 remedial teachers with effect from September 1995.  This is in addition to 186 such teachers allocated to ordinary primary schools in the previous two years.  This recent allocation brings the total number of remedial teachers in place at primary level to 1,188.</P>
      <P>Second level pupils with specific learning disability are normally integrated into ordinary classes.  In such situations they may receive additional tutorial support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teachers.  Such children may also be eligible for special arrangements in the certificate examinations.  Responsibility for the educational assessment of primary school pupils is a matter for the relevant health authorities through the director of community care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is currently in the process of developing a school psychological service at primary level on a phased basis.  To this end, ten additional psychologists have been recruited. However, it will be some time before this new service will be in a position to take on responsibility for educational <Col N="2206" /> assessments from the health authorities.</P>

      <P>There is no reduction in the 1995 Education budget as provided in the Estimates for 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government reviewed its financial targets in June 1995 and decided <Col N="2211" /> that in order to meet its overall budgetary targets it was necessary to control public sector expenditure.  In this context it was agreed that the expansion in teaching posts for the 1995-96 school year should be carefully monitored and controlled.  This means that the rate of expansion of certain services has to be adjusted.</P>
    <P>Additional education posts have been provisionally allocated on a sectoral basis as follows: First-Level Education 300; Second-Level Education 576; Third-Level Education 255.</P>
    <P>The 1996 budgetary requirements for my Department are currently being discussed with the Department of Finance within the parameters of the Government's overall budgetary strategy.  I will not be in a position to make a definitive statement on the matter until the Government approves the 1996 Estimates.</P>

      <P>The 1995 capital budget for the university sector is £15.7 million.  The 1996 capital budget for the sector will be determined in the context of the annual Estimates process.</P>
      <P>I should point out to the Deputy that the Government has as part of the National Development Plan already approved a capital investment programme of around £8 million per annum in respect of the university sector for the period up to 1999 of which 75 per cent will be financed by a non-repayable grant from the European Regional Development Fund.  The European Regional Development Fund expenditure will be on projects urgently needed to bring teaching facilities in targeted facilities to a higher standard.</P>
      <P>The Government has also recently approved the provision of £30 million funding by the State over the period 1996 to 2000 towards capital developments provided it was matched by a similar level of funding by the universities from private sources.  The investment programme of £60 million will enable the universities to accommodate an additional stock of 6,200 students by the year 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 255 and 306 together.  I presume that the Deputy is referring to the granting of temporary release to offenders under section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.</P>
      <P>The majority of offenders qualify for some element of early release by way of temporary release at some point during their sentences.  The temporary release system is also used to grant short periods of release to offenders for such reasons as family funerals, examinations, attendance at training courses etc.  This granting of temporary release or parole, as it is called in some countries, is a feature of prison systems worldwide and has been operated by successive Ministers for Justice since 1960</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding a review of the temporary <Col N="2220" /> release system, I would refer the Deputy to the document The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan which was published last year.  Chapter 5 of the plan contains a review of the current temporary release arrangements together with a number of specific proposals for the future.</P>
    <P>Statistics are not readily available regarding the number of offenders who reoffended while on temporary releases during the past three years.  Such statistics could be compiled only through an examination of the individual records of several thousand offenders and this would involve the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that an application for a copy map in respect of Folio 42601 County Mayo was lodged in the Land Registry on 22 July 1991 and again on 7 December 1994.</P>
      <P>The reason for the delay in dealing with these applications for copy maps is that a small portion of the lands on folio 42601 County Mayo is not identifiable on the Land Registry map.  In order to resolve this difficulty the Land Commission Estate Map was requested in 1991 but, as the Deputy has mentioned, to date it has been unavailable.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, the Land Registry recently contacted the applicant's solicitors and they agreed to accept a copy map of the Folio excluding the plot under query together with a blank map of the relevant townland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Registry understands that <Col N="2221" /> this blank map, if marked by the registered owner, will suffice for the purposes for which the map is required on this occasion.

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that they have investigated two incidents each involving an outbreak of fire at the location mentioned in the question.  However, no evidence has been found to suggest that the fires were as a result of arson.</P>
      <P>I have also been informed that the level of crime in the area is considered quite low.  In 1994 nine crimes were reported to the Garda.  In 1995, to date, this figure has decreased to two.</P>
      <P>I have been assured by the Garda authorities that the area receives and will continue to receive regular and ongoing attention from local community Garda covering the flat complex.  This foot patrol is augmented by the services of two mobile uniform patrols and one plain clothes mobile unit.  It is also serviced by regular patrols by members of the Garda dog unit.</P>

      <P>The backlog of cases for hearing in the courts is a matter of great concern to <Col N="2222" /> me.  The Programme for Government &mdash; A Government of Renewal &mdash; gave a commitment to review the provisions of the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1994, to ensure that measures will adequately address the need to tackle the backlog of cases to be heard in all courts.  This review was completed last June and I obtained Government approval to prepare a Bill which would include provisions to increase the number of judges of the Supreme, High, Circuit and District Courts by 3, 2, 7 and 5 respectively. This Bill is currently being drafted in my Department and I expect to introduce it early in the coming session.</P>

      <P>It is not the practice for the Minister for Justice to make statements to the House about the progress of individual Garda investigations except in singular instances where the circumstances of an investigation are so exceptional that such a course is deemed to be appropriate.</P>
      <P>All I propose to say in this case is that I have been informed by the Garda authorities that both these incidents are the subject of a Garda investigation and that every effort is being made to satisfactorily conclude these investigations.</P>
      <P>The Garda community relations section have issued two public information leaflets aimed at improving public awareness of crimes of this nature.</P>

    <P>In addition the Garda authorities utilise every available opportunity to provide advice to the public, on this and many other types of crime, in both the national and local media.  Features on measures that women can take to enhance their personal safety are frequently carried on the &ldquo;Crimeline&rdquo; programme.</P>

      <P>Carrickmacross Urban District Council wrote to me recently expressing concern at increases in rents which had arisen in particular cases.  The rights of landlords and tenants fall to be determined in the first instance by reference to the provisions of the tenancy agreements which have been entered into.  Certain statutory protections for tenants are contained in the Landlord and Tenant Acts and a person's own legal advisor would be the appropriate person to advise in relation to the facts of a particular case.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I have no powers or function in relation to the operation of the Landlord and Tenant Code in particular cases. However, if the Deputy has any specific proposals for change in landlord and tenant legislation I will, of course, arrange to have examined any submission which he might wish to make in this regard.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the tragic death of the young man is to be the subject of a coroner's inquest shortly.  The coroner is independent in the exercise of his functions and, as such, it would not be appropriate for me to make any further comment.  The Garda investigation file into a number of incidents including the alleged sale of drugs at a dance event in the Point Depot on 24 June 1995 has been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions. However, no directions from the director's office have been received to date.</P>
      <P>With regard to dance venues in general, the Garda will be availing of opportunities during September when dance licences come up for renewal to object in court to licences where there is evidence of drug abuse, sale etc. on the premises.  I am also examining dance hall legislation, which is very out dated, with a view to amending such legislation.</P>

      <P>The latest year for which committal statistics are available is 1993.  In that year, there were 10,448 committals, remand and sentenced, of which 2,227 were to St. Patrick's Institution.  It should be noted that quite a number of the 2,227 prisoners would have been transferred to a different place of detention as St. Patrick's serves as one of the committal prisons in Dublin, the other being Mountjoy.  Precise figures for 1994 and 1995 will be published, in due course, in the annual reports on prisons and places of detention.</P>

      <P>Arrangements are now being made to implement the provisions of the European Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons which comes into effect on 1 November 1995 in the case of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Procedures are being put in place to facilitate consideration of applications from Irish prisoners serving sentences in foreign prisons who wish to return to <Col N="2243" /> Ireland to serve their sentences here. Applications may be directed in the first instance to my Department, either directly or through our embassies, or to the sentencing country.  However, even with this facility in the sentencing State, the consent to the transfer from the sentencing country is a requirement.</P>
    <P>The following table sets out the approximate number of Irish persons serving sentences abroad who have made known their interest in a transfer to this country:</P>

      <P>Provisional figures for crime for the first six months of 1995 compared with the first six months of 1994 show a welcome drop in certain areas of the country but they also show an increase in the Dublin <Col N="2249" /> Metropolitan Area.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that this increase is largely attributable to an increase in larceny from motor vehicles.  More importantly, however, I am informed that many of the more serious categories of crime, such as burglary and robbery with firearms, show a significant decrease over the period.  While the overall picture, therefore, is not as presented by the Deputy, there is clearly no room for complacency.</P>
      <P>The Government is providing the Garda with the necessary resources, in terms of personnel and equipment, to deal with the various issues confronting them, including serious crime.</P>
      <P>A total of £413 million is being provided for the Garda Siochána this year &mdash; the highest amount ever.  The allocation of an amount of this magnitude will be of assistance to the Garda in the fight against crime by enabling the following measures to be taken:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash; The recruitment of 1,050 gardaí over the next 3 years.</P>
      <P>&mdash; Replacement of the Garda Fleet on a 5 year basis.</P>
      <P>&mdash; Implementation of an information Technology plan for the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>&mdash; Upgrading the Garda Communications Network.</P>
      <P>&mdash; Installation of Closed Circuit Television Cameras to combat crime in certain area.</P>
      <P>&mdash; Further development of community based measures in area of disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I am confident that these measures together with legislative changes and other strategies such as the broadly based plans I have announced to combat the importation of drugs provide for a comprehensive considered response to the problem of crime in our society.</P>

      <P>I dealt with this matter in some detail when I answered an oral question in this House on 8 June last.  As I stated then the Garda authorities are aware of the extent of the problem facing retail shopkeepers and their staff, and have assured me that they are taking appropriate action to tackle the problem including targeting certain areas where the highest incidence of this type of crime occurs.</P>
      <P>Measures aimed at preventing crime are also vitally important in tackling the problem.  An initiative in this area is the business watch scheme which was launched in February 1994.  The scheme is a crime prevention programme on the lines of the neighbourhood watch scheme and enlists the help of the local business community in co-operation with the Garda.  Preliminary indications are that these measures are proving very effective in dealing with this type of crime.  Provisional figures for 1995, to date, indicate that this type of crime has decreased significantly compared with the same period in 1994.</P>

    <P>Out of these 11 cases, 8 persons were from the group of 29 persons referred to in answer to Parliamentary Question No. 34 of 25 October 1994 who on advice of the then Attorney General had been advised during 1994 that their applications had been approved subject to certain conditions.  These applications had been processed prior to the establishment of an Advisory Group <Col N="2252" /> operating within a Terms of Reference for the purpose of making recommendations to the Minister for Justice on investment-based naturalisation applications. The Attorney General (current) subsequently advised that the Minister for Justice was legally bound to approve these applications provided all the conditions attaching to them were met.</P>
    <P>In the case of the remaining 3 persons who were issued with certificates of naturalisation so far this year, the Advisory Group referred to above recommended that each of the applications be approved on foot of their investments in the State.

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, last July I received the approval of Government for a comprehensive series of legislative, financial, operational and organisational measures designated to combat the smuggling of drugs into this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already dealt with this issue extensively in the Dáil on 26 July last. (Dáil Debates Volume 455 No. 7 columns 1811-1843).  The measures to be taken were also dealt with fully in press statements issued by me on 19 July and 14 September 1995.  In the latter statement, I also announced the assignment of a Deputy Commissioner of the Garda Síochána who will have direct responsibility for all Garda anti-drugs measures, and the creation of a post of Chief <Col N="2254" /> Superintendent to head up the new Garda Drugs Unit.</P>
    <P>I am as anxious as the Deputy that these measures be implemented without undue delay and I have made arrangements to ensure that this happens.  Many elements of the package are being put in place now and the necessary legislation is in preparation and will be brought to Government as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>There is a total of 11 vehicles available to the Detective Units, including the Drugs Units, within the DMA South Central Division.  This transport is pooled at local level and is available to the district drug units as required. Because of the nature of the duties performed by these units, including covert surveillance, official transport is not always appropriate.  The Divisional Task Force is also active in the detection of drug related crime and assists the district drug units in major drug operations. The Divisional Task Force comprises 12 members and has four vehicles available to it at all times.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that they keep the strength and deployment of the District Drugs Units under continuous review.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also be aware that the Government recently approved the establishment of a new Garda National Drugs Unit.  The establishment of this Unit follows on a series of legislative, financial, operational and organisational measures already announced which are designed to combat drug trafficking in a multifaceted way.</P>

      <P>The Department has no information on court orders generally in respect of lone parents.  Its information is limited to those in receipt of social welfare payments of which the principal payment is the lone parent allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2256" /> Lone parent's allowance is a means-tested payment and account is taken of any income a lone parent might have, including payments received under court maintenance orders.  While the Department's computer records contain information on means levels for payment purposes, a breakdown on the source of the means is not available from these records.  The information which the Deputy is seeking is only available in the individual claim files relating to applicants.  It would not be practicable, in view of the numbers involved (over 44,000) to extract this information.</P>
    <P>However, in operating the &ldquo;liability to maintain family&rdquo; provisions of the Social Welfare Acts, the Department has examined the detailed situation of some 4,000 cases involving deserted wife's benefit and lone parent's allowance where the partner was in employment. From this examination, the indications are that Family Law Court maintenance orders exist in 62 per cent of these cases.</P>
    <P>It appears that over half of these orders were in default to varying extent by the maintenance debtors concerned. The average value of each court maintenance order transferred to my Department was £51 per week in 1995 to date. These figures need to be interpreted with extreme caution and should not be used to extrapulate general conclusions as they relate to specific cases &mdash; i.e. working liable relatives &mdash; where court orders are most likely to arise and would not be fully representative either of all court orders made under family law, or of all separated couples.</P>

      <P>The scheme is aimed specifically at third level students and students on post leaving certificate courses and therefore the question of sanctioning participation by the person concerned does not arise.</P>

      <P>My Department administers various means-tested social assistance schemes provided for in Part II of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 as follows: unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance, old age (non-contributory) pension, blind pension, widows and orphans (non-contributory) pensions, deserted wife's allowance, prisoner's wife's allowance, lone parent's allowance, carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>In addition, it administers the family income supplement provided for in Part V of that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fuel allowance payable, subject to a mean test, during the winter months is also administered by my Department. Means investigation is carried out by local social welfare inspectors.  In recent years, means assessments are also being made on a summary basis without referral to an inspector at the initial stage in order to speed up claim processing. In the case of local offices, these <Col N="2259" /> summary assessments are applied to certain unemployment assistance claims and in the case of Headquarter Offices they are applied to certain claims for lone parent's allowance, carer's allowance and fuel allowance.  Claims for family income supplement are, as a rule, decided on the basis of documentation submitted with a small proportion requiring referral to a local inspector.</P>
    <P>The Department employs 373 social welfare inspectors around the country. This cadre of inspectors has a range of duties relating to means-testing, PRSI compliance inspection and, in some cases, specialist control work.  In addition, some 100 staff at local offices and Headquarters are involved to varying degrees in summary assessment work on certain means-testing assistance claims and family income supplement. The work is so organised that staff, including inspectors, are not engaged solely in means-testing.  In many cases, the means-testing element of their duties is the minor one.</P>
    <P>Inspectors do not deal solely with any particular type of claim.  In the case of summary assessments, the staff involved deal with particular claims as follows:</P>

      <P>Provisions excepting prescribed relatives from insurability have applied since the Social Welfare Act 1952 came into operation in January 1953.  Under the provisions of the Acts and Regulations, employment in the service of the spouse is expected from insurance.  Also excepted is employment of defined categories of relatives in the common home or a corresponding home.  However, a prescribed relative who is employed under a written contract of service or apprenticeship is insurable.</P>
      <P>These provisions continued the conditions that had applied under the former National Health Insurance Acts where such employment without money payment was excepted from insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prescribed categories who are excepted comprise close relatives of the <Col N="2261" /> employed person who are normally family helpers who reside with the employed person and are not subject to a contract of employment.</P>
    <P>Self-employed persons were brought into social insurance under the Social Welfare Acts from 1988 and analogous provisions were made excepting prescribed categories of relatives from self-employed insurance.</P>
    <P>These issues were considered by the National Pensions Board and in their final report they made some suggestions regarding the possibilities of making voluntary contributorship available to such persons.  These proposals and other possible approaches are being considered at present by my Department.</P>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of the interest element of a mortgage repayment.  Entitlement to the supplement is determined by the health board in the light of the circumstances of the case and the payment is normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of the mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their circumstances, less £6.00.</P>

The group is expected to report before the end of the year.  In addition, the report of the Review Group on the role of supplementary welfare allowance in relation to housing, is nearing completion.

    <P>Since June 1993 a total of 290 exemptions have been granted to invalidity pensioners.  182 of these were granted to males and 108 were granted to females. Statistics prior to 1993 are not available and no differentiation is made between the different categories of exemptions.</P>
    <P>Information on income or income capabilities is not held by my Department.</P>
    <P>The usual procedures for applying for an exemption to earn income while on invalidity pension is as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;A written request made by the person concerned.</P>
    <P>&mdash;A letter is submitted by the person's doctor indicating that the proposed work is for rehabilitative/occupational therapy purposes or confirming the person's suitability for attendance at a training course with a view to taking up some other occupation.</P>
    <P>&mdash;A letter is submitted by the employer giving details of the work or course (e.g. hours per week, remuneration and duration of employment/course).</P>
    <P>&mdash;When the documentation is received the case is referred to the Department's Medical Advisor for his opinion.  Following this an Officer of the Minister makes a <Col N="2264" /> decision to grant or not to grant an exemption.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Special application forms with slightly more streamlined procedures have been agreed in dealing with applications for exemptions from the National Rehabilitation Board.</P>

      <P>The statistical data available on lone parent allowances are drawn from the computerised records maintained for payment purposes.  These records show the number of allowances in payment and the family sizes at particular times.  I understand that the Deputy is primarily interested in the unmarried category of lone parent for whom the available statistics are appended to the reply.  Similar statistics are also available for other categories of lone parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is reasonable to assume that the unmarried category of lone parent to whom the appended statistics apply qualifies initially for payment as a one child family.  The exception to this would be where claims arise following <Col N="2265" /> breakdown of non-marital arrangements. Records are not maintained in such a way as to identify the extent to which this factor or other relationships contribute to family size or to enable other statistical data sought by the Deputy to be supplied.</P>
    <P>As regards payments for additional children, the Social Welfare legislation provides for the payment of a child dependant allowance in respect of each qualified dependent child.  The identity of the father is not a requirement for this purpose.  In processing applications for child dependant allowances in the cases referred to by the Deputy the Department has regard to the additional needs on the birth of an additional child and in the normal course arranges for payment of the additional allowance as quickly as possible.  However, enquiries are initiated immediately thereafter to establish if the circumstances surrounding the birth constitute a statutory disqualification for Lone Parent's Allowance. If it is established that the lone parent and another person are cohabiting as man and wife or that adequate maintenance is being paid, the Lone Parent Allowance is stopped or adjusted as the circumstances dictate.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Liability to Maintain Family&rdquo; provisions in Part IX of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993 stipulates that where a lone parent family is dependent on a Social Welfare payment, the person who is liable to maintain that family must contribute to the <Col N="2266" /> Department towards the cost of the family's income support.</P>
    <P>Liable relatives pay either by way of regular direct contribution to the Department or through family law court orders which are transferred to the Department.  Since the scheme commenced a total of almost £600,000 has been collected.  In addition to these contribution payments, the operation of the maintenance recovery provisions also yielded savings on scheme expenditure of a further £440,000 since commencement. Altogether, a total of over £1 million has been yielded directly and indirectly since the commencement of the Liability to Maintain Family provisions at the end of 1990.</P>
    <P>To date the application of these provisions has been concentrated on married/separated cases.  Consideration is being given now as to the most practicable way to implement the system in non-marital situations.  A number of issues are involved in this, including concerns expressed by voluntary organisations dealing with unmarried parents about the impact of the system on existing informal child maintenance arrangements where they exist.  The Department is reviewing the operation of the Liability to Maintain Family provisions generally, including their applicability to unmarried parents, in the context of the proposed introduction of a unified lone parent support scheme.</P>

      <P>The Government has given its approval for the drafting of the Social Welfare (No. 3) Bill, 1995.  On completion of the necessary preparatory work, the further approval of the Government will be sought to publish the Bill.  The Bill will provide for the abolition of the concept of &ldquo;desertion&rdquo; in cases of family breakdown and will provide support for men as well as women caring for children as lone parents. I have undertaken to consult widely with interested bodies and intend to do this before seeking approval from Government for fund proposals.  The bill will also deal with a number of miscellaneous matters which need to be addressed before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>The number of claimants who have benefited to date from the equal treatment arrears provisions announced last March is 68,000 and the total expenditure to date is £142.5 million.</P>
      <P>This means that in line with the commitment given last March that all claimants, with the exception of a small number where more detailed examination to determine entitlement was required, have been issued with a payment on account.  The remaining claimants will be paid within the next two weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The payments on account represent a substantial part of the total arrears due to each claimant.  Further payments on <Col N="2268" /> account will be issued before the end of the year as part of the overall expenditure provision of £200 million for arrears in 1995.  The balance of the arrears due will be paid between January 1996 and mid 1997.</P>

      <P>There are three statutory agencies under the aegis of my Department, namely the Combat Poverty Agency, the Pensions Board and the National Social Services Board.</P>
      <P>Two appointments have been made to the Combat Poverty Agency since 1 January 1995 as follows: Ms Anna Lee became a member of the board and chairperson with effect from 21 June 1995; Ms Deirdre Carroll was appointed as the Department's representative on the board on 31 January 1995.</P>
      <P>There have been no new appointments to the Pensions Board since 1 January 1995.  Mr. Michael Guilfoyle, the representative of the Minister for Finance, who resigned recently from the board, has not yet been replaced.</P>
      <P>The following persons have been appointed to the National Social Services Board for a three year period from 1 September 1995:</P>

      <Col N="2269" /> Responsibility for two bodies with which the National Social Services Board is associated has also transferred on a temporary basis to this Department. These bodies are the National Council for the Elderly and the National Validation Body for Social Work Qualifications and Training.  Both bodies continue to report to the Minister for Health.  It is proposed to have alternative administrative arrangements in place by the end of the year.  There have been no new appointments to the National Council for the Elderly since 1 January 1995.</P>
    <P>The National Validation Body for Social Work Qualifications and Training was technically established in 1994, the Chair was appointed at the end of 1994 and nominations for representations on the Body were requested by 18 November 1994.  A number of organisations nominated their representatives by the end of 1994 but there were a small number of additions in 1995.</P>

      <P>Currently one of the qualifying conditions for receipt of Deserted Wife's Benefit is that desertion must be proven to the satisfaction of a Deciding Officer of my Department.  For this, a deserting spouse either must have left of his own volition or his conduct must have been such that his wife was justified in leaving him.</P>
      <P>The person concerned applied for Deserted Wife's Benefit in May 1995 and a decision on her entitlement has not yet been made.  The delay in determining entitlement in this instance results from the need to obtain additional evidence relating to the circumstances of the break-up of her marriage. The evidence submitted to date has been insufficient to establish that desertion occurred.  The nature of the evidence which she is being asked to furnish was explained to her over the telephone on 31 August 1995.</P>
      <P>When a response to this request is received the position will be reviewed and the person concerned will be notified of the outcome.</P>

      <P>The Industrial Research and Standards (Fire Safety) (Domestic Furniture) Order, 1988 &mdash; which is enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs &mdash; prohibits the manufacture, assembly or sale of <Col N="2272" /> upholstered domestic furniture unless it passes tests relating to flame and smoulder resistance and is labelled accordingly.</P>
      <P>Replacement covers and fabric intended for use in domestic furniture must also pass the match test and be labelled accordingly.  However, the latter requirements do not apply in the case of a cover or fabric which contains 75 per cent by weight of cotton, flax, viscose, modal, silk or wool, not coated with polyurethane or a polyurethane preparation, provided the furniture (or second-hand furniture) concerned has an interliner between it and the permanent cover that passes the ignition test. I am aware of concerns expressed about the complexity of the Order and difficulties in its enforcement.  These are being addressed in an amending Order which I shall be making very shortly.</P>
      <P>The difficulties experienced in fully enforcing the 1988 Order in relation to upholstery fabric have arisen from the fact that such fabric is not covered by the Order if it is for use other than for the covering of domestic furniture.  The intentions of both the retailer and purchaser must be ascertained at point of sale and evidence is difficult to obtain in respect of infringements for use in court proceedings.  However, inspectors from the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs recently visited a substantial number of upholstery fabric wholesalers and retailers informing them of their responsibilities under the furniture safety Order.  I have asked the Director to continue these visits with a view to ensuring that the wholesalers and retailers comply fully with the Order.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy indicates, employment in IDA-assisted overseas companies in the Border counties had a net increase of 124 jobs in the first six months of 1995, compared with a national net increase of 3,000 jobs during the same period.</P>
      <P>However, the long term trend is the important factor, rather than a six month figure and since 1973, the number employed in IDA-assisted overseas companies in the Border counties has increased by 4,820 or 71 per cent.  This was achieved against the background of a difficult security climate and compares with a national increase of 33,786 or 72 per cent during the same period.</P>
      <P>In the past five years, net employment in Border counties has increased by 1,937 or 20 per cent.  This is a substantially better performance than the country as a whole, which increased employment by 12.7 per cent (9,322) in the same period.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the serious implications of the recent layoffs by Donegal Rubber in Ballyshannon, County Donegal; the action, if any, he is taking to secure the viability of the plant; and the further action, if any, he will take to increase employment in the town.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware of the problems being experienced by Donegal Rubber Limited which led to the recent announcement by the company to place 61 of their 126 full time staff on temporary lay-off.  The measures introduced by the company have been largely brought about by a <Col N="2279" /> difficult sales position and fierce competition in the European automotive industry.</P>
      <P>Donegal Rubber Limited is endeavouring to assess the future direction of its business and efforts are currently under way by IDA Ireland and the company to find an investor for the Ballyshannon operation.  IDA Ireland have assured me that everything possible is being done to assist the company in overcoming its difficulties and to minimise the duration of the lay-offs.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland are also actively pursuing an existing company to expand its operations to Ballyshannon and, in addition, will continue to promote the area to potential overseas investors.  To this end, Forfas have 11 acres of land together with some smaller units to assist in the attraction of industry to the town.</P>
      <P>Forbairt are actively promoting their total range of programmes and initiatives in Ballyshannon and County Donegal and have recently provided all manufacturing and internationally traded services in the area with detailed information on the full range of Forbairt services available.  Forbairt has been working closely with indigenous companies in the Ballyshannon area with a view to increasing their sales and employment levels.  Forbairt is drawing up a five year development strategy to address, in so far as it falls within Forbairt's remit, the employment creation needs of the region.  Local interest groups both community and business have been invited to participate in this process.</P>

    <P>(*To September, 1995)</P>
    <P>Samples are taken from farms, meat factories and distributors throughout the State; analysis is carried out at laboratories situated in the Dublin area and in County Tipperary.</P>
    <P>No attempts to interfere with the analysis process have been encountered. However, attempts have been made to frustrate the efforts of my Department by moving treated animals and carcases or by intimidating officers.</P>
    <P>Ireland carries out a higher level of testing of clenbuterol than any other member state.  I can assure the Deputy <Col N="2289" /> that I intend to continue using every means at my disposal to stamp out the use of this illegal substance.  I am confident that those engaged in abuse are a small minority and that the vast majority will join me in condemning those who attempt to sabotage our valuable beef export trade.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently examining proposals to further extend the level of testing with a view to confirming the residue free status and wholesomeness of Irish Beef.</P>

      <P>The abattoir at Straffan &mdash; the only horse slaughtering plant in Irland &mdash; is registered in the Register of Horse Slaughtering Premises under the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930 and holds an export licence.  Following complaints last year about conditions at the abattoir, an immediate investigation was launched by my Department and corrective measures were taken where deficiencies were found.  The level of veterinary inspections, including unannounced visits, was significantly increased, additional covered lairage space was provided within the perimeter of the abattoir and the use of areas outside the perimeter for the holding of animals awaiting slaughter was prohibited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, veterinary staff have been instructed to put down in a humane manner any distressed animals found in the course of visits or inspections. The veterinary inspectors who carry out the supervision of the abattoir, as in the case of other veterinary personnel of my Department working within the meat industry, are acting under very strict guidelines for the <Col N="2290" /> enforcement of animal welfare regulations.</P>
    <P>I am concerned, as is the abattoir management, by the practice of abandoning animals in distressed or injured condition at the entrance to the abattoir or on the adjoining lands.  This is done by the owners in order to avoid having to pay a veterinary surgeon to destroy the animals and then dispose of the carcases. Though only a very small number of animals are treated in this way, I find such behaviour utterly reprehensible and I shall not hesitate to call for prosecution on grounds of cruelty if the owners can be traced.</P>

      <P>This project proposal seeks a commitment of public funding, initially for a pilot project and subsequently for a possible longer-term venture.</P>
      <P>My Department considers that an independent evaluation of the proposed project is required before decisions on funding support can be made.  The Department has been seeking an assurance on the part of the proposers that they will co-operate with and facilitate the independent evaluator which the Department will appoint to carry out this task.  To date the necessary clear assurances have not been forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without such assurances I am certainly not prepared to speculate public moneys on such evaluation, much less contemplate a commitment of public funds to the project in question.  It is a matter for the proposers as to how the issue develops from here.  If and when the proposed independent evaluation <Col N="2291" /> can be carried out and concluded and once the evaluator's report is available to my Department, the question of the funding application can be further considered and final decisions made.  If it does not prove possible to carry out such an evaluation there will be no question of committing public monies in support of the project in question.</P>

      <P>The importation of poultry to Ireland from other member states of the European Union is permitted provided the goods comply with specified health standards and the requirements of the relevant EU Directives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, imports from third countries are not permitted.  However, the EU Commission have prepared a list of 16 third countries and models of animal health certificates for the importation of <Col N="2292" /> fresh poultrymeat into the EU.  It is proposed that the importation of fresh poultrymeat into the EU from these countries will be permitted from 2 February 1996.</P>
    <P>In January of this year I launched a new Development Strategy for the Poultry Processing Sector.  This Strategy recognises the major challenges facing the Irish industry from increased imports in the context of the liberalisation of markets.</P>
    <P>The Strategy provides a framework for the industry to reduce its cost base, further improve quality, and develop skills, facilities, new products and niche export markets.  Targets have been set for output, domestic market share and export activity up to 1999.  Estimated capital investment of £34 million, including substantial State and FEOGA financial assistance, will be provided in this five year period.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure the successful implementation of the development strategy for the poultry industry.  I have set up a Poultrymeat Forum.  The organisations represented on the Forum are drawn from all areas of the industry, Teagasc, Forbairt and my own Department.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the situation of farmers retiring under the farm retirement scheme which now requires transferees in joint ownership to increase the size of their holding by a minimum of ten hectares; the steps, if any, he will take to remedy this anomaly in view of the fact that the joint ownership of husband and wife does not constitute two separate farm holdings; and his views on whether this requirement cuts across the principle of family farming in Ireland.</Quest>

      <P>There is no change in the minimum enlargement requirement of five hectares which is deemed necessary for structural improvement under the scheme.</P>
      <P>This requirement applies to each farming transferee where lands are transferred solely or jointly.  The Deputy will appreciate that where the enlargement lands are jointly owned there must be sufficient to meet the enlargement requirement for each transferee.</P>
      <P>However, if the enlargement lands are jointly owned by husband and wife, then five hectares enlargement suffices if the released lands are transferred to only one of the joint owners.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the EU beef regime has traditionally focused its support, through the intervention system, on male cattle.  Accordingly, when the regime was reformed in 1992 beef producers were compensated for the restrictions introduced on intervention by way of a substantial increase in the special beef premium which is confined to male cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current cattle premium system is extremely beneficial to the Irish beef industry overall and I am anxious to avoid re-opening the 1992 Reform <Col N="2296" /> Package because of the risk that other Member States would avail of the opportunity to attempt to clawback some of the advantages enjoyed by Irish producers.  However, a number of aspects of the current regime will come up for review over the next year and I will keep the proposal for a slaughter premium for beef heifers in mind at that stage.</P>

      <P>The 1995 TB testing programme is proceeding with in excess of six million animal tests having been completed which is generally in line with previous years.  The objective is to complete a full monitor of all herds as well as any consequential testing from reactor breakdowns.  Rotation of testing which if implemented will facilitate drawdown of EU funding of some £4.2 million in respect of 1995 remains a key element of this years programme.</P>
      <P>Discussions are currently taking place with the farming organisations on revised arrangements for the scheme for 1996 and these discussions include <i>inter alia</i> decentralisation of responsibility for aspects of the scheme.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the costs of quarantine in relation to pet dogs and cats <Col N="2297" /> imported from countries other than the UK in accordance with the Rabbies Orders 1972-1976.  Under these Orders a period of six months quarantine in a premises approved by my Department is required in the case of such imports. The cost reflects the strict requirements of this legislation which is designed to eliminate the risk of rabies being brought into the State in animals which may be incubating the disease.  Details of the number of pet dogs and cats held in quarantine are as follows:</P>

      <Quest>the efforts, if any, he will make to ensure that the implementation of regulations which apply to the classification of certain medicines, including injectable antibiotics, as prescription-only medicine, does not bring about a situation where vets are less willing to write prescriptions as has been the experience since the introduction of the 1985 antibiotic legislation resulting in the retailing of veterinary products by vets themselves and a reduction in dispensation of these products by pharmacists on foot of veterinary prescription.</Quest>

      <P>Under regulations introduced in 1985, a wide range of <Col N="2299" /> medicines were declared to be prescription only medicines and veterinary surgeons were required to confine prescriptions for and direct supply of such medicines to animals under their professional care.  The actual retailing of medicines by veterinary surgeons must comply with the same requirements as any other shop selling veterinary medicines.</P>
      <P>In order to implement EU Directives and consolidate and modernise existing provisions, draft regulations to govern the manufacture, distribution, sale and supply of veterinary medicines are at an advanced stage of preparation within my Department.  These regulations will specify the various routes of supply applicable to veterinary medicines, but in the case of prescription medicines, I do not propose any substantive change in the current position as the controls in place are necessary to safeguard human and animal health.  However, the rules for prescribing will be strengthened.</P>
      <P>One of the ideas being considered is to introduce a new category for certain veterinary medicines which do not require prescription control but would be limited to &ldquo;pharmacy only&rdquo; sale as with certain human medicines.  This category would, of course, be available for direct supply by veterinary surgeons in respect of animals under their care.</P>
      <P>The National Drugs Advisory Board will have the responsibility, when authorising a veterinary medicine, to determine the appropriate sales category.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 358, 374 and 378 together.  When the control of farm pollution scheme was suspended in April 1995, some 18,500 applications had been received, of which approximately half will have been approved to carry out works by the end of September.  At present payments are being made within 5-6 weeks of the applicants notifying my Department's local offices of works being completed and submitting the appropriate certification.  To date approximately £9.3 million has been paid to about 1,500 applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I announced recently, I have now lifted the suspension in the processing of the balance of the 18,500 applications <Col N="2302" /> received up to 27 April 1995.  This follows an intensive review of the funding arrangements for the scheme.  I have now ensured that adequate financing will be available to enable payment to cover all such applicants over the next few years.  I am confident that the bulk of the payments will be made in 1997. The new funding arrangements require the approval of the EU monitoring committee which meets on 29 September.</P>
    <P>By the beginning of October all CFP applications received up to 31 December 1994 will be processed.  Work will then commence on all remaining applications.  Applicants will be dealt with in monthly batches starting with those received in January, 1995.  It is expected that by the spring of next year processing of the final batch of applications will commence.</P>
    <P>As a result of the review I am also introducing new improved procedures for the processing of applications.  Each applicant will be written to and given up to six months to submit detailed drawings of his or her proposed developments together with a list of existing farm facilities or, where appropriate, local authority planning permission. This will greatly speed up the processing of applications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 360 to 363, inclusive, together.  In a letter dated 17 March 1995, the Commission services wrote to my Department proposing a 10 per cent financial correction on the EAGGF <Col N="2304" /> expenditure for public storage to beef-meat in Ireland in the years 1990 to 1991.  In an earlier letter in November 1994, the Commission services had indicated that following their inquiry into the operation of public storage for beef-meat for the years in question, conducted under Article 9 of Regulation 729/70, a 5 per cent financial correction was considered appropriate.  The reasons for the adjustment of the penalty were not outlined by the Commission services.  Penalty increases were proposed in the case of the other member states concerned also.</P>
      <P>The Article 9 inquiry provides a basis for the Commission Services to check: (a)  whether administrative practices are in accordance with Community rules; (b)  whether the requisite supporting documents exist and tally with the transactions of the EAGGF; and (c) the conditions under which transactions financed by the EAGGF are carried out and checked.  Accordingly the Article 9 inquiry examined both the administrative systems operated by the Department and the operation of a number of individual meat plants.  The inquiry involved three other member states (France, Italy and UK) and financial corrections have been proposed for these countries also.</P>
      <P>The Department does not accept the validity of the findings of the Article 9 inquiry conducted by the Commission services, on legal, administrative and technical grounds.  The Department also considers that the level of disallowances proposed is wholly disproportionate to the findings of the Article 9 inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the procedure for clearance of EAGGF Accounts, a conciliation body now operates to examine cases involving proposed financial corrections where there is a disagreement between the Commission and a member state.  My Department referred this case to the conciliation body, in accordance with established procedures, and made a detailed written submission to the body in June.  An oral hearing between the body and an Irish delegation, consisting of officials from my Department, <Col N="2305" /> the Department of Finance and an independent legal adviser, took place on 8 September last.  Further discussions involving the conciliation body, the Commission services and the Irish authorities are envisaged.  It is expected that the conciliation body will make its report sometime during the next two months.  This report will be taken into account by the Commission in making its proposal for a financial correction in relation to the Article 9 inquiry, to be dealt with in the context of the clearance of accounts for 1992 which is expected later this year.</P>
    <P>While it is not useful to speculate on the likely outcome of the conciliation process and the subsequent decision by the Commission, I believe that the Irish case against the conclusions of the Article 9 inquiry is very strong and that this should be reflected in the final outcome.</P>
    <P>In relation to the possible recovery from traders of any fine imposed by the Commission, the Government has established a group of senior officials from the Department of Finance, the Office of the Attorney General and my Department to examine this question.  On completion of its work, the group's report will be submitted to the Government.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 367 and 368 together. Detailed assessments were carried out by both the Geological Survey of Ireland (GSI) and independent consultants on behalf of the then Department of Energy, which at that time had statutory responsibility of forestry matters, prior to sale of the lands in question and in the context of enabling the Department evaluate the fair market value of <Col N="2307" /> the property.  These assessments were a most important element of the Department's negotiating stance on the sale to Roadstone.  Since the outcome of the assessments and the value as ascribed to the sand and gravel deposits are related to the negotiation and agreement of the eventual sale price, I do not feel it would be appropriate for me to disclose details.  The sale price itself is a matter of private contract which I am not at liberty to disclose.  I can however assure the Deputy that, taking the aforementioned assessments into account, the Minister of the time was satisfied, as am I, that the State received a fair price for the sale of this property to Roadstone.</P>

      <P>My Department is considering proposals for the introduction of a scheme of compensatory <Col N="2308" /> headage payments on deer.  The relevant EU Regulation provides that in the case of production other than cattle, sheep, horses and goats, the compensatory allowance shall be proportional to the area farmed, less that devoted to the feeding of livestock.  In other words the compensatory allowances for deer would be based on forage area exclusively devoted to deer farming, and our proposals have been drafted along these lines.</P>
      <P>The proposals will require the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Formal approval of the European Commission of the inclusion of deer under our compensatory headage payments scheme will also be necessary.</P>

      <P>Under the plan for the future of Dublin Zoo approved by the Government the role of monitoring animal welfare at the Zoo was assigned to my Department. The question of an independent committee to assist in this function did not arise.  I have, therefore, put a system of inspectors by my Department's veterinary inspectors in place with a view to ensuring satisfactory animal welfare standards.  I intend to ensure that the well-being of the animals will be regularly and carefully monitored.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have retained an independent zoo expert from the UK, Dr. Andrew Greenwood, to act as consultant inspector and to make recommendations as appropriate.  His function is to advise my Department on an on-going basis and it was not envisaged that he would prepare a particular report for publication.  Dr. Greenwood was engaged on 26 January 1995 and details of the terms of engagement were set out in reply to a Dáil Question on 27 June last.</P>

      <P>Since the proposed Directive deals primarily with postal services, i.e. the collection, carriage, and delivery of postal items, it is unlikely to have any significant impact on the post office network, the business of which is mainly the payment of social welfare benefits, the operation of a range of savings services, TV licence issuing services, bill payment and money transmission services and other counter services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 385 and 386 together.  The Deputy may be aware <Col N="2314" /> that on 13 July 1995, Deputy Emmet Stagg, Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, announced plans for a competitive scheme to secure one electricity generating plant of up to 30 megawatts using biomass as a fuel.  It is proposed, subject to EU approval, to provide grant assistance of up to £7.5 million to the project under the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme. The drawdown of the grant will follow on normal European Union Structural Funds rules.</P>
      <P>The scheme will be designed to assist Irish energy policy by supporting the cheapest supply of electricity commensurate with environmental objectives. The detailed arrangements for the scheme, including arrangements for allocation of the grant and the criteria for evaluation of project applications, are being finalised by the Power Procurer in consultation with my Department. The scheme is expected to be launched in the coming weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 388, 392 and 393 together.  The core light rail network recommended by the Dublin Transportation Initiative provides for lines to Tallaght, Cabinteely &mdash; via the Harcourt Street line &mdash; and Ballymun at an estimated cost of approximately £300 million, in 1993 prices.  The Operational Programme for Transport, 1994 to 1999, provides for a total expenditure of £200 million on light rail during the period, £175 million of which is proposed to be EU-cofinanced.  The DTI final report endorsed this expenditure of £200 million as about the limit of what could be physically implemented in the period.</P>
      <P>In October 1994 the Government noted and approved the provisional finding of the light rail project team that the links to Tallaght and Dundrum should be constructed during the current Structural Funds round, with the remaining DTI recommended links to be constructed thereafter.  The decision in relation to the two priority phases to be constructed does not imply any abandonment of the remaining phases of the core network.  A fourth light rail line to Finglas via the old Broadstone railway line and an extension of the Ballymun line to Dublin Airport and Swords comprise the Phase 2 light rail network recommended by DTI for implementation once the core light rail network has been established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the Government decision, the project team, comprising CIE personnel and consultants, proceeded with the detailed planning work for the two priority phases, including the determination of the preferred technical route alignments.  Pending the completion of that work, I am not in a position to furnish detailed information regarding possible routings, station locations, the extent of underground service diversions, the impact on road traffic, opportunities for interchange with other public transport modes and the many other issues associated with implementation of a light rail network.  However, I would like to assure the Deputies that I <Col N="2317" /> am committed to ensuring the fullest and widest consultation concerning all aspects of the priority phases of the light rail network.  I expect to be in a position to formally launch a comprehensive public consultation programme later this year which will detail the proposals for the priority phases and give local people a full opportunity to air their views.</P>
    <P>In the immediate future I will be presenting proposals to Government for new legislation to provide a comprehensive legal framework for the development of a light rail network in Dublin. These proposals will deal with a range of issues associated with the development of a light rail network, including the preparation of an environmental impact assessment, the holding of a mandatory public inquiry, land acquisition, etc.</P>
    <P>The final configuration of the lines to Tallaght and Dundrum can only be definitively determined when the public consultation programme and the statutory procedures have been completed.</P>

      <P>Under the European Communities (Minimum Stocks of Petroleum Oils) Regulations, 1995 (S.I. No. 96 of 1995), the National Oil Reserves Agency was established with effect from 1 June 1995.  The agency has the statutory duty of ensuring that national oil reserves are at a level equivalent to at least 90 days consumption. Ireland is required by EU Directives and the rules of the International Energy Agency to maintain stocks of oil at this level.</P>
      <P>The regulations also provide for the collection of a levy on oil consumption in order to finance the activities of the agency which is required to operate on a break-even basis.  The amount of the levy is determined by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and has been initially set at 0.375 pence per litre which is equivalent to 1.7 pence per gallon.  It is estimated that the levy will yield revenue of between £15 million and £16 million in a full year which is equivalent to the initial estimate of the expenditure of the agency.</P>
      <P>As the agency does not own oil stocks at present, its costs arise mainly from contract payments in respect of the holding of oil stocks both within and outside the State.  The purpose of such contracts is to ensure the availability of oil stocks in the event of a supply shortage. Some costs will also arise in respect of necessary infrastructural improvements at the Whiddy Island Oil Terminal aimed at bringing the terminal back into commission and restoring its strategic value as a crucial element in our emergency response capability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention that the agency will operate in a cost-effective manner and provide the consumer, on whose behalf strategic oil stocks are held, with value for money.  I will, accordingly, be keeping the amount of the levy under review <Col N="2319" /> to ensure that the cost to the consumer is kept to a minimum.</P>

      <P>I am deeply concerned about the extent and potential seriousness of the nuclear incident which occurred at Wylfa in north Wales in July 1993.  The evidence which emerged in the recent court case only serves to increase the Government's worries about the ability of nuclear operators to manage such a hazardous industry.  My concerns are compounded by media reports yesterday of the incident at Dungeness a nuclear power station in Kent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the report of the Wylfa court case, I have written in the strongest terms to the UK Minister for Energy, <Col N="2320" /> Mr. Tim Eggar, MP, and to the Secretary of State for the Environment, Mr. John Gummer, MP, expressing my grave concern at the seriousness of the nuclear incident and the failure of Nuclear Electric plc to react promptly to the possibility of a serious accident.  I have also expressed the Government's and the Irish public's concerns about the age, safety and reliability of Magnox reactors, such as those at Wylfa, Sellafield and Dungeness and, indeed, the level of safety in the UK's nuclear industry generally.  In addition, the Attorney General has been asked to examine if there is any scope for Ireland to take an action under the EURATOM Treaty in respect of the Wylfa incident. Also, my Department has sought a full report from the UK authorities on the Dungeness incident.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I have called on the UK Government to phase out all Magnox reactors in the interests of nuclear safety and radiation protection.  In this context, I have sought an immediate review of the closure and decommissioning strategies of the UK's nuclear companies and have called for decisions on shutdown of Magnox facilities to be taken without delay.  On a more general level, the Ministerial Task Force on Sellafield and the Irish Sea is examining all possible avenues open to the Government to remove the serious threat posed by the UK's nuclear industry.</P>

      <Quest>if he will confirm the flows of gas which are expected in either direction from the interconnector with Scotland and the purposes therefor, especially in view of the fact that there are gas supplies from Kinsale and related fields.</Quest>

      <P>The Ireland/UK natural gas interconnector built by BGE is designed to provide gas supplies when the Kinsale Head/Ballycotton gas fields are depleted, which is expected to occur in the next five years or so, and to provide an alternative supply in the event of any disruption of that source prior to depletion.  All the onshore and undersea pipeline elements <Col N="2324" /> of the project have been completed, while the compressor station in Scotland is expected to be completed shortly.</P>
      <P>BGE has informed me that it is negotiating for the import of gas from the UK through the interconnector on behalf of a third party.  In addition BGE will import gas from the UK to meet other market requirements which cannot be met by Kinsale Head/Ballycotton fields.</P>
      <P>From October, 1996 BGE will start to import gas to meet peak winter requirements for the domestic, commercial and industrial markets.  Since December 1993 small volumes of gas have been transported through the pipeline.  In addition, the pipeline has provided security of supply facilities to protect BGE's core market of 240,000 customers should there be an interruption in supplies of gas from the Kinsale Head/Ballycotton fields.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2325" /> In the event of further indigenous gas supplies being discovered, the interconnector can be used to export any gas which is surplus to our requirements.</P>

      <P>As is the practice in the petroleum industry &ldquo;reserves&rdquo; is taken to mean recoverable reserves; that is estimated volumes of natural gas which are technically and commercially recoverable.</P>
      <P>In the case of Ireland's two gasfields, Kinsale Head and Ballycotton, the most recent estimates available to me indicate that there are 418 billion cubic feet of gas reserves in the fields.  This figure is dependent on several factors including the gas initially in place, the reservoir drive mechanism and its efficiency and the assumed economic cut-off point for the gas being produced.  Ninety seven billion cubic feet of gas were used during 1994 and this year, to the end of July, 60.3 billion cubic feet have been used.  Apart from the Kinsale Head and Ballycotton fields, Ireland has no other existing gas reserves.</P>

      <P>An application for a passenger boat licence in relation to the vessel in question was lodged with my Department in November 1994.  The vessel concerned was surveyed and a licence issued on 21 of that month.  The licence authorises the carriage on board of up to 12 passengers from Roonagh Pier to Clare Island in County Mayo and expires on 10 October 1996.</P>
      <P>A further application to carry in excess of 12 passengers on board the same vessel was subsequently lodged with my Department on 23 March of this year.  This requires the issue of a Class VI Passenger Vessel Certificate. The survey requirements relating to the design, construction standards, stability and survivability requirements for this class of certificate are more stringent than those in respect of smaller passenger boats and consequently requires the application of additional resources in terms of time and manpower.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that the survey application in this case is being processed at present and will be expedited as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>No statutory investigation or inquiry was carried out by the Department of the Marine in this case.  A surveyor carried out an informal review of the circumstances and reported to the Minister for the Marine.  Since the report was not prepared with a view to publication there are legal obstacles to its publication.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to answers given to previous questions in this House on 11 October 1994 and 5 April 1995. Those answers reported that: the initial recommendation to the ESB to erect improved warning signs was immediately acted on; a joint working group was established involving officials of the Departments of the Marine and of Transport, Energy and Communications and the ESB; the terms of reference of the group were to carry out an urgent review of safety standards and hazard warning procedures for overhead powerlines in the vicinity of all waterways and to offshore islands; this group agreed on a recommended minimum of 10.6 metres clearance for all new power crossings over designated waters; it also agreed a further upgrading of hazard warning and visability of power crossings and the examination in detail of existing crossings to assess the need for any other measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The visibility of power crossings has been enhanced over the past six months by the erection of more prominent signs and the attachment of warning markers <Col N="2334" /> to the lines.  This programme is continuing and its effectiveness is being reviewed on an ongoing basis by the ESB.  The signs and markers were developed in conjunction with the Joint Working Group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 419, 420, 421 and 422 together.</P>
      <P>Loran C is a civil land-based radio-navigation system.  It is used extensively throughout the world.  It has no military or nuclear significance.  This system in north-west Europe is being expanded so as to significantly improve the safety of navigation and the protection of the marine environment in north-west Europe waters.  It will ensure the availability of an independent non-military cost effective system as an alternative to the US military Global Positioning System (GPS).  Loran C is under the control of civil authorities and agencies in the countries concerned and overall control is rested in civil representatives from those countries.</P>
      <P>While any system of communications may be used for military purposes. Loran C has nothing to add to the variety of sophisticated military purposes, Loran C has nothing to add to the variety of sophisticated military systems in use and has no significance from a military or nuclear perspective.</P>
      <P>The parties to the Loran C International Agreement have established an administrative organisation consisting of a Steering Committee and a Co-ordinating Agency.  The steering Committee, which is comprised of senior officials from the countries involved in the Agreement, rotates its meetings between the various signatory countries. The co-ordinating Agency Office is located in Oslo, Norway.  There is no operational HQ, as such, for Loran C. Each country owns, is responsible for and has full control over its own stations.  The synchronising of the timing of each station's signals is currently done at an interim centre in Norway; this function will transfer to Brest, France in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be a total of nine transmitters in the Loran C chain, of which three, including Loop Head, will be new constructions.  The International Agreement provides for the sharing of capital costs on the following basis: Denmark offers the free use of the station at Ejde <Col N="2337" /> in the Faroe Islands and agrees to facilitate the updating of the station in accordance with the agreed specification and programme; France offers the free use of the existing Loran C facilities at Lessay, Souston and Brest; in addition France will fund new capital expenditure at Lessay and at Brest, and will contribute 50 per cent of the capital expenditure for the new station in Ireland; Germany will fund all capital expenditure at Sylt in Germany and contribute to general project management and technical assistance costs; Ireland will fund 45 per cent of the capital expenditure for the new Irish station; The Netherlands will contribute a proportion of the shared overall capital expenditure, equivalent to 50 per cent of the Ejde station and 5 per cent of the Irish station; Norway will fund all capital expenditure at Gamvik, Boe, Fedje in Norway and Jan Mayen; Norway will contribute 50 per cent of the capital expenditure at Ejde and will contribute to general project management, technical assistance and maintenance centre updating costs.</P>
    <P>This accounting mechanism is designed to ensure an equitable distribution of the cost burden, with countries benefiting directly from the new stations contributing to the capital cost of their construction or upgrading, and those countries not hosting a station also making a fair financial contribution. This arrangement also has the benefit over the alternative of pooling and redistributing funding through the Co-ordinating Agency of minimising currency exchange costs.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the contributions of France and the Netherlands towards the capital costs of the Irish station reflect the direct benefit of its inclusion in the chain to seafarers in the Bay of Biscay and road transport in the Netherlands, respectively.  Similar considerations give rise to the contribution of Norway and the Netherlands towards the capital costs of the Loran C station located in the Faroe Islands.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2338" /> Under the terms of the International Agreement, each party will pay all expenditure for the operation of the facilities on their respective territories, with the following exceptions: the Co-ordinating Agency running costs are shared equally by the parties except for France, which pays in kind; the maintenance centre running costs will be met by France on a cost recovery basis; Denmark will pay 50 per cent of salaries and remunerations of personnel employed at the Ejde station, the rest of the running costs being shared by the Netherlands and Norway.</P>

      <P>During my recent trip to Donegal I visited a number of harbours, including those referred to by the Deputy, to see the condition of landing facilities at first hand.  A number of the harbours require remedial repair works.  The repair of harbours in County Donegal is a matter for Donegal County Council and Buncrana Harbour Commissioners in the case of Buncrana Harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that many of the harbours in County Donegal and indeed throughout the country would benefit greatly from capital development works. Proposals for such works have been submitted by Donegal County Council to the Department of the Marine for consideration. However, the funding available for capital development works is particularly limited, amounting to only £1.5 million per annum.  Against this background it is difficult to see how major development works can be undertaken at the piers mentioned in that short term.  However, I will be making every effort to secure additional Exchequer funding for fishery <Col N="2339" /> harbours and the matter will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>The Merchant Shipping (Jet Skis and Fast Power Boats) Regulations, 1992 enabled local authorities, regional fisheries boards, harbour authorities and the Commissioners of Public works to make proposals to the Minister to designate areas as being unsuitable, in the interests of safety of pleasure craft and <Col N="2340" /> their occupants, for the operation of jet skis and fast power boats.</P>
      <P>These Regulations, in keeping with their statutory basis under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, were introduced to deal specifically and exclusively with the safety of pleasure craft and their occupants.</P>

      <P>Following the incident between the Irish fishing vessel <i>Orchidee</i> and the French fishing vessel <i>Agena</i> on 22 September 1992, the French Authorities have been carrying out an investigation through a procedure known as a &ldquo;Rogatory Commission&rdquo;. The Department of the Marine, in conjuction with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Irish Embassy in Paris, have been pressing the French Authorities to bring this matter to a conclusion.  The Department of the Marine has been advised that the investigation by the &ldquo;Rogatory Commissioner&rdquo; has been completed and that his report is, at present, under consideration by the French Maritime Tribunal Commerciale.  The Tribunal will decide whether any legal proceedings will be initiated.  I am very much aware of the distress that this lengthy procedure has placed on the bereaved families and I can assure the House that every effort will be made to bring this matter to a conclusion.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 12 noon on Wednesday, 27 September 1995.</P>
