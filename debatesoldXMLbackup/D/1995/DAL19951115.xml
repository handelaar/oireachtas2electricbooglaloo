    <Title>Civil Legal Aid Bill, 1995    [Seanad]:    Report and Final Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 13, after &ldquo;both&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and includes a person under 18 years of age&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make it clear that people under 18 years are entitled to legal aid.  Generally, people under 18 years cannot maintain civil actions and must get an adult to act as a &ldquo;next friend&rdquo;.  There are many circumstances in which a person under 18 years cannot get a suitable adult to act as a &ldquo;next friend&rdquo;.  For example, if he has left home he may not be able to get an adult to assert his legal rights for him and he may find himself in a vacuum until he reaches the age of 18.  Difficulties may also arise in cases involving domestic violence where he would not be able to get the parent guilty of the violence to act as a &ldquo;next friend&rdquo;.  Difficulties can also arise in cases involving landlord and tenant issues, contracts and abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person under 18 years should be able to seek legal aid if he wishes to pursue a claim for damages.  In cases where the abuse took place between the ages of 11 and 12 years the evidence may not be available when the child reaches the age of 18.  There are various other circumstances in which a fairly adult child of 16-18 years could find himself without a &ldquo;next friend&rdquo; and in need of legal <Col N="407" /> aid and assistance and the amendment proposes that he should be able to get advice in such circumstances.  I mentioned this proposition to the Minister on an earlier stage and I would like to know if he has given further thought to it and whether he considers it appropriate to include such a clarification in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage I indicated that I would further examine the points made by Deputy Woods.  The position is that the under rules of interpretation in relation to statutes the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; as used in the Bill will include a person under 18 years of age.  There is, therefore, no need for the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point made by the Minister &mdash; I am sure this is the advice he has received &mdash; but a person under 18 years cannot maintain a civil action in his own right.  There is a possibility, however remote, that if such a person approaches the local law centre he will be told, &ldquo;In view of the fact that you cannot maintain a civil action in your own right we interpret the legislation as providing that you are not entitled to legal aid in your own right&rdquo;.  Deputy Wood's amendment proposes to clarify the position.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware of the proposal in the public domain that the Government should establish a legal services agency for children who are not in a position to bring a legal action on their own behalf for their own protection in the case of abuse, where their welfare is threatened or where the person who would normally act for them or is legally entitled to act for them is unwilling or unable to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very minimum the Minister should do is make the position absolutely clear.  The insertion of the words can do no harm to the interpretation of the section.  It would put the position beyond doubt.  What the Minister says about the advice given to him on the <Col N="408" /> interpretation of the section is totally irrelevant since what he says in this House is not binding on the law centres, from whom those under 18 years will be seeking legal aid.  In order to prevent a very undesirable situation we ask the Minister to reconsider his position and for the reason I have outlined, accept the suggested wording.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Woods wishes to intervene he may do so but it must be understood that he is now replying to the debate on amendment No. 1.  The House will appreciate that on Report Stage Members may speak once only with the exception of the mover of the amendment who, in this instance, happens to be Dr. Woods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that on further reflection he considers the definition, &ldquo;applicant&rdquo; to mean a person applying for legal aid or advice or both; that it can mean also a person under 18 years of age.  As Deputy O'Dea has pointed out there may be circumstances in which difficulties will arise over that. The Minister recognised that during the earlier discussion on this issue and consequently was prepared to re-examine it.  We do not disagree with the Minister that the term &ldquo;applicant&rdquo; can be taken to include persons under 18 years but in the interest of clarity, we believe the Minister should include words to make it quite clear that it does include people under 18 years.  We cannot see what will be lost by doing that as all it will do is make it quite clear in all circumstances that a person under 18 years will have that entitlement.</P>
      <P>For that reason we favour the amendment but will not press it.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 36, to delete &ldquo;, with the consent of the Minister,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 3 (2) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="409" /> The Board shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession and an official seal and power to sue and be sued in its corporate name....</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to establish a statutory board with rights and entitlements that will operate the scheme of civil legal aid on behalf of the Minister and the Oireachtas.  In the circumstances we find it hard to understand why the Minister wants all property transactions to have his approval.  In practice, this is a much more restrictive approach than exists at present.  Under the present arrangement the board has set up its own offices around the country and has done this to everybody's satisfaction.  I do not think anybody had any great difficulty with that.  Apart from the fact that the Minister appoints all board members he has three direct representatives on it, a representative of the Department of Finance, of the Department of Social Welfare and of the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  Other board members are not just representatives of some organisation but are appointed by the Minister. The Minister has direct control and representation on the board.</P>
    <P>The subsection continues:</P>
    <P>... and, with the consent of the Minister, to acquire, hold and dispose of land or an interest in land or rights over or in respect of land and to acquire, hold and dispose of any other property.</P>
    <P>We suggest the words &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister,&rdquo; are not necessary.  We believe the Minister has a sufficient involvement in matters arising from issues relating to land.  For instance, if the board wants to open a new-suboffice in Tralee it will now have to get the Minister's approval on location and so on.  I do not think that is necessary especially when the Minister has such strong representation on the board of this independent corporate body.  Once the Bill is enacted this independent corporate body will not have one of the most basic and simple powers in its day <Col N="410" /> to day operations.  It is hard to understand why the Minister should have inserted such a provision.  The National Management Treasury Agency Act, 1990, on which this Bill seems to be modelled, makes no such provision and the remainder of this Bill seems to come from that Act.  The board of the National Management Treasury Agency could be involved in substantial property dealings.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand why the Minister, in setting up the board as a separate, corporate statutory body with representation of the Departments of Finance, Social Welfare and Equality and Law Reform, should also have a degree of control over matters such as the renting of offices and so on.  I would have thought that the criteria that applied to semi-State bodies generally should be adequate to deal with anomalies that might arise and that in any event the degree of consultation would be considerable given that in this instance this is the Minister's board.  We believe it will put a noose around the neck of the board's operation which seems to be totally unnecessary.  It seems quite clear that the Minister will have considerable influence on the activities of the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>We had considerable discussion on this topic at an earlier stage. The point we have been trying to convey to the Minister is the degree of control over the board when it is established.  People are extremely concerned that the Civil Legal Aid Board should be an autonomous body.  Everybody accepts, of course, that in the last analysis the Minister has a responsibility for the matter but there is the case to be made that notwithstanding the overall position the board should be as autonomous as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware of the recent controversy over the acquisition of property. As the Minister will have adequate representation on the board, he should give those appointees the responsibility he is taking on himself in this area.  While he should accept overall responsibility for <Col N="411" /> the board, it is important, particularly in the legal area that the board is as autonomous as possible.  This has as much to do with the way the board is perceived as with its functions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The kernel of the matter relates to the autonomy of the board and the extent to which it is distanced from the Minister.  The tenor of the legislation puts a strangehold on the board, to effectively make it an arm of the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  The tenor of our arguments is to loosen that stranglehold and establish distance between the board and the Department.  The Minister may smile, but it is important to have some distance between the board and the Department.  The board will have an important quasi-judicial function.  It will decide in what circumstances people can look to the taxpayer to vindicate their legal rights.  Expert groups who have studied such matters in other jurisdictions have concluded that, in the interests of public confidence in the system, the board should be as distant as possible from the Department.</P>
      <P>I understand the Minister's difficulty in that we do not want the civil legal aid board to turn into a property speculator engaging in major property transactions, holding investments and so on. I conclude from the Minister's demeanour that he is not disposed to accepting our amendment, but I ask him to come part of the way in this regard.  The non-statutory board was not hog-tied to this extent, but exercised its functions in a responsible manner.  There is no basis for saying a board established on a statutory basis would act less responsibly than one established on an non-statutory basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill states that the consent of the Minister is needed to acquire, hold or dispose of land or an interest in land or rights over or in respect of land.  We are not opposed to the consent of the Minister being sought when the board engages in such transactions, but his <Col N="412" /> consent must also be sought before the board acquires, holds or disposes of any other property.  Property other than land can be personal property or moveable property.  The legislation effectively means that if a law centre wants to throw out an item of disused office furniture or acquire a desk or a chair, it must obtain the consent of the Minister. That is ludicrous.  By way of compromise at this late stage, the Minister should introduce an amendment to remove this silly restriction.  Literally interpreted, it could mean the civil legal aid board would have to acquire the consent of the Department before acquiring a supply of stationery.  It should not be beyond the Department of Equality and Law Reform to draft legislation to ensure, in respect of the acquisition and disposal of property, that the board does not exceed its statutory functions and that property transactions would be incidental to its core statutory function to provide free legal aid and advice to those who qualify.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage I indicated that I do not support this amendment which would enable the legal aid board to acquire, hold and dispose of land and property without having to obtain the consent of the Minister.  I explained that virtually all of the board's finances are provided from moneys voted by the Dáil to provide legal aid and advice.  While I am concerned to ensure that the board has a free hand to act in respect of its primary activity, namely, providing legal aid and advice, given the significant amount of office accommodation and so on which the board requires for its daily activities and which involves significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, I could not agree to it being allowed absolute <Col N="413" /> discretion in respect of the acquisition and disposal of property without ministerial consent.  I am satisfied it will be possible for the board to exercise a good deal of discretion on the basis of delegated sanction to deal with minor matters.  That covers the point raised by Deputy O'Dea.  That is also the best way to proceed under the statutory scheme. I regret that I cannot support the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not explained how sanction would be delegated.  Would it be delegated by order or by specific regulation?  Would it be a clear statutory delegation?  If so, it would meet some of our concerns.  The Minister should not be confused by recent events.  He frequently informs us that hard cases make bad law and this also applies to the running of semi-State bodies.  I support the establishment of such bodies.  In other countries they are recognised as being effective.  I worked in An Foras Talúntas which the Department of Agriculture set up after years of haggling.  It was a dynamic independent body for which the late Dr. Tom Walsh, a world figure in science who set it up was never forgiven.  We must have confidence in the people who run semi-State bodies and remember that it is not only civil servants who wish to serve the best interests of the country.  We should set the terms and conditions and ensure the checks and balances are in place. Semi-State bodies do something Departments do not do well and Seán Lemass promoted their establishment to tackle tasks in a direct operational context while the Civil Service and Government set the checks and balances, controls and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in that context we want this statutory body to have more freedom to do a specific job.  Under paragraph 224(3) of the non-statutory civil legal aid scheme, the board already had power to acquire or dispose of its interest in any <Col N="414" /> premises as may be necessary for the due performance of its functions.  Under the statutory scheme it should have the freedom, in a system of management by exception, to carry out its duties on behalf of the Department with the overriding management ensuring the checks and balances are in place.  I do not know if the Minister can say anything about delegating sanction.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 17 to 20 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  The Board may, to such extent and in such manner as it considers appropriate&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  advertise its services to the public,</P>
      <P>(b)  organise programmes of education for the purposes of informing citizens about their legal rights and entitlements,</P>
      <P>(c)  provide such other information services as it thinks fit, and</P>
      <P>(d)  undertake research projects.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about extending the <Col N="416" /> remit of the Civil Legal Aid Board.  The Minister went some way in accepting a Seanad amendment in this regard but it was a minimalist response.</P>
    <P>The amendment states that the board may, to such extent and in such manner as it considers appropriate, advertise its services to the public.  That is essential. People must be aware of its services and what is available to them.  It states that it may organise programmes of education for the purposes of informing citizens about their legal rights and entitlements.  The Minister accepts the board advertising its services but an important facet is that people would be informed of their legal rights and entitlements. Unless people are aware of those they will not avail of the services.  We seek that the board may provide such other information services as it thinks fit and undertake research projects.</P>
    <P>The amendment seeks to give the board as much scope as possible.  We do not want to divert the board from its main intent but if it were to undertake research projects it could better discern the direction in which it should go and react in a better way to new developments in the legal framework.  No agency can stand still; it must relfect the mores of the times and the needs of the people.  This is particularly so in regard to the law.  I do not suggest that this should divert the board from its main business but there must be a benchmark against which to measure how well an agency performs.  In the area of research it is vital that there be feedback which can be used as a benchmark against which to establish how other companies or agencies operate and evaluate needs and performance.  This is extremely important in terms of the quality of service available to people.</P>
    <P>Many commercial companies, particularly those involved in the provision of services, engage in research.  It is fundamental to all companies, including semi-State organisations and boards under the aegis of Government Departments, that research facilities are available.  It is unacceptable to suggest that research <Col N="417" /> would cause large commercial organisations to deflect from their main aim; that would never be the case.  On the contrary, it would provide a fresh impetus and ensure a satisfactory reponse to the needs of consumers or clients, which is a very valid expectation in this day and age.</P>
    <P>People availing of legal aid, who to some extent require protection, are not in a position to lead in this regard.  They are recipients of advice and aid.  The type of research proposed in this amendment would mean an expansion of the role of the agency.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter.  It is not our wish to curtail the service available, and I am sure that is not the Minister's intention.  If we do not allow the board latitude to develop in these areas we will be doing it a disservice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Keogh has set out the position clearly.  The three amendments in our name are similar to that in the name of Deputy Keogh.  Amendment No. 6 proposes to insert after &ldquo;information&rdquo;&ldquo;on the law and legal matters, and information&rdquo;.  The purpose of the amendment is to enable the board to provide information about the law and legal issues and to ensure it is not unduly restricted.  I accept the Minister has gone part of the way to meet our concerns in this regard.  Subsection (2) enables the board to give information about its services, but it should also be able to give information and advice about the law and legal issues.  Law centres throughout the country provide information and give explanations on the law and legal issues.  It is important that they continue that work but they should also be involved in research.  The Minister believes it is unrealistic to suggest that law centres should carry out research.  To serve the clients well, a certain amount of research is necessary.  It is an integral part of the operation of the service that people are kept up-to-date with matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 states: &ldquo;Nothing in this section shall prevent the Board from engaging in research related to its <Col N="418" /> activities, or in the provision of information or education to the public on legal matters&rdquo;.  The board may decide where and when research is necessary and the Minister, who has direct involvement with the board, may consult the board in that regard.  I am certain that can be done in a harmonious way.  It is important to provide on a statutory basis that the board has enabling powers to carry out research relating to its activities.  The approach taken by Deputy Keogh to this issue is slightly different from that taken by Deputy O'Dea and myself.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies Keogh and Woods have made the case very well for these amendments and I do not intend to delay the House.  I acknowledge that during the Seanad debate on this legislation the Minister introduced an amendment in this regard, but unfortunately his approach is a minimalist one. The Minister is well aware of the Pringle recommendations on the free legal aid service &mdash; that report envisaged a much more broadly based service.  Pringle criticised the service as constituted at the time as being too narrowly focused.  In this legislation we have missed the opportunity to broaden the civil legal aid system, which is provided largely for the disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Woods said, law centres disseminate information throughout the community.  Nevertheless, a FLAC survey of 1991 showed that despite the length of time the legal aid system had been in operation, only 58 per cent of those surveyed were aware that a civil legal aid system existed.  In disadvantaged areas the figure was 42 per cent.  I hope, with the expansion of law centres, that position has improved, but I will not be convinced until I see an updated survey.  From talking to people I am almost certain that, proportionately, in disadvantaged areas awareness is less than in other areas.  There is a very compelling case for a system along the lines suggested by Pringle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many reasons people do <Col N="419" /> not avail of the civil legal aid system, particularly in disadvantaged areas, such as lack of knowledge and the psychological gulf that exists between them and the legal system.  Pringle took account of that and envisaged a position whereby the system would be more broadly based and rooted, particularly in areas of disadvantage in the community.</P>
    <P>At present the civil legal aid system provides for subsidisation.  A person who cannot afford a solicitor in private practice is means tested for civil legal aid.  In some cases, depending on the person's income, they must pay a charge towards the service.  Some 98 per cent of clients of the civil legal aid system are family law clients.  Various organisations, particularly the Combat Poverty Agency, have criticised this system, and rightly so, as being too narrowly focused &mdash; that matter will be dealt with in a later amendment.</P>
    <P>On research, it is important that problems are identified and brought to the attention of the Government on a regular basis.  The Minister will, no doubt, say that law centres are very busy and do not have time to engage in esoteric research, but even 1 per cent of the budget could be allocated towards commissioning research in particular areas. People working in law centres who deal with these issues at the coalface see the problems that arise and realise that legislation may not achieve the objective intended by the Government.  It may impact on people, particularly in areas of disadvantage, in ways that were never envisaged.</P>
    <P>There is no difficulty in the way of the Government introducing the appropriate changes.  In matters such as this, law reform is preferable to constant litigation.</P>
    <P>If there is to be a regular reporting system of problems and difficulties that arise, some mechanism should be established to deal with it.  The Minister advised on Committee Stage that he visits the law centres, hears the problems and is kept well informed.  I appreciate <Col N="420" /> this, but we should have something more than this hit and miss method, whereby if one visits the centres one will hear about this and that.  Some law centres advise of problems by writing to the Department but others may not.  We must have some kind of mechanism whereby problems that arise on a regular basis, which could be easily ironed out by a simple reform, are notified to the Department.  It is also very important that some research be undertaken to see how these problems can best be resolved.</P>
    <P>As currently based, we are building on a system that is too narrowly focused.  The amendments in the name of Deputy Woods and Deputy Keogh would help to broaden the system and to bring it closer to what the Pringle Committee suggests.  This is desirable, and the system would be better for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the force of one of Deputy O'Dea's arguments regarding the fact that in many cases people do not know of the existence of the law centre or the services available. This is why I inserted subsection (2) of section 5 in the Bill.  I refer the Deputy to the subsection, where he will see this point is specifically covered.</P>
      <P>Section 5 was amended in the Seanad by way of the addition of subsection (2) to make it clear that a function of the board shall be to disseminate, for the benefit of those for whom its services are made available, information with regard to those services and their availability.  The principle function of the board is that set out in subsection (1), which is to provide within its resources legal aid and advice in civil cases to persons who satisfy the requirements of the Bill.  In addition, section 6 provides that the Minister may, by order, assign to the board such additional functions as are considered incidental to or consequential on the functions assigned to it under the Bill, and section 37 provides that the Minister may, by regulation, make provision for such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the board can be relied upon to provide information to <Col N="421" /> the public as required.  If the need arises it will be possible, under the Bill as it stands, to make ministerial orders or regulations to deal with the matter.  I believe that the board can best ensure access to justice by addressing the priority of providing legal aid and advice to those most in need in society.</P>
    <P>As I indicated on Committee Stage, over 90 per cent of legal aid cases relate to family law.  Deputies will agree that these cases must continue to be our number one priority and that subsection (1) of section 5 should be the main function of the staff and board.</P>
    <P>I do not support the proposed amendments.  Their effect would be to divert staff from their main function, which is to provide legal aid and advice. Staff are not employed as educationalists and researchers.  No firms of solicitors operates on this basis and law centres have not heretofore operated on it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea also referred to the Pringle Committee.  Its report led to the establishment of the scheme of civil legal aid and advice, and it envisaged some role for the board with regard to the provision of legal information to the public.  However, at the time it reported, in 1977, the committee envisaged that law centres would be concerned primarily with the provision of legal advice rather than legal aid.  The practical experience of the last 15 years has shown this to be the case.  Law centres spend by far the greater proportion of their time providing legal aid for court proceedings to members of the public. What the Pringle Committee did not anticipate was the establishment of the National Social Services Board, with a multiplicity of information centres operating under its auspices.</P>
    <P>For all the reasons I indicated on Committee Stage, I regret I am not disposed to accept any of these amendments.</P>

      <P>I understand the Minister's fears.  However, under amendment No. 8 I propose that nothing in <Col N="422" /> this section shall prevent the board from engaging in research relating to its activities.  We are seeking to give the board the authority to engage in this.  I agree with the Minister's remarks regarding the importance of the mainline work undertaken by the board.</P>
      <P>We are establishing a statutory board, which will hopefully last for a long time. This amendment will facilitate the board.  We seek to provide the facility to undertake research as part of its work. The Minister is not disposed to making such changes to the Bill and I will, therefore, withdraw the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody has suggested that we should in some way dissipate the functions of the board.  The amendment in my name seeks to allow the board a certain degree of flexibility.  The Minister is not taking cognisance of the fact that things change and that a body such as the Legal Aid Board would have to adopt to change.  I was suprised to hear him reply that the Minister would make ministerial orders with regard to functions.  Surely it should not have to come to this, especially with regard to providing information about the services and undertaking research?</P>
      <P>There should be some degree of flexibility.  Deputy O'Dea made a reasonable suggestion on the issue of allowing 1 per cent of the budget to go towards research.  It is not that this would redirect the efforts towards legal aid for court proceedings.  However, it would allow flexibility for the board to undertake research projects as it sees fit.</P>
      <P>The Minister is not right in attempting to curtail the activities of the board in this area, and I am not convinced that a lack of flexibility in an area such as this is the best thing.  We should allow the board greater autonomy.  I am disappointed with the Minister's response to my amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 28 to 35.</P>
      <P>This section deals with legal policy directives on legal aid and advice.  The section states that the Minister may, by order, from time to time as occasion requires, issue to the board such general directives as to policy in relation to legal aid and advice as he or she considers necessary.  My amendment proposes that wording should be deleted.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keogh's amendment proposes that in page 7, line 30, after &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, and shall lay each such directive before the Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.  That would be desirable and I support Deputy Keogh's amendment.  The section deals with general policy directives on legal policy and advice.</P>
      <P>Section 37 provides for a range of regulations and has a catch all provision to deal with such other matters arising by virtue of the Act as the Minister considers appropriate.  That is why we question the inclusion by the Minister of this provision and the nature of the policy directives.  The Bill sets out the general policy for the board and the extra powers that will be given to the Minister. Those are the issues about which we are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made amendments to subsection 3, but subsections 1 and 2 indicate a specific control by him over the operation of the board.  There is a limitation and control on the operation of the board which enables the Minister to direct it in a manner which goes beyond the provisions made for the range of regulations in section 37.  The <Col N="424" /> provisions of section 37 alone would meet the requirement of Deputy Keogh's amendment, that the regulations would be placed before the House.  Our difficulty is that there are many provisions which restrict the operations of the board and maintain tight control by the Department.  The Oireachtas is telling the board the manner in which it would like the board to operate and if it were to work to the provisions set out it would perform the task the Oireachtas has set for it.  The Minister's intervention through this section indicates that may be the position but he may put forward other proposals not covered by the broad parameters set out by the Oireachtas or by the regulations the Minister must place before the House.  One wonders about the purpose of the interference in policy matters through general policy directives on legal aid and advice.  That is a matter of concern.  If the Minister was not prepared to rely on section 37 for the provision of the range of regulations, the section as it stands would be improved by Deputy Keogh's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Woods made a good case.  I am concerned about directives on policy.  Under section 37 &ldquo;the Minister may make such regulations as are necessary for the purpose of giving effect to this Act&rdquo;.  There is something of a belt and braces approach to that. Now that there is a plethora of committees of the House, matters relating to policy could be considered by one of them.  The Minister responded on Committee Stage that the regulations will be laid before the House but that is a passive response.  In the area of policy and as we are concerned about the control a Minister &mdash; I am not speaking specifically about this Minister although this may relate to a future Minister &mdash; may or may not want to exert over a civil legal aid board, it should be a facility of the House that policy should be <Col N="425" /> immediately and proactively examined and not addressed in a passive way.</P>
      <P>Part of our concern is that while one might consider this Minister reasonable and open to debate, we must consider also what control future Ministers may or may not try to establish over a board such as this.  To a great extent precedents are created in legislation when a Minister is allowed a great deal of control.  One might be tempted to say that this Minister is reasonable and we accept that he will not issue regulations and directives concerning this or any other board willy nilly but, unfortunately, we cannot rely on the goodwill of one Minister, we must think of the future when drawing up legislation.  In light of the regulation of and control over this board, the Minister should reexamine these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis for issuing ministerial policy directives to the Legal Aid Board already exists in the scheme of civil legal aid and advice.  The directives which have so far been made have helped to clarify positions for the board where necessary.  In many cases the directives were of direct benefit to legally aided persons.  There are precedents in other legislation for policy directives and there is no reason to depart from precedent in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 was carefully framed.  It empowers the Minister, by order, to issue general policy directives in relation to legal aid and advice to the board.  However, such policy directives do not confer a power on the Minister to exercise any power or control in relation to any particular case with which the board is or may be concerned. I do not accept there is a need to delete section 7.  On the contrary, the section is soundly based and should remain in the Bill as it requires the Minister to issue policy directives by order.  Such orders must, by virtue of section 38, be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and are published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> The <Col N="426" /> amendment is, therefore, unnecessary and I am opposing it.</P>

      <P>There is no point in relying on that old argument because the same argument cannot be used on both sides of the case.  During Committee Stage the Minister referred to the high calibre of the people being appointed to the Civil Legal Aid Board and no doubt he will avail of the opportunity to refer to this today.  It is a contradiction to refer to the excellence of those being appointed while at the same time he introduces statutory provisions which indicate he does not trust them.  He wants to be in full control on a daily basis.  The Minister said that under the provisions of section 37 the regulations will have to be laid before the House but what we are talking about here are general policy directives.  In an ordinary interpretation of language they will not have to be laid before the House and they do not come under the provisions of section 37.  According to this legislation the Civil Legal Aid Board is supposed to act independently, yet the Minister has the power to issue general directives which can change the goal posts and alter the scheme fundamentally.  He can do so in secret without having to lay the directives before the House and without being accountable to anyone.  That is allowing too much control by the Minister and he should <Col N="427" /> amend the legislation to make it absolutely clear that the general policy directives should be placed before the House.

      <P>If that is the advice the Minister has got, I am happy to accept it.  Even if that is true, it is a minimalist approach.  I am in favour of section 7 (3) which prevents the Minister from interfering in and taking control of any particular case.  That is desirable and it is a change from what was proposed in the original legislation.  I may be incorrect in saying that, but from wherever it came it is acceptable.  The rest of the section is a reflection of the Minister's stranglehold of the Civil Legal Aid Board, the public perception of which will be bad. The public perception for those who understand it is that the Civil Legal Aid Board has become an arm of Government.  If one is seeking legal advice, one does not actually go to the Civil Legal Aid Board or the law centre but to the <Col N="428" /> Department of Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>It is clear that the Minister will not make any further alteration.  I admit he conceded a change earlier.  We have made our concerns clear to him.  I accept that under section 38 an order must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, in addition to regulations under section 37.  We are concerned that there is too much rigidity and not enough flexibility.  We do not want the board hamstrung or tied down by regulations, orders and directives. We want it free to carry out the intentions of the House and the Minister in a modern fashion.  We are concerned about the board being able to carry out some research where necessary and that it should have the freedom to operate. It boils down to the way in which the Minister will operate the new statutory scheme and whether he will be sufficiently flexible in its operation.  That remains to be seen.  Deputy Keogh has said that although the Minister might be flexible in operating the scheme, his successor is likely to be more flexible because he or she will probably come from this side of the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 39, to delete &ldquo;September&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;June&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 9 (1) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not later than the 30th day of September in each year, the Board shall make a report to the Minister, in such <Col N="429" /> form as he or she may approve, of its activities during the preceding year.</P>
    <P>It should be possible for the new statutory board to make its reports within six months.  The Pensions Act and other Acts require that reports be available within six months.  That has been Government policy.  We seem to be moving further away from openness and transparency.  The defence the Minister will offer is that it will take a little longer to get the information from law centres.  The National Pensions Board, which has to deal with the trustees of many thousands of pension schemes and hundreds of thousands of people each year, has a major task in compiling its information in six months but it is done because the Oireachtas has specified it.</P>
    <P>We adopted that line with various other boards and asked that their information and reports be available within six months.  That was the Labour-Fianna Fáil Government policy while in office.  We now find there is a slippage and that it will take longer for the figures to become available.  This may be due to the fact that there are three heads pointing in different directions, as pointed out by Deputy Ahern. In any event, it is preferable that we keep to the six months requirement. There is no reason for specifying a longer period.  I will be interested to hear the Minister's reply.  All the other boards are being asked to make their reports available in six months.  The body is being modernised and will have the equipment to provide information it may have had difficulty providing in the past within the timescale.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 as it stands requires the Legal Aid Board to make its annual report to the Minister within a period of nine months relevant to the period to which the report relates. Deputy Woods's amendment, which is a repeat of the amendment he tabled on Committee Stage, seeks to reduce the period in question to six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="430" /> In the Bill as initiated, the period was 12 months but following discussions with the board I was in a position to bring forward an amendment in the Seanad which was accepted and which reduced the timescale to its current period of nine months.  I regret I am not in a position to agree any shorter period. The difficulty is that the board's annual reports contain a considerable amount of statistical data which takes some time to compile.  The period in the Bill is the maximum time within which the board must report.  The 1994 report was made within the shorter period of eight months and this was quicker than many previous reports.  I recall in previous years waiting two or three years for reports from the Legal Aid Board.</P>
    <P>I am confident the board, on enactment of the Bill, will make its reports quickly, consistent with the need to be as comprehensive and informative as possible.  We should not impose unrealistic deadlines which would unduly disrupt the board's operation and other important areas.  Consequently, I oppose the amendment.</P>

The report was produced within six months last year and this indicates it is possible when the system is set up.  It is similar to the position in the Office of the Attorney General.  I heard a report about this matter on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; today.  This office is now doing wonderful things and can turn out information almost immediately.  It is possible when the need arises and a clear demand is made.  I was conscious for some time of the need to reorganise the Office of the Attorney General.</P>

I hope the board will turn in its reports within six months anyway.

      <P>In page 8, line 4, before &ldquo;as&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;other than information in relation to day to day activities&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>Section 9 (2) (a) states: &ldquo;The Board shall, at the request of the Minister, supply him or her with such information relating to the performance of its functions as the Minister may from time to time specify...&rdquo; The amendment seeks to insert &ldquo;other than information in <Col N="432" /> relation to day to day activities&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;as&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to leave the board free to carry out its day to day activities and ensure there is no interference with the daily running of the board with demands for detailed or personal information.  The board's day to day activities should be excluded, this is not unusual, I can point to other recent legislation, such as the Pensions Act, where day to day activities are excluded.  The amendment seeks to ensure there is no interference.  It is important the Minister does not interfere with the board's day to day activities but also that he is seen not to do so. This is important in terms of people's confidence in the daily operation of the board.  I raised this issue earlier and I am concerned about it.  Before the Bill is concluded, it is important to address this issue and allow the Minister a further opportunity to alter the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <P>Section 9 (2) (a) provides that the board shall, at the request of the Minister, supply him or her with such information relating to the performance of its functions as the Minister may from time to time specify.  Deputy Woods's amendment seeks to exclude information relating to the board's day to day activities.</P>
      <P>I already indicated in debate on this matter it could be argued that almost everything the board does constitutes day to day activities.  Acceptance of the amendment could render the operation of section 9 meaningless in practice.  The Bill already makes clear in section 7 that nothing in the Bill shall be construed as enabling the Minister to exercise any power or control in relation to any particular case with which the board is or may be concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is answerable to the Houses of the Oireachtas for the operation of the Legal Aid Board.  Over £6 million of Exchequer funding now goes to the board.  The Minister's position would be impossible if he or she were, for example, unable to answer questions <Col N="433" /> on the operation or activities of the Legal Aid Board because of inability to obtain the relevant information from the board.  The House would not then be in a position to obtain meaningful replies to any parliamentary questions which Members thought necessary to put down in relation the board's operations.  In the circumstances, I am unable to support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I concede the Minister was correct on the earlier point in relation to section 38.  Unfortunately, I have not read the Bill for some time. However, with that caveat, there is potential for abuse with regard to section 7 (3) and the subsection Deputy Woods wishes to amend.  This would not be availed of by the current incumbent in the Department of Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor.  The Minister stated that under section 7 (3) nothing in the Bill shall be construed as enabling the Minister to exercise any power or control in relation to any particular case.</P>
      <P>Effectively that means the Minister is prevented from interfering and nothing in the Bill shall allow him to intervene in any case with which the board is dealing.  That is fair enough but it seems under that section, particularly the subsection Deputy Woods is trying to amend, that the Minister could seek information on any case with which the board is dealing.  It is not impossible to imagine circumstances in which a less scrupulous Minister than the present incumbent of the Department of Equality and Law Reform might be approached by, for example, a backbencher seeking information about a particular case on behalf of constituents or by a constituent seeking information on his or her own behalf.  He or she might be a strong supporter of the then Minister.  Is there anything in the Bill to prevent the Minister getting information and communicating that information to either a member of his parliamentary party, a friend or a party supporter?</P>

      <P>I think the Minister understands our concerns which are about interference in the day to day activities of the board by officials of the Department or the Minister of the day. We are anxious that the board would be free to get on with its work and not to be interfered with in any way.  That is why we put down this amendment.  I can only rely on the Minister and his approach to this matter but I advise him that the board must be allowed to get on with its day to day operation.  We cannot have the heavy hand of a Department on a board because it would stifle its operation and would not work.  I do not wish to appear hard on the Departments in this regard but departmental officials have many other responsibilities, including those to the House, and to all the regulations under which they operate. Consequently, their hand is often stayed in such a way that it can lead to delays and difficulties.  The Government is trying to deal with that problem, as did the previous Government, through the strategic management initiatives for the public service and the Civil Service in particular.  I am not suggesting that people are malevolent in what they might be doing but it is important that management systems operate efficiently and flexibly.  We are trying to ensure there is not any interference in the day to day activities of the board.  The question of personal information arises also and the danger that might be used under pressure in particular circumstances.  I will not press the amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes to delete lines 33 and 34 in page 8 which read: &ldquo;An officer of the Board shall, upon his or her appointment as such, be a civil servant in the Civil Service of the State.&rdquo;  Amendment No. 14 proposes to delete subsection (5) (a) which reads: &ldquo;The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by order designate solicitors of the Board as civil servants in the Civil Service of the State, to take effect from the date of the making of such order and upon the making of such an order, subsection (4) shall cease to apply.&rdquo;  It also proposes to delete subsection (5) (b) which reads: &ldquo;The Minister shall not make an order under paragraph (a) without having (i) notified in writing any recognised trade unions or staff associations concerned and the Board of the Minister's intention so to do, and (ii) considered, within such time as may be specified in this notice, any representations made by such trade unions, staff associations or the Board, in relation to the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps we should hear from the Minister on his amendment No. 15 in which he seems to be trying to clarify the position.  He suggests the deletion of lines 42 to 44 in page 8 and substitutes them with the following: &ldquo;(i) in the case of a solicitor of the Board appointed on or before the date of the making of such <Col N="436" /> order, from the date of the making of such order, and (ii) in the case of a solicitor of the Board appointed after the date of the making of such order, from the date of such appointment.&rdquo;  We should hear what the Minister has to say since he has come part of the way to meet the proposals I have made in my amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <P>Section 11 provides for the appointment of staff of the board and provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that staff currently employed by the board who are civil servants be made civil servants of the State.  It also provides that the staff currently employed by the board who are not civil servants may also be made civil servants of the State if they so wish.</P>
      <P>The effect of Deputy Woods's amendments would be to remove Civil Service status from the staff of the board who are already civil servants and remove the provision whereby any non-civil servant members of the board may be made civil servants if they so wish.</P>
      <P>I should make it clear at the outset that to ensure an orderly transition of the board from administrative to statutory status and that the board retains its highly experienced and capable staff, the board and my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance, engaged in a long series of meetings with the trade unions representing solicitors and administrative staff.  As a result of those meetings, detailed provisions which were acceptable to all parties have been agreed and the framework of those agreements is contained in section 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not now willing, as the amendments propose, to ignore the best interests of staff on the board and I, therefore, must oppose Deputy Woods's amendments.  Official amendments Nos. 15, 17 and 18 are technical amendments only.  Section 11 (5) makes provision for designation by ministerial order of law centre solicitors as civil servants of the State following consultation with staff representatives.  The section is in line with similar legislation where the establishment of a board on a statutory <Col N="437" /> basis is concerned.  The purpose of amendment No. 15 is to make clear that solicitors appointed after the date of the ministerial order provided for in section 11 shall also be civil servants of the State.  Amendments Nos. 17 and 18 are consequential on acceptance of amendment No. 15.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>When I raised this issue on Second Stage I said that the board should be independent in the exercise of its functions, but that the Minister was taking tighter control of its operations. This runs counter to the trend in other countries.</P>
      <P>I stated, as at column 777 of the Official Report of 29 June 1995:</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that the purpose of the legislation is to establish the board on a permanent basis and to copperfasten the position of the board.  However, the Bill creates various problems in relation to the independence of the board....  Staff members, including solicitors, will become civil servants in the Civil Service of the State.  At present some of the existing non-legal staff of the board are civil servants.  Under the provisions of the Bill all staff will become civil servants.  All solicitors and law clerks of the board are employed under direct contract between themselves and the board and do not fall into the category of civil servants.  Why does the Minister wish to change the status of the solicitors and bring them within the Civil Service?  In a recent article in the <i>Irish Law Times</i> of May 1995, Siobhán Fianna in an article on human rights had this to say in relation to the position of staff members as civil servants:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill also gives rise to some concern in that it is difficult to accept that the staff members will remain independent and neutral in the exercise of their duties, given that under the Bill their status within the Board depends upon the consent of the Minister and that they are also to <Col N="438" /> be designated &ldquo;Civil Servants in the Civil Service of the State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is not that far fetched to suggest that a position of a legal aid solicitor as servant of the State will undermine his/her judgment in decisions relating to actions against his/her master, i.e. the State.</P>
    <P>The underlying principle is that the board must be seen to be independent in the exercise of its functions, but the Minister's amendments will bring it under the control and direction of the Department and the Civil Service.  This should give rise to concern.</P>
    <P>I stated, as at columns 778 and 779:</P>
    <P>In case the Minister may consider that this is a concern in this jurisdiction only, this matter has been the subject of discussion in Australia.  In the report of the National Legal Aid Advisory Committee in 1993-94, the question of the independence of the Legal Aid Commission in Australia was discussed.  In Australia, legal aid is provided through legal aid commissions....  The advisory committee stated it had discussed the independence of legal aid commissions at length and concluded the notion of their independence was initially directed towards ensuring their freedom to act against Government, whether as the initiating party or as the defence, uninhibited by Government interference.  The advisory committee suggests there are two underlying principles to the independence from Government control of the commission: first, employees should not be servants of the Crown; and, second, they should not be subject to ministerial direction and control.</P>
    <P>It came solidly to the conclusion, having considered the matter long and hard, that the Legal Aid Commission in Australia should be seen to be independent and free to act on behalf of the citizens of that state uninhibited by Government control within the parameters set down, but in the case of the Legal Aid Board here it is clear that the Minister is taking <Col N="439" /> tighter control of its operations.  That is wrong.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that the staff have now agreed to the arrangements that he wishes to make.  That is a matter for negotiation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>They pressed for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but the board must be free to act on behalf of all the citizens of the State.  If the Minister were to establish a commission, I am certain it would reach the same decision as the advisory committee in Australia.  The cost of the equality payments at £260 million approximately is the largest expense ever incurred by the State.  If the Legal Aid Board had taken a case against the State the matter could have been resolved in 1984 which would have given rise to a cost of no more than £30 million.</P>
      <P>I trust the Minister accepts the point that if a body does not regard itself as independent it will be inhibited.  Consequently, I cannot agree with the approach being taken by him, although I accept the staff may wish to take a particular line in negotiations.  They need to know what line the Government and the Oireachtas is taking so that they can negotiate proper arrangements which must be protected and secured.  This is a fundamental issue.  It is one on which the Minister missed an opportunity to escape the clutches of departmental control.  I have the highest regard for the officials in the Departments but I explained earlier the restrictions under which they operate.  A strong statutory body with the powers to do what the Oireachtas desires would be in the best interests of the country in the long run. It is unfortunate that the Government will not go along with that approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a great deal of what Deputy Woods said.  The Minister has taken the line of least resistance in this Bill.  Whether that is on ideological or purely practical grounds I do not know.  There must have been an <Col N="440" /> option for the Minister to establish the Civil Legal Aid Board on a completely independent basis.  He must accept that when people see what they consider to be the control of the <i>status quo</i>&mdash; many people refer to the Civil Service as the permanent Government &mdash; there is a fear that the board will be less flexible than it might be.  When we say things like this we all have to pay tribute to the great work done by the Civil Service; that is understood.  However, it always seems to be that what is not specifically allowed is forbidden, instead of approaching things the other way around and that is my fear in relation to the board.</P>
      <P>The legislation is terribly narrow and defined and may not be in the best interests of what the Minister is trying to achieve.  I do not know why he made the decision in relation to the members of the board being civil servants, or whether they should be allowed to take that option, except for the fact that civil servants are already employed there. There could have been a way around that if the Minister wished to find it. Obviously he did not.  People will see that the board is to operate under the aegis of the Minister's Department and will perceive it to be, to a certain extent, shackled by the restraints that there must be within a Department and the Civil Service.  They may or may not be right, but that is a perception and for many people feelings are facts and perception is, unfortunately, reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dr. Woods made valid points and I am in agreement with many of them.  A totally autonomous body may have caused problems for people who were already involved.  The Minister says that people already involved pressed for the type of solution that he decided upon, but that is not necessarily the best way to approach the problem.  I do not suggest that the Minister should have created a row or made people uncertain as to their future.  In other circumstances, difficulties like that have been addressed and they could have been <Col N="441" /> addressed in this case, but the Minister is seeking to establish quite a degree of control over this board.</P>
    <P>I said on Committee Stage, and I repeat, that the Minister has confused control and accountability.  We all accept that the Minister must have accountability, but it does not follow that he must control everything down to the day to day functions of the board. He will have to give members of the Legal Aid Board, particularly the professionals involved in the specific area, the degree of autonomy that is their due.  I suggest this on the basis that there is a perception problem in relation to the freedom of action of the board.</P>

      <P>Deputies Keogh and Woods outlined the situation very well and I do not intend to add much to it. We are back again to the question of independence.  I have no doubt that the Minister will say that the solicitors working for the Legal Aid Board are officers of the court and that they will not exercise their powers any less fearlessly or independently just because they happen to be public servants. Unfortunately, in turning the solicitors employed by the Legal Aid Board into civil servants, there can be no doubt that the Minister is changing its ethos and atmosphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might not make very much difference in an average family law case where a person seeks maintenance against their spouse or a case where two people want to sue each other about a right of way, but the Minister will be aware that more and more people have to enlist the aid of the civil legal aid service to take on the State.  Deputy Shatter gave examples on Committee Stage of people who were refused asylum or citizenship by the Department of Justice.  Deputy Woods cited the equality arrears case where ultimately the Department of Social Welfare had to pay out £260 million.  If a citizen in that situation who cannot afford a private lawyer goes along to the Legal Aid Board to take on the State, those who <Col N="442" /> will represent him are themselves servants of that State.  This matter has only to be stated for it to be concluded that it is undersirable.</P>
    <P>It is well known that senior civil servants in different Government Departments know and regularly communicate with each other.  The Sir Humphrey syndrome is alive and well in the Irish public service.  It is most undesirable and inherently unjust that people who have to rely on the Civil Legal Aid Board to vindicate their rights against the State should have to depend on servants of the very State they are taking on to represent them.  The Minister said that there have been trade union negotiations and so on and that the line he was taking was in the best interest of the staff.  For whom are the taxpayers providing the annual budget for legal aid and on whose behalf?  Is it for the staff, or for the citizens who have to depend on civil legal aid to vindicate their rights?</P>
    <P>The situation should not be dealt with in a certain way simply because the staff want it so.  Our primary concern should be the consumers of the free legal aid service and their interests are not being taken into account in relation to this matter.  Deputy Woods quoted experts in Australia, he also quoted experts who have no axe to grind, who have criticised this trenchantly in various academic magazines.  They are objective, they are independent, there is no reason they should criticise this if they do not see it as being wrong.  They have no political affiliation as far as I know.</P>
    <P>It appears it was left to the staff to take this decision.  The Oireachtas would not ask for their views.  The Oireachtas, which is supposed to represent the people, was not allowed to take the decision.  The staff itself took the decision and the Minister is using the Government majority to vote it through.  That is inherently undemocratic.</P>

      <P>Had I wanted to create a future for myself as a solicitor working in civil legal aid I would have become a <Col N="443" /> permanent and pensionable civil servant.  Clearly that would be in my interests but not in the best interests of the people relying on public representatives.  The Minister can suggest that we are insulting the integrity of the people working in civil legal aid, contending they would work less effectively if they were civil servants, but I would remind him that the whole ethos has been changed it would appear, at the behest of the staff.</P>
      <P>The Minister is worried about trade union, industrial relations difficulties and so on but the civil legal aid system is being provided by taxpayers for customers.  This step is the last straw.  It destroys the independence of the Legal Aid Board and the legal aid system.  It is a bad day's work &mdash; independent, outside experts are unanimous on this &mdash; for the unfortunates particularly those who take on the State, who must rely on the civil legal aid scheme to vindicate their rights.</P>

      <P>I reject any assertion that solicitors of the board would be less independent were they civil servants. There is no basis for that assertion.  The approach of Deputies opposite seems to be based on the theoretical argument which suggests that members of the public who want to take action against the Department of Equality and Law Reform or the State will be concerned about the independence of the board because its staff, by and large, are members of the Civil Service.  I cannot accept that there is any validity in that suggestion.  Whether the board's solicitors are civil servants in the service of the State or otherwise, ultimately they <Col N="444" /> will be paid out of Exchequer funds; that is the unavoidable reality. However, to suggest that they would be inhibited, in acting against the State, because they are ultimately paid by the Exchequer is to do a disservice to a highly trained and remarkably committed group of people.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out on numerous occasions in this House and the Seanad, I hold the board's solicitors in the highest regard.  I know they are absolutely committed to the principle of equality of access to justice and would not contemplate abandoning a client in any circumstances.  For example, staff in the Office of the Ombudsman and of the Garda Complaints Board are civil servants in the service of the State.  I have not heard any criticism of those officers in respect of their independence.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy has a complaint, he should spell it out.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods referred to the report of the Australian National Legal Aid Advisory Committee in support of his argument, page 14 of which states:</P>
      <P>It was clear to the National Legal Aid Advisory Committee that the independence of commissions from Government was never intended to be absolute.  Rather, their independence is directed towards ensuring that they are uninhibited by Government interference.  Subject to the requirement of independence of this form, the commissioners are to carry out their duties and functions in accordance with their governing legislation.</P>
      <P>I am more than satisfied that the independence the board requires and which was envisaged by the Australian NLAAC is guaranteed under this Bill. On the other hand, Deputy Wood is more concerned about public perception than the real effect of having solicitors as civil servants.  The bottom line is that, ultimately, solicitors always will be paid out of Exchequer funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> Any change in the Bill could have two effects only.  The first would be simply to mask the fact that the board's solicitors are employees of the State while the second would lead to a deterioration of the industrial relations climate within the board.  Deputy O'Dea would have to agree that would not be helpful to consumers, the citizens of this State.</P>
    <P>I regret I am not willing to make any changes to the Bill which would lead to a dilution of its provisions and, for that reason, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy O'Dea said, I will not take the Minister's decision lying down and must dispute many of his comments.  When he stands back and examines them he will realise someone will read them and ask how he could say such things since the board should be clearly seen to be independent.</P>
      <P>The authors of that Australian report made the clear, strong point that the servants of the board should not be civil servants, so that the independence of the board would be seen to be transparent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but we are concerned that all the relevant terms revert to more and more control and centralisation.  Unfortunately, the Minister does not appear to be able to grasp the point that that is what is actually happening.  I know his eminent civil servants are very clever in the manner in which they put their case.  In 1967 I was a principal officer in the Civil Service and I am now equated with the grade of assistant principal as a TD, so I have good reason to believe civil servants do not do too badly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, the Minister is missing the real point here, which is that it is a question of those solicitors having their independence within the parameters laid down by the Minister, Government and Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is no question of allowing them to do whatever they like.  When the Minister <Col N="446" /> thinks about that, he will fully realise that is what we are talking about.</P>
    <P>I might remind the Minister that the members of the Judiciary who are not civil servants are also paid out of moneys funded by the Exchequer, but that does not mean the Minister can interfere with them.  There is no question mark over solicitors at present staffing the legal aid system.  As far as we can ascertain, they do an excellent job and have been meeting an ever increasing demand very effectively.  The question relates to the best option for the future and what type of statutory board should be established.  I commend the Minister on setting up the statutory board, on many of the conditions being laid down for that board and on his flexibility in meeting the points we raised earlier.  However, this is a crucial, fundamental point.  In these enlightened days of openness and transparency, we should go a step further; we should have a vision of the membership and role of this board, which is what we on this side of the House are talking about.  Our vision is of an independent board under the overall control of the Minister, his Department and his civil servants.  The Minister has chosen to do differently and has given his reasons for doing so. I think he is wrong and that he will regret not having taken the bigger, bolder, more visionary step when he had the opportunity to do so.  I commend the Minister on many parts of the Bill.  We all do on this side of the House. However, we have great fears about the restrictions on the body.  The Minister has not gone far enough to ensure that the board is statutorily independent in the full meaning of that term.</P>

    <P>(7)  The Board may cease to grant legal advice under this section to a person where it considers that it is no longer reasonable for the person to continue to receive it and, in particular, where the person no longer satisfies the requirements in respect of financial eligibility specified in section 29 and in regulations under section 37.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Section 26 sets out the criteria for the grant of legal aid.  The Bill throughout is very clear on the circumstances under which legal aid may be granted, and it reflects generally what is contained in the scheme as it stands.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposed by Deputy Woods is, as I indicated on Committee Stage, excessively broad in its scope.  It would allow regulations to be made under which the Legal Aid Board would have complete freedom to grant legal advice apparently with or without limitations.  My amendment No. 21 goes some way in the direction of amendment No. 22 in that it allows the board to cease granting legal advice subject to conditions in the Bill and in regulations. However, I have no hesitation in saying it would not be appropriate, given the context in which the scheme of legal aid and advice is operated, and the context in which it would operate under the Bill, to allow the board to operate on the basis proposed generally in the amendment from Deputy Woods.  I do not support his amendment.  Amendments Nos. 21, 26 and 41 are technical amendments only.</P>

The main effect of amendment No. 21 is to make similar provision in so far as giving legal advice by the board is concerned.  It also enables the board to cease granting legal advice where the applicant fails to comply with requirements laid down by the board, requirements specified in section 29 and in any regulations made under section 37.

      <P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>In page 22, to delete lines 13 to 15.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that a law centre may provide legal aid or advice to more than one party to a dispute provided each such party is represented by a separate solicitor or, where necessary, a barrister. There is no statutory prohibition on both parties being dealt with at the same centre and it is important to ensure a clear separation in terms of accommodation in such cases.  I thought this issue could be dealt with by the board on an administrative basis but this brought us back to the question of whether it has adequate flexibility.  I am very anxious to ensure that the solicitors or barristers for each party are seen to be separate.  This will depend on the design of the centre and the provision made for separate treatment.  This matter should be handled by the board and, given that it is expanding and providing extra centres, consideration should be given to the provision of facilities for mediation.</P>

      <P>Section 30 (6) is purely an enabling provision which does not obligate the head of a law centre to act for both parties; it simply states that any law centre may provide legal aid or advice to more than one party to a dispute.  It goes down the road advocated by Deputies that the maximum possible discretion should be downloaded to the people at the coalface, that is the heads of law centres.  Obviously, no head of a centre will undertake this unless it is appropriate in the particular circumstances.  For example, if a law centre has two, three or four solicitors, both parties in, say, a judicial separation case have agreed all the terms and it is a matter of going into court to have a formal order made then obviously it would be difficult to send one of the spouses 100 miles <Col N="455" /> down the road to the nearest law centre. This provision will be applied at the sole discretion of the heads of law centres in a professional way in suitable cases.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister given further consideration to this matter?  The amendment provides that the Minister may, by regulation, establish committees representing local interests in a particular area to consult with the person responsible for the management of the local law centre.  It also states that no member of such committee shall have access to any client's personal file, etc.  There was much discussion about this on Committee Stage.

      <P>The amendment would enable me as Minister with responsibility for the Legal Aid Board to establish, by regulation, committees which would consult with law centres.  I spoke at length on the same amendment on Committee Stage and stated my reasons for opposing it.  I am still of the same <Col N="456" /> view.  The board and law centres will be free to engage in consultation with local interests as they see fit.  It would be regarded as a poor form of consultation between law centres and local interests if it were necessary for me as Minister to impose by regulation committees representing those local interests.  Local interest groups may from committees on their own initiative to consult with law centres without the need for ministerial regulation.  If law centres wish to take the initiative in such matters they should be free to do so and not have the matter forced on them.  I do not have a problem with that if they decide to do so.</P>

      <P>With the establishment of my Department over two years ago I took over responsibility for the scheme of civil legal aid and advice.  At that time it was operated by the Legal Aid Board with insufficient staff and law centres. There were long waiting lists.  Those problems have been eradicated by doubling the funds which resulted in a doubling of staff numbers and law centres.  Waiting lists bear no comparison to those of earlier years.  Staff are highly motivated and we have a new board comprising a good and representative gender balance.  It is operating well under the chairmanship of Claire Connellan, a solicitor who is a skilled administrator.  For the first time the board comprises two staff association representatives.</P>
      <P>The new board, law centres and staff are operating effectively and efficiently and on the basis of what I have seen to date on the many visits I have made to law centres throughout the country there is an air of enthusiasm and no little excitement about a dynamic organisation that is gearing itself for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This landmark Bill puts the scheme of civil legal aid and advice on a statutory basis while allowing for a degree of flexibility to set out more specific details by means of regulations.  The perception <Col N="459" /> will be that the board is not only permanent but is being organised and developed strategically to deal with the future and the consequences of marriage breakdown.  I am happy to say that the Bill implements the Government's commitment to legal aid.</P>
    <P>Amendments have been made to the Bill and, as far as possible, they take into account the fine contributions made by Members in this House and in the Seanad.  It is one of a series of major family law Bills which I initiated.  The promise made was to bring forward these Bills and culminate the exercise in the holding of the referendum on divorce.  On the basis of the Maintenance Act, 1994, the Family Law Act, 1995, the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1995, the Domestic Violence Bill, 1995 and Civil Legal Aid Bill, 1995 we will have an updated code of family law to match that of any developed country.  That code of legislation represents a Government that cares about those involved in marital breakdown.  It is a response that society expects from Government and one it will be the better for.</P>
    <P>We cannot legislate for the right to obtain a divorce and remarry.  That is in the hands of the people who will decide the issue on 24 November.  All major outstanding legislative matters dealing with the support of spouses and children in the context of marital breakdown have been addressed.  Should the people vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in the referendum the further protections enshrined in the constitutional amendment proposal will become part of our law and the House will have an opportunity to discuss the details of the Family Law (Divorce) Bill which I will be in a position to bring forward.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their support on this important Bill and appreciate their constructive contributions.  I offer my sincere thanks and appreciation to my officials for their many hours of hard work on the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage I stated that the Bill presented an opportunity for the Minister to adopt a comprehensive approach.  However, he did not take this historic opportunity to provide an imaginative and integrated way of dealing with the requirements in this area. We repeatedly pointed out that we wanted the board to be more independent, open and transparent in its operations and gave examples of how such boards operate in other countries.  It is regrettable, therefore, that the Minister lost an opportunity to provide for such openness.</P>
      <P>The board will be closely controlled and will lack the necessary powers. While we acknowledge that its main function will relate to legal aid and advice, it will not have the power to carry out research.  As the need for family law support was never greater the Minister should have taken an independent stance in the formulation of this statutory body.  After some 15 years' experience of the legal aid service he could have proceeded in a comprehensive and visionary manner.</P>
      <P>The board has been successful in meeting the increasing demands placed on it in the past few years and I compliment the Minister on establishing a large number of local centres and increasing the board's budget to £6.2 million.  The officials of the Department must also be congratulated for their exemplary work in this regard.  I thank the Minister for introducing a number of amendments to meet some of our concerns, but it is regrettable he did not meet our wishes in respect of the board's independence.  Our main concern relates to the basic concept of the statutory body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this important legislation and compliment his officials for their work in this regard.  I wish the new statutory board success in its work.  It will face many challenges in the next few years, irrespective of whether the divorce referendum passes.  Many people do not realise there is a demand for the board's <Col N="461" /> services and that will escalate.  If the divorce referendum passes the board will experience additional difficulties in the short-term and the Minister must address them.  While he has taken important steps in regard to mediation, much more needs to be done urgently in that area, a different approach to this legislation might have facilitated that.  I wish the Minister and the staff of the Civil Legal Aid Board success in its operations.</P>

      <P>Despite the many reservations I have about the Bill, I am pleased the Civil Legal Aid Board will be put on a statutory footing.  I congratulate the Minister and his officials on the work they have done in this regard.  Notwithstanding that, too much power has been vested in the Minister and the board will not have sufficient flexibility.  It is regrettable the Minister did not go the extra distance in that regard.</P>
      <P>The need for free civil legal aid in the case of family law is generally accepted, especially as many women avail of the service.  People should be made aware of the existence of the board, especially as we are facing a divorce referendum. From my experience in the past few weeks it is obvious that people are not aware of the extent of marital breakdown and that is clouding their judgment in respect of the forthcoming referendum.</P>
      <P>I wish the new board success and hope Ministers will not seek to use the powers of regulation to stultify its work.</P>

The Minister stated I was incorrect in that regard but he previously said that in the Seanad.  I would like him to clarify the matter.</P>

At line 15 of subsection (8) of that section &ldquo;disposable capital&rdquo; is defined as the amount of the applicant's capital after making such reductions and allowances as may be specified by the Minister in regulations. I assure Deputy Kenneally that in making those regulations the family home will be excluded from the definition of &ldquo;disposable capital&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I had a meeting with the President of the European Commission, Mr. Jacques Santer, in Madrid on Sunday 5 November.  We had a wide-ranging discussion on key items on the agenda of the European Union in the perspective of the December Madrid European Council, the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the union and the longer term. The specific items which we discussed included the 1996 inter-governmental conference economic and monetary union, employment and future enlargement of the Union.  The discussion was extremely useful and enabled me to ascertain Mr. Santer's current thinking on a range of important issues.</P>
      <P>I also had a substantive discussion with Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, Prime Minister of Luxembourg during our flight from Madrid to Tel Aviv for the funeral of Prime Minister Rabin.  I was particularly glad of the opportunity to have such a discussion at this time with a Prime Minister of a fellow small member state.  My discussion with the Prime Minister ranged over bilateral matters and some of the issues which I have already referred to in my meeting with Mr. Santer.  In addition we discussed the situation in Central and Eastern Europe and relations between the European Union and Turkey.</P>
      <P>I had a very brief conversation on the issue of economic and monetary union with President Chirac at the funeral of Prime Minister Rabin.  The President confirmed his determination to ensure that France will qualify for participation in European Monetary Union in 1999.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matters to which I have referred concern a meeting with the President of the Commission, the President of France and the Prime Minister of Luxembourg.  I have had no discussions lately with the German Finance Minister, Mr. Waigel or with Chancellor Kohl so I would require notice of any questions that address the question of policy of the Federal Republic of Germany.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not raising the policy of the Federal Republic of Germany but what I am anxious to discuss with the Taoiseach is economic and monetary union in so far as it affects Ireland. In his reply the Taoiseach said he discussed economic and monetary union with the President of the Commission and with President Chirac.  In that context would the Taoiseach agree that controls tighter than the controls laid down at Maastricht would not be achievable by the Irish economy?  Is he concerned that this it the intention of the German authorities in relation to the European Monetary Union?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied with the criteria for economic and monetary union laid down in the Maastricht Treaty.  I do not believe there is any need to add to those criteria and that they should be applied in full.  The more detailed reference scenario for the application of the treaty provisions will be agreed at the Madrid Summit but I am satisfied that the decision thereon will be a reasonable one and I am satisfied with that.  I am not willing to become involved in speculation about views that may have been expressed by individual members of other governments of member states.  I have stated the Irish Government's position, which I think is reasonable and I will confine myself to that.</P>

      <P>I outlined to the President the strong views on neutrality of the Irish people and Governement policy which is that any change in that position would require to be approved by the people before it would be made.  I was also willing to listen to his point of view.  We have stated our position quite clearly but I do not think we should be unwilling to listen to what others have to say.</P>

That is not necessarily the best way to proceed in the national interest. What I did, and this was proper, was to outline the strong attachment that the Irish people have to neutrality.  I explained also the historical reasons for that to both the President of the Commission and the Prime Minister of Luxembourg.  It was not wise of me to anticipate proposals that might never be made, but to the extent that they might be made I outlined the viewpoint of the people on the matter and stated that any decision to change that policy would have to be made with their consent.</P>

      <P>The position in regard to this matter is well known.  I raised the issue of Irish Steel with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in Majorca. I also raised it with Prime Minister Juncker during our lengthy discussion.  I am glad that whereas Luxembourg previously joined Britain in opposing the proposals for Irish Steel, it has now withdrawn its opposition, and that is very welcome.  Obviously, a problem remains in regard to the position of Britain, but questions tabled to me today do not relate to bilateral discussions with Britain; they relate to the Commission and Luxembourg.  I assure the House I will continue, as will the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, to do everything possible to get the necessary unanimous agreement at Council for the Irish Steel proposal.  At this point the only country whose consent is required is the United Kingdom.</P>

      <P>The Government recently authorised the drafting of a Constitution Amendment Bill.  This Bill will provide for the relaxation of the Cabinet confidentiality rule where details of discussions at Government are sought by either a tribunal of inquiry or a Dáil committee, inquiring into a matter of grave public importance, whose terms of reference specifically permit them to inquire into such discussions.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first part of the question concerning courts, the Government decided it would address the matters that arose directly from the decision of the Supreme Court in 1992 in the judgment arising from the proceedings of the beef tribunal which wished to inquire into matters that occurred at a Cabinet meeting, in which a number of Ministers of the Deputy's party were involved.  On that occasion, the Supreme Court made no decision on whether courts could require such information.  It simply made a decision on whether a tribunal, which is an instrument of the Oireachtas, could make such an inquiry.  We took the view that we should remedy the matter that arose directly from the Supreme Court decision which affects tribunals.  The question of courts having access in particular cases to Cabinet discussion is a matter that is best decided by the courts themselves without the aid of a constitutional amendment.  They may make that interpretation on the basis of existing constitutional provisions.</P>
      <P>On the second part of the question, the Government took the view that Cabinet confidentiality is not in the first instance a technical legal matter.  The question of whether &mdash; and to what extent &mdash; Cabinet discussion should be confidential is a matter of public policy upon which the Government, accountable to the Dáil, should make the first decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, we decided to proceed on the basis that the <Col N="470" /> Government would make a decision on the appropriate form of constitutional amendment and that there was no necessity for us to delay matters by involving ourselves in a reference to the Law REform Commission, which in practice would be superfluous.  That involved a change in the position as set out in the Programme for Government. In the interests of dealing with this matter with a reasonable degree of expedition, the change in procedure decided by the Government was the correct one because this is essentially a matter of public policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is being disingenuous.  It is clear from the Supreme Court decision that the ban on revealing Cabinet proceedings is absolute.  If a tribunal of inquiry, to whose findings the proceedings of Cabinet may be central, cannot inquire into what went on at Cabinet, it is clear that a court could not demand that information.  The Taoiseach's explanation for going back on the promise in the Programme for Government to refer the matter to the Law Reform Commission defies belief.  The reason the Government did not refer the matter to the Law Reform Commission is that it decided privately on a minimalist approach.  It was embarrassed to put the matter to the Law Reform Commission because it might suggest that the Government should go much further than was decided.</P>

      <P>Political matters should be decided by politicians and the question as to what degree Cabinet discussions should be confidential is best decided by serving politicians &mdash; that may not be the view of Deputy O'Dea &mdash; who understand what is involved in the responsibilities of Government.  On reflection, I do not believe it would have been right to refer this matter to the Law Reform Commission, which is comprised of many estimable people, <Col N="471" /> none of whom ever sat around a Cabinet table or made a Cabinet decision.  I believe a decision of this nature is better taken by politicians.  I have no doubt that the Government's case for the decision it has taken will be supported in this House as it is the only practical approach to the matter.</P>

      <P>Regarding the other matter to which Deputy O'Dea referred, if the proposed constitutional amendment is passed allowing for a tribunal of inquiry to go behind Cabinet confidentiality and to inquire into Cabinet discussions having been given that specific mandate by this House, that will involve Ireland being more advanced than all EU countries except The Netherlands in terms of the extent to which it is willing to go behind Cabinet confidentiality.  My view is that Cabinet confidentiality, particularly regarding discussion, is a very important matter of public interest and it is necessary to preserve such confidentiality particularly regarding discussion around the table. Where a matter is so serious as to necessitate the setting up of a tribunal by this House and the House has decided that inquiries ought to be made into what happened at Cabinet, it is justifiable to set aside the very important consideration of Cabinet confidentiality, but only in those limited circumstances. I do not favour a casual setting aside of Cabinet confidentiality.  As somebody who as served in Cabinet, and I hope the Deputies opposite who have served in it will agree with me, I believe this matter should not be set aside lightly.</P>

      <P>The Government has introduced a Bill dealing with the compellability and privilege of witnesses who will come before committees and the Dáil.  There are many exclusions in that Bill and some people suggest there are more exclusions than inclusions. One of the exclusions relates to Cabinet discussions.  If the Oireachtas passes that legislation and a referendum on Cabinet confidentiality is held subsequently, will it be necessary to amend the legislation before the House?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The constitutional amendment being proposed here would not apply to normal committees of the House.  It would apply only to tribunals established to investigate a specific purpose and, therefore, the resolution governing the establishment of a tribunal would be in the origin of the powers of the tribunal.  To my knowledge a tribunal would not rely on the general <Col N="473" /> powers of privilege and compellability in the Bill before the House.

      <P>The last time this issue was raised I suggested to the Taoiseach that the Government might take the legislative route first and test its constitutionality and that a different Supreme Court might have a different view on it. The Taoiseach said on that occasion that he would consider the matter.  Has it been considered and is it feasible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my appreciation to the Deputy and Deputy McDowell who made that suggestion.  I had the matter seriously investigated. The reason we decided not to follow this route is that we were advised that under the Constitution as it stands legislation can only be proposed by the Government if it reasonably believes the legislation it is proposing is constitutional.  It would not be appropriate for the Government to propose legislation of uncertain constitutionality in the expectation that the President might refer it to the Supreme Court.  Referral by the President is something over which the Government has no control. It is an independent prerogative of the President and cannot be anticipated by the Government in any way.  Therefore, the Government took the view that any legislation proposed by it should be constitutional in its view in light of current constitutional decisions by the courts. They clearly indicate a position taken by the courts in regard to this matter and tribunals.  The Government took the view that although the proposal made by Deputies McDowell and Harney would have many merits in terms of convenience and ease of decision, it is not one we could properly follow in light of our constitutional obligations.  I advise the Deputy that this proposal which was seriously made was seriously examined.</P>

      <P>Regarding the proposal to amend the Constitution by way of a referendum on Cabinet confidentiality, the Taoiseach appears to indicate that the Government is moving towards a position where some discussion of Cabinet matters could be disclosed in tribunals validly set up.  However, all Cabinet discussions are excluded according to the provisions of a Bill before the House.  Knowledgable people have said that hopefully we will never have another tribunal like the beef tribunal given the massive expense it imposed on taxpayers, but we have seen how a committee of this House can, as it did this time last year, validly investigate circumstances.  I ask the Taoiseach and his Government colleagues not to close their minds to allowing some relaxation on Cabinet confidentiality in terms of some committees of this House which might be specially set up to investigate circumstances that might arise in the future.</P>

      <P>This Government has an intense level of contact with the <Col N="476" /> social partners.  I have met employer, farmer and trade union organisations many times, at national and local level, on both a formal and informal basis.  All of these meetings have been open and frank and we have discussed a wide range of issues of mutual interest.  I have found such contact very useful.</P>
      <P>The central review committee of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> holds regular meetings and I, and other senior Ministers, are represented at the highest possible level.  The Secretary of my Department who chairs the committee briefs me regularly on the work of the CRC.  In this way the committee's deliberations on a wide range of issues are brought to my attention and are taken by me as a constructive input into policy formulation.</P>
      <P>The concerns of the social partners as expressed through the CRC have a real impact on the day to day implementation of policy.  For example, after the previous Government had decided to reduce the participation level on the community employment programme, the CRC made strong representations to the Government on the detrimental effect this move would have on communities making great use of the programme.  This Government examined the matter and found a way to maintain the high level of participation that the programme had achieved at the end of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My interest in keeping in regular contact with the social partners has not been confined to the organisations involved in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> I addressed the National Economic and Social Forum last month, a group which includes a very wide representation of social partners.  In the near future I also intend to speak to the National Economic and Social Council a body which, under the current Government, has been expanded to include a broader range of social partners, by the inclusion for the first time of the Council for the Status of Women and the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed.  As <Col N="477" /> with the CRC I am briefed regularly on the workings of the NESC by the Secretary of my Department who is also the chairperson of the council.</P>
    <P>Communications between Government and social partners are continuous in the form of regular meetings between Ministers and individual partners.  I attend conferences, seminars and a range of other meetings organised by ICTU, IBEC and the IFA, and these together with a number of informal meetings help reaffirm, for both the social partners and me, that channels for the easy exchange of concerns and ideas remain open.</P>
    <P>I will of course continue to meet the social partners on a formal and informal basis, as the need arises.</P>

That is a matter of concern within the trade union movement.  I had a recent meeting with the trade union movement where that point about lack of partnership at company level was raised strongly.  I subsequently had a meeting with IBEC, at which I <Col N="478" /> strongly conveyed the concern of the trade union movement.</P>
      <P>I accept the need to ensure that partnership is not just at the top but applies at every level of industrial relations. How that is done in practice is best decided by individual firms and their representative trade unions in a pragmatic way.  There should be a commitment to deepening the concept of social partnership to ensure it applies at company as well as national level.</P>

I expressed concern at the fact that there was no forum through which the unemployed could participate in social policy and as a result of that pressure the Government established the National Economic and Social Forum which includes the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed.  Subsequently, when I became Taoiseach, I extended the membership of the National Economic and Social Council, a separate body, to include the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed.  The public good would not be served by adding members to the central review committee.  The arrangement whereby the wider range of social partners are represented and their concerns expressed through the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Economic and Social Council is the best one.  Industrial relations would become unduly complicated and cumbersome if <Col N="479" /> the membership of the central review committee was extended.</P>

For the same reason I, as Taoiseach, extended the representation of the National Economic and Social Council to include the unemployed.  The National Economic and Social Council has already started on the preparatory work for the next social partnership arrangement.  As members of the National Economic and Social Council, the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed is fully involved in that preparatory work.</P>

I expect to hear from the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed representative and all the other organisations represented on the National Economic and Social Council, their views on the appropriate shaping of social partnership.  I intend to do everything I can to ensure that the widest possible range of economic opinion, <Col N="480" /> including the valid and important contribution of the unemployed, is heard in the evolution of social partnership arrangements.</P>

      <P>I have paid tribute to the memory of Thomas Davis.  As the House may or may not be aware I launched the first official biography of <Col N="481" /> Thomas Davis to be published this century.</P>
      <P>I commended the author on the publication which is most important because it recalls the work of a man whose views and thinking were seminal.  His achievements were not gained by any physical actions but through the written expression of his opinions.  It is important to recognise that Thomas Davis showed the pen is mightier than the sword.</P>

      <P>It is important to recall that Thomas Davis was commemorated in the past by the House in a formal manner.  It is probably appropriate to concentrate out attention on the 150th anniversary of 1845 since Thomas Davis was extensively commemorated in 1945.  On this occasion we should concentrate, perhaps, more inclusively on all the victims of the Famine.  This is the Government's priority in its commemoration and it is concentrating its energies on the Famine and those who died as a result.</P>
      <P>Anybody who peruses the writings of Thomas Davis, as I have, will be aware that he expressed concern about the economic conditions in the country at that time which contributed to the scale of the disaster caused by the potato blight.  While it would not be correct to say the commemoration of the Famine involves the commemoration directly of Thomas Davis, it is appropriate to point out that in commemorating the Famine, and those nameless people who died during it, we are also paying a tribute indirectly to Thomas Davis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government regards the labour force survey figure as more reliable.  However, in terms of short-term trends, since the live register <Col N="483" /> figure is issued more regularly it is useful as an indicator of movement, though not necessarily of the true scale of the problem.</P>

      <Col N="485" /> As I said in the House yesterday, I believe strongly that agreement now needs to be achieved on a reasonable compromise on those issues still in the way of movement towards all-party talks through the twin track approach and within a speedy timetable.</P>
    <P>In working towards that end, I do not believe that it would be constructive to elaborate on the differing positions of the various parties on the best way forward.  As I said on a number of occasions, the point has been reached, in my view, where the process requires a joint Government impetus to advance matters.  I will, of course, provide the House with all relevant details when I judge it appropriate to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said on my return from London, there was a response of a general nature.

      <P>I am not in a position to answer that question in a definitive way.  As I said, I would like to have a meeting at which these matters can be finalised at the earliest possible date.  It would be preferable to have it before the end of this month rather than next month.  However, equally, it would be preferable to have it next month rather than the following month.  The sooner we can have it, the better but there is <Col N="486" /> no point having it until we reach agreement on the relevant points, not only in terms of the communiqué, but also in terms of answers to any supplementary questions which might legitimately be asked about it.  This all needs to be tied down before we even set a date. However, as soon as that is done, we could have the meeting itself quite quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I have answered this question in substance on four or five occasions already in the House.  If we are to have all-party talks it is <Col N="487" /> important to have all parties at them. The Irish and British Governments have a responsibility to address the concerns of all the parties at the table because, having talks at which an important segment of the community is not represented, is not consistent with the objective of the Hume-Adams declaration, which is an agreement between the communities on this island.  Unless the two communities are represented at the table, we cannot have an agreement. Therefore, any proposals I will put forward on behalf of the Irish Government will be balanced and take account of the need to meet the concerns of all the people we need at the table.  We need Sinn Féin and the SDLP but we also need the Unionist parties at the table. As I said in response to Deputy Ahern yesterday, I do not regard myself as representing any particular &ldquo;ism&rdquo;; I regard myself as representing the Irish people as a whole who, as I see it, represent all the people living on this island whether they be Unionist or Nationalist.  As part of my constitutional responsibility I must have concern for the views and fears of all the people living on this island and in that context, as the Taoiseach, I agree with my colleagues that we should bring forward proposals which are balanced and fair on that inclusive basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, the Irish Government will decide its policy on this matter and we will account to this House for it.  In deciding on our policy on this matter, we will take into account the interests and needs of all the people on this island because what we are working for in the peace process is an agreement. However, an agreement can only be reached at a table and we must have everybody at the table who will be party to the agreement for that agreement to be reached.  Anything that has the effect of setting up a situation where one part of the community is put into a corner and not represented at the table is counterproductive to the purpose of an agreement, and I am working for an agreement.  That is the essence or what the peace process is all about.</P>

I suggest to the Taoiseach it is a matter of serious concern that there is a loss of confidence in the Irish Government among Northern Nationalists and republicans, as clearly stated yesterday by Mr. Adams.

      <P>The Government had an extensive discussion on the proposals in question.  The Tánaiste met Mr. Maginnis to discuss the Hume-Adams proposals presented to us early in October.  We indicated that in one or two respects the proposals were not attainable.  We did not believe they would achieve the objective we were looking for, namely all-party talks with all the relevant people at the table.  That was a pragmatic decision which we took in light of the considerations I have just outlined.  We want an agreement and to have an agreement we must have the parties to the agreement present.  We cannot make an agreement for other people who are absent.  John Hume, as the Deputy rightly said, has sought, throughout his political career, to reach an agreement between the two communities on this island.  In many ways, he is the architect of this process.  As I said in my speech in London, he is the one who conceived the idea that what we need is an agreement between the two sections of the Irish people and not a situation where they talk past one another to a third party, namely, the British or any other government.  For that to happen we must have all the relevant people at the table.  This requires <Col N="492" /> pragmatic consideration of the interests of all.  This is not something that can be done or achieved simply by taking into account the views of one section of the community in Northern Ireland alone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first phase of the consideration of a brand image for Irish tourism was completed in the spring of this year with a presentation of initial consultancy findings to the Tourism Council, which is chaired by the Minister for Tourism and Trade.  Since then work has proceeded on an operational programme based on the brand vision. This work has been carried out, at the Minister's request, by an advisory group led by Bord Fáilte's international marketing director.</P>
      <P>The partnership forum to which the Deputy refers was organised by Bord Fáilte and held on 24 October.  The forum gave leading figures in the tourism industry the opportunity to discuss strategic issues facing Irish tourism, to hear the results of research on international consumer perspectives of Ireland and to debate further steps in the development of the brand image.  It was agreed that further such fora would be convened as thinking developed. Meanwhile, Bord Fáilte was instructed to continue, under the aegis of the advisory group referred to already, to develop brand positioning proposals and communications strategy.</P>
      <P>The second part of the Deputy's question appears to be based on certain elements of media reporting of the forum which, perhaps not surprisingly, concentrated on some of the findings of the research on international consumer perspectives of Ireland.  While that research did throw up some unexpected findings, I would not agree with the implication in the Deputy's question that previous marketing campaigns have been unsuccessful.  The reality is that Irish tourism has performed extremely well in recent years and is making a growing contribution to wealth and job creation here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not appreciate the response to my question which was a reasonable one and related not to my findings, but to the proceedings at the forum which the Minister, Deputy Kenny, attended.  Millions of pounds have been invested in seeking to establish a new tourism brand for Ireland, in many instances, without success based on the findings of analysts and others. In this regard, is it necessary to conduct another analysis?</P>
      <P>Some people do not think spontaneously of Ireland as an island nation or as a destination suitable for women and children.  They think most of us spend all our time in the pub.  I am not making a moral judgment in that respect, but is it necessary to waste time, energy and money in seeking to establish a new tourism brand for Ireland? Should we not allow Bord Fáilte, in keeping with the recommendations of the AD Little report, to continue marketing and promoting the country in which it has been very successful?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that Ireland already has a good brand image, bar a number of blips?  The tourism industry had had a successful season. Long may this continue despite our best efforts to make a mess of our brand image.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>My views are not at variance with those of the Deputy regarding the contribution of Bord Fáilte to the tourism industry, but it is the view of its new international marketing director that in the past we opted to adopt the &ldquo;bums on seats&rdquo; approach rather than engage in long-term planning.  Research findings show that if we engage in forward planning the benefits will flow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should we seek to change the brand image in which we have been investing since the 1940s and which has achieved for us some recognition?  It is my information, and that of my colleague, Deputy Killeen, that industry experts believe that the concentration on a new brand image is a <Col N="495" /> smokescreen for the failure to increase the marketing budget of Bord Fáilte and the slow pace of its restructuring.  They also believe that it will cost more than £100 million to establish a new brand.  If all Bord Fáilte's marketing budget &mdash; less than £14 million per year &mdash; was devoted to this task it would take up to eight years to establish the brand the Minister of State is seeking to achieve. This proves the point that the pursuit of a new brand is a waste of tiem, energy and money which would be better expended elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Research findings show that there are significant gaps in the image of Ireland abroad.  Bord Fáilte has engaged in this venture to address that problem.  It is of the view that far greater benefits would accrue from updating Ireland's tourism brand. I agree with the Deputy that the existing brand, in which we have invested since the 1940s, has served us well to the extent that 3.68 million people visited this country last year.  There is, however, a need to alter this image if we are to create more jobs and generate more income from this industry.</P>

      <P>In reply to previous questions on this subject on 5 October, the Minister outlined in detail the progress which had been made in the implementation of the changes recommended in the Arthur D. Little review of Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new mission statement has been <Col N="496" /> agreed for the board and a new organisational structure is being put in place. A new international marketing director with a proven track record in private industry now heads the International Marketing Division and a new general manager for Europe has been appointed.  The board has recently advertised for up to 20 marketing executives and graduates to work in the development of overseas markets.  Seventy employees approximately have left the organisation under the voluntary severance package which was agreed by the Government earlier this year.</P>
    <P>In relation to the divesting of functions by the board, a contract is currently being finalised with Tourism Quality Services Limited, who were selected following a tendering process, to undertake the registration and grading functions for tourist accommodation.  On the product approvals side a number of the key industry associations have been recognised by the board for the purpose of self-regulation.</P>
    <P>The Tidy Towns competition is now being run by the Department of the Environment and a contract has been concluded with MAC publishing for the publication of the &ldquo;Discover Ireland&rdquo; brochure series.  A steering group has been established to oversee the search for a partner for Gulliver &mdash; the electronic tourist information and reservations system developed jointly by Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the recommendations of the Arthur D. Little review of Bord Fáilte has resulted in a fundamental restructuring of the organisation in terms of its future role and relationship with the industry.  The mandate for the new board is confirmed as international marketing and the organisation will be refocusing its resources on this key task while divesting itself of other non-core functions.  As is evident from what I have said, the implementation of the change process is virtually complete.</P>
    <P>The new direction now in place for Bord Fáilte is expected to result in the <Col N="497" /> organisation having a more focused role in the promotion and development of Irish tourism, thereby helping to increase Ireland's share of the international tourism market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>My information from those who describe themselves as experts within the industry is that there is concern that the changes recommended are taking too long which, in the medium term, could damage the employment growth prospects of the tourism sector.  Is the Minister of State telling the House that the restructuring of Bord Fáilte as set out in the Arthur D. Little review is almost complete?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>In my reply I said that Bord Fáilte is at present recruiting staff, including graduates, with marketing expertise.  As a Member who is not yet the father of the House but quite close to it, I am sure Deputy Andrews is well aware that those 70 former employees of Bord Fáilte served the country well. There was a very smooth transition. Many long-term employees availed of the voluntary severance package but new blood and new skills are being introduced which I hope will be in place before long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 21 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>One of the benefits of our vibrant and expanding tourism sector over recent years has been its regional dispersal of economic benefits.  Latest available estimates from Bord Fáilte relate to 1994 and continue to show all regions benefiting from tourism growth with 54 per cent total tourism revenue being spent that year in the western, south-western, mid-western and north-western regions. No official figures are yet available on regional distribution this year.  Bord Fáilte advises that, while Dublin has benefited from continued growth in the short break holiday market, particularly from the United Kingdom, preliminary indications are that all regions are again benefiting from growth this year. Official estimates will not be available until the first half of 1996.</P>
      <P>While promotion of tourism to the regions is primarily a function of the respective regional tourism organisations, the Minister cannot accept that financial and marketing resources under the supervision of his Department have been employed to exacerbate any perceived regional imbalances in tourism growth and incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A positive feature of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1989-1993 was the extent to which it achieved a good regional spread of investment and helped to build the tourism industry across all sub-regions.  This is expected to continue under the current operational programme expenditure which is also under the overall supervision of my Department and covers the period 1994-1999.  However, ultimately the spread <Col N="499" /> will depend on the public and private sectors within each region bringing forward suitable, quality proposals for co-funding.</P>
    <P>In addition to the extensive regional and local publicity measures already undertaken, the regional authorities are kept informed on a regular basis of expenditure under the tourism operational programme in their respective areas.  This serves to keep each authority up to date on the opportunities available for the development of tourism in their region and to encourage a steady flow of applications under the programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is surprising and disappointing to note the lack of concern in the Minister's reply at the serious imbalance that has developed in tourism growth, first evident in the 1994 season and repeated in 1995.  Is it not true that in both those seasons growth in tourism in Dublin and on the east coast generally was phenomenal and that, in the 1995 season, no growth was shown to have taken place in tourism in the western region?  Surely the Minister and his Department, being responsible for the promotion and development of tourism, should analyse the reasons and seek to devise policies to redress that imbalance?  Would the Minister of State not agree that access is of primary importance in promoting tourism and that the change in access to the western region, to the benefit of the Dublin region, obviously is having its effect, with the over-flying of Shannon and the lack of direct access from Europe to western airports?  Would the Minister address this problem when replying and give some encouragement to those who have made very substantial investments, sometimes life savings, in the tourism industry on the basis of the Government's commitment to it in the west, which appears very weak at present?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will cover all regions if the Deputy will allow me.  While I appreciate his concern about the drift which he incorrectly contends is benefiting the east coast, the hotel bed occupancy figures for 1994 and the 1995 season up to August last do not corroborate with what he is saying.  For example, in Dublin, there was a 50 per cent rate of bed occupancy in the year 1994, which grew to 58 per cent this year; in the south-east the rate was 57 per cent which remained static &mdash; again contradicting what Deputy Molloy said about the predominant growth being in the east.  While I accept that Dublin has become extremely attractive for short-stay visits, the eastern region, stretching from Louth down to Wexford and Waterford, has not reaped disproportionate benefit.</P>
      <P>In the south-west region there was a bed occupancy rate of 53 per cent in 1994, with an increase of 1 per cent, to 54 per cent in 1995.  In the mid-west region the rate of bed occupany increased from 44 per cent in 1994 to 46 per cent this year.</P>

      <P>I will deal with that region if the Deputy will allow me. There was a 51 per cent bed occupancy rate in the west in 1994.  This figure, up to August last, had increased to 53 per cent.  These statistics can be proven if the Deputy cares to check them.  The north-west is the one region&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There was a 46 per cent bed occupancy rate last year which reduced at 45 per cent this year, representing a 1 per cent decrease in a region that could well do with more tourism activity.  There are reasons for that also.  Bearing in mind the ceasefires in the North, I imagine that people who would normally have crossed the Border for a short-stay holiday remained at home.  In the midland east area, somewhat different from the east coast and Dublin, there was an increase in the rate of bed occupancy from 40 per cent to 43 per cent, a complete contradiction of what Deputy Molloy contends.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State familiar with the presentation to the ITIC forum, under the heading &ldquo;Regional Dimension&rdquo;, which states that the impact of tourism growth at regional level is varied, that higher levels of growth have been experienced on the east coast and Dublin, that additional access capacity has favoured the east coast, that more access to the west of Ireland is needed and that the regional spread of tourism needs to be addressed?  It is that to which I am endeavouring to direct the Minister's attention today.  There has been a huge investment in tourism in the west in recent years, but because of inadequate access to that region it is not gaining from the current overall national growth in tourism taking place primarily in Dublin and on the east coast.</P>

      <P>As the Minister indicated in reply to supplementary questions on 5 October last, the provision of necessary infrastructure for the designated resorts is a matter for consideration in the first instance by the local authorities.  He has received representations in respect of possible infrastructural problems in one county with pilot resort areas, and has referred the matter to the Minister for the Environment for attention.</P>
      <P>The Minister and I hope developments under the scheme will not be impeded by a lack of such infrastructure and expect this matter will be kept under review by local authorities and the Minister for the Environment. Meanwhile, there continues to be a high level of investor interest in the scheme and recently the Minister published a comprehensive brouchure on the scheme which is available from the local Regional Tourism Organisation and Bord Fáilte.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take the three private notice questions together.</P>
      <P>I confirm to the House that Mr. Éamon Walsh yesterday tendered his resignation as Chairman of CIE and that the Government has accepted it with regret.</P>
      <P>I sincerely thank Mr. Walsh for his service to the company.  Éamon Walsh has steered CIE safely through a difficult period of change and transition.  In his brief term as chairman of CIE Mr. Walsh has made major advances towards fulfilling the mandate I gave him on his appointment.  These advances included: the appointment of a dynamic group chief executive together with a top management team with a range of skills and expertise in financial management, project management, marketing and human resources management; turning around the old confrontational relationship between management and front line staff which has bedevilled CIE for decades; putting value for money to the customer and the taxpayer at the heart of CIE's corporate mission; and commencing the process of preparing the CIE group for the advent of sharper competition in line with developments at EU level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Walsh, in his statement today indicated that, having put in place the main elements of my mandate to him <Col N="505" /> for the development of the CIE group, he wished to resign.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, to ensure continuity and an orderly transition at board level in CIE, I appointed Ms Tras Honan to the position of deputy chairperson of CIE.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, I have articulated a national policy on public transport more clearly and in great depth and detail than has been done for many years.  I do not propose to go over the detail of that policy here today.  Suffice to say that the main elements of my policy are: a dynamic, competitive, customer focused and commercially driven mission for the CIE group; securing the optimum return to the taxpayer and the public on the major investments in public transport now being implemented; ensuring that these investments are delivered in a timely and effective manner; restructuring the financial relationship between the Government and CIE by introducing public service contracts to replace the existing State subvention in respect of socially necessary but commercially unviable public transport services. These contracts will be multi-annual and will include performance targets for the quality and quantity of services to be provided.  Performance will be measured and the results made public.</P>
    <P>The Government will appoint a successor to Mr. Walsh as quickly as possible to take forward the implementation of this mandate and to put in place the £600 million investment programme, the largest in public transport this century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Did Mr. Walsh give the reasons for his resignation?  Did the Minister press him to stay on?  Did the Minister express lack of confidence in the board during his two hour discussion with Mr. Walsh?  Does the Minister propose to take any action on the existing board?  Does the Minister accept that during his short time in office we have had two chairmen of CIE and are now about to have a third; we have an acting chairman in the former Senator Tras <Col N="506" /> Honan to whom I offer congratulations on her appointment.</P>

      <P>Mr. Walsh did not give any specific reasons for his decision, but it is common knowledge that he felt he was not at all times receiving the full support and co-operation necessary to implement the mandate given to him by me as Minister.  It is obvious from the statements made in respect of Mr. Walsh that he was also concerned that he and his family had become the focus of media attention.  He has had a very successful career in the private sector and, to sum up his position, he can do without the hassle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that Mr. Walsh has found it necessary to resign.  Prior to my election to Dáil Éireann I was employed by Iarnród Éireann.  I am, therefore, speaking with some authority and knowledge when I say that the <Col N="507" /> 11,000 workers at management and staff level are appalled at the manner in which the company has been used as a political football in recent months.  This has had a devastating effect on the staff. Does the Minister agree that this is totally unacceptable and must be brought to an end?  In the light of recent developments will the Minister give a commitment that in making future appointments to semi-State bodies only people with experience, talent and qualifications in the relevant field of activity will be appointed as directors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the points made by the Deputy about the morale among staff in CIE.  On my appointment as Minister approximately 12 months ago my attention was immediately drawn to the serious difficulties in CIE's management structure which was totally inadequate and needed to be strengthened.  I immediately moved to strengthen the management structure and a number of key and important appointments were made.  I have studied CIE's record in regard to industrial relations which has been appalling in recent years.  That issue was addressed by way of the new appointments made. The CIE board had a lengthy meeting this morning.  I have not yet received a report of the meeting and I intend to meet with the deputy chairman within the next half hour to get a report of the outcome.</P>
      <P>I agree with the points made by the Deputy about the calibre of people appointed to State boards. In this context I would draw the attention of Deputies to the corporate governance section of the task force report which states that the chairpersons and directors of commercial State companies should be appointed solely on the basis of their experience, competence and expertise.  I hold that view very strongly and have implemented it in appointments to semi-State bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my <Col N="508" /> party I wish to express regret at the decision of Eamon Walsh to resign.  It is difficult to find people of his calibre and we genuinely regret his decision to leave office.  We wish him well, as we did when he agreed to take up that post.  Is the Minister aware that all the directors of the board of CIE consistently expressed and gave their support to Mr. Walsh during the past four-five months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the Deputy has asked that question.  I would expect all members of State boards to fulfil their obligations and responsibilities, irrespective of their political persuasion or who appointed them.  It is common knowledge that that was not always the case in regard to Mr. Walsh. If the Deputy is saying that some people had a change of heart when they recognised his ability and competence I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that this sorry episode will have the effect of deterring decent men and women with the necessary ability and professional acumen from taking up positions on semi-State boards?  I do not think anyone would want to endure five-six months of the kind of carry-on we have had since the middle of summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that we will find it difficult to attract people with the necessary calibre to fulfil these functions on behalf of the State.  It is important for us to recognise this. Unfortunately in Mr. Walsh's case this was not recognised in time.  The Deputy said that the carry-on began in the middle of the summer.  Mr. Walsh clearly outlined his reasons for resigning.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly support Minister Lowry's policies to effect a change in public transport in Ireland.  I support unreservedly the Minister's vision for CIE and the State sector in general and notably his commitment to put an emphasis on the customer and value <Col N="509" /> for money for the taxpayer.  Any suggestion that the Horgan's Quay issue was relevant in my decision to resign is simply wrong.</P>
    <P>He went on to say that during his tenure of office he achieved considerable progress in managing change and recognised that he achieved this with the co-operation of the management, staff and trade unions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an accurate reflection of what he achieved during his short tenure as chairman of the CIE group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Deputies in expressing my regret at Mr. Walsh's decision to resign.  On the morning after the Government made the appointment I welcomed it as Mr. Walsh is a man of substance and the kind of person we need in State companies.  Does the Minister agree that the focus of the CIE board in recent times has been a political rather than a commercial or strategic one?  Will he further agree that it would be in the interest of CIE and the public if the entire board of CIE was replaced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of public record that at times the discussions and attitude of the board became over-politicised.  The fact that five members of the board found it necessary at one stage to have a secret meeting and later issued an invitation to a journalist to express their views in public was extremely unhelpful and is something I would not like to see arise again.  As I have clearly stated, I gave a preliminary report to the Cabinet meeting this morning and within the next half hour or hour I intend to have discussions with the deputy chairperson of CIE with a view to ascertaining the outcome of today's board meeting.  This evening I intend to have discussions with a potential candidate to replace Mr. Walsh as chairman of the group and to report further to Cabinet.  After I have reviewed the matter I will discuss it with <Col N="510" /> my Cabinet colleagues and when we have made a decision I will communicate it publicly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>While acknowledging that change in CIE in inevitable, does the Minister agree that the company and staff have performed very well since the restructuring of the company in 1987, particularly given the lack of resources and direction by successive Governments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that significant progress has been made and I am pleased to acknowledge that there has been a general improvement in the approach and attitude of all those working in CIE.  There is now a high level of co-operation between the management, workers and trade unions.  The Government has been genuinely concerned for some time about the impact on the work force.  We have set out a clear strategic vision for the company based on customer needs and the provision of value for money for the taxpayer.  The new management team has already demonstrated its intent to replace the old adversarial approach to industrial relations with one based on a shared consensus approach to solving the problems at CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to point out that the largest investment programme in public transport in the history of the State will take place between 1994-99.  This investment, which amounts to more than £600 million, clearly demonstrates the Government's commitment to CIE and indicates the need to ensure that we have a strong and responsible management team in place.  One of the first mandates I gave the executive chairman of the company was to make the necessary arrangements to appoint a chief executive officer and a new management team.  Mr. Ray Byrne was appointed head of programmes and projects; Tony Bergin was appointed head of human resources; Jim Cullen was appointed chief financial officer and Eddie Lane was appointed head of marketing.  The chief executive and the four <Col N="511" /> function heads bring together the range of skills needed to lead the company through a difficult transition to a more commercial and competitive era.</P>
    <P>I wish to illustrate the level of progress made and the seriousness with which these people take their task.  Mr. Byrne has had extensive experience in the Departments of Finance and Transport in dealing with a wide range of commercial State bodies.  He has had particular experience of large project management and is heavily involved in the Dublin light rail and national mainline rail investment programme.  He brings a level of knowledge and expertise which significantly complements the skills available in the CIE group.  Mr. Bergin will inject &mdash; and this is his job &mdash; current private sector industrial relations practices into the group which has suffered in the past from an inward looking old-fashioned confrontational approach in this area.  Already we have seen considerable progress in this area. Mr. Cullen, the chief financial officer, has extensive experience in financial management and control and has a specific mandate to address the issue of cost reduction and cost efficiency throughout the group.  Mr. Lane, who has worked in CIE's advertising arm has been promoted to head of marketing and sales with the remit to improve marketing of CIE services and to maximise revenue arising from ancillary activities such as advertising.  There have been significant improvements in this area with advertising profits set to increase by more than 50 per cent in the next few years.  In the past, marketing was seriously neglected in CIE and Mr. Lane's appointment has already redressed this neglect.</P>

      <P>The low morale predated my appointment as Minister.  I have referred to the appalling and unacceptable practices that operated at CIE, the lack of efficient management at CIE which percolated to the workforce who were very conscious of the lack of leadership of that group.  Over recent weeks Members opposite have chosen to ignore that.  Deputy Sean Ryan was quite right when he addressed the issue of morale but I am sure the Deputy is well able to speak for himself and that Deputy O'Donoghue interpreted him correctly.  I have had private discussions with Deputy Sean Ryan and he is very conscious that great progress has been made and that has been acknowledged throughout the group from management down to the workforce who are very happy with the sense of direction and the leadership they are getting.  They are very happy also with the level of communication that exists between management and members of the group.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Sean Ryan the Minister said that since 1987 there had been a considerable improvement on matters within CIE which I was very glad to hear because it appears to contradict the Minister's earlier statement.  The Minister said that since 1987 there has been a considerable improvement in the operational strength and activities of CIE.  The Minister said that Members should speak for themselves, but I take from what he said that he will be considering the membership of the board.  Will the Minister confirm that he will continue to have worker directors on the board <Col N="513" /> of CIE?  I had thought that Deputy Sean Ryan would raise that point.</P>

At the appropriate time I will announce my intentions together with the Government's intentions in respect of the replacement of Mr. Walsh.  I confirm that significant progress has been made and that the progress is down mainly to the fact that in less than 12 months, we have appointed four new members to the management team, in addition to a new chief executive.  Under their leadership significant progress has been made.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister contributed to the instability within CIE and to the low morale of staff?  In particular may I pinpoint the meeting of 19 October when the board of CIE ratified for the second time the sale of Horgan's Quay site as being in the best interests of CIE.  Given the further castigation of that sale &mdash; the Minister indicated clearly his lack of confidence in the decision taken by CIE &mdash; the position of the chairman was untenable as a result of his action.</P>

I wish to quote one line from the statement issued by the chairman of CIE, which is a direct rebuttal of the imputation that the Deputy is trying to draw:</P>
      <P>Any suggestion that the Horgan's Quay issue was relevant in my decision to resign is simply wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask Members to accept the word of the outgoing chairman in that regard.  The Deputies consistently attempt to justify the decision in regard to Horgan's Quay.  I have placed on record the facts and the details in regard to the Horgan's Quay site.  I said and I will say it again, it was a shameful and disgraceful sale of <Col N="514" /> a public asset which is totally unacceptable.  It is obviously acceptable to Fianna Fáil but it is not acceptable to me or to the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the legislation.  This is probably the last piece of the environmental legislation jigsaw started in the 1986-87 period.  At various stages since we have dealt with air and water pollution.  We set up the Environment Protection Agency in 1992 and the Waste Bill is currently before the House.  This legislation must be considered in the context of a wider programme of environmental protection that underlines the increasing importance with which the environment is treated, not only here but in the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this is the first opportunity I have had to do so, I offer belated congratulations to the Minister of State on his <Col N="570" /> appointment.  As I believe in giving credit where it is due, I compliment him on his actions in the past six or nine months.  He has done great work in his Ministry.</P>
    <P>The Bill will give effect to the OSPAR Convention.  I am pleased restrictions on dumping will extend out 200 and in some cases 350 miles from baselines.  While I have grave doubts about our effectiveness in controlling dumping at sea, I am sure all Members are pleased that in theory at least we will have control over such dumping. Most people nowadays welcome environmentally friendly measures. While I am not being critical of the Minister, I wonder who we are fooling about the alleged control we will have over the 200 or 350 mile limits.</P>
    <P>The Bill will be meaningless unless its provisions can be enforced, a point made by Deputies from all sides.  Have we the means to implement its provisions?  I do not believe we have.  By and large, it will fall to the Naval Service to implement them.  During my time as Minister of State at the Department of Defence I had the privilege to work with that excellent organisation.  It is a progressive and forward looking organisation that is open to change and innovation and I have no doubt that given the necessary resources it would adopt the correct approach to implementing this legislation.  However, it is not capable of taking on this responsibility without greater commitment from the Government.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service has been successful in carrying out the two main functions assigned to it under assistance to the civil powers.  It has proved successful on numerous occasions in carrying out its onerous and difficult fishery protection duties.  It has also proved successful in making a number of illegal drugs seizures as well as in controlling Irish waters to prevent the importation of such drugs.  However, it lacks personnel and operational vessels.  I have been told that two of its vessels are out of commission at any given time.  From my information, only three are operational <Col N="571" /> at any given time and four are not operational due to lack of manpower or the necessity to carry out repair works.</P>
    <P>If the provisions of the legislation are to be properly enforced the Government must be more committed to the Naval Service, but the indications so far are not good.  The Government appears to have shelved plans for expansion of the fleet as well as the recruitment commitment given this time last year by the outgoing Fianna Fáil minority administration.  More than any branch of the armed forces, the Naval Service requires additional recruits each year. Due to the nature of the work involved there is a higher drop-out rate among personnel in that service than in any other branch of the armed forces.  An ongoing recruitment programme should be implemented.</P>
    <P>The Bill will give legislative effect to an international convention.  Dumping at sea is an international problem and must be tackled on that basis.  In so far as the Bill indicates our role in that international effort, it is welcome. However, while EU directives are implemented and conventions signed, national interests overrule international ones in the case of many environmental issues.  Sellafield is proof of that.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not deal with the dumping of weapons by the British Government in Irish waters in the past.  Successive British Governments have used Irish waters as a dumping ground for chemical weapons.  The British Ministry for Defence has admitted dumping potentially lethal nerve gas off the coast of Donegal in three ships in the late 1950s. These vessels contained 6,000 tonnes of gas packed aircraft bombs and approximately 3,500 tonnes of 21 lb artillery shells which contain nerve gas.  Further records indicate that 145,000 tonnes of chemical weapons were dumped off the Irish and British coasts since World War II in addition to 25,000 tonnes of chemical weapons and 71,000 bombs located in the Beaufort Dyke dump off the coast of Antrim.</P>
    <P>Three other dumps are located in the <Col N="572" /> western approaches off the south coast of Ireland and areas west of the Hebrides in Scotland and 80 miles off the north coast of Ireland.  The British Government has bequeathed a chemical time bomb to future Irish generations.  I am not happy with its assurances that everything is all right particularly since, in one case, the Ministry indicated it has lost its records of where this potential lethal cargo is dumped.  The British Government has failed to indicate that it will do anything to locate the records or check the safety of the dumps.  There should be an immediate scientific investigation into the dumps to ascertain their level of safety.  If they are found to be unsafe it is vital to retrieve the weapons.  I accept that in some cases it is better to leave them where they are but if there is a doubt about it they should be moved and stored in their country of origin.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher raised this matter in the European Parliament and was told it could be raised with the Commission by either the Irish or British Governments.  The Minister should indicate if the matter has been raised and, if so, the response he received.</P>
    <P>A fine of £1,500 will not frighten anyone.  Why is the amount so small when one considers the damage that could be caused?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Dempsey for giving me an opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I have raised a number of issues relating to the maritime environment, particularly in regard to Sellafield.  It has often been said that the Irish Sea is the most polluted sea in the world.  Quite apart from the nuclear installations on the west coast of Britain, numerous cities and towns discharge untreated sewage into the sea. We endeavoured to address this in Government by bringing forward a major plan, with EU funding, under which the towns and cities on the east coast, including Dundalk and Drogheda, will have sewage treatment plants.  I hope the Government continues apace with that programme so <Col N="573" /> that by the year 2000 we will not pollute the Irish Sea through sewage disposal.</P>
      <P>I concur with the sentiments expressed by previous speakers on munitions dumping.  It is another example of the cavalier way in which the British Government tends to treat this nation in matters to do with Sellafield and dumping munitions.</P>
      <P>The transport of nuclear fuel is an issue close to my heart and I welcome the Minister's efforts in that regard.  I am not sure if he will be successful in view of an incident I raised in the House previously.  It relates to the transport of spent nuclear fuel from Dounreay to Sellafield one weekend, when weather conditions on the Irish Sea were horrendous, without the knowledge or consent of the State agencies.  The ship left Dounreay under the cover of darkness with a flask of plutonium for reprocessing at Sellafield Thorp.  I contacted the Department of Foreign Affairs over the weekend and that Department contacted the Department of the Marine. No apparent notice had been given to the authorities on this side of the Irish Sea.</P>
      <P>I travelled to Sellafield with a number of Deputies and know the slick PR engaged in by their personnel.  They say that if one of the flasks is dropped from an aeroplane it will not crack and that the ships cannot sink and are destruction proof.  That is what was said about the <i>Titanic.</i> No one can say that about any ship.  Our State agencies, particularly RPII, should be notified of such shipments.  On that occasion the British Authorities stated they had informed the coastguard but they did not see fit to tell us.  The Minister addressed this in the recent past and, in renewing his efforts in this regard, he will have the support of all sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note the setting up of the interdepartmental committee but when it comes to action taken by the committee the silence is deafening.  Will the Minister indicate what the committee has achieved?  As I am from the same country as the four litigants who succeeded in overcoming the first hurdle in their <Col N="574" /> test case against BNFL, I am interested to know what action the committee proposes to take.  Will it join in the action taken by the four litigants?</P>
    <P>I very much support&mdash;as I did when we were in Government&mdash;the efforts they made.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate that the Attorney General, under the new powers of that office, will come before a committee of the House &mdash;he attended a committee yesterday but perhaps that is not the appropriate forum to deal with that matter&mdash;to appraise us of the possibility of the Government taking up this case.  The longer it goes on, the more difficult it will be for the people involved, particularly in terms of finances.  I exhort the Minister to take on board the case taken by the four litigants from County Louth on behalf the the Irish people and to see it out to the bitter end.  When Deputy Cowen was Minister for Transport Engery and Communications I said he should call BNFL's bluff and take an action against it.  International pressure in that regard would be very significant.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that ratification of this Convention will present the possibility of initating arbitration between Ireland and the UK relating to increased discharges from Sellafield since the start of the THORP operation. Any pressure put on the British Government in that respect is welcome. Very often we encounter the age old problem that the British establishment will not allow an inspectorate into Sellafield.  The whole operation takes place under a cloud of secrecy, as was evidenced by lack of notification of incidents in recent years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I accept that certain anomalies exist.  I agree with Deputy Dempsey that the proposed fine for dumping at sea is minuscule.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate that amendments will be accepted from this side of the House on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gilmore, for his foresight in bringing forward this Bill which is long <Col N="575" /> overdue.  It is of paramount importance that we develop a strategy to protect our marine resource and environment which will have a major impact on the future of all citizens.  The Bill will enable us to ratify the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North Atlantic Ocean.  It will give the Government control over dumping up to a 200 mile limit &mdash; the present limit is 12 miles &mdash; and in some areas up to 350 miles off the Irish coast depending on the extent of the continental shelf.</P>
      <P>When I became a Member of this House in 1981 I drew to the attention of the Government the necessity to curb indiscriminate dumping off our south-west coast, but I got little satisfaction on that occasion.  This problem has existed for the last two, if not three decades, with the Atlantic Ocean used as a dumping ground by the industrial magnates of Europe, particularly Great Britain.  Hundreds of thousands of tonnes of contaminated material are dumped annually in the seas off our shores, and it is relatively easy to charter ships for that purpose.  I am pleased to note that strict regulations will now apply to the types of substance that may be dumped at sea.  The legislation will ban the dumping of radioactive waste and toxic, harmful, noxious substances. However, unless the Government provides enforcement powers and tougher penalties, the protection provided for will be null and void and the culprits will not be debarred from destroying our seas and oceans.</P>
      <P>As one of the maritime nations in the EU and the only island nation, given that Great Britain is joined to mainland Europe by the Channel Tunnel, it is of paramount importance that Ireland plays its rightful role in ensuring the protection of our seas and oceans.  We must make sure the world's extensive and complex marine resource is left for future generations in a sound, healthy state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that irregularities have occurred down the years.  The lack of international interest in preventing <Col N="576" /> people damaging vital elements of life is amazing.  No country, particularly a coastal state can turn a blind eye to the stewardship of our oceans and seas.  If we do so it could threaten the existence of future generations.  It is evident that work begun is half done.  The Minister, who is a busy man and whose task is an onerous one, must be congratulated on bringing forward this legislation.  Let us hope it succeeds in curbing the indiscriminate dumping in our seas and oceans that has occurred for the last three decades.  More than two-thirds of this planet is comprised of oceans, seas and rivers.  It is vitally important that constant vigilance in this matter is maintained throughout the world.  Immediate protective measures are necessary if we are to maintain the paramount important tag of clear, cool and clean waters.  We must strive also to educate our people to understand the importance of the marine environment and the impact of man's activities on its condition.  Turning a blind eye to events that have caused damage may cause irreversible damage in the future.  It is evident that the waters and resources of our seas and oceans are fragile, complex and only partly understood.</P>
    <P>Ireland, by its geographical position as an island in the North Atlantic Ocean, is particularly vulnerable to the effects of marine casualties such as oil spills and wilful disposals of waste in the North Atlantic Ocean.  It is evident that for the past three decades or more the Fastnet Lighthouse and Mizen Head area, approximately 150 miles off the south west coast, have been used as a dumping ground for radioactive waste and other toxic and harmful deposits, despite numerous protests from our Government.  Such indiscriminate dumping is still being carried out by other European nations.</P>
    <P>We are part and parcel of the European Union and let nobody cod themselves that responsibility for the maintenance of the quality of the water in the North Atlantic Ocean is and should be as much a concern to other European states, including Germany, France, <Col N="577" /> Luxembourg, Belgium, Holland, Denmark and Austria, They can all play their part to ensure that the condition of the waters in the Atlantic Ocean will be of paramount importance in planning for future generations.</P>
    <P>The action of indiscriminate dumping 150 miles off the coastline of south west Cork must stop immediately if we are to prevent the Atlantic Ocean and the seas adjacent to our coastline being polluted by obnoxious substances.  It is vital that this island, as a nation, should be in a position to monitor the busy shipping lanes off our coast and to ensure that no disposal of waste will be permitted in that area.  We must strive to protect our coastline and seas from misuse and abuse.</P>
    <P>It is vital for the survival of future generations that rigorous laws should be implemented to guarantee the protection of our marine environment and to implement effective policy which will require the provision of naval protection at its maximum strength.  It is not satisfactory for this or any other Minister to put legislation before the House if we are not in a position to enact it and to carry it out to the letter of the law.</P>
    <P>Previous Governments have sat idly by, allowed such dumping and have not planned for the future.  This Government cannot strike a rock and produce a miracle.  However, I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the Naval Service is used to its fullest strength to stamp out the threat of dumping around our coastline.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, we are close to major shipping lanes and some of the ships which cross them may be carrying radioactive products.  If there were a shipping disaster it could affect the maritime environment for centuries to come.</P>
    <P>Ireland, as a member of the OSPAR Convention, should advocate that the tankers which operate in our shipping lanes should have a certificate of seaworthiness.  I do not want to see a repetition of the <i>Betelgeuse</i> disaster off Whiddy Island in Bantry Bay more than 15 years ago.  That tanker which was in <Col N="578" /> a dilapidated condition was allowed to enter the waters around Whiddy Island and deposit its cargo of oil when it was refused entry to several other ports in Europe.  That disaster created havoc in my constitutency of south west Cork and many lives were lost as a result of that incompetence.  Such disasters which cause grave distress should be prevented.  Old tankers damaged by storms should not pose a threat in waters off our shoreline.</P>
    <P>We have had other serious marine threats from ships such as the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> which was allowed to drift for days off our south west shoreline and finally hit the graveyard of the seas off Stags Rock in south west Cork.  Fortunately for that area that vessel's cargo caused only minor environmental damage to the seas around that coastline.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate if Ireland is a member of the International Laws of the Seas Convention and, if not, when it will become a member?</P>
    <P>I note from the Minister's address that the Merchant Shipping Salvage and Wreck Act, 1993, gave effect to the International Convention of Salvage, 1989.  It made an important further contribution to the procedures for dealing with maritime casualties.  An orderly system for handling the three main phases of a casualty at sea was introduced, namely, vessels in distress, salvage operations and, where necessary, the removal or rendering harmless of wrecks.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that this Bill will strengthen the role of the Department of the Marine's emergency service and its marine survey office.  If that is the case why has the <i>Bardini Reefer</i> been allowed to lie at the entrance to Castletownbere harbour for the past decade or more with no effort being made by any Minister for the Marine to remove it?  It is interfering with the navigational process at the entrance to and exit from that important fishery harbour.  A local contractor is willing to give the Minister a quotation for the removal of the wreck of the <i>Bardini Reefer</i> which has <Col N="579" /> foundered in the waters of Bere Haven Sound at the entrance to Castletownbere harbour.  It would scarcely cost £50,000 to remove this wreck yet successive appeals by me in this House have fallen on deaf ears and no money has been allocated for its removal.</P>
    <P>With the advent of the tall ships to Bantry Bay in 1996 and the designation of Castletownbere harbour as the main port to entertain those tall ships in 1996 surely it is not too much to ask the Minister to ensure that an allocation is provided for the removal of this wreck which has caused so much annoyance to the boats and skippers entering and leaving Castletownbere.  There are other wrecks in that area lying off our coastline.  One of the most well known incidents in south west Cork is the night the ex-Taoiseach's boat struck the rock at Mizen Head.  Thanks to the crew and the skipper of the local lifeboat all were saved although the incident added a certain amount of pollution to the seas in that area for a short period.  The area is now very popular among people who call to the Mizen vision signal station, all of whom ask the exact location of the incident involving Mr. Charles Haughey.  It is the most popular seaside view in that area.  Be that as it may we have other derelict wrecks lying off our shoreline that need to be removed immediately.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the Irish Sea is monitored for radioactive content to the fullest extent?  Is he satisfied that there is not an over radioactive content in the Irish Sea by virtue of Sellafield? I have been told by people that the radioactive content in that sea is much higher than in any other part of the world.  If that is the case, no matter what answer Great Britain has for maintaining Sellafield we must ensure that the Irish and Celtic Seas are kept free of radioactive content.</P>
    <P>What steps will the Minister take to monitor the movement of ships from the Far East laden with radioactive and nuclear waste <i>en route</i> to Great Britain through the Celtic and Irish Seas to <Col N="580" /> ensure they are kept clear of Irish territorial waters?  I compliment the Minister on the introduction of this legislation.  If the legislation is not implemented it will have no effect on maintaining clear, cool waters in the North Atlantic Ocean.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím roimh an mBille seo.  Is léir ón méid atá ráite ag daoine eile agus ón méid a bhí le rá ag an Aire inné go bhfuil gá leis, cé go bhfuil cuid mhaith Achtanna againn a bhfuil baint acu le cúrsaí na farraige.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil gá le Bille mór amháin chun cuid de na hAchtanna seo a chur le chéile.  Ach tuigim go mbeadh se thar a bheith deacair é sin a dhéanamh os rud é go bhfuil an oiread sin ann.</P>
      <P>It is widely accepted that legislation is required in this area and speakers on all sides have welcomed the legislation.  It is advisable that its passage through the Oireachtas would enable Members in both Houses, particularly on Committee Stage, to have an input.  It is clear from what the Minister said in regard to the list of legislation and conventions that there is a need for considerable consolidation of maritime law.  In this context the Refugee Bill comes to mind.  When the Oireachtas has an opportunity to consider matters at length and to bring to bear the various views put forward, legislation can be improved.  It is particularly important in this area because our geographic location makes us extremely vulnerable to what happens in the sea. We have a long coastline and the onshore prevailing winds hit the west coast daily.  We also have busy shipping lanes.  Unfortunately, because of our size we fear we are not influential in world terms but we need to establish our own standards and to seek to have them implemented internationally for our own benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the fact that 70 per cent of <Col N="581" /> the earth's surface is covered in oceans and water we do not have a particularly deep knowledge of exactly what goes on there and the effects of man's intervention.  We have reason to be concerned about many of the activities mentioned by other speakers.  It is significent even though Ireland and Britain became parties to the London and Olso conventions.  The Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, led to Ireland implementing those conventions but they do not appear to have had a particularly great impact.</P>
    <P>The British, who are also party to both conventions, excel in ignoring what was agreed in the conventions.  It is clear that they were dumping dangerous substances off our coast at least ten to 15 years following their accession to the conventions.  I welcome the fact that there will be a review of the London Convention.  In many ways that is more important than what is contained in the Bill.  How the Government will manage to do its business, in the conduct of that review, may well be much more important than what happens here.</P>
    <P>If we are unable to deal with dumping by the British and others in Irish waters and in waters which give rise to concern and danger on the Irish coast we need some other body to which to appeal and which would have an input in relation to these matters, whether the EU or some other body.  There is a perceived weakness in relation to implementation of many of these conventions which have already been agreed.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that Ireland is also party to the Intervention on the High Seas Convention in case of Oil Pollution Casualties, 1969, and its 1973 Protocol on intervention in cases of pollution by substances other than oil.  The Sea Pollution Act, 1991, gives effect to this convention.  Apparently the Minister already has power to intervene in cases where pollution danger arises even outside territorial waters where a ship is in danger.  He is allowed to intervene and give instructions to the ship's master. How effective are these powers?  Have they been used effectively in the past? Given all the conventions, Protocols <Col N="582" /> and Acts, it is a wonder there has been sea pollution of any type over a long period.  One would be forgiven for being surprised the Bill is required.</P>
    <P>It is a worry that many of the provisions and regulations already implemented and the other measures included in the Bill will be ignored with impunity.  For example, the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability) Compensation Act, 1988, the 1969 convention from which it arises and several Protocols could not be&mdash; and were not &mdash;invoked when a series of oil slicks washed up on the west coast in 1991 and 1992.  As a result of what happened on that occasion, Clare County Council, among others on the west coast, had to undertake an expensive clean-up operation.  Deputies who are members of a local authority are aware that the financial position of most councils does not allow them to expend huge sums on controlling maritime pollution.</P>
    <P>One of the most frustrating aspects from Clare County Council's point of view, and this would be shared by any local authority, was that the Departments of the Marine, the Environment and others, which may have been called on for help, were reluctant to accept responsibility.  Clare County Council initially picked up the tab for that specific episode, which included a series of incidents.  After a frustrating series of meetings and negotiations, it finally received approximately 50 per cent of the cost jointly from the Departments of the Marine and the Environment.</P>
    <P>It may be more appropriate to other legislation but it is a pity a clear delineation between the different agencies, Departments and local authorities is not laid down in the Bill regarding responsibility, particularly in terms of the cost of clean-ups.  I understand there was strong evidence on that occasion that the damage occurred because a crude oil carrier, which was passing approximately 150 miles off the coast, took the opportunity to wash out its holds.  Unfortunately, the relatively large slicks floating on the ocean hit the west coast and caused an enormous amount of environmental <Col N="583" /> damage.  Given some of the provisions that were in place and others outlined by the Minister, it should have been possible to go after those people and hold them responsible.  However, this was not done.</P>
    <P>In 1992, a ship ran aground in Ballyvaughan bay.  This also involved a substantial clean-up operation, which was overseen by the Department of the Marine.  Clare County Council had to bear a substantial element of the expense and despite some insurance provision, it was still liable for quite an amount of the costs of the clean-up operation on that occasion.  To the best of my recollection, the Department of the Marine paid only approximately £24,000 in June 1994 and was effectively handing on the insurance money it received arising from the incident.</P>
    <P>We must face the fact that there is a considerable weakness in how we deal with the cost of clean-up operations.  We must realise that such operations are costly and responsibility should not be left almost entirely to the local authority.  I ask the Minister to address this point either during the debate or at some date in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>As a result of those incidents, it emerged that the charts of Irish territorial and on-shore waters are not up to date.  In some cases, I understand the charts are inaccurate and have contributed to some of the difficulties and accidents.  If an owner or master of a ship is seeking refuge from a storm and the charts he is using in difficult weather conditions are inaccurate, it is difficult to expect him to berth his ship safely.  It seems daft that the Oireachtas is considering legislation of this type while ignoring a real danger and cause of onshore pollution.  Appropriate action to address that problem is not being taken and it would not be difficult or expensive to do so.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement that plans are in train for accession to the 1990 Oil Pollution Preparedness Response and Co-operation Convention.  Ireland has not adequately <Col N="584" /> addressed the need to have the capability to deal with pollution in our waters.  As many speakers said, we are on the front line of western Europe and given the law of averages, it is likely we will be involved in some relatively serious pollution cases.</P>
    <P>While we have some capability, we do not have anything approaching an adequate amount of equipment.  The Department, the harbour authorities and private operators in the marine area must, if they have not done so already, prepare a response document and, perhaps more importantly, put in place hardware and equipment for use when required.  The Shannon estuary may be a suitable area to place such an emergency response team, if that is what is required.  We should stress that the provision of this equipment should attract European and perhaps international aid on the basis of some of the conventions.</P>
    <P>Many speakers referred to the <i>Brent Spar</i> oil rig incident.  It is encouraging and in a sense educational that the power of public opinion was mobilised so effectively in such a short time to ensure Shell did not go ahead with its plans to dump the rig in the ocean.  I am slightly worried about the apparent subsequent findings that some of the materials alleged to have been on the <i>Brent Spar</i> were not on it.  It would be a great pity if an inaccuracy in what turned out to be a minor matter encouraged public opinion to be less vigilant in environmental terms when alarm bells sound in the future.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the fashion for environmental awareness about relatively large issues far away does not seem to be practised by many people in their areas.  The amount of litter on some of our streets and the level of dumping, not just in remote places but sometimes at major beauty spots, is indicative of a lack of regard for the environment.  This is most worrying and little effort is being made with regard to dumping at sea and dumping generally. There is little awareness of the need to reduce the amount of waste to ensure dumping becomes less of a problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> Many speakers referred to the huge munitions dump at Beaufort Dyke, which is close to the north east coast.  I understand the British authorities have admitted dumping approximately one million tonnes of munitions and other materials there, mainly in crates.  This is most worrying and people may feel the concern is confined to coasts closest to the dump sites.  However, there is deep concern throughout the country about the type of dumping in that area and off the County Donegal coast.  There is also concern that so little information has been made available and that it has been minimal and misleading.</P>
    <P>There is concern also that more dumping has taken place unknown to us.  The British Government, and other governments which might be involved, have a moral responsibility to make safe the materials they have dumped.  They have an initial responsibility to determine the state of these materials, whether they are dangerous, the length of time they can remain where they are and the action required to deal with them.  The Minister referred to joint responsibility with the UK in the preparation of a report on the Irish Sea, and the coasts of Ireland and Scotland.  That is important but, apart from a consultative role, I hope the Irish involvement will be sufficiently strong that we will be satisfied the level of information required is made available.  The opportunity should not be lost whatever the cost to find out exactly what materials are there, the condition they are in and how we can deal with them effectively, as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I understand the opportunity is being taken to initiate arbitration between Ireland and Britain in relation to THORP and that is to be welcomed. People living on the east coast are extremely concerned, and rightly so, but people in other parts of the country cannot afford to relax and take matters for granted.  Living a further 100 miles to the west does not guarantee safety.  We must be seen to campaign nationally to ensure that whatever action is required on THORP is taken.  Successive <Col N="586" /> Governments encountered difficulties in attempting to put this matter on the agenda; perhaps political considerations came into play.  We must take the initiative on this matter and I hope we will in co-operation with the British Government.</P>
    <P>The transportation of nuclear materials on the Irish Sea and other waters around the country is a matter of grave public concern.  I understand the Department of the Marine has set up a a licence vetting committee.  It will have an important job to ensure that the people can be confident that that job is being done properly and that there will not be any need for concern.  However, in view of our experience with some other countries, provision should be made for observer status on the vetting committees of other countries even if we had to allow them the same right. Openness is not a quality that has been applied to dumping at sea and it is difficult to believe there has been an instant conversion.  We must continue to be as vigilant as we have been in the past, if not more so.</P>
    <P>Great concern has been expressed about enforcement and people wonder if these international conventions are being taken seriously.  I understand the June meeting of OSPAR, for example, agreed by a majority to include in the provisions of the convention all vessels including those for which an indemnity had been sought.  Perhaps the Minister, when replying, would indicate whether that agreement applies to the majority or to all those who are signatories to the OSPAR Convention.  The Government has decided in the Bill not to exclude vessels and aircraft which would previously have been excluded under that provision.  If it has been decided only by the Irish Government and not by the other governments, it will clearly have much less effect and, therefore, will be of less benefit.  If this provision is not recognised by other countries it is important that in future meetings of OSPAR the Government continues to press for its inclusion.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I hope the <Col N="587" /> opportunity will be taken to strengthen it in some key areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  It is important legislation to protect the environment and extend the protection afforded to our marine environment in particular.  I would not speak on this environmental issue without recalling what happened this week to a Nigerian man, Ken Saro-Wiwa, the internationally known playwright, fighter for democracy, activist and environmentalist, who was murdered by hanging last Friday along with eight fellow activists by a Nigerian dictatorship too fearful to give him a fair trial and too vicious to hear the pleas for clemency from an outraged world.</P>
      <P>This man's life was taken because he stayed in Nigeria to fight the cause of his people and their homeland.  I mention that in the context of this Bill because he fought against the environmental damage oil production had caused to his country, particularly to his people.  This fight made him an even greater threat to the dictatorship in Nigeria.  He was a danger because he complicated matters for the Government and for an international company seeking to make money within that country. His fight was about the struggle for democracy in Nigeria but it was also an environmental fight about the effects of the environmental rape of a country and its vulnerable people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Ken Saro-Wiwa had to say about oil and the rights of tribal people may seem far removed but it is relevant to what we are discussing today.  There are real conflicts involved in protecting the environment.  The rush of international companies to make money, whether by transporting materials across the seas or developing oil, is strong.  They are the new decision makers.  This battle has been raging for quite some time and we must not forget that. Underlying this legislation, on which I congratulate the Minister, these tensions continue to be felt and they are <Col N="588" /> part of the struggle to save the environment.</P>
    <P>In a country like Ireland, with high rates of unemployment decisions will always have to be taken to balance the environment and the economy.  We must continue to have debates on these issues and we must not create a climate in which people are afraid to express their concerns about the environment. Those concerns are often less tangible than the arguments for economic growth.  It is difficult to care for the environment our rivers, waterways, canals and the quality of our air when we are concerned about creating jobs. That has been evident in recent discussions but it is important that we have those discussions and ensure there is a fair balance.  Ken Saro-Wiwa's sacrifice will only mean something if we keep it alive in our memories and if a strong message comes across about the environment and also his work for democracy.</P>
    <P>The Dumping at Sea Bill is concerned with the healthy management of the marine resource and the protection of our environment, seas and oceans.  The carelessness with which we treated our seas in the past is extraordinary.  Despite international Conventions it is extraordinary also that the Minister has to go to an assembly to fight for an agreement between the UK and Irish Government on the proper management of ships carrying nuclear waste and how nuclear waste from Sellafield and THORP will be handled.  The Minister is now getting support from other countries and it is agreed that the INF code on fuel will be extended because of his work.  Is it not extraordinary that this is only now being done when so much concern has been expressed about THORP over a long period and the dangers being posed on a daily basis to our environment and seas?</P>
    <P>About 70 per cent of the earth's surface is covered by oceans.  I fully agree with the Minister of State when he said:</P>
    <P>Our knowledge of the physical, chemical and biological processes of <Col N="589" /> our seas and oceans is far from complete.  We do know, however, that they are fragile; they are threatened every day by the effect of onshore and offshore activities; they are at risk of long-term damage from visible and invisible processes and actions, the impact of only some of which we fully understand.  Other more insidious damage is inevitably occurring; we cannot await the luxury of the establishment of clear casual relationships in framing and implementing protective measures.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, we are now more aware of the risk to the environment which has moved closer to centre stage.  There cannot be slow movement in protecting it. That is the reason I made the point that the pace of progress has been slow in having the codes changed to ensure, at the very least, proper monitoring of the transportation of nuclear waste.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable Ireland to give effect to the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic, the 1992 Paris Convention and to update the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981.  We owe it to future generations to pass on our inheritance enhanced and not diminished.</P>
    <P>I welcome the restriction on dumping in the maritime area which is to be extended up to 200 miles from baselines and, in some cases, up to 350 miles whereby it will be an offence to dump or to load for the purposes of dumping substances or materials unless it is in accordance with the permit granted by the Minister.  I also welcome the section which states that it will be an offence to cause the incineration of substances or materials in the maritime area.</P>
    <P>Under section 4 it will be an offence to deliberately dump or to permit the dumping of an offshore installation or any substance or material from an offshore installation, particularly radioactive substances or materials in the maritime area.  It will also be an offence to dump toxic, harmful or noxious substances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="590" /> It is depressing to think of how polluted our seas have become and that adequate protection has not been provided in recent years.  In that context many Deputies highlighted the need for monitoring.  While this is a complex issue it is an important aspect.  I ask the Minister of State to give us some indication as to the level of resources required to properly monitor the implementation of this Bill given that people will continue to dump at sea if they believe they will get away with it.  The fines provided for in the Bill are low.  I would have thought that the savings to be gained by dumping at sea are large and that a fine of £1,500 is rather low, although I note a term of imprisonment may be imposed.  I am not sure, however, if this will act as a deterrent.</P>
    <P>The Government has gone a step further by including a reference to military vessels in the Bill.  That is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>About two-and-a-half years ago Fianna Fáil produced a report on the environment which was the subject of a good discussion.  On the question of industrial development and the need to protect the environment, the report stated that it should be in the automatic self interest of producers and customers to cherish and conserve their environmental endowment.  To achieve this means understanding the incentives which led them to do otherwise and then designing and implementing a combination of carrots &mdash; positive incentives &mdash; and sticks &mdash; negative incentives &mdash; to move behaviour in this direction.  I share that view.  I hope this issue will be addressed in the next budget as tax and grant provisions in an annual budget can be especially influential if we develop the concept of Green budgeting, lower taxes on environmentally positive behaviour and higher taxes on the converse.  This should be an integral part of the budgetary process.</P>
    <P>We are moving towards a more comprehensive approach to the environment, but, as in the case of equality issues, environmental issues cannot be hived off to any one Department; they <Col N="591" /> must inform thinking at all levels in all Departments.  I should like to give one example.  In my constituency the planning application relating to the development of an incinerator is the source of major concern.  It is clear from the discussions which have taken place that this issue is deeply linked with the question of Government policy on the disposal of hospital waste.  We lag far behind other countries in developing appropriate plans to deal with this issue. It is more by luck than design that we are not facing the environmental problems being faced in Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>In recent days a member of the Court of Auditors said that in many ways it is pointless providing money for many developmental projects in Eastern Europe because of the damage already done to the environment.  This is a vicious circle from which it is very hard to break free.  We have to try to move from fire brigade mode on these issues as we are always trying to roll back the disasters which have occurred.  While great progress has been made we have to move from the position where we always seem to be reactive rather than pro-active on environmental issues.  This legislation is important in that regard in that it sets down a baseline in managing our seas.</P>
    <P>As this is an international issue, I welcome the progress outlined by the Minister of State in relation to the various international initiatives under way. There are huge differences between East and West not only in economies, but also in the priorities set by governments in tackling the issue of environmental protection which goes hand in hand with economic growth.</P>
    <P>While this is an important measure there is a need to monitor its implementation.  The big issues have to be the discussions taking place with the UK Government in relation to THORP and the need for the UK authorities to provide more detailed information about the munitions that have been dumped off our coast.  If anything goes wrong, the impact on the health and welfare of <Col N="592" /> people living here could be disastrous.  I urge the Minister of State to continue to exert pressure in this regard.  What reaction did he receive this week when he tried to have the code extended to cover the issues I mentioned?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important Bill for us as an island nation, all legislation in relation to the sea highlights the necessity for co-operation between nations, their serious common purpose to enact and enforce &mdash; so often the forgotten part of the equation &mdash; agreed measures through local, national and international law.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been long awaited by the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, since the worldwide ban on dumping industrial and nuclear waste at sea, which had 37 signatories at the London Convention held at the headquarters of the International Maritime Organisation when, tragically, Britain, France, Belgium, China and Russia abstained.</P>
      <P>In advance of the visit here by the President of the United States, Mr. Bill Clinton, it is important to remember that the United States backing of this ban was crucial to its requisite international clout against the dumping of such waste at sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first issue of concern to my party is the relative damage done by dumping at sea within the overall context of marine pollution.  The second is the need to tackle the scourge of land-based marine pollution in accordance with the contentions of STAD &mdash; the Stop THORP Alliance Dundalk &mdash; in their nongovernmental case against THORP. Our third concern is the legacy of marine legislation reverting to 1609 and the ambivalent role of Irish Governments over many years in promoting clean seas.  Our fourth concern is in relation to the shortcomings of existing legislation in protecting the oceans as a common heritage.  Even though an extension of the coastal limit under control is welcome, enforcement and international co-operation remain weak.  Our fifth concern is the need to review the legislation to tackle the growing menace of <Col N="593" /> plastic and latex pollution, particularly as it threatens wildlife at sea; sixth, the need to review the protection given a polluter who may argue that a given pollution incident was an accident &mdash; as provided for in the Bill.  Our seventh concern is the need to tighten up the legislation relating to registration of ownership of a vessel, given that failure to prove ownership renders the authorities powerless to bring those responsible for hazardous wrecks to justice. Our final and eighth concern is the need to raise the limit of fines from the present £1,500 to a more realistic level. I shall explain my reasons for advocating this later.</P>
    <P>In comparison with overall dumping of waste into the sea from land-based sources, other dumping of waste at sea represents a small proportion only of total marine pollution, but must be tackled also.  I understand that 85 per cent of oceanic pollution worldwide arises from land-based sources, which is significant, and means that that type of pollution is concentrated in coastal areas from which coastal economies derive their greatest benefit in terms of fishing or other recourse to the seas surrounding them.</P>
    <P>It has been brought to my attention that an estimated six million tonnes of oil is lost at sea each year, of which approximately two million tonnes emanates from land, particularly from cities; that, despite the fact that publicity surrounding discharges of oil at sea often is much weightier, being so much more destructive to wildlife than, say, a land-based pipe dripping into the sea. All Members living in coastal communities will be very familiar with the sight of oil floating in coastal waters.</P>
    <P>Neither must this Bill distract us from marine pollution from radioactive sources such as Sellafield, repeatedly mentioned in this debate.  The Minister referred to the adoption in 1993 of the International Maritime Organisation's Code on the Safe Carriage of Irradiated Nuclear Fuel, Plutonium and High Level Radioactive Wastes in Flasks on Board Ships &mdash; the INF code.  I regret <Col N="594" /> he did not avail of the opportunity to apprise the House of the Government's response to the courageous stand by the STAD group.  The establishment of an interdepartmental committee on Sellafield was welcomed, particularly by those of us who campaigned and, in my case, were arrested and detained at Her Majesty's pleasure.  However, the initial momentum appears to have been lost.  I know that the advocators of the STAD case would like the Minister to say whether the Government will practically support their case, including funding.  That case should transcend any arguments I have yet heard on where the Irish Government stands and so on, it being much too important to be sidetracked.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sea is subjected to more than radioactive discharges.  As I prepared for this contribution I came across a report from the North West Water Authority in Cumbria in 1990 of a detergent company, detected by Green-peace, that had been dumping ten million gallons daily of waste, including heavy metals such as cadmium, zinc and chromium, under licence, and were also licensed to dump 93 tonnes of uranium annually.  This clearly demonstrates there is a much wider agenda than merely tackling Sellafield which I hope will be borne in mind when people talk about pollution at sea.</P>
    <P>With regard to our legacy of marine law, it is worth recalling that the earliest attempt I could trace to enact marine law was 1609 when a Dutchman, named Grotius, brought into being what was termed the &ldquo;Mare Liberum&rdquo; proclaiming &ldquo;freedom of the sea&rdquo; which limited territorial waters to three nautical miles.  That legislation was enacted at a time when people's perception and understanding of the sea was one of an infinite expanse of water to be traversed, used and abused at will.  Nowadays that view should have changed radically, and should now understand the finite nature of the oceans surrounding our continents.  Despite the fact they comprise such a vast proportion of the <Col N="595" /> earth's surface and represent our common heritage they do not readily respond to our traditional means of governing society, when we draw borders and lines on maps and decide which laws should apply on one side of that line and which on the other.  The oceans must be regarded as a common heritage of mankind, thus presenting a challenge to our traditional views and methods of decision-making.</P>
    <P>Yet, those oceans are too immense to be policed by any one country or group of countries.  Therefore, it is vital that we honour our responsibility, in common with other nations, in enforcing the law of the sea, which probably leads to the greatest amount of disagreement among nations.  Some of our laws in relation to the sea are quite good but have not been enforced.  Sadly, Ireland has not always had an honourable record in protecting the seas around our coastline from pollution.</P>
    <P>I recall a headline in a newspaper in 1990, at the time of the Government comprising the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats, stating that Ireland did not even voice an objection when informed of the UK plans to dump over 50,000 tonnes of chemicals, including epoxy, mercaptans, a chemical I had not heard of previously, and paracetamol, in the North Sea.  Perhaps history will reveal why we chose not to object.  It is still a mystery to me, given that we were clearly informed, under the international requirement, as to what would happen.  Was it to avoid annoying the British?</P>
    <P>This is a question that also needs to be asked when trying to understand fully why our motivation on the issue of Sellafield, in stopping short of taking legal action, has been so reticent.  This kind of phoney opposition, where we are verbal about our position, yet stop short of taking any action, has a negative knock-on effect on other countries further away but affected by the transboundary nature of marine pollution. They are especially affected if the nearest neighbour does not take firm action, <Col N="596" /> including legal action and action that will, perhaps, annoy a few people but nevertheless must be taken if we are responsible, as we say we are, for the safety and health of the nation.  We must come off the fence when we speak of our opposition to plants like Sellafield.</P>
    <P>Ironically, at the time of the North Sea incident, the Government launched a poster campaign to encourage non-dumping at sea.  This highlights the different levels on which the Government can work, and the level of deception there can be as to how serious or sincere a Government is about following through on its stated aims.</P>
    <P>My fourth point was to address some of the shortcomings in the Bill.  I welcome the extension of the coastal zone in the legislation, but the threat of dumping in international waters is not addressed.  A measure such as extending the coastal zone gives us a certain amount of comfort, but it does not help when serious crimes are committed in international waters and which are totally outside the boundary we have set ourselves.</P>
    <P>I recently saw a cartoon in an American book entitled &ldquo;A Citizen's Guide to Plastics in the Ocean&rdquo; by the Centre for Marine Conservation in Washington DC.  It shows two people stranded in a boat in the middle of the ocean.  The caption reads: &ldquo;Unfortunately these days, seeing thrash does not necessarily mean you are near land.&rdquo;  This has a serious ring to it also, because, ultimately, it is the truth and it illustrates how serious matters have become.</P>
    <P>I recall lobbying the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, in the early 1980s, who was the Minister responsible at the time, about UK dumping in Cork, in Deputy Sheehan's constituency.  The USA stopped the dumping of radioactive material around 1970, having begun the process around 1949, but the UK was still continuing with the activity, which was taking place in international waters.  Will the proposed legislation alter, in any significant way, our ability to tackle head <Col N="597" /> on, and take decisive action on this matter?  I am glad to say that the matter has now been resolved, but at the time it was the subject of immense frustration for all concerned.</P>
    <P>The extent to which this is an international problem without any boundaries, no matter what is said in legislation, is clearly apparent from the reports that have been published on the levels of DDT in the penguins in Antarctica.  The substance, which has not been used in Antarctica or anywhere near it, has been found in the fat tissues of animals in that part of the world.  This must be kept in mind when we speak of our role in protecting the marine ocean. We must never be content that we have everything under control, simply because we have extended our own coastal zone, welcome as this is.</P>
    <P>The issue of plastic latex does not receive attention in the Bill, perhaps because it is not known about widely enough and because the Bill tends to concentrate on chemicals and vessels.  In this recpect, the <i>Brent Spar</i> episode provoked a great deal of public outcry which, I hope, has found expression and a response in the Bill.  However, the matter of plastic, latex and other household rubbish is not often associated with the marine environment.  For example, we often see on the news, because it is so colourful, a release of latex balloons, where people are either celebrating or marking an event.  They disappear into the sky, become tiny specks and that is the end of anybody's concern.  However, remembering that over 70 per cent of the earth's surface comprises water, it is not hard to understand that a great many of those items are likely to be dumped, to use the terminology in the Bill.  I hope this point will be taken into account when we consider amendments to the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a clause in the Bill which deals with accidents and which makes clear that if a spillage or a dumping at sea is an accident it will not be treated so seriously.  However, there have been some very severe accidents in marine history.  In view of this, when we deal <Col N="598" /> with compensation, insurance and so on, will the Minister consider a bond system of some kind?  There is a certain amount of comfort if there is insurance, and there needs to be a realistic type of a bond to deal with this area.  I recall a container being lost at sea between the UK and France.  Fishing in the area had to be banned, perhaps as a precautionary measure.  When accidents happen they have a serious knock-on effect.  For example in the <i>Exxon Valdez</i> incident, only 4 per cent of the spillage was recovered.</P>
    <P>On the issue of abandoned sea wrecks, which are largely moored in harbours, the Minister will be aware of my concern for the harbours at Balbriggan and Skerries from meeting harbour users and Fingal County Council with him.  However, speaking to personnel in Dublin Port today, I was reminded that, currently, there is a huge legal loophole when it comes to vessels at sea.  In the case of cars and vehicles on the road, one must declare when one is transferring ownership and the person is responsible until that transfer is registered in the name of the new owner. This is not the position in the case of ships.  There is a wreck in Balbriggan Harbour traceable to an owner who claims that there have been five owners since he sold it, yet none of them can be held legally responsible for leaving such a wreck in a serious, dangerous and polluting condition.  I ask the Minister to consider some of the measures I have addressed in the Bill, because they weaken it by default.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  The management of our marine environment is vital as the seas around us become more important and people take a greater interest in fishing and consume more fish in substitution for red meat.  Anybody who eats a great deal of fish, as I do, will notice how the price of fish has rocketed in recent years.  Many species of fish have become almost a luxury.  That people are willing to spend huge amounts of money to buy fish is an indication of how important <Col N="599" /> an industry fishing has become.  Had we been more enlightened on our entry to the European Community many years ago, we would probably have adopted a very different approach to our resources in the seas around us; we might have put less emphasis on our agricultural industry and more on fishing.  Agriculture is a very important industry for Ireland and has done extremely well, but if we had the chance again, we would probably put more emphasis on fishing than on agriculture.</P>
      <P>In recent years we have taken a number of initiatives to try to stop the pollution of our seas.  One initiative which is close to my heart is the development of the sewerage works at Ringsend.  Everybody is disturbed by the idea of raw sewage spilling into the seas around our coast.  I am delighted, therefore, that initiatives have been taken to try to treat the sewage entering the sea. The new plant at Ringsend will treat all the sewage from Dublin to secondary level and eventually to tertiary level. That would be to a very high standard with practically no pollution entering the seas in a few years.  It is hoped that this will be extended to other places around the coast, taking on board the concerns of people and making a large contribution to cleaning the seas around our shores.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years it seems to have been thought that one could just dump anything into the sea because it would not be seen; it was like the campaign run in America regarding nuclear testing which told the American troops, as they jumped out of their bunkers and ran towards nuclear explosions, that if they could not see it, could not smell it and could not taste it they need not worry about it.  We have discovered that dumping items at the bottom of the ocean does not mean that they will not-re-emerge at a later date.  British military establishment dumping of arms and chemicals in the seas off Donegal and other places has recently come to light. There is much genuine concern that <Col N="600" /> these arms and chemicals might be moving and coming to the surface.  Some of them have, and people now know that such dumping was very foolish.  This is not the way to dispose of such substances.  The British Army would not get away with it if it tried to do that today, although it probably would try if it got half a chance.</P>
    <P>The <i>Brent Spar</i> incident received wide coverage when it was proposed to dump it into the sea.  If ever there was an illustration of the outrage and power of the public, it was their success in having the decision to dump the rig overturned.  I read subsequently that it may not have been as bad as we originally thought, but the incident highlighted the desire of people to protect the seas and the environment.  We do not want people to dump items willy nilly, into the sea, and hope for the best.  The overturning of the decision to do so in this case was an indication of people's concern about the marine environment.</P>
    <P>A recent report, the Quality Status Report, which was prepared by scientists from eight different nations&mdash; Britain, France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Denamrk, Norway and Sweden&mdash;states that chemicals such as HCHs, PCBs and TBTs have reached alarming levels in the North Sea, and that discharges of pesticides, oils and poisonous metals such as cadmium have been unchecked and pose disturbing problems.  It states that more stringent goals and measures are urgently needed and that only radical action will halt the decline that is turning the sea into the waste dump of northern Europe.  It is quite an alarming report.  Happily, our seas have not reached that level, but I will return later to the issue of the Irish Sea in the context of Sellafield.</P>
    <P>Fishermen are usually reluctant to talk about the level of pollution for fear of losing their market.  However, older fishermen say privately that they have seen a huge increase in pollution in the seas around Ireland.  That is very unfortunate.  Deputy Sargent mentioned plastics, and oil slicks which are the result of ships being cleaned as they move along.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="601" /> This is dreadfully polluting.  This Bill is aimed at stopping people just dumping items into the sea and moving on, because it is essential that we tackle all types of pollution.</P>
    <P>The Bill enables Ireland to give effect to the Convention for the Protection of the Marine-Environment of the North-East Atlantic, generally known as the OSPAR Convention.  It will extend the limit of Irish control in relation to dumping from 12 miles up to 200 miles and in some areas up to 350 miles off the Irish coast, depending on the extent of the Continental Shelf; it will set strict limits on the substances which can be disposed of at sea, and ban incineration at sea, the dumping of radioactive wastes, offshore installations and toxic, harmful or noxious substances.  It will also introduce new enforcement powers and tougher penalties.  This is a very important initiative and it will be welcomed generally.</P>
    <P>When dealing with pollution of the sea one immediately thinks of Sellafield. Even though the level of dumping in the Irish Sea has decreased in recent years we still live with the threat of a nuclear explosion.  As recently as ten-15 years ago a considerable amount of nuclear waste was dumped in the Irish Sea and, these radioactive substances are lying on the seabed; the unfortunate thing about nuclear pollution is that it remains active for hundreds of years. The British nuclear industry has not given a satisfactory explanation for dumping this material at sea and one no sooner proves scientifically that nuclear material has been dumped than it says this type of dumping is no longer going on.  Unfortunately the horse has already bolted and the damage has been done.</P>
    <P>The British nuclear industry has said that the level of dumping of radioactive materials into the Irish Sea has decreased considerably in recent years and obviously we welcome that. However, the Irish Sea still has the unenviable reputation of being the most radioactive sea in the world.  This is not our fault; it is the fault of the British nuclear industry which is completely <Col N="602" /> insensitive to the concerns of Irish people.  Successive Governments have fought the British nuclear industry at every opportunity in an effort to curtail its activities and hopefully to close down Sellafield in the long-term.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sea is an international marine corridor whose resources and amenities are shared by a number of countries.  While its physical characteristics are quite distinctive the pressure and conflicts which can arise within it are common to all regional sea areas. This suggests that Ireland has much to gain from participation in international organisations whose existence reflects a common interest in protecting the oceans and their resources.  The management of these is not confined to legal agreements and Protocols.  The Bill will add to this by making further provision to control dumping at sea.  It is very clear in what it seeks to do and must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>It is extremely difficult to ascertain what materials are being dumped at sea as much of it is dumped by boats.  It may be possible to use satellites and other modern technology to check from where the pollution is coming.  I ask the Minister to address this point in his reply.</P>
    <P>The one aspect of the Bill with which I find fault is the provision relating to fines.  We correctly strongly criticised the miserable fines imposed on British Nuclear Fuels Limited when it broke its safety regulations.  The proposed maximum fine of £1,500 or 12 months' imprisonment should be considerably increased and it should be left to the courts to decide the amount of the fine. I ask the Minister to give further consideration to this provision between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this good Bill which will go a long way towards minimising the level of pollution in the seas around our coasts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I welcome this very important Bill which will have a major effect on all our lives. As an island state our shores will <Col N="603" /> obviously be contaminated by dumping at sea and it is important for us to ensure that future generations can enjoy the same facilities enjoyed by us.  For example, they should be able to swim in safe waters and catch fish which they know are not contaminated.</P>
      <P>It is easy to understand how lakes can be polluted but it is difficult to understand how vast oceans can be polluted. However, there is much traffic on oceans and there has been much dumping and pollution over the years, for example, fuel from ships, oil spillages, etc.  The Bill deals mainly with nuclear dumping at sea which is much more serious.  It is proposed to extend the 12 mile limit to 200 miles which seems more of a myth than a reality.  Do we have the necessary man, boat and air power to supervise what happens in this stretch of water and will we be able to control what happens in it?</P>
      <P>The proposed fine of £1,500 or 12 months' imprisonment seems more appropriate to the storing of rotten apples in plastic bags than to dumping at sea.  A fine of £1.5 million would show we were serious about controlling the sea.  I might be exaggerating when I suggest a figure of that magnitude but a £1,500 fine is more appropriate to an offence such as careless or drink driving and people have been fined that much in court for crimes that would not be on a major scale.</P>
      <P>This legislation will be difficult to enforce.  We will have to supervise our seas.  It will be difficult to prove that people have been dumping at sea but the proposed fine on conviction is derisory.  I hope I am misreading the figures because I think it is belittling the importance of the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister will explain later how the level of fines was arrived at.  The sum of £1,500 is chicken feed for somebody who is caught dumping at sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British dump chemical and other weapons in the seas around us. Obviously we cannot do very much about what has been dumped already but we must try to safeguard against <Col N="604" /> dangerous emissions from the dumped material.  Such emissions would be affected by tidal flow and in some cases fish may be affected by pollution.  It is grand to be surrounded by water on a glorious summer day if the sea is safe, but if not one is as well off away from it.  The Atlantic Ocean because of its vastness can absorb a great deal but we should try to protect the purity of the water.</P>
    <P>Possible emissions from the THORP installation at Sellafield are a greater danger to us than dumping 200 miles from shore.  Our demands do not seem to have an impact.  We are always in danger from something going wrong there and it is so close to us that it is always a worry.  It is right to highlight this issue on all appropriate occasions. We are at the mercy of those who provide the reports.  We may not be told about an accident in the plant immediately and it may take six months for a report of it to be leaked.  There is no early warning system and we are not notified immediately there is an accident.  Sellafield is so close that any disasters there could cause major difficulties for us.  All that we can do is hope that nothing happens.  I am sure, however, the Minister will continue to protest to the British Government about Sellafield/THORP.  The less nuclear waste going there, the better for us. Legislation on the marine dates back to 1609.  How does one control reckless people?  On land it is not easy to control them but at sea there is a strong temptation to dump material in deep water and hope it will never be heard of again. We do not know how long it will take for this material to be carried on the tides.  Perhaps the detritus that is coming in on the seashore began its journey further out at sea years ago.  We have no idea how long it takes to come ashore.</P>
    <P>One of the most important things we can do to protect our seas is to control dumping.  We have to ensure that it is safe to eat our fish and that people may bathe in our waters.  One would not want to have a question mark over the quality of our fish.  When this Bill is <Col N="605" /> enacted I hope we will be able to enforce the regulations.  Having caught offenders I hope we will deal with them in a serious way to deter anyone else who might be tempted to commit a similar offence.  I wish the Bill an easy passage and I hope when enacted it will be a protection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>A group of people came together in 1984 under the umbrella of the Irish Sea study group and in conjunction with the Royal Society of Arts in London they carried out a study on the Irish Sea.  A questionnaire was circulated to a large number of governmental, academic, industrial and private representatives which led to a series of meetings convened and hosted at the university of Liverpool.  Three years later agreement was reached to establish a number of subgroups in various areas near the Irish Sea to consider the impact of pollution on the sea.  Both the Irish and the UK Governments agreed in 1987 to support the study on an informal basis.  Concern about the level of pollution in our seas has only begun to develop in recent times.  Only lately have we focused attention on trying to address some of the ills of our seas.</P>
      <P>The Dumping at Sea Bill, 1995, is welcome, particularly the principal provision.  Dublin Bay is at our doorstep and my concern and that of my constituents about Bull Island is that on one side large signs indicate that the waters are polluted in excess of EC and Irish levels and are not suitable for bathing, even though there are bathing shelters provided at that location.</P>
      <P>On the other side of the wall, depending on the weather, people will swim in polluted or unpolluted waters.  I am also a regular visitor to Sheep's Head in west Cork where, from childhood days, I recall heavy pollution from the many disasters at Whiddy Island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is an attempt to address pollution of our waters, about which there is genuine concern.  While public reaction prevented the disposal of the <i>Brent Spar</i> in the manner the proprietors felt <Col N="606" /> appropriate, the public is more concerned about the regular dripping of pollution into the sea from industry, farmers, Sellafield and other nuclear plants.  I am sure all Members are familiar with the proposals regarding the use of the Irish Sea for the transportation of nuclear fuels to and from the THORP reprocessing plant.</P>
    <P>While I compliment the Minister on introducing the Bill, some questions need to be asked.  When will regulations be put in place to enforce its provisions? What effect will the 200, and in some cases 350, mile limit have on the pollution of our waters?  There is not a great problem on the Atlantic side but that is not true in the case of the Irish Sea.  To what extent will the legislation address the difficulties we are experiencing with British Nuclear Fuels in respect of Sellafield?  What control will we have regarding the transportation of nuclear fuels to and from the THORP plant by way of the Irish Sea corridor? As happened in the past, will we be told by the UK authorities to mind our own business?  Will the Minister outline clearly the role of the Government in respect of the use by British Nuclear fuels of the Irish Sea corridor for that purpose?  We can address the problem of pollution, whether from cargo vessels or farm waste, on the Atlantic side but the management and control of pollution in the Irish Sea can be successfully addressed only with the co-operation of international as well as the UK authorities.  I would welcome a response from the Minister in that regard.</P>
    <P>In the past few months I tabled a number of questions to various Ministers about dumping at sea.  I tabled one to the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, about the increase in seabed levels in the Dublin Bay area.  Will he clarify if this matter is covered under the Bill?  In reply to my question he informed me that no evidence had been made available to the Department of the Marine about an increase in seabed levels in Dublin Bay.  His former colleague, Pat McCartan, a keen yachtsman who frequently uses the bay, will <Col N="607" /> give him first hand evidence in that regard.  I would also be pleased to supply the Minister of State with information about the increase in seabed levels from any water sport enthusiasts who use the bay area.</P>
    <P>The significant increase in such levels in recent years may have resulted from the development of the causeway to Bull Island.  As the causeway is not breached, tidal flow is stopped and this results in the formation of sandbanks, mudflats and encourages the development and spread of spartina grass.  This has created many problems for Clontarf Yacht &amp; Boat Club, Kilbarrack Sailing Club and many other water sport enthusiasts who use the Dollymount-Clontarf Bay area.  If Dublin Corporation, who developed the causeway, is responsible for an increase in seabed levels, action must be taken.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the study being undertaken by the ESBI in regard to whether the cause way should be breached, part of which involves a reading of seabed levels.  If the survey reveals that there has been an increase in such levels, could the provisions of the Bill be enforced in that regard.</P>
    <P>I also tabled a number of questions about the Dumping at Sea Bill and the amount of sewage dumped at sea by Dublin Corporation, of which I am a member.  I am totally opposed to dumping at sea either through the nosepipe off Howth or the <i>Sir Basil</i> that dumps a couple of miles outside the bay area. Section 5 gives the Minister power to grant a permit for the disposal of substances at sea.  In reply to a question I tabled in June last I was informed that the only authorised dumping of sewage sludge at sea is that carried out by Dublin Corporation and the dump site is located some 14 miles south of Kish Lighthouse.  The reply went on to deal with a number of regulations in respect of the permit.</P>
    <P>To put it into perspective, the total estimated amount of sludge to be dumped in the years 1996, 1997 and 1998 is 340,000 tonnes each year.  This <Col N="608" /> Bill gives the Minister an opportunity to authorise dumping.  I am concerned that Dublin Corporation is using its vessel to dump and is dumping untreated sewage into the sea at Howth.  There is a population in excess of 1.3 million in the greater Dublin area and half the total sewage for the region goes into the sea through the nosepipe at Howth.  Such dumping, just 14 miles outside Dublin Bay, is done with the approval of the Department.</P>
    <P>My question on the environmental impact of such dumping elicited the reply that following extensive scientific studies the authorised sewage sludge dump site was relocated at a new site south east of the Kish Lighthouse ten to 14 miles offshore.  This prompted further questions from me about what was found at the old site.  I was told that a number of studies are being carried out and while there would continue to be monitoring, indications were that there would be a good recovery.</P>
    <P>There are EC regulations governing the dumping of sewage.  The public are concerned about the level of pollution and not once off incidents such as the <i>Brent Spar.</i> It is the continual drip of pollution &mdash; the 340,000 tonnes of sewage dumped each year by Dublin Corporation; the partially treated sewage going through the Ringsend sludge pipe; the untreated sewage going through the nosepipe at Howth and the proposal by British Nuclear Fuels to further develop THORP.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the Bill will adequately deal with all the issues? He is not a fool and he knows public concern is not about technical aspects such as whether it is 350 miles out into the Atlantic or 70 miles across the sea. Is the Minister satisfied he will have power to redress the ills that exist so that we can enjoy water sports activities and eat fish and foodstuffs from the sea without being concerned?  Will he be in a position to dispel the myth that the Irish Sea is the most radioactive in the world?</P>
    <P>I do not expect the Minister to have the answers now.  Will the regulations be <Col N="609" /> enforced with the EU regulations?  I am deeply concerned about the dumping of sewage, treated or untreated, into the sea.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan referred to the maximum penalties.  I suggest they should be revised upwards.  A fine of £1,500 and five years imprisonment on conviction on indictment should be reviewed.  I am glad the Minister has gone this far but I am not sure it is far enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation.  As an island nation it is particularly important that we control dumping at sea and ratify the 1982 Paris Convention on the protection of the marine environment of the north east Atlantic.  Although we are an island nation we have made our living from the land and have traditionally ignored the riches of the sea.  We have been slow to recognise the importance of the sea to the economy.  It is a rich source of fish.  Countries such as Spain, Russia and other continental countries are emphatic about harvesting the sea and use that resource to their benefit.</P>
      <P>The sea is of tremendous value as a tourist attraction.  Whether in terms of angling, swimming or bathing along the coast it provides a healthy means of exercise.  It is essential that we preserve the seas around Ireland and that they are not abused by the dumping of dangerous wastes, munitions and other unacceptable material.</P>
      <P>Before I came into the House I attended the Joint Committee on Sustainable Development.  There is enormous potential for us to exploit our geographic position.  While our location on the periphery of Europe is a disadvantage in terms of transporting goods to other markets, there is a certain attraction in marketing ourselves as an unpolluted island economy, which is of enormous benefit in selling our products. For that reason it is important that our seas remain unpolluted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main cause of coastal pollution is untreated sewage constantly spilling out of urban areas.  That problem, while not <Col N="610" /> covered by this legislation &mdash; it is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment and local authorities &mdash; was referred to in great detail by Deputy Callely.  December 1998 is the deadline under European protocols for dealing with sewage treatment.  Dublin Corporation is seriously considering this matter with a view to providing tertiary treatment, which would cost a little more than secondary treatment.  EU grants will be provided for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Slurry is discharged from farms into rivers, lakes and streams, eventually reaching the sea and other forms of land based waste leak into the sea or are dumped in it.  In this legislation we are dealing with large scale dumping which has been taking place down the years.  A great deal of dumping took place after World War II, particularly off the coast of Donegal where it is alleged large quantities of munitions, including mustard gas, were dumped creating a hazard for fish life in the area.</P>
    <P>Offshore installations are another cause of concern in this regard.  For example, in the case of the <i>Brent Spar</i> it was intended to dump the oil rig at sea. Objections were made on the basis of the amount of oil involved.  Similar instances will occur in view of the increase in the number of installations that exist and we must take action to deal with these problems.</P>
    <P>Likewise, it is unacceptable that radioactive wastes are dumped at sea as has occurred on a large scale in the past. Very often the waste is put in containers supposed to last for years, but as we know, radioactive material lasts much longer than any man-made material used to contain it.  Because of its close proximity to Ireland, Sellafield is a cause of great concern to us.  I would like the Minister to outline in greater detail the extent to which this legislation will deal with the immediate threat to our coast from Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the Government will have control over dumping up to 200 miles off our coast, and 350 miles in some areas depending on the extent <Col N="611" /> of our Continental Shelf where dumping, particularly of radioactive material, took place in the past.  It is important that the Minister has authority to issue permits for the disposal of waste and also for dredging which can be damaging to the sea.  Ministerial permits will be required for dumping certain substances, vessels and aircraft &mdash; they will also be required in cases where such vehicles carry loads for dumping.  In certain instances incineration will be an offence, as will the dumping of toxic, harmful or noxious substances.</P>
    <P>A major question arises in regard to the policing of dumping.  Our Navy encounters problems in adequately policing illegal fishing in our waters on a regular basis.  It would be difficult for our Navy to adequately police dumping carried out surreptitiously by a vessel or corporate body which wished to dispose of material that would be expensive to dispose of otherwise.  Will the Minister elaborate on what effective mechanism can be put in place in co-operation with other navies and what co-operation can be secured from the range of satellites at present circling the globe to assist in identifying aircraft or vessels at sea, which might be engaged in such activity?</P>

      <P>This Bill makes sexual offences against children by Irish citizens or residents committed in other countries punishable here.  As a father of three young children, I am delighted we are introducing legislation to deal with child prostitution.  Our thanks is due to Deputies Ryan and O'Donoghue for preparing and introducing the Bill. Special thanks is also due to the Government for accepting it.  I understand it is only the fourth occasion a Private Members' Bill has been accepted by a Government.  The acceptance of this Bill highlights a greater maturity among Irish politicians.  The idea that one party has all the answers is no longer valid.  It is time that Members of Dáil Éireann acted in a coherent fashion and used their brains more productively.  That applies to all parties because Governments always tend to oppose proposals put forward by the Opposition.  Unfortunately, commonsense is not as common as we would like to believe.</P>
      <P>We are obliged under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child to take the necessary action to prevent child prostitution.  Other Governments throughout the world have introduced legislation to deal with this problem and I am proud we are doing the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During recent years Irish people have been subjected to horrific accounts of incest and paedophilia.  We have all been shocked by these dreadful stories. We have heard weekly of new sexual scandals involving young children.  Child sex abuse is common in all countries and, while it is bad in Ireland it is far worse in other countries.  Thailand is now known as the sex capital of the world and, like any other business, if there is a demand somebody is always ready to supply it.  Unfortunately, in many cases the supply is not voluntary. Young children are forced into prostitution and then used to satisfy the demands of dirty bastards all over the world.  Poverty as we know it in Ireland bears no comparison with the poverty <Col N="613" /> that exists in Thailand, Cambodia, Brazil, Sri Lanka and many other underdeveloped countries.</P>
    <P>Children are forced into prostitution principally because they are poor and have not had any real education.  It is common for parents to sell their children to the sex industry in return for a new and much needed income.  Aware of the terrible poverty that exists, pimps are always ready to exploit those situations.  This is a major problem.  Families are willing to sell their children into sex slavery and sex tourists seek to satisfy their lust.  While no figures are available it is more than likely that millions of children are being abused in that way.</P>
    <P>Tonight we are outlawing child sex tourism and it is important that we continue the fight against that evil trade. We must pressurise other countries to introduce legislation to deal with that problem.  We have been horrified by the number of cases of child sexual abuse here and cannot turn a blind eye to the sexual abuse of children because it is taking place far away.</P>
    <P>The sexual abuse of a child has the same devastating effect on its victim irrespective of whether the child is Irish, Brazilian, or any other nationality.  Last night Deputy Ryan mentioned the great work being done by Fr. Shay Cullen in Manila and I ask the Minister to ascertain if resources could be provided to help him continue his good work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MildredFox" hpid="Miss M. Fox Miss M. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>I am greateful for the opportunity to speak briefly on this Bill. Child sex is probably the most horrific crime against humanity.  It targets the innocent and the vulnerable and scars them more than anybody will ever know.  Unfortunately, that is a problem with which we have been faced increasingly in Ireland of late but it is not confined to Ireland, it is an international one.  It is particularly evident in countries like Thailand, Cambodia and other countries of South East Asia.  Children in those countries are sold like slaves to be physically and sexually abused as their predators see fit.  It is very disturbing that children can be marketed in <Col N="614" /> such a manner and this practice must be discouraged in every way possible.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which seeks to prosecute those who travel to commit such crimes and promote or in any way aid the sexual abuse of children in any country.  The Bill is a step forward in terms of bringing such criminals to justice.  I thank the Government for accepting it and Deputy Ryan for introducing it.</P>

      <P>That is an unfortunate comment considering the subject under discussion.  I congratulate the Deputies.  I also congratulate the Government for accepting a Bill of this nature introduced by Opposition Members, it should happen more often. I am sure members of the Government from their time in Opposition realise that the Government of the day would have accepted various Bills put before it by the Opposition if it were not for party politics and the games we play in trying to order other people's lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would have been virtually impossible to vote against this legislation because of its subject matter.  Like earlier speakers, I congratulate Fr. Shay Cullen for his tireless work in exposing the scandal of child prostitution in the Philippines and lobbying governments.  I doubt if any of us thought when we saw Fr. Cullen's first appearance on television that he would have made such an impact and the introduction of this Bill represents the conclusion of his work in this country.  Naturally it is not the end of his work in other countries but in as <Col N="615" /> much as we can do it is a significant step.  It is largely due to his efforts and those of organisations, such as Trócaire, that politicians have been made more aware of this issue.</P>
    <P>We were probably aware of it from television documentaries on child prostitution but did not realise its scale, or the economic reasons for it until Fr. Shay Cullen and others drew our attention to it and let us know what we could do on behalf of those children.</P>
    <P>As the gap between the developing and developed world increases, certain types of exports are flourishing.  The developed world increasingly exports its social and economic ills, ranging from environmental despoilation to child exploitation.  As awareness of child sexual abuse increases in the developed world and legislation is enacted to tackle it more and more paedophiles are seeking new hunting grounds in the poorest countries of Asia, Thailand, India, the Philippines, Kenya and other African countries.  As soon as the Philippines and Thailand for instance enact legislation to clamp down on this henious crime, the perpetrators will move on and find fresh hunting grounds.  Child prostitution is subject to the laws of supply and demand in the same way as any other commodity.  The increasing demand by European, American and Australian tourists for child prostitutes has created a seemingly inexhaustible supply.  UNICEF estimates that 60,000 child prostitutes are operating in the Philippines, a substantial number of whom operate for the foreign tourist.</P>
    <P>So-called sex tourism is a new form of colonialism, a form as insidious and corrupting as the political colonialism of the past.  While most of the destination countries have enacted legislation to deal with child prostitution, prosecutions of foreign nationals are extremely rare.  This is due to a combination of factors including lack of resources, the logistical difficulties of prosecuting a tourist and, in some cases, corruption.  No foreign paedophile has <Col N="616" /> yet been convicted under the Philippines' stringent child protection laws. This is certainly not due to a lack of evidence.  Sex tour brochures, videos and records of sexual encounters are all too easily available.</P>
    <P>The enactment of legislation to prosecute paedophiles for offences committed abroad will serve a number of purposes.  First, it will send a clear message that on their return to Ireland people who have abused children elsewhere will not find a safe haven.  We in Ireland are only coming to terms with the very difficult problem of child sexual abuse. I am pleased this legislation comes at a time when we are dealing with our problem.  It will reassure the people in the destination countries that we are not prepared to see their countries being used as paedophile dumping grounds and it will ensure that child abusers are not left loose to continue their activity in this jurisdiction.  That should also be of concern.</P>
    <P>Legislation similar to this has been enacted in jurisdictions such as Australia and Sweden but it is too early to assess its effectiveness.  I understand that a prosecution is currently being taken in Sweden and hope many more will follow.</P>
    <P>In the long-term, the issue of child prostitution and exploitation in the developing world can only be addressed by a fundamental shift in the balance of global economic power.  In the short-term, legislation such as that proposed by Deputies O'Donoghue and Ryan will provide a legal sanction against Irish child abusers travelling to the developing world in search of victims.</P>
    <P>Most people are outraged by child sexual abuse and I do not believe anyone would defend it.  I congratulate both Deputies on introducing the Bill. Equally, I congratulate the Government on its acceptance of it and look forward to more Private Members' Bills being accepted.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy O'Donoghue and my constituency colleague, Deputy Eoin Ryan, on <Col N="617" /> introducing this Bill.  It is important legislation and I commend them on their foresight and interest in the issue. I congratulate the Minister on accepting the Bill and hope Deputies will accept the proposed amendments which are reasonable, worthwhile and essential. As Deputy Power and others said, it is a sign of political maturity that the Government has decided to accept the Bill.  I agree with him and Deputy Lynch that we should have more of this.  If good ideas find legislative expression, we should support them.</P>
      <P>It is a reflection of the global village in which we live that a Bill such as this should be before the House and accepted by the Government.  It is also a reflection of the international dimension of protecting children's rights, our international obligations and the international opportunities to protect and further children's rights and the international problem of child sexual abuse.</P>
      <P>We have heard a great deal here about the national problem but it is an international problem and one which is understood to varying degrees in different countries.  I recall being in Russia a number of years ago and asking people if they were dealing with this issue, to which I got a negative response.  That society at that time had not faced up to its problems in this area.  The matter is dealt with in different ways all over the world due to the different levels of awareness.  It is only in the past ten years that awareness levels here have reached the required levels and that we have put in place appropriate monitoring safeguards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are also witnessing an international problem of child sexual abuse in the form of child sex tourism and the vulnerable position of young female children throughout the world.  It is important for us to give leadership in this area.  It is interesting to note that some of our priests abroad, one in particular, has given leadership and succeeded through his lobbying efforts in bringing this matter to the attention of the governments of Sweden, Germany and Holland but has not been successful <Col N="618" /> in the UK.  Australia has brought in legislation similar to ours.  It is right and proper that Ireland is giving leadership in this area and putting legislation in place.  It is important that a clear and unequivocal message goes out to those involved in organising child sex tourism. It is terrible that an industry such as tourism which has the potential for happy times should be used in this way. We have to send out a message to the countries where this is happening that it is not acceptable and that the world is taking action on it.</P>
    <P>This matter was considered in great detail at the United Nations Conference on Women in Beijing early this year. One of the themes which emerged from the conference was the need for greater protection and greater focus on women's rights as human rights. Developing that dimension and understanding in the search for equality for women and young girls is about the search for human rights and it is important to equate the two.</P>
    <P>At the conference I heard many horrific stories of children being sold to paedophile rings.  I had not realised that parents sold their children to known paedophile rings although I had been aware that children were being sold for various forms of commercial work and we heard individual stories of witnesses. As Deputy Power said, this happens in many poverty-stricken countries where parents feel they have no option.  Parents are driven to do this in desperation because of their economic situation and the low status of girls in their society.</P>
    <P>Different themes emerged from the United Nations international women's conferences.  For example, a new focus on domestic violence emerged from the Nairobi conference and firmly placed that matter on the international agenda. Countries took action as a result.  A huge focus on the rights of the girl child resulted from the Beijing conference.  It is not a concept with which we are familiar in Ireland but it is increasingly important that we are aware of it.  It is <Col N="619" /> linked to this debate because we are discussing the exploitation of young children, boys and girls, but particularly young girls.  The sexual exploitation of these young girls is closely connected not just to poverty in their countries, to which it is intimately linked, but also to the low status of the girl child.</P>
    <P>A recent article in an English Sunday newspaper on this issue stated that up to half the new born daughters in parts of southern India are sacrificed to the cult of the boy child.  Many of the girls who survive in such countries face sexual exploitation at a very young age.  It has been estimated that, because of infanticide, abortion after ultra sound has determined the sex of the foetus and the low status of girls in many societies, up to 60 million women are missing worldwide, victims of such dreadful approaches to the perception of parents of the girl child in their societies.</P>
    <P>This issue must be placed in that context because it belongs there.  The preference in such countries as Pakistan, India and Bangladesh among mothers is for sons.  This all makes the girl child more vulnerable to the type of sex tourism and sexual exploitation we are discussing.  It leads to ongoing exploitation.</P>
    <P>At the conference, women spoke of the despair they felt when their daughters were born.  It was very sad to hear them speaking in such terms and of the dreadful pressure they felt not to be pregnant with a girl or to allow a baby girl to continue to live because of the future she faced in those societies.  It is only by tackling equality at its broadest level, the equality issue in relation to women worldwide and reaching the type of agreement achieved in Beijing with regard to the Platform for Action that we can truly tackle these problems. That is why the agreement reached there is so important and it is essential to monitor and move forward on it in Ireland.  The UN's constant monitoring of the agreement puts pressure on those countries where girls are being exploited.</P>
    <P>Women in many countries have little <Col N="620" /> choice regarding their sexual rights.  This issue was covered at the conference and an extremely good agreement was reached.  The decision on protecting women's sexual rights, with which the Vatican in particular and some other countries have so much difficulty, is the basis of the Bill and our discussion.  This is why it is important to adopt what they said and for the European Union to state it wants sexual rights as a concept. That was not previously agreed at a world conference.</P>
    <P>These rights include the right to have control over and decide freely matters of sexuality, free of coercion, discrimination and violence.  This is very relevant to sex tourism.  It is extraordinary that this proposal provoked so much opposition from so many states. However, though the term sexual rights was not used, this right is included in the agreed Platform for Action and Ireland fully supported, as did the EU, this important development.</P>
    <P>Another important development, which is receiving more attention world-wide, is the issue of helping women to become more economically independent so that they do not rely on forms of exploitation, such as sex tourism, or exploitation within their country.  For example, we must ensure development aid to countries goes directly to women in addition to men.  Previously, women were a type of add on to development policies.  They received some money when the main funds had been distributed.  However, it is now clear the entire society benefits if the money goes directly to women who are involved at grass roots level in developing their communities, developing farming methods and setting up micro arts and crafts businesses.  This gives women independence and ensures they will not be exploited.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that world organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which previously never thought of giving this type of micro financial aid directly to women have changed their policies. They give small amounts of money to <Col N="621" /> women to set up businesses in rural communities throughout the Third World.  This is the way forward and will ensure that women are not exploited.</P>
    <P>We increasingly recognise that discrimination against women and the girl child begins at the very earliest stages of life.  It often continues unabated throughout their lives, particularly in poorer regions of the world.  We are very lucky in this part of the world because we have made so much progress on this issue.  We have made many changes to the lives of women and men. Women are often subjected to forms of sexual and economic exploitation, including female infanticide, pre-natal sex selection, incest, female genital mutilation, which was not considered a problem some years ago by some cultures but is now considered as such, an early marriage, including child marriage and sexual exploitation.</P>
    <P>The media has played a strong role worldwide and also in Ireland in highlighting these issues and ensuring that action is taken.  The Bill, produced by Deputies O'Donoghue and Eoin Ryan, is another marker on the road to tackling this issue at the appropriate level. We are taking a strong lead when we state we believe this type of exploitation of young children occurs.</P>

      <P>I pay special tribute to and salute my colleagues, Deputies Eoin Ryan and O'Donoghue, for preparing this important Bill.  If an Irish citizen or any person resident in Ireland commits a sexual offence against a child, it will constitute a criminal offence under the Bill.  Child abuse, and particularly child sexual abuse, regardless of where it is committed, is horrific and sick.  The innocence and vulnerability of children and their needs deserve special attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My former colleague, former Deputy Dermot Fitzpatrick chaired the select <Col N="622" /> committee established in 1989 on the Child Care Act.  This was long before some of the paedophilia cases came to light.  It is encouraging that legislators were working on the identified need to put in place a mechanism and regulations to protect children.</P>
    <P>Child abuse has caused concern in Ireland in recent years.  Nobody condones it and I welcome the fact that the Minister for Health has placed a special focus, with personal conviction, on ensuring a number of outstanding issues and regulations under the Child Care Act are dealt with in 1996.  I am particularly aware of this as a member of the Eastern Health Board and I am sure the same position applies in the other seven health board regions.  I know several Departments are involved.  I congratulate all those involved in ensuring these measures are put in place and, most importantly, that funding is made available.</P>
    <P>Child prostitution, which I gather is an escalating problem, is an issue of great concern.  We have all travelled abroad on holidays and may have been brought to particular &ldquo;hot spots&rdquo; in a city to see the cultural benefits on offer. I will not be shy in saying I have been brought to locations where some people get a thrill from looking at what I would describe as sick behaviour.</P>
    <P>Not long ago, a friend of mine returned from a holiday in Thailand with a photograph of himself among eight very attractive young ladies whose ages I could not guess.  To my horror I learned they were eight men but anyone would have been easily fooled.</P>
    <P>We are now mature enough as a nation to discuss the escalating problem of child prostitution in its various forms which heretofore was not recognised or spoken about.  On their own initiative, for which I heartily congratulate them, Deputies O'Donoghue and Ryan went to the trouble of preparing a difficult Bill.  We would all prefer not to talk about child sex abuse and the promotion of child prostitution, particularly when they are not problems on our own <Col N="623" /> doorsteps, but it is an issue that warrants a Bill such as this.</P>
    <P>Thailand and the Philippines are recognised as being at the forefront in the area of child prostitution.  I understand the governments of both those countries have made clear policy statements in regard to addressing this problem.  Children ranging in ages from four or five, which does not bear thinking about, to 14 or 15 years, which is considered old, are engaged in prostitution. It can truly be regarded as a sacrifice of the lambs.  The betrayal and violence involved in child prostitution is a crime against humanity.</P>
    <P>I am sure the public is wondering what Ireland can do to prevent people in authority, be they parents, police forces, etc., acting as pimps selling young children for sexual purposes.  Can this problem be addressed by Irish legislators?  Can we stop a mother, a corrupt police officer, government official, street trader or pimp putting an innocent male or female child on the streets of Thailand tonight to engage in prostitution?  We cannot but we can hopefully put in place a mechanism that will deter Irish citizens from availing of services which may be offered to them on a sex holiday by ensuring they are charged with a crime on their return to Ireland. That is the best this Bill can offer.  I know the Minister has some reservations about the Bill although I welcome the fact that the Government is accepting it.  It is an historic occasion for a Fianna Fáil Private Members' Bill to be accepted by the Government.  I appreciate it will take some time for the Bill to go through Committee Stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would be grateful if the Minister would indicate the <Col N="624" /> type of mechanisms that will be put in place, when they will be put in place, the type of penalties that will apply for criminal offences and whether they have to be specified in the Bill.  The Minister has said it will be a matter for the Whips but I ask her to give some timescale for the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make some brief comments about this short but important Bill which puts down a marker for the whole world on where Ireland stands in relation to child sexual abuse, paedophilia and child prostitution.  It is an indication that we are willing to prosecute our citizens who have any involvement in such activities while abroad.</P>
      <P>I compliment my colleagues, Deputies O'Donoghue and Ryan, for bringing forward the Bill and thank the Minister and the Government for accepting it.  Child sexual abuse, paedophilia and child prostitution have become prominent issues in our society of late but these problems have been on the increase in other countries for many years.  It is alarming to hear that package sex holidays are organised to Thailand, Cambodia and southern Asian countries, often veiled by exotic advertising.  As the level of vigilance increases here in relation to child sex abuse, paedophilia and child prostitution, the attention of the paedophiles will turn to other areas and locations where they are not known and the law is more lax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill marks a major step forward in imposing the jurisdiction of the Irish courts on child sexual offences committed abroad.  Its provisions will also apply to those who aid and abet or act as go betweens in the international pornographic trade.  This is a welcome development as it brings the law here into line with our obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the position in countries, such as the United States, Australia, Germany, France, Sweden and Norway. <Col N="625" /> legislation is in the pipeline in a number of others.</P>
    <P>Child prostitution and sexual exploitation must be viewed as a crime against humanity.  It is a global problem which demands an international response.  It can only be tackled by co-operation at an international level and law enforcement similar to what is proposed in this Bill.  There is a need for more stringent enforcement of the law in the land where such acts are perpetrated.</P>
    <P>Anti-poverty measures are also of importance in preventing this trade. When foreign aid is provided the purposes for which it may be used should be specified.  It should be allocated to the areas where most good can be done. In this regard our missionaries and agencies, such as Trocaire and GOAL, have an excellent record.  Fr. Shay Cullen has highlighted the scale of the problem in Manilla where he has done tremendous work and outlined ways by which it may be resolved.</P>
    <P>There must be a heightened sense of awareness among Governments, police forces, judges and religious leaders of the need to ensure that poor families are not duped by offers of employment for their children who, in many cases, end up as prostitutes in the sex tourism industry.  This must be stopped by international law and co-operation between international police forces, such as Interpol, in breaking up paedophile and pornographic rings.  There is a need for vigilance as I understand the Internet system is now being used by those involved in the sex trade.</P>
    <P>I hope some of the measures I have outlined will be implemented in the near future in the fight against this trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the debate last evening with a sense of shock, horror and total disbelief.  Having read an article about Fr. Shay Cullen and the enormity of the problem in Manilla, I am prompted to say that something has to be done.  For that reason I compliment Deputies Eoin Ryan and O'Donoghue for drafting this <Col N="626" /> Bill and the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, for accepting it.  It mirrors exactly how we feel about the abuse of children, be it at home or abroad.  It is important, in keeping with our obligations under the UN Convention, that we are seen to play our part in ensuring that these monsters are not allowed to continue to walk free.</P>
      <P>When one looks at the countries where this is a major problem the common denominator is that each of them is underdeveloped economically.  In most cases the children concerned are handed over by their parents who because of their circumstances are unable to maintain them.  In turn, they become the property of pimps who ruthlessly exploit them to the extent they are subjected to physical torture.</P>
      <P>It is stated in the article to which I have referred that the number of cases involving abuse in Manilla doubled to 1,586 last year.  This is appalling.  There was a time when the sex tourism industry was confined to consenting adults, but nowadays many people who live ordinary lives under the mask of normality travel to south east Asia to engage in such activity.  This should not be tolerated given that the self-esteem of the young people left behind is shattered.  They feel that they are somehow guilty and dirty.  In the light of recent revelations concerning paedophiles here, it is important that we are seen to take action against these people and ensure that it is regarded as a crime, not a disease.  We need to show to the world that under no circumstances will this behaviour be tolerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need to mobilise the international community to take action and ensure unity of purpose in eradicating this problem.  There is also a need to ensure that in providing aid the emphasis is laid on the education aspects, the need for training and the concept of self help to provide the families who feel they have to give up their children with a sense of hope and purpose.  This should be done as quickly as possible, <Col N="627" /> with the assistance of the international community, to eradicate this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Deputies O'Donoghue and Eoin Ryan on having introduced this important Bill and the Minister on having accepted it, demonstrating that Private Members' time need not necessarily be devoted to motions only, sometimes to no effect, but can be devoted to Bills through which we can achieve something.  If the members of Government can listen to the views of the Opposition we can achieve something really positive.  It also proves there is no need for a weighty tome in order to achieve something important.  A mistaken view is that unless a Bill runs into volumes its provisions are not worthwhile.</P>
      <P>This issue is one that affects all of us. Many Members have referred to regions in which child prostitution is an industry.  We deplore the behaviour of those who leave this country to engage in such unthinkable, unmentionable habits abroad and they should rightly be brought to book here if that behaviour is against the law.</P>
      <P>The issue is a worldwide one, constituting an overall comment on society in general.  It leads to questions about how modern technology is used, how it can lead to some people forming behavioural ideas they might not have contemplated in the past.  Some Members have referred to the use and abuse of the Internet which is part of the problem in tackling the overall problem of child sexual abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Bill before us undertakes one fundamental, specific task, I am sure the Minister would agree it is not the beginning and end but rather tackles a series of loopholes that must be closed, leading to greater awareness within our society.  Any suggestion that such occurrences only take place abroad is not correct.  While they may be more obvious or organised and constitute more of an industry abroad, paedophilia is appalling and unthinkable whenever <Col N="628" /> and wherever practised.  As a parent I find it impossible to understand the urge that would drive people to abuse children in the manner that came to light in the Father Brendan Smith case and as portrayed in a television documentary I saw recently about a choirmaster in Canada whose name I cannot recall.  It was astonishing that this practice there was known to so many people, yet the system failed in its attempts to deal with it.  It took some 20 years, and many destroyed lives, to bring the individual responsible to book.</P>
    <P>We must tackle the worldwide sex tourism industry, which is growing within Europe and elsewhere.  We are taking measures to combat it, but it is not something with which Ireland can deal in isolation.  Next year during our Presidency of the European Union, the Minister, in her capacity as President of the European Council of Justice Ministers, should adopt a European-wide legislative programme to counter these awful practices being perpetrated within Europe and elsewhere.  It is an issue we should be seen to be the fore in tackling.</P>
    <P>The importance of this type of Bill cannot be exaggerated.  While Members have spoken about the limitations and precision of its provisions, I am thinking of tackling it on a much wider front.  It is an international industry, though that is a peculiar description of it, that appears to be on the increase.  There are many reasons, not least of which is the social deprivation in many countries.</P>
    <P>When one examines the types of countries in which this appalling industry thrives one discovers they are those experiencing horrendous internal social problems.  Tackling those social problems on a global scale will play a part in eliminating that industry and this is the only manner in which we can guarantee the protection of children.  Whatever their nationality, colour or creed children are equally precious and we must ensure that everything possible is done for their protection.  I look forward to greater developments to tackle this horendous problem on a wider front.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill and the fact that the Minister has indicated the Government is supporting it. If necessary, it will be amended to tigten up various technicalities to render it operable.</P>
      <P>The image of a well-built German, American, Australian, Swedish, Irish or English male walking along a street hand in hand with a child in Thailand is one many people have seen in documentaries on child prostitution.  It is that chilling, absolutely unforgettable image which has prompted many parliamentarians who have had access to the Far East, Thailand in particular, to initiate legislation in their national legislatures to deal with this issue of child prostitution.</P>
      <P>The existence of a thriving trade in children's bodies has been well documented.  For example, in 1989, the United Nations Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery reported that worldwide child prostitution may involve millions of children. The problem is particularly severe in Asian countries.  Due largely to the work of ECPAT &mdash; End Child Prostitution in Asia &mdash; and other dedicated groups, individuals and legislators, this is now receiving serious attention from the world community.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputies O'Donoghue and Eoin Ryan on having introduced this small Bill which has large implications and very much welcome the fact that it is being accepted by Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of our people were introduced only recently to the term &ldquo;paedophilia&rdquo; as a result of controversies and revelations and the collapse of the previous Government.  Many of them may never have heard of paedophilia in any specific sense until the Father Brendan Smith case came to the fore.  The practice of paedophilia is a type of deviant sexual preference for engaging in sexual activities with children, by and large facilitated by privileged access to children by a parent or other person in authority.  In the absence of privileged access, a paedophile can travel abroad <Col N="630" /> in order to buy access to extremely poor child prostitutes.</P>
    <P>This issue has been receiving serious attention within the international community and is reflected in Article 34 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which provides:</P>
    <P>States Parties undertake to protect the child from all forms of sexual exploitation and abuse.  For these purposes, States Parties shall in particular take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent:</P>
    <P>(a)  The inducement or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful sexual activity;</P>
    <P>(b)  The exploitative use of children in prostitution or other unlawful sexual practice;</P>
    <P>(c)  The exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials.</P>
    <P>In 1991 the European Council of Ministers adopted a recommendation to all member states on sexual exploitation, pornography, prostitution of and trafficking in children and young adults.</P>
    <P>We have witnessed incidences of incest and child abuse in this country. The very term &ldquo;child abuse&rdquo; has been almost diluted through overuse, masking the horror of the physical act of rape or sexual interference with a child.  I understand that child prostitution is one of the most extreme, horrific manifestations of the crime of child abuse.  Ron O'Grady, on behalf of ECPAT, has written a book entitled <i>The Rape of the Innocent</i> outlining the facts behind the trade in child prostitution in Asia which makes for extremely disturbing reading. Most people would prefer not to dwell overlong on the issue of child prostitution.  Mr. O'Grady makes it clear that the principal or root cause of child prostitution, in all societies, is extreme poverty, as a result of which many Asian families are literally persuaded to sell their children into slavery.  In some such countries, such as Thailand, there are <Col N="631" /> villages in which almost every household has sold one or more daughters into prostitution.  These children are regarded as no more than commodities, a sort of cash crop to be reared for sale. The sale of one daughter yields them sufficient money on which to live for some ten years.  This leads them to think of their daughters as silver and gold, as one man was quoted as saying in Ron O'Grady's book.  Once sold on to brothels, those children are rented out to customers in exactly the same way as one would rent a hired car.</P>
    <P>While it is imperative that measures such as this Bill be introduced by national legislatures in all European Union member states, it is obvious that the problem of child abuse, whether on a domestic or international scale, will never be eliminated until children cease to be perceived as commodities or possessions but rather as human beings in their own right, whose rights the State should defend and vindicate.</P>
    <P>If the Dáil is truly committed to the principle that children should be protected from abuse and exploitation, a huge amount can be done in legislation.  We cannot yet claim to have even minimum standards of child protection on the Statute Book.  While the Bill is welcome in demonstrating our willingness to protect children in other jurisdictions, we need to clean up our own act with regard to prosecution policy as it applies to our children.</P>
    <P>The perception of children as a possession is not confined to the villages and slums of Asia.  It is also very much alive and well in our Constitution, which guarantees to protect the family in its constitutional authority, and which also protects the inalienable and imprescriptible rights of parents.  This has created huge difficulties over the years for State authorities when trying to determine the degree to which bodies such as health boards may intervene in cases of suspected child abuse or neglect.  Generations of children have suffered because <Col N="632" /> of this reluctance to put aside the constitutional rights of parents over their children.</P>
    <P>The Constitution does not specifically protect children's rights, apart from the unborn.  Prosecution rates are abysmal in the State.  For example, in the case of prosecution rates for sexual offences against children, only one in three cases which go to the Office of the DPP from the gardaí and health boards are prosecuted.  I have had cause to criticise these rates of prosecution, question them and call for a review of prosecution policy in the State with regard to child sexual offences.</P>
    <P>Our conviction rates are even worse. It is amazing to look at the diminishing numbers of cases.  Hundreds of cases are reported to the health board, yet we have conviction rates in single figures for a given year.  Our prosecution policy must be addressed in this area.</P>
    <P>We have many homeless children, especially homeless boys living in Dublin.  People who work with them have indicated there are suggestions that homeless boys sell their bodily integrity in Dublin.  There appears to be an extraordinary absence of attention to this issue.  Will the Minister indicate if she has any information as to the existence of child prostitution or of boys under the age of consent involved in prostitution in this city?  Some allegations were investigated, but there was not a conclusion or a firm result on this matter.</P>
    <P>The reporting of cases is problematical, for example, we still do not have mandatory reporting.  This recommendation of the Kilkenny incest report is still at discussion document stage.  Our policy is not thought through.  We do not have a register of sex offenders or licensing of care workers, who have privileged access to children in all sorts of situations, such as in orphanages and residential homes.  There is a general laxity regarding the kinds of people who are allowed to work and have privileged access to children.  The Minister must, therefore, look into the licensing of care workers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="633" /> The right of the child to freedom from sexual abuse goes hand in hand with the obligation of the State to bring to justice those who offend against children.  Recent cases which have revealed the non-prosecution of child abuse cases, because of lapse of time, which resulted in the DPP deciding not to prosecute, have given cause for concern.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of information generally about prosecution policy in this area in the State, and action and good policy can be based only on good statistical information.  However, we do not have solid information in the State on the rates of child abuse, and what is worse, no study has been undertaken with regard to those cases of alleged child abuse which have been brought to the State's attention by the victims.</P>
    <P>On 3 October 1995, I asked the Taoiseach, by way of parliamentary question, to state the number of cases alleging child sex abuse currently awaiting decision by the DPP, whether there was an increase in the volume of such cases over the last three years, and whether he would make a statement.  According to the Official Report, 3 October 1995; Vol. 450, col. 644, he made the following, regrettable, reply:</P>
    <P>I have been advised by the Director of Public Prosecutions that the cost and the required commitment of scarce resources in his Office to produce the statistics and information requested by the Deputy would be out of proportion to the value of the information obtained.</P>
    <P>Not only is this information unavailable, the number of cases awaiting determination in the DPP's office is not available, and in spite of a parliamentary question the Government does not consider it important enough to obtain.</P>
    <P>The issue of delay and child abuse prosecution will come into play in this legislation also, because if a case is to be taken, delay is always a feature of the reporting of child abuse if we appear to have a very ingrained policy, based on not to prosecute child sexual offenders where there has been a delay in making <Col N="634" /> a complaint.  Deputies will recall that it was this excuse, that there was too long a lapse of time from the alleged complaint, which caused the failure to extradite Brendan Smyth.  This feature crops up again in many of the cases which have come into the public arena in recent weeks, where, for example, a file went to the DPP and a determination was made by him not to prosecute on the grounds of a lapse of time.  It crops up regularly in child abuse cases, and is something we must look at.</P>
    <P>There is incontrovertible psychological evidence that children face specific difficulties in making complaints, and that they often delay because of threats from the abuser, through fear of being disbelieved or because they may be so young that they lack the vocal skills to articulate what happened to them.</P>
    <P>Delay is a feature of all child abuse cases.  The policy of allowing delay to be a bar to a prosecution flies in the face of a very strong statement in the Supreme Court that delay should not be a factor in dismissing a prosecution where the offender has contributed to the delay by threatening the child or because the child is subject to his authority.  It would be an irony if Irish paedophiles were being prosecuted under this Bill for having abused children abroad when insufficient controls and inadequate policy mean that paedophiles who abuse children in Ireland walk free.  Too many have escaped justice because of a raft of policy and precedent which tends to disbelieve the child and believe the abuser, and which protects inordinately the rights of the accused over the rights of the victim.  Unless the rights of children are given real protection under Irish law here where we have real control over policy, and until the State takes real and worthwhile measures to protect Irish children from abuse and exploitation and ensures that child abusers are denied sanctuary, whether in relation to offences abroad or in this jurisdiction, the genuinely meant expressions of concern for children's welfare which we heard tonight and last night will be very much empty rhetoric.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="635" /> It would be wrong to concentrate only on the Asian countries.  We need to be aware that sex tourism happens in countries like Spain as well.  The Minister made a rather cryptic remark in her opening speech when she said there was evidence that some of this tourism emanates from Ireland.  The Minister of State who is here may not be in possession of that information, but it would be interesting if the Minister would expand on that aspect of her speech.</P>

      <P>I join with the other Members of this House in congratulating Deputies Ryan and O'Donoghue on introducing this important Bill.  I am sure the Deputies had to devote a considerable amount of time to preparing it, and we would all consider that time was very well spent.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice has informed the House that the Government is prepared to back the Bill, subject to certain amendments likely to be required.  I am delighted the Government has taken such a positive attitude to this Bill.</P>
      <P>Child prostitution is a phenomenon in many parts of the world.  It has been estimated that over one million children, and perhaps many more, have been forced into that monstrous trade in Asia alone.  That is a staggering, appalling statistic.  No Deputy in this House would hesitate to say that we must do everything in our power to bring the exploitation of children in that way to an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the factors that undoubtedly contributes substantially to child prostitution is the so-called sex tourism trade. This industry has developed largely because the laws protecting children in developed countries have been tightened and because of the ease with which foreign travel can be undertaken to countries where the same safeguards have not been put in place or at least do not operate very effectively.  It is difficult to imagine that any Irish person would seek to take advantage of or become involved in what can only be <Col N="636" /> described as a disgusting trade, but it has become clear that some of our citizens have done so.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House provides a legislative framework which targets the activities of Irish citizens and residents who travel overseas to sexually abuse children.  Unfortunately up to now paedophiles in this country could avoid prosecution for offences committed against children abroad.  That escape route has been cut off.  When the new legislation is enacted we will have the means to ensure that these individuals will not be able to avoid the consequences of their terrible crimes.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Justice, Deputy Nora Owen, pointed out in her statement, there are gaps in the Bill, and she will bring forward a number of amendments on Committee Stage.  I also understand from Deputy Ryan's contribution last night that his party has proposals to amend the Bill.  We would all agree that what is required is that the text should be comprehensive, and I have no doubt that Deputies on all sides of the House will be prepared to cooperate to make sure that the final version will be as effective as we can possibly make it.</P>
    <P>I take the opportunity to pay a special tribute to the organisations playing such a significant part in the fight against child prostitution throughout the world. They have saved thousands of children from that horrible fate, and in the process the people involved have often had to face great dangers.  It is difficult to express appreciation for the contribution those parties have made towards protecting the human rights and lives of children who would otherwise have been exploited and abused, but I am sure we all fully appreciate the work they have done and their extraordinary commitment.</P>
    <P>I am very happy to have had the opportunity to speak on this Bill, and thank Deputies for their generosity in granting me time.  This Bill will identify Ireland as a member of the international community that has taken special steps to protect the children of the world and <Col N="637" /> assist in the elimination of the vile trades of child prostitution and child sex tourism.  These are objectives we all support, and I look forward to the early enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Earlier it was asked when the next Stage will be taken.  This is to be agreed between the Whips.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to share my time with Deputies O'Donoghue and Eoin Ryan.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to both Deputies for introducing the Bill.  It is an illustration of a pro-active legislative input from the Opposition which is to be welcomed.  I welcome also the Government's endorsement of the principle of the Bill and its agreement to proceed to Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>This Bill is long overdue.  It sends out a clear message that this country is not prepared to tolerate child abuse or child prostitution either here or abroad, or the participation in such activities by Irish citizens.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, we have child prostitution in this country also.  Young people are engaged in prostitution in our capital city and throughout the country.  We cannot be complacent about that.  We must take strong measures to deal with it.  We are all agreed that child prostitution and the enslavement of children in this type of activity is to be condemned.</P>
      <P>The established governments of the western world tend to approach issues such as this in the Third World, in the Philippines and Thailand, with a degree of complacency and to feel there is not much they can do about it.  This Bill endeavours to show that we can do something about it and that Irish citizens who engage in such activities in these countries will be treated as outcasts and criminals and have the full rigours of the law brought to bear against them here if evidence materialises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to have a much stronger input at the UN and through various international agencies to root out this type of activity.  It is estimated that <Col N="638" /> every year one million children world-wide are forced into child prostitution. As many as ten million children could be potentially enslaved in child prostitution, the sex industry, sex tourism and pornography generally.  That illustrates the international dimension to this problem and the need for resolute Government action.  Unfortunately there is a perception among the public that the international authority and agencies such as the UN are not powerful enough and do not have the resources or the will to deal with this crime and eradicate it from society.</P>
    <P>I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to Fr. Shay Cullen who has worked for many years in the Philippines.  He has been a motivating force behind the publication of this Bill and raising consciousness on this subject.  In many ways Fr. Cullen illustrates the outstanding impact Irish missionaries have had in the Third World in highlighting issues of human rights, injustice and the rights of children.  We often forget the outstanding pioneering work carried out by these missionaries.  They have been our greatest ambassadors and put their lives at risk in the fight against dictatorships, corruption, Mafioso etc.  They have worked with, for and on behalf of people and shine like a beacon.  We should never underestimate their contribution in the fight for human rights and justice, a contribution which illustrates the need for the Government to allocate extra funding to them.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the Bill because it focuses on the rights of children.  It is only in recent years that modern society has begun to address the fundamental rights of children.  I was struck by the fact that the White Paper on Education did not deal adequately with these rights and hope the Bill will influence our attitude to them.  It is our duty and responsibility as legislators to ensure that those rights are upheld in all cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate and the <Col N="639" /> Government and Ministers for supporting this very good legislation.  The acceptance of the Bill sends out a clear message that we are willing to tackle this unsavoury subject.  The Jubilee Group in England which has been campaigning for many years to have similar legislation enacted is delighted that this Bill will be enacted here as it believes it will send a message to the UK Government that it should implement similar measures.  It is unfortunate that the UK Government is dragging its heels on this issue and any help we can give in ensuring that similar legislation is enacted there is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I thank Fr. Shay Cullen for the support he has given us.  He has done fantastic work in the Philippines and given us the benefit of his experience.  He has been dealing with this problem for many years and knows what needs to be done. Happily he is now working with the Filipino Government in trying to eradicate paedophilia from that country.  I wish him every success in this major task.</P>
      <P>I also wish to thank Ann Badger who works with ECPAT in England for the help she gave us and for sending us the material we requested.  Finally, I thank Deputy O'Donoghue for his input to the legislation.  It was very interesting to work on a Private Members' Bill which I am delighted is being accepted by the Government.</P>

      <P>Paedophile offences stretch across every spectrum of society.  In this context it is important to note that paedophile offences are not confined to any one class or creed. Given their special place in Irish society, naturally there has been a concentration of publicity on the Catholic clergy in recent months.  It is important to point out that only a very small minority of the Catholic clergy have transgressed in the area of child sexual abuse.  While these occurrences were of public interest we should not lose sight of the fact that child sexual abuse also exists, perhaps to a greater degree, in other professions and callings.  Presumably <Col N="640" /> because of the humility of their calling the clergy have not highlighted the fact that they have been at the coalface of human calamity wherever it has occurred for many years, if not centuries.  It would be remiss of me, therefore, if I did not avail of the opportunity to remind the public that while a very small minority of the clergy have transgressed in the area of child sexual abuse a far greater and more significant number of them have been to the forefront in the fight against child sexual abuse wherever it has occurred.</P>
      <P>The man who led the fight to ensure that the Government would accept this Bill was the Columban priest, Fr. Shay Cullen.  To the best of my knowledge, this is only the fourth time in the history of the State that a Government has accepted an Opposition Bill.  While the Bill has been favourably received it is important to emphasise that the many other worthwhile and meaningful Bills brought before the House by Fianna Fáil during the past year have been shot down by the Government in an archaic and undemocratic fashion which ill befits a modern democracy.  The practice of dismissing important legislation is not what democracy is about in the final analysis.</P>
      <P>It is of fundamental importance in cases where Catholic bishops report members of the clergy to the authorities as a matter of justice that people's names are not published.  Every man and woman has a right to a fair trial and it is important in the context of this Bill and other criminal legislation to recognise that an individual is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  Over the years we have seen how people who have been prejudged in newspapers regarding certain offences have subsequently not been extradited or prosecuted for that very reason.  Inasmuch as any private individual has the right to be treated as innocent until proven guilty so too does a member of the Catholic clergy or any other profession or calling in this democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been evident for some time &mdash;<Col N="641" /> the Director of Public Prosecutions recently emphasised this &mdash; that there is a need for a unified prosecution agency. There is too much duplication between the Director of Public Prosecution's office and the State solicitors at county level.</P>
    <P>I warmly thank my friend and colleague Deputy Eoin Ryan with whom I had the great pleasure of working on this Bill.  The Irish people and I extend deepest thanks to Fr. Shay Cullen, Trócaire, the Jubilee campaign, ECPAT, the Methodist Church, Christian Aid and Ann Badger who helped so much in leading the fight to have this Bill enacted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Galway city is one of the fastest growing cities in Europe. It has a steady population of 52,000 which rises to between 80,000 to 100,000 during the tourism season and in winter there are an extra 14,000 students.  At all times the population is approximately 65,000.  At present sewage is collected in main sewer pipes from all parts of the city and discharged into Galway Bay at three locations.  Several plans have been prepared over the past 25 years to install a proper sewerage system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planning of the proposed scheme started ten years ago.  Plans were drawn up in 1987 and on 1 December 1988 the <Col N="642" /> Department of the Environment advised that an environmental impact assessment should be done.  On 9 October 1989, the city council noted the environmental impact assessment and various submissions from the public and passed the following resolution:</P>
    <P>That the proposed Mutton Island outfall drainage scheme incorporates secondary treatment from the outset and that the Minister for the Environment be requested to give early approval to the proposed scheme with preparation of contract documents for the scheme.</P>
    <P>Six years later we have not advanced on that.  On 23 June 1993 the application for funding for the scheme was sent to Brussels but a decision was not made. During the past ten years the level of pollution on our beaches has got progressively worse and Ballyloughane Beach near where I live has ceased to be used for bathing even though 15 years ago it was a safe family beach. Because of the continual pollution of Galway Bay, Salthill lost its Blue Flag status this year.  Pressure has built up in Galway to get the Commission in Brussels to make a decision &mdash; a fortnight ago 5,000 signatures in support of the Mutton Island project scheme were collected on one day.</P>
    <P>At my request Mr. Joe McCartin, MEP arranged to meet with Mr. Wulf-Mathies, Commissioner for Regional Affairs earlier this week and the two other MEPs for Connacht Ulster joined with him in supporting this scheme. Unfortunately a Labour MEP purporting to speak on behalf of the Labour Party told the Commission that the Labour Party was opposed to sanction for the proposed scheme.  I presume this spokesperson was misinformed and I am sure the Minister will be able to correct that statement in his reply.  Such statements transmitted to the Commission are holding up sanction for the scheme.  This week a letter dated 24 <Col N="643" /> October 1995 from the Commission to the Department of the Environment was faxed to local radio station Galway Bay FM.  In spite of my best efforts, a record of this letter could not be found in the Department up to 5 p.m. yesterday.  This is extraordinary &mdash; but more extraordinary is its contents which seem to raise several matters already dealt with.  It is written as if plans were prepared for an alternative site, but this is not so.  The letter refers also to the marina at Mutton Island but there are no plans for a marina in the proposed scheme.</P>
    <P>It is six years since the proposed scheme for Mutton Island was sanctioned by Galway Corporation and the Department of the Environment but it has not yet been sanctioned by Brussels. If we have to begin to plan a new scheme on land we do not own, it will take at least another six years and the current Cohesion Funds will be exhausted.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and all those who are misguided in their opposition to the proposal for the treatment of sewage in Galway city to end the scandal of a city of 60,000 or more people pumping its raw sewage into the sea.  Galway Bay has reached its saturation point and will take no more sewage.  The sooner the scheme is sanctioned the better.  I appeal to the Minister of State to ask the Minister for the Environment &mdash; to whom I spoke today on this matter &mdash; to put pressure on Brussels to sanction the scheme which was agreed six years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McCormack for raising this important matter.  An application has been with the European Commission since July 1993 for Cohesion Fund assistance for the construction of the Galway main drainage scheme.  This is a major infrastructural proposal designed to provide <Col N="644" /> secondary sewage treatment for Galway city and its environs in accordance with national and EU environmental standards.  A number of elements of the project have already been approved for Cohesion Fund assistance.  Work on the Knocknacarra portion of the collection system is already under way.  Work will soon commence on the corresponding Oranmore section.</P>
      <P>Since early 1994, the European Commission raised a series of questions with the Department of the Environment about the proposal to provide a secondary treatment plant on Mutton Island. The latest development in this correspondence is a letter of 13 November 1995 from the Cohesion Fund director to the secretary of the Department of the Environment in reply to a letter by the secretary of 11 May.</P>
      <P>There has been some confusion about the date of dispatch of the recent Commission letter and when it was received in the Department of the Environment. The original of the letter has apparently been posted and has not yet reached the Department.  A copy of the letter, bearing the date of 13 November 1995, was faxed to the secretary of the Department yesterday afternoon.  Contrary to what has been suggested, the Department did not conceal the existence of the letter, or prevent disclosure of it, for the simple reason that the letter was not in its possession before now.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment regrets that public representatives with a close interest in the Galway main drainage scheme should have been embarrassed by the apparently prior disclosure of the Commission's letter to media and other interests.  He considers that the lack of protocol involved was regrettable and proper arrangements must be found in future for the release of such correspondence by the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment intends that a full substantive reply to the latest arguments advanced by the <Col N="645" /> Commission will be made as soon as possible.  He does not intend at this immediate point to anticipate the content or substance of that reply.  His overriding concern is, however, to have this necessary environmental project advanced with minimum delay for the benefit of the water quality in inner Galway Bay.</P>
    <P>The proposal to provide a sewage treatment plant at Mutton Island was advanced in an environmental impact study prepared by Galway Corporation in 1992.  The Minister for the Environment determined the environmental impact assessment in July 1993 by certifying that the proposed development would embody the best practicable means to prevent and limit significant adverse effects on the environment, subject to specific modifications stipulated by the Minister.  These related to mitigation of effects on birdlife, odour control and archaeological excavation of Mutton Island prior to any construction work.</P>
    <P>Following the EIA determination in July 1993, the Save Galway Bay group was constituted.  The group commissioned a study from a UK based engineering and environmental consultancy.  This study, which was postdated and not available to the EIA process, was sent by the group to the European Commission.</P>
    <P>There followed a series of requests from the Commission to the Irish Government about the suitability of the Mutton Island proposal.  Initially, the Commission made clear that its principal concern was that the Mutton Island proposal might be costlier than a viable alternative at Lough Atalia.  This is no longer an issue, given that an independent report obtained by the Commission demonstrates Mutton Island to be the most economical of all the realistic options.</P>
    <P>The Commission subsequently wrote to the Department of the Environment in March 1995.  On this occasion, it <Col N="646" /> made clear that its principal concern was with the effect of the Mutton Island proposal on the special protection area for the protection of bird habitats which had been designated for inner Galway Bay.  The Department replied to this concern on 11 May pointing out that the alternative site identified by the Commission at Lough Atalia was equally covered by the special protection area and that the national parks and wildlife service had in any event certified that the impact on bird habitats would be minimal.</P>
    <P>The Commission's latest reservations about the Mutton Island proposal, as expressed in the letter of 13 November 1995, have a different premise.  They are principally centred on the visual impact of the proposed causeway and possible effects on sediment movement.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment does not wish to comment at this stage on the merits of these latest arguments. He is somewhat concerned, however, about the implications of the Commission's approach for the EIA process. Under the 1985 EIA directive, the duty of establishing systems for the environmental impact assessment of major projects is placed on member states.  In accordance with this obligation, member states throughout the European Union have designated a variety of national and &mdash; or local authorities to act as competent authorities in determining EIA matters.</P>
    <P>If the Commission is seen as a court of appeal in relation to EIAs determined nationally, then this will have important implications in terms of subsidiarity and finality for the EIA process. In the present case, the Commission has effectively indicated a preference for a particular alternative location in Galway.  Again, this may have problematic implications for the fair conduct of any future EIA in relation to this site, given that we would be looking to the Commission to assist in cofinancing the project.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="647" /> The Minister regrets the protracted nature of the correspondence which has been necessary in this case.  He is determined to advance an early and effective solution to the pollution problems of Galway Bay.  He will ensure that further discussions with the Commission are focused on an early finalisation of this difficult matter.</P>

      <P>Thank you, Sir, for allowing me raise this matter and the Minister of State for coming in to reply.</P>
      <P>This problem arises from the refusal of the Department of Social Welfare to make unemployment benefit payments to a number of dockers in Waterford city from 21 November 1980 to 10 December 1980 and from 4 May 1981 to 28 May 1982.  During those periods the men involved were in dispute with their union and signing each week at the local labour exchange to indicate their availability for work.  However, they did not receive payments from the Department of Social Welfare and they were available for work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their initial appeal, after their social welfare payments were restored, was heard by an appeals officer on 15 November 1984.  I am told that during the hearing that officer cited an article from the <i>Irish Press</i> as one of the reasons for refusing to pay them unemployment benefit.  In fairness, the appeals officer involved denied this version of events. However, it would be difficult not to be aware of what was being said at that time.  Subsequently, the <i>Irish Press</i> apologised for its article which would <Col N="648" /> invalidate a reliance on that story as a basis for argument.</P>
    <P>When I first became involved in the case, I contacted the then Minister for Social Welfare who referred my representations to the new appeals office.  I was surprised to receive a letter, dated 3 October 1991, indicating that the case had been further reviewed by the original officer who refused the application. In fairness, and without casting aspersions on the individual involved, it would have been more prudent to involve a different officer so that justice could be seen to be done.</P>
    <P>Some time afterwards the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, agreed to refer the matter to the social welfare tribunal and this was indicated to me by letter dated 30 July 1993. When there was no sign of further movement I made more inquiries.  On 30 December 1994 the secretary of the tribunal informed me by letter that the papers were being referred to the chairman of the social welfare tribunal.  On 9 March 1995 I was informed by the new secretary that the reason for the delay was that the tribunal had not sat for the previous two years and that this was the only case with which it had to deal.  I then knew the reason for the lack of urgency.</P>
    <P>During my dealings with the tribunals in the past few years, four different secretaries have been involved.  That says something about the importance the Department attaches to their role.  After trying unsuccessfully to have the tribunal reconstituted, I was eventually told in October 1994 that various nominating bodies had been contacted. When they submitted their recommendations, the secretary was informed that he must try again as the four-person board did not constitute two men and two women, part of the Government's over-preoccupation with gender balance.  Eventually in June 1995 the new <Col N="649" /> social welfare tribunal came into force. All I had to do then was get a date for the hearing, or so I thought.</P>
    <P>Following several unsuccessful attempts to get a date for the hearing, bearing in mind that I was told on three separate occasions that the case was before the tribunal, in desperation I put down a parliamentary question to ascertain a date for the promised hearing and that was listed for yesterday.  In reply I was informed, for the first time, that the tribunal can adjudicate only in cases where the stoppage of work or trade dispute took place on or after 1 June 1982. As indicated earlier, the dispute with the Department ended on 28 May 1982, four days earlier.</P>
    <P>I will inform the House what the Rights Commissioner, who was involved subsequent to this problem, stated in 1994 about the men for whose just entitlements I am fighting:</P>
    <P>I have always had a very high regard for the true Waterford dockers whom I have met and worked very successfully with since 1990.  Above all I admired their strong character in adversity over ten years and their loyalty to a just cause and their integrity that when a deal is struck, it sticks.</P>
    <P>Some of the men involved have passed away and others are sick and elderly.  I call on the Minister to intervene to ensure this injustice is finally righted and the men involved get what is rightfully theirs.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me an opportunity to reply to this matter.</P>
      <P>Social welfare legislation provides that persons involved in a trade dispute are not entitled to receive unemployment payments for the duration of the dispute.  Persons not participating, or directly interested, in the dispute are exempt from this disqualification.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that later.  There were two separate disputes at Waterford Docks, the first lasting from 21 November 1980 to 10 December 1980 and a second from 4 May 1981 to 28 May 1982.  The persons concerned were involved in both disputes.</P>
      <P>A claim for unemployment benefit or assistance in a trade dispute is decided initially by a deciding officer of my Department.  If a worker is dissatisfied with the decision he or she may submit an appeal to the independent appeals office.  In a case involving a trade dispute, an oral hearing of the case would normally be convened by the appeals officer at which both parties involved in the dispute would be requested to put forward their views on the matter.</P>
      <P>The persons concerned were disqualified under the trade dispute provisions from receipt of unemployment benefit and assistance for the duration of the disputes by a deciding officer.  These disqualifications were subsequently upheld by an appeals officer following two oral hearings.</P>
      <P>I understand that the matter was further examined by an appeals officer in November 1984 in relation to a claim for benefit from another worker involved in the disputes mentioned. This appeal also proved unsuccessful. Following representations by the persons concerned in 1991 the matter was referred on two occasions to the chief appeals officer for further examination. Having considered the matter fully he concluded that there were no grounds for reopening the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues involved in the case have been the subject of detailed consideration by appeals officers on a number of occasions.  Under the legislation, an appeals officer's decision is final and conclusive and may only be revised in the light of new evidence or facts. <Col N="651" /> However, any person who is dissatisfied with the decision of an appeals officer may appeal the decision to the High Court on a point of law.  No such appeal was made in this case.</P>
    <P>Social welfare legislation also provides that a person involved in a trade dispute who is dissatisfied with the decision of a deciding officer and an appeals officer may apply for an adjudication of the matter to the social welfare tribunal.  In the normal course a referral to the tribunal would be made immediately following an adverse appeal decision on the case and it would be unusual for a referral to be made, as in this case some 11 years after the trade dispute ended.  In this case, however, it was pointed out that recourse to the tribunal was the only avenue available under social welfare legislation to have the case reopened.  The papers were, accordingly, referred to the tribunal in August 1993.  Unfortunately, as the Deputy said, there was a considerable delay in making the necessary arrangements to have the case heard.</P>
    <P>When the papers were re-examined in recent weeks it became apparent that the tribunal did not have the jurisdiction to hear the case.  The tribunal's jurisdiction commenced on 1 June 1982 and it is not open to the tribunal to adjudicate in relation to any dispute not in existence on or after that date nor would it be open to the Minister to request the tribunal to do so.</P>
    <P>I regret the delay in resolving this matter and that incorrect advice was given as to the appropriateness of this course of action.</P>
    <P>The matter was further considered by senior officials in my Department as late as this evening with a view to ascertaining whether it might be possible to look again at the case in the event of a miscarriage of justice.  There does not appear to be any such evidence at this stage but if the Deputy wishes to make a further submission on whether the <Col N="652" /> persons concerned were available for work, that can be considered but no guarantee can be given.</P>

      <P>I tabled this question in light of the judgment given by Mr. Justice Keane in the High Court on Friday stating that Southcoast Community TV was entitled to an injunction requiring the Minister to reconsider its application for a licence to rebeam British television channels to areas of Cork and Waterford.  It has been rebeaming for over ten years without being granted a licence.  This non-profit making organisation services more than 30,000 homes for an annual fee of £30.  This has been of benefit to the elderly, those on low incomes and the unemployed.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that the judge said it has been possible to accommodate the group since it first set up in 1985 within the UHF band since it operated regionally and this has been the case notwithstanding the contemplated addition of a new national programme service.  He further said there was no evidence that the existance of the group's rebroadcasting system affected the economic viability of the cable system operated in Cork city by Cork Communications for the past 13 years as the signal is not received in Cork city.  I call on the Minister to grant the licence to Southcoast Community TV.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Cork by-election campaign the Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, made a solemn promise to a packed public meeting in Carrigaline that he would grant such a licence.  He has reneged on that promise.  The company had to pursue a High Court action and <Col N="653" /> did not receive any assistance from the State.  Its victory is one for the community.  The Government should, on foot of the High Court decision, grant the company a licence immediately. This saga has gone on for too long and all political parties share responsibility for it.  It has now received a favourable judgment from the High Court and there is an onus on the Government to respond to that.  Many people in Cork are sceptical about the promise made by the Taoiseach.  The High Court judgment presents the Taoiseach and the Government with an opportunity to honour the promise made a year ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the High Court case taken against the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications by Southcoast Community TV and the judgment in that case which was read out on Friday last, 10 November.  I am very pleased at the speed of the judgment in this case, particularly in light of the complex and difficult issues laid before the court for consideration. That judgment, reportedly the longest given by the High Court, is very detailed and the judge has not yet issued a final written and approved copy of it.  Under those circumstances, the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot give a definitive comment at this stage.  It is important that the judgment be examined in detail and all the implications fully explored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The High Court has confirmed the existing statutory basis of the licensing regime in the area of multi-channel television services.  In addition, the court has explicitly confirmed the Minister's duty to regulate the use of the radio frequency spectrum in the national interest.  In that context, the Minister must have regard not only to good frequency management to ensure quality services to television viewers but also, among other things, to implement stated <Col N="654" /> Government policy and objectives, for example, those explicitly provided for in legislation, such as the provision of a third independent television channel and the Irish language channel, Teilifís na Gaeilge, both of which are to be provided on a nationwide basis and the provision of new digital services in the near future.</P>
    <P>The judge also granted to Southcoast Community TV the right to have their application reconsidered by my Department.  In fact, I anticipate the Minister writing to Southcoast in the very near future to invite that application and look forward to receiving the detailed information necessary to pursue the matter further.  I am naturally not in a position to say what the outcome of the Minister's consideration of its application might be, but the examination will be fair, impartial and concluded as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the Deputy may be aware that an injunction remains in place which prevents the defendants in the High Court case &mdash; my Department and Cork Communications Limited &mdash; from interfering with Southcoast's operations.  This is the interlocutory injunction granted to Southcoast last April and it continues to permit it to carry on its service for the time being.  That question, with the question of costs, is to be examined by the court shortly.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that the judgment in this case is long and detailed and requires further in-depth analysis before a more comprehensive statement on the issue can be made.  One reason for the length of the judgment, no doubt, is the underlying complexity of the technical matters dealt within it.  These matters are in turn what made the licensing of the spectrum for deflector systems difficult in the first place.  That is not stopping the Minister, however, from progressing the matter of an application by Southcoast and he will ensure that the <Col N="655" /> due process of examining that application gets under way as soon as possible.  Unfortunately I am not in a position to say how long the examination may take because the nature of the application or the amount of work necessary to analyse it is not yet precisely known.  This is an issue which will obviously become clearer through communication between my Department and Southcoast over the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the Minister is currently in the process of putting in place the mechanism to assist and facilitate the submission of an application by Southcoast and to ensure the fair and impartial examination of that application.</P>
    <P>It never ceases to amaze me that the Deputy ignores the fact that while his colleagues were in this ministry for some time after Southcoast was established, they took no action whatever&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire Stáit anois rud éigin a dhéanamh faoi seo.  Beidh mé ag éisteacht go géar leis an rud atá le rá aige.</P>
      <P>I have heard much from the Minister and his predecessor about the waiting list initiative.  In reply to a Dáil question I put down on 25 May the Minister boasted about it.  However, the waiting lists for orthopaedic operations are masked by the fact that it takes four years for a person to be assessed for orthopaedic treatment.  In his reply on 25 May the Minister said the patient about whom I inquired was placed on the out-patient waiting list on 4 March 1994 and should be called for an assessment within the next four years.  In other words, a person suffering severe pain could have to wait up to four years for assessment for an orthopaedic procedure.  That is clearly intolerable.</P>
      <P>Patients waiting for assessment for orthopaedic operations are often in severe pain.  All they get from the health board is a standard reply that an assessment cannot be carried out.  They are normally told that if their condition deteriorates they should get another letter from their doctor.  It is obvious that people who have already been sent by the general practitioner for assessment must be in need of orthopaedic treatment and are suffering pain.  It has been suggested that the answer to the problem is for people to queue jump on the basis of deteriorating condition, but that would obviously mean somebody else will go down the list.  The solution to this problem obviously does not lie in such an approach.  Finance must be provided so that everybody referred to a consultant for assessment is seen within a reasonable period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for an urgent crash programme of assessment in the Western Health Board area.  I accept the logical and inevitable result of such a programme would be to increase the waiting list for procedures.  That would bring to the surface the extent of the <Col N="657" /> underlying problem, which at present is masked by false statistics.  I call on the Minister to show compassion for the large number of people in the Western Health Board area who are in severe pain due to the failure to provide adequate funding for orthopaedic assessments and procedures.  Where serious pain is involved, it is unacceptable that lack of resources is used as an excuse.  Resources are found for many purposes and the State should provide adequate resources to ensure people are not left in severe pain.  I hope the Minister will have good news and that he will address this matter with the urgency it deserves.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue and providing this opportunity to discuss the work which has been under way to reduce waiting times for hospital treatment.  The Government has committed £8 million in 1995 to continue to reduce waiting times in a number of target specialties where such times are considered excessive.  Since the waiting list initiative commenced in 1993 a total of £38 million has been provided to tackle long waiting lists.</P>
      <P>It may interest the Deputy to know that one of the specialties targeted for attention over the past three years is orthopaedics and a sum in excess of £10 million has been provided over the last three years to increase orthopaedic activity.  Almost 5,000 patients have already received treatment as a result of this funding and an additional 1,785 inpatients and 700 out-patients will be treated this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="658" /> When the waiting list initiative commenced in June 1993, there were a total of 6,975 people on orthopaedic waiting lists.  Of these 3,186 had been waiting for a period in excess of 12 months.  By the end of September 1995, the numbers waiting for orthopaedic procedures had been reduced by 1,258 or 18 per cent. The numbers waiting in excess of 12 months have been reduced by 670 which represents a decrease of 21 per cent.</P>
    <P>These figures indicate that the waiting list initiative has resulted in higher levels of activity and shorter waiting times for the individual patient.</P>
    <P>It has been recognised that improvements to orthopaedic services in the Western Health Board area are required.  I welcome this opportunity to inform the House of some of the measures taken to alleviate the hardship currently experienced by some orthopaedic patients in that region.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that under the 1995 waiting list initiative, a total of £709,097 has been allocated to the Western Health Board which includes funding for the provision of an additional 235 inpatient orthopaedic operations.  This will bring the total number of orthopaedic operations planned by the Western Health Board in 1995 to 789, and current levels of activity suggest that this target may actually be exceeded.  Also included in the waiting list allocation is funding for an additional 300 outpatient appointments which should raise the number of outpatient attendances this year in the west to 3,688.</P>
    <P>The commitment to the long-term expansion of orthopaedic services in the west is reflected in the allocation of a further £70,000 in 1995 to the Western Health Board to enable the board to continue with the development in orthopaedics currently under way at Merlin Park Regional Hospital.  A sum of £400,000 has been allocated to the board in 1994 for this development which makes provision for two clean air <Col N="659" /> theatres with the necessary additional staffing which includes two consultants. The Deputy will be pleased to know that the new consultant orthopaedic surgeon will take up duty shortly, and the additional outpatient cover that this post will provide will help reduce overall waiting times for outpatients.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, many of us have been aware in recent years that a sizeable number of patients from Mayo who require orthopaedic surgery are obliged to travel long distances for treatment, either to Galway or other regional centres.  I am happy to report that approval has been given for the provision of an orthopaedic unit in phase 2 of Mayo General Hospital.  This planned <Col N="660" /> development, which will consist of a 33 bed unit and one clean air theatre, will greatly enhance the present range of health services available to the people of that county and enable the Western Health Board to carry out 1,000 orthopaedic operations annually and assess 1,400 new patients at outpatient clinics.</P>
    <P>The developments I have outlined will greatly alleviate the hardship currently experienced by orthopaedic patients in that area and are tangible evidence of a strong commitment to the continued improvement of orthopaedic services in the west.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 16 November 1995.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 97 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Grant-aid schemes for tourism are currently co-funded by the EU in most instances.  The primary vehicle is the Operational Programme for Tourism <Col N="515" /> (1994-1999).  Responsibility for administering and implementing the various measures under the programme rests with several Departments and agencies namely Departments of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Education, Marine, and Tourism and Trade; Bord Fáilte, Central Fisheries Board, CERT, Office of Public Works and Shannon Development.  A Tourism Operational Programme Co-ordinating Committee, chaired by my Department, with representatives of all the implementing bodies meets on a regular basis to ensure a coherent approach to the administration of the programme.  There is also a national monitoring committee for the programme, again chaired by my Department, comprised of representatives from the EU Commission, the European Investment Bank, Government Departments, the Tourism Agencies, Tourism Industry, Farming and Trade Union interests.  The committee has general responsibility for ensuring smooth implementation in pursuit of the set objectives.</P>
    <P>My Department, and as appropriate Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development, are also represented at the monitoring committee meetings of other Operational Programmes contributing to the development of the tourism industry e.g. INTERREG (Northern Ireland and Maritime), the Special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation and Rural Development and on the appropriate regional structures for monitoring the implementation of the Community Support Framework as a whole.</P>
    <P>Co-ordination of grant-aid for the tourism sector is a top priority, and the existence of these co-ordinating mechanisms will ensure that that priority is maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a continuing positive balance in our trade with Northern Ireland which in 1994 stood at £186 million plus.  In the first five months of 1995, the latest period for which CSO statistics are available, that trend has continued and a positive trade balance of £71 million has been recorded.</P>
      <P>In the period September 1994 to May 1995, exports to Northern Ireland amounted to £565 million, an increase of 7 per cent over the corresponding period the previous year.  During the same period imports from Northern Ireland amounted to £427 million, an increase of 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>This trend is not surprising.  For the past 25 years, economic development in the North has been seriously inhibited by the security situation there.  As the North attempts to develop its exporting sector, their exports, in the short-term, will tend to rise at a faster pace than our own.  This growth is also facilitated by the larger market available in the South.</P>
      <P>The situation is further exacerbated by a continuing slump in our live animal and meat preparation exports, which have fallen by £75 million since 1992.</P>
      <P>There are indications that both before and since the ceasefire, the overall figure for exports to the North was disguising a buoyant performance especially in the indigenous sector, supported by An Bord Tráchtála.  ABT client companies experienced increases of around 30 per cent in 1994 over 1993, and in 1993 over 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the emergence of a more integrated all-Ireland market will mean new challenges to exporters, particularly for certain firms, and certain sectors, here.  This is the inevitable consequence of increased mutual awareness and greater market penetration in both directions.  However, the overall result <Col N="517" /> should be a greater share of the all-Ireland market being held by Irish firms, North and South.  With increased inward investment to the North, the potential in the sub-supply area alone for southern exporters should be very significant.</P>
    <P>ABT's activity levels in support of southern firms in the northern market have increased since the ceasefire.  Specific initiatives taken by ABT include the production of 15 marketing guides for various sectors and a number of &ldquo;Meet the Buyer&rdquo; events.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Paper, tabled by the Commission at the December 1993 European Council, endeavours to identify an economic strategy, which can effect a major reduction in EU unemployment.  The White Paper focuses on three main areas &mdash; macroeconomic policy, competitiveness, and employment &mdash; overall responsibility for which lies in this country with the Ministers for Finance and Enterprise and Employment in this country.  Accordingly I propose to confine my remarks to those areas of the report relating specifically to trade and tourism policy.</P>
      <P>The White Paper noted that &ldquo;Each of the major bursts of growth in the European economies started with a qualitative leap in international trade&rdquo; and identified the integration of the former communist countries into the world trading system and establishment of the WTO as perhaps the beginning of another burst in economic growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trade statistics published by the Central Statistics Office for the first quarter of 1995, show our exports increasing by 19 per cent in value terms, compared to the same period in 1994 which was a record year with exports to the value of IR£22.789 billion.  This performance undoubtedly contributed to the strong performance on employment creation in <Col N="519" /> the recently published Labour Force Survey for 1994.</P>
    <P>The economic strategy in the White Paper also emphasised the importance of developing small and medium sized enterprises and stressed the necessity for European firms to have new and innovative products and services.  In this regard An Bórd Tráchtála is actively involved in assisting SMEs market their goods and services abroad.  Under the Operational Programme for Industrial Development, ABT assists Irish firms to develop new products and packaging to meet international market demands.  A new Services Programme is also being prepared by ABT to exploit the potential of the services sector.</P>
    <P>Accordingly to the White Paper, one of the comparative advantages which Europe enjoys, is the diversity of its culture and regions.  An important aspect of Irish tourism strategy is to market our culture and heritage.  Surveys confirm that almost half of all holiday makers visit places of cultural or historic interest.  Under the current Tourism Operational Programme, £125 million will be invested in natural/cultural tourism initiatives over the period 1994-99.</P>

    <P>The Minister is acutely aware of the importance of an adequate transport infrastructure to the development of exports and he will continue to liaise as necessary with the other relevant Ministers and Departments to ensure that Ireland's potential for overseas trade is not disadvantaged.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 90 together.  It is inaccurate to suggest that collaboration between Bord Fáilte and Northern Ireland Tourist Board is ineffective and ill-defined. In fact, the opposite is the case.  Bord Failte and Northern Ireland Tourism Board have collaborated successfully for many years in a number of areas.  In particular, they have forged close operational alliances in a variety of markets, they have undertaken a series of joint marketing campaigns and they have worked together on the tourism working groups of the International Fund for Ireland and the INTERREG Programme.  The benefits of such collaboration can be seen clearly in the growth of tourism revenue in both parts of the island.</P>
      <P>The advent of peace in Northern Ireland has created new opportunities for attracting additional visitors to the island of Ireland and the Minister is pleased to say that the public and private sectors on both sides of the border are demonstrating a strong commitment to co-operation for the benefit of the whole island.</P>
      <P>The commitment to cross-Border co-operation is particularly evident in the 1995 Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative under which £6.3 million is being spent on joint marketing campaigns to promote the island of Ireland as a single destination in our four most important overseas markets.  It is planned to have a similar initiative next year.</P>

      <P>The &ldquo;Today Show&rdquo; was broadcast live from Ireland on Channel 9 throughout Australia for one week last May.</P>
      <P>Because Australian travel to Ireland involves long lead time and detailed planning prior to booking, results will begin to be reflected primarily in the 1996 visitor statistics when they become available.</P>
      <P>Board Fáilte advise that there are, however, some encouraging indications that the broadcast successfully raised the profile of Ireland as a holiday destination.  There was a significant increase in the programmes' normal audience, peaking with 850,000 people viewing the programme at one stage.  Five television stations compete for audiences and over the week the number of all homes tuned to the Ireland Today Show was: Sydney, 54 per cent; Melbourne, 52 per cent; Brisbane; 59 per cent; Adelaide, 64 per cent; Perth, 58 per cent.</P>
      <P>In addition, the sponsor airline Cathay Pacific reported a 60 per cent increase in Ireland product sales for the month of June.  Harvey World Travel, the retail chain sponsoring the programme, received 70,000 entries for its Ireland viewer competition run during the broadcast.

ABT are projecting an increase of 17 per cent in indigenous exports to Europe for 1995.  Special emphasis has also been placed on encouraging companies to identify opportunities in the Northern Ireland market, and ABT are continuing their high levels of activity, in support of indigenous exporters, in Central and Eastern Europe, where considerable growth has already been achieved in recent years.</P>

      <P>As the Minister has stated a number of times since coming into office he does not propose to introduce a compulsory regulation system for all tourist accommodation.  He is not convinced that it would necessarily improve standards to any great extent whilst at the same time giving rise to endless policing and prosecution problems.  Of course, the ideal solution would be for all tourist accommodation providers to voluntarily seek approval.  He is hopeful that following the restructuring of Bord Fáilte, the associations which have been recognised by the board for the purpose of approving the B&amp;B sector will be successful in persuading more operators of the benefits of being in the approved sector.</P>
      <P>There are, of course, obvious disadvantages to operating in the unapproved sector.  Unapproved operators do not have access to official marketing through Bord Fáilte and the Tourists Information Offices and my Department and the Department of Finance were careful in the design of the implementation arrangements for the recent Pilot Tax Relief Scheme for Certain Tourist Resort Areas, and the new tranche of subsidised loans for certain Tourism projects, that only approved operators would be eligible.</P>
      <P>Unapproved operators are also obliged to comply with requirements, for example, in the areas of taxation, planning, fire and safety and hygiene in the same way as the approved sector.</P>

In addition, investment in such accommodation in any of the resort areas designated under the pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas may also qualify for generous tax incentives available under the scheme. There is also limited financial assistance available under the Tourism OP for specialist accommodation needs in certain, specific circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purposes of my reply I am taking Eastern Europe to consist of Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, the States of Former Yugoslavia, Albania, and the Baltic States.  Since 1992 our total trade with the countries of Eastern Europe has more than doubled from £97.8 million to £234 million.  Total imports have increased from £67.7 million to £102 million, with coal from Poland, £32.5 million in 1994, accounting for almost one third of the total.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This increase in imports must be seen in the light of a more than four-fold increase in our exports to those countries from £30 million in 1992 to £132 million in 1994, leaving Ireland with an overall trade suplus of about £30 million compared with a deficit of £37 million <Col N="529" /> in 1992.  In addition, Irish consultancy companies have done very well in competing for internationally-funded technical assistance projects in those countries.  I welcome this rapid growth in trade and particularly our very strong export performance in both goods and services.  An Bord Tráchtála, through its offices in Warsaw, Prague, and Budapest will continue to support indigenous Irish companies exporting to these markets.</P>
    <P>Ireland fully supports the development of closer economic links between the EU and Eastern Europe which should lead to further growth in trade in the coming years.  While some products from Eastern Europe will undoubtedly compete with ours in parts of the Single Market, it must be borne in mind that in return Irish exporters will have access to the rapidly growing markets of Eastern Europe which offer excellent potential for our indigenous exporters for years to come.</P>
    <P>The EU has power, of course, to adopt appropriate safeguard measures such as anti-dumping duties against imports from Eastern Europe found to be competing unfairly with Community, including Irish, products.</P>

    <P>The only insurance services provided by the Minister for Tourism and Trade are those which are associated with the <Col N="530" /> operation of the State export credit insurance scheme.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the export credit insurance scheme was restructured in 1991.

My policy is that the scheme should be operated in a way that assists the development of exports while taking due account of the need to protect the interests of the taxpayer.  I am satisfied that the scheme is serving both these objectives and that there are no grounds for changing its operating arrangements at the present time.</P>

      <P>I understand from Bord Fáilte that there are now over 200 tour operators operating from the US market to Ireland.  Of these 34 could be described as new to Ireland as they have introduced their programmes either this year or last year following encouragement and support from Bord Fáilte and other Irish tourism interests.  Bord Fáilte is currently negotiating with a further two major tour operators in connection with the introduction of new programmes to Ireland in 1996.</P>
      <P>The number of tour operators in Europe offering programmes to Ireland has shown significant increases over recent years and 45 new operators attended the Continental European Workshop in June last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall, Bord Fáilte's strategy is to encourage existing tour operators to <Col N="531" /> increase their level of promotion for Ireland and where there are gaps to encourage selective strengthening of the tour operator base.</P>

      <P>Since 1990 there has been a strong growth in the number of Italian visitors to Ireland increasing from 73,000 to 121,000 in 1994.  This represents an increase of 66 per cent in four years.  Comparable figures are not yet available for the 1995 season.  However, there are indications that the outbound holiday market from Italy generally has not performed strongly in 1995, primarily due to the weakness of the lira.  Bord Fáilte, who are the body responsible for overseas tourism promotion, plan a comprehensive marketing programme in 1996 to consolidate and seek further growth from Italy.  This marketing programme will include consumer advertising, publicity and a range of promotions directed at the trade and consumer to highlight Ireland's competitiveness as a general holiday destination.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>The number of CERT graduates in recent years were as follows:&mdash; 1992, 1,023; 1993, 1,065; 1994, 900 and 1995, 975.</P>
      <P>The fall-off in graduates between 1993 and 1994 was due to an extension of two programmes from one to two years.  There are no figures available on the proportion who remain in Ireland to work after graduation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="538" /> In addition to graduates, CERT places some 1,000 trainees who have completed their first year, of a two year course, in the tourism industry annually for the summer season, and approximately 50 per cent of them are available to the industry until they recommence their courses in November.</P>
    <P>Another 1,200 approximately of CERT's retraining programme for the unemployed are placed each year in suitable employment while the agency also provides in-service training for almost 7,000 employees in the industry per annum.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that one of the issues raised in the recent ITIC survey was recruitment difficulties and the lack of trained staff.  The Tourism Council has this year already carried out a study on manpower and training policy for the tourism industry into the 21st century. This highlighted a number of strategic issues arising in the area of training and human resource planning for the tourism sector, emphasising in particular how vitally important it is that the industry does more to project itself as a worthwhile and rewarding career for young people, and actively addresses those factors which create a negative perception.</P>
    <P>These and other aspects of future training for the tourism workforce are currently being considered by my Department in the context of CERT's draft strategic plan for the sector up to the turn of the century.</P>

      <P>While the maintenance of environmental standards is essentially a matter for the Minister for the Environment, the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999 acknowledges that the future of Irish tourism is linked <Col N="539" /> to the maintenance of a quality environment.  A guiding principal of the programme is that all developments must comply with best standards as established by the appropriate environmental authorities.</P>
      <P>Under the Operational Programme, the application of planning law is critical in ensuring that tourism developments are compatible with the best environmental standards.  Recent changes in Irish planning law together with the application of EU Environment Impact Assessment Directives are enchancing the trasparency of this compliance.  In addition, due account is also being taken, under the Operational Programme, of EU Directives related to the conservation of natural habitats and of wild flora and fauna.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Trade brief, it is now commonly accepted that a country with an environmentally friendly image has a competitive advantage in particular product areas, most notably in sophisticated and wealthy markets in Europe.  In the key German market, for example, which is our largest continental market, consumers rate Ireland second only to Germany itself as the &ldquo;greenest&rdquo; country in Europe.  To capitalise on this advantage it is necessary to ensure that we protect our position by giving substance to our &ldquo;green&rdquo; image through the rigorous application of all appropriate environmental standards.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 98 together.</P>
      <P>A primary objective of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999 is to generate foreign earnings of £2.25 billion per annum by 1999.  This will be achieved by increasing visitor numbers and most importantly by increasing visitor spend.</P>
      <P>The Marketing Sub-programme of the Operational Programme envisages a total spend on marketing activities of £125 million over the six years of the programme, a significant proportion of which support marketing campaigns aimed at high-yield markets such as conference and incentive business; quality niche and activity markets such as cruising, golf, equestrian, shoppers; and users of paid services such as accommodation and car hire.</P>
      <P>It is also expected that the current review of Ireland's brand image will play a part in positioning Ireland as an attractive destination to higher spending tourists.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The forthcoming visit of President Clinton and the attendant worldwide media coverage will undoubtedly provide a great opportunity for highlighting <Col N="541" /> Ireland as a desirable tourism destination and as a source of high-quality products and services.</P>
    <P>The White House Trade and Investment Conference last May highlighted the possibilities for matching US companies with Irish partners through mechanisms such as joint ventures, technology transfers, franchising and licensing arrangements.  A joint communique on tourism co-operation was also signed at the Washington Conference by the Minister for Tourism and Trade together with his Northern Ireland and US counterparts, which covered tourism promotion, the opportunities for increased US private sector investment in tourism development in Ireland and the possibilities for co-operation in training.</P>
    <P>Since last May, my Department and the agencies, ABT and Bord Fáilte, together with their Northern Ireland and US counterparts have been working closely on the follow-up to the conference.  It is hoped that there will be an opportunity during the course of the visit to review progress with Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and the other senior Administration figures and business people accompanying the President.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the forthcoming visit of President Clinton will provide a major boost to the promotional efforts of An Bord Tráchtála and Bord Fáilte in the United States and, indeed, in other markets and that both agencies will be seeking to maximise the publicity opportunities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Disabled person's maintenance allowance (DPMA) is the primary income support scheme operated by my Department for people who, because of their disability, cannot maintain themselves in the community.  The regulations governing eligibility for this allowance specify that a maintenance allowance shall not be payable to a person who resides in a health facility. However, where a disabled person's maintenance allowance recipient is admitted to a health facility, payment of the allowance is continued by a health board for the period during which the <Col N="545" /> person is maintained in the institution subject to a maximum of eight weeks in any calendar year.  A health facility is defined in the regulations as a hospital, convalescent home or home for people suffering from physical or mental disability or ancillary accommodation, nursing home for the care and maintenance of dependent elderly people and any other similar establishment providing residence, maintenance or care where the cost of a person's maintenance therein is being met in whole or in part by or on behalf of a health board.</P>
      <P>The reason a person in long-term institutional care does not continue to receive a disabled person's maintenance allowance allowance is that his/her essential maintenance requirements are being met.  I understand that in the case of a person admitted to a health facility on a short-term basis who forfeits entitlement to disabled person's maintenance allowance, consideration is given by health boards to assisting with any financial commitments &mdash; such as rent allowance &mdash; by way of supplementary welfare allowance.  In addition, a pocket money allowance may be payable by a health board to a person who is admitted to a health facility if that person has no means to support their day to day financial requirements.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, disabled person's maintenance allowance is in the process of being transferred to the Department of Social Welfare. Responsibility for the payment of disabled person's maintenance allowance transferred to the Department of Social Welfare on 1 August 1995, and it is expected that responsibility for the administration of disabled person's maintenance allowance will transfer to Social Welfare in early 1996.  I have no plans to change the eligibility criteria for disabled person's maintenance allowance pending this transfer but I will bring the Deputy's concerns to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Persons who are disabled from birth or who are not in insurable employment when becoming disabled receive disabled person's maintenance allowance (DPMA).  The current maximum rate of disabled person's maintenance allowance is £62.50 per week.  Persons in insurable employment who become disabled may qualify for disability benefit or invalidity pension. The weekly rate of disability benefit is the same as disabled person's maintenance allowance while the rate for invalidity pension is slightly higher at £64.20. However, it should be noted that disabled person's maintenance allowance recipients usually also qualify for the following additional benefits: free travel, free electricity allowance, free bottled gas, free television licence, free telephone rental allowance free fuel and footwear for children.  Because of these additional benefits many people with disability eligible for disability benefit or invalidity pension, opt for disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for administration of disabled person's maintenance allowance is transferring from my Department to the Department of Social Welfare from early next year so that that Department will be responsible for all income maintenance payments from then.  I should also add that the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities is currently examining income support as part of its wide remit covering all aspects of services and supports to people with disabilities.  Accordingly, any change in policy in regard to income maintenance for people with disabilities will be a <Col N="547" /> matter for consideration by the Department of Social Welfare in the light of the commission's recommendations.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> As the Deputy will be aware the provision of health services in the first instance is a matter for the health boards.</P>
      <P>Health centres play a crucial role in the delivery of primary and community health care.  The range of services which might be available from these premises is extremely wide.  It is a matter for the health boards to ensure that adequate necessary services are provided locally and also to ensure that these services are provided on an equitable basis to groups such as the elderly and vulnerable in society.</P>
      <P>The strategy document &mdash; Shaping a Healthier Future &mdash; recognises the crucial role of health centres in the provision of preventative and other services in the community and indicates that more health centres will be provided and existing centres will be improved.</P>
      <P>The development of services in the community will continue to gather momentum.  In line with the health strategy, community services will continue to be expanded on the basis of appropriate local catchment areas and healthcare needs.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Under section 61 of the Health Act, 1970, health boards may make arrangements to assist in the maintenance at home of persons who but for the provision of such a service would require to be maintained otherwise than at home.  This section empowers, without obliging, health boards to provide support services such as home help, laundry and meals.</P>
      <P>The organisation of the home help service in general came under the scrutiny in a recent report commissioned and published by the National Council for the Elderly in November 1994.  My Department is currently considering, in consultation with the chief executive officers of the health boards, a number of aspects of the home help scheme, including the overall organisation of the service and the variations from board to board.</P>
      <P>The report, <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> recommended that the health boards should appoint a co-ordinator of services for the elderly and that they should also maintain a register of elderly people at medical and social risk.  I am aware that the health boards, under the auspices of the public health nurse, currently maintain such lists.  Obviously such lists will indicate whether an elderly person is being cared for at home and the circumstances of the individual providing that care.</P>

      <P>Section 72 of the Roads Act, 1993, gives extensive powers to road authorities to make by-laws to regulate and control skips on public roads.  Such by-laws may, <i>inter alia,</i> specify requirements in relation to the lighting and marking of skips for the purpose of making them readily visible to road users.  A decision to make such by-laws is a matter for the elected members of individual road authorities.</P>
      <P>Under the Waste Bill, 1995, commercial waste collection will require a local authority permit.  Conditions attached to a waste collection permit may include requirements in relation to the receptacles, including skips, to be employed, and the identifying marks to be displayed on them.

      <P>Free travel companion passes have been available since 1990 to persons who qualify for free travel as the recipients of social welfare type payments in respect of a disability and who, on account of their disability, are unable to travel alone.  The free travel companion pass enables a person 16 years of age, or over, to accompany the pass holder free of charge.  The majority of <Col N="557" /> companion pass holders are either blind or mentally handicapped.</P>
      <P>Currently, the passes are available to the following:</P>
      <P>&mdash;recipients of blind person's pension from my Department,</P>
      <P>&mdash;people getting disabled person's maintenance allowance from a health board who are medically certified that they are unfit to travel alone, and</P>

      <P>Any extension of the free travel companion pass to include other categories of disabled people, who are unable to travel alone, would have cost implications which would have to be considered in the context of available resources.</P>

      <Quest>if he will reconsider his Department's decision to refuse fuel allowance under the national fuel scheme to tenants of Ballymun flats, Dublin 11, on the grounds that Dublin Corporation provide subsidised group heating; if he will reconsider this decision on the grounds of equity in view of the fact that his Department will grant a fuel allowance to people who have their own supply of turf, providing their expenses exceed £130 per year and as tenants in Ballymun have average annual heating costs of £213; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist qualified householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households for <Col N="558" /> 26 weeks, from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
      <P>If an applicant, or a person living with an applicant, rents a bog or pays to have turf cut, and the expense involved exceeds £130, the household may apply for a fuel allowance, once proof of expenditure is provided.  The fuel allowance is not expected to cover the full cost of heating for any individual; it is a contribution towards the heating costs of that person.</P>
      <P>In the Ballymun flats, the cost to tenants for subsidised heating is between £125 for a one roomed flat and £213 for a four roomed flat.  The subsidised heating is provided from September to May inclusive, which is approximately 13 weeks longer than the duration of the national fuel scheme.</P>
      <P>In addition to heating each room in the flats, the local authority also provides hot water 24 hours a day, each day of the year, the charge for which is also included in the above costs.</P>
      <P>In view of the facts that:</P>
      <P>(a)  the subsidised heating lasts for 13 weeks longer than the national fuel scheme;</P>
      <P>(b)  heating is provided in each room of the flat;</P>
      <P>(c) 24 hour hot water is provided daily for the tenant in Ballymun Flats and is included in the charge to the tenant,</P>
      <P>the local authority tenant in these circumstances would appear to be in a more favourable position than a person providing their own hot water and heating needs with the assistance of a free fuel allowance.</P>
      <P>The fuel allowance conditions are reviewed annually in the context of budget preparations, and I will bear in mind the case the Deputy has made in this regard.  Any changes would only be possible in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>The operational programme for tourism 1994-99 aims to concentrate a significant proportion of tourism growth in the shoulder and off-peak periods, with the specific target that by <Col N="561" /> 1999 75 per cent of visitors will arrive outside the peak July-August period.</P>
      <P>As well as encouraging investment in the development of tourist products suitable for year round business, the operational programme envisages that marketing will be a key instrument in securing the required shift of traffic away from the peak period.</P>
      <P>The marketing sub-programme of the operational programme envisages a total spend on marketing activities of £125 million over the six years of the programme and priority within the marketing sub-programme is given to supporting marketing programmes aimed at off-peak and shoulder periods.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the general promotion of Ireland as a holiday destination in recent years has been successful and that this has been reflected in increased visitor numbers and revenue. Specifically the concentration of tourist traffic in the peak July-August period has fallen from 34 per cent in the mid-1980s to 29 per cent in 1994 and I look forward to further progress in the coming years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111, 112, 113 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Angling Measure of the Operational Programme for Tourism provides for total investment of almost £19 million in the development of the tourism angling product over five years. I have already announced 34 projects, involving total expenditure of some £4 million, under this measure.  Almost £0.8 million, or 19 per cent of the allocation to date, has been allocated to projects in the Sligo-Leitrim area.</P>
      <P>The Central Fisheries Board and the Department of the Marine have responsibility for the administration and implementation of the Tourism Angling Measure.  The Central Fisheries Board is responsible for the day to day administration of the measure with the Department having overall responsibility for its implementation.  All applications for funding under the measure are subject to detailed technical, operational management and financial assessment by the Central Fisheries Board.  I will ask the board to advise the Deputy directly about applications on hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can, however, advise the Deputy that the North Western Regional Fisheries Board, which is responsible for the development of fisheries within its <Col N="568" /> region, has recently completed a development plan for Lough Arrow and also has proposals in relation to limited development of Lough Talt.  I understand, however, from the North Western Board that Lough Talt has limited potential from an angling tourism perspective.</P>
    <P>I can further advise the Deputy that £691,000 has already been allocated under the Tourism Angling Measure to the North Western Board's development plan for the River Moy.  The key objective is to develop the valuable salmon and trout fisheries of the Moy catchment to their maximum potential which will facilitate a potential increase of 200 per cent in angling tourists to the area.  Full details of the proposed developments are set out in the North Western Fisheries Board's development plan. In addition £92,000 has been allocated under the measure to specific development works at the renowned Moy Fishery in Ballina.</P>
    <P>Angling tourism has the potential to become a significant contributor to the Irish economy.  The strategic objectives of the Tourism Angling Measure are to deliver on this potential through significant investment in Ireland's game, coarse and sea angling resources thus creating a unique tourism angling product which will increase the annual number of angling tourists to 250,000 by the year 2000 and create up to 1,000 new jobs mainly in the more remote and disadvantaged regions.</P>
