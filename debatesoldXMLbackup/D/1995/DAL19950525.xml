      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business the House will hear expressions of sympathy on the death of the former British Prime Minister, Lord Harold Wilson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with a sense of sadness that, on behalf of my party, I pay tribute to the late Lord Wilson, former British Prime Minister.  He represented the constituency of Huyton which I believe has one of the largest Irish communities in Britain.  He had a long-standing interest in Ireland and a practical interest in the benefits that could be accrued for Irish people as a result of good Anglo-Irish relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the age of 31, having had a brilliant academic career &mdash; he was one of the most brilliant people of his generation in Oxford University &mdash; he was appointed as President of the Board of Trade one of the youngest Cabinet members in the history of British Government.  During his long ministerial career he had to face many difficulties &mdash; some of which have returned to cause problems for his successors in Britain and elsewhere &mdash; not least of which was the appropriate valuation to place on his currency and the difficulties <Col N="1146" /> faced by any serving politician in Government in answering questions on a matter of that subtlety.  He was also a man who was not afraid to face a difficult debate in the House of Commons. On a number of occasions when particularly severe cuts had to be introduced, to sustain what probably turned out to be an unsustainable currency policy, because of his sense of courage and commitment to his colleagues, Harold Wilson as Prime Minister, insisted he would give the bad news to the House of Commons and face the criticisms.</P>
    <P>He was the subject of many criticisms; phrases he used in difficult situations throughout his life were turned to his disadvantage in subsequent criticism.  It is important, however, to draw attention to his personal qualities.  One of his most trenchant opponents throughout his political career in the Labour Party was a present member of the House of Commons, Mr. Tony Benn.  Speaking of Harold Wilson and the way he dealt with colleagues at a personal level, Tony Benn said he was an extremely kind man, probably one of the kindest persons he had ever met.  Such a statement from a person who was a strong opponent in a deeply turbulent party throughout their relationship is an indication of the personal quality and compassion of Harold Wilson in his dealings with other people.</P>
    <P>As a member of Government his achievements were notable.  Having studied his career for other purposes, probably one of his most notable achievements in terms of personal pride was the establishment of the Open University, something from which we have benefited.  That achievement was a notable application of technology to the improvement of the lives of ordinary people who do not have the privilege of attending university on a residential basis.  That initiative by him effected an improvement in the quality of the lives not only of British people but also of the people of this island because of the access to that facility we enjoy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1147" /> With the exception of Lady Thatcher, he was the longest serving British Prime Minister this century.  He represented a constituency with a large number of Irish people and, therefore, took a special interest in Irish issues.  He took decisive action in 1969 in bringing troops to the streets in Northern Ireland and in so doing saved the lives of an incalculable number of people who otherwise may have lost their lives as a result of a breakdown in security.  That cannot have been an easy decision, but it was most assuredly a correct and courageous one.  Some will say, with justification, he did not show a similar determination subsequently when the Ulster Workers Council strike threatened the viability of the Sunningdale Executive. That criticism is valid.  Perhaps part of the problem was that this Sunningdale Executive had been agreed to by a previous Prime Minister and was undermined by the intervening general election results in Northern Ireland which appeared to deny that Executive the confidence of the people there.  That is an example of how one should not allow the exigencies of party political change or transition to interfere with sound settled policy in the national interest. This is a measure all of us in this House, whatever our controversies &mdash; and there will be many &mdash; ought to recall.</P>
    <P>Harold Wilson did many other things in the course of his career which were particularly beneficial to this country. He agreed the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement of 1966 with the late Seán Lemass, with whom he enjoyed a particularly good personal relationship, one of the best relationships between two Prime Ministers of these two islands for many years.  As we all know, that agreement opened up this economy ultimately to Europe.  Finally, he was responsible for the return of the remains of Roger Casement to this country, a matter of symbolism, some might say, but a matter of reconciling symbolism of great importance for the improvement of relations between our two islands.</P>
    <P>I join with all those who will now pay <Col N="1148" /> tribute to the late Harold Wilson in conveying the sympathy of this House to his wife, Mary.  Mary Wilson obviously suffered a great deal during the course of her husband's career both in terms of the criticism she had to face and the isolation from her husband which was forced upon her by his duties.  At this time, in the evening of her life, having borne with him in a long and trying deteriorating illness, the feelings and sympathy of this House should go to her and her family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Taoiseach in expressing the sympathy of our party to the wife of the Late Lord Wilson and to his family.  The Taoiseach touched on many of the highlights of his career as a politician.  There are others to which I would like to lend my voice, in particular his achievement in regard to the Open University which provided an opportunity for ordinary men and women to enter third level education. That it became so popular so quickly and that other countries had access to it is a mark of great achievement for him.</P>
      <P>Another matter on which he had a huge influence was equal opportunities legislation.  He was particularly strong in pursuing that type of legislation and, under his premiership, labour legislation received a major boost.  Harold Wilson also introduced the system of appeal against unfair dismissal which, at that time, was a very innovative idea.  As is the practice in so many matters of a political and administrative nature, that system subsequently became law here too.  He had great vision on the rights of people and had many qualities as an industrial innovator, but his efforts in ensuring the rights of ordinary people in the workforce has left a lasting impression on a body of legislative reforms both in the UK and Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Harold Wilson was a great a believer in state intervention in industrial matters, and while there were many positive aspects to his career in the period from 1967-69, some had the idea that he had gone too far in regard to state intervention and a hands-on policy in that <Col N="1149" /> respect.  He had many different encounters with Ireland.  I believe he visited here in 1969 and met an ex-colleague of ours, the former Minister, John O'Connell, on one or two occasions.  Little came of those meetings but that was another indication of how Harold Wilson was prepared to look at matters in a different way.  He did not always follow the sure and easy path.</P>
    <P>Harold Wilson, at the age of 48, was the youngest member of the Cabinet and the youngest political head of the Board of Trade.  He had many far-seeing ideas.  I note particularly his achievements in regard to science and technology. His now famous speech at a party conference, to the effect that industry in Britain had to feel the white heat of technology, led to an awakening of industrial minds in regard to the unexplored area of research and technology which proved to be such fertile ground later.</P>
    <P>Our sympathies go to Lord Wilson's wife, who withstood many distresses in her life due to the exigencies of public life.  One of Harold Wilson's most famous phrases was: &ldquo;A week is a long time in politics&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I express the deep regret and sympathy of our party on the death of Lord Wilson to his widow, Mary, to his family and to his party colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Harold Wilson was elected to Parliament in 1945.  He remained in Parliament for the remaining 50 years of his life, 38 years in the House of Commons and 12 years in the House of Lords.  He was an outstanding leader of the Labour Party from 1963 to 1976.  During that <Col N="1150" /> period he won four general elections, more than any other leader this century. He was Prime Minister at a time of economic and industrial relations difficulties and of tremendous social change in Britain, a time when the vestiges of Britain's colonial influences were waning and when the importance of Europe was coming to centre stage.  It was a time when the impact of the media on politics became even greater.</P>
    <P>Harold Wilson led a Labour Party Government to power after 13 years of Conservative Government.  His time as Prime Minister was a period of tremendous challenge and achievement.  That record of achievement, particularly in the social policy field referred to, will stand as a monument to Harold Wilson and to the Labour Party he led with such distinction in Government.</P>
    <P>I will not attempt to review the whole of Harold Wilson's political life this morning but I would draw particular attention to just one aspect of it, that during his terms as Prime Minister, through both free votes and Government legislation, Parliament tackled a breathtaking range of social reforms. That period saw the establishment of the English and Scottish law commissions; the abolition of the death penalty for murder in 1965; the establishment of the office of Parliamentary Ombudsman in 1967; the setting up of the Open University referred to by the Taoiseach and Deputy O'Rourke; the decriminalisation of homosexual acts and the enactment of a raft of family legislation, including the Divorce Reform Act of 1969 which rationalised the grounds for divorce.</P>
    <P>Above all, in the social field, Harold Wilson saw the enactment of wide-ranging equality legislation beginning with the Race Relations Act of 1965, a further Race Relations Act in 1968, the Equal Pay Act of 1970 and the wideranging Sex Discrimination Act of 1975 which covered, among other areas, discrimination in goods, services and facilities and which also established the Equal Opportunities Commission.</P>
    <P>Harold Wilson was a gigantic figure <Col N="1151" /> in British politics.  His legacy is deep and enduring.  His work as Prime Minister and throughout his whole career was informed by a deep sense of morality, of purpose and vision.  He promised change and renewal and delivered on that promise until the last day he held office.  We will all miss him very much. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom that cheann an Pháirtí Daonlathaigh ar gcomhbhrón a chur in iúl do Bhean Harold Wilson as ucht an briseadh mór dí.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats Party, I join with the Taoiseach and Members in extending our sincere sympathy to the wife, family and friends of the late Harold Wilson, the former Prime Minister of Great Britain.  All involved in politics know the price that has to be paid by the family.  Harold Wilson made a particularly special contribution to politics in his own country. We can recall the excitement and the great hope that blossomed when he came to office because of his unique appeal.  His was a special contribution. There was a shift in the relationship between Ireland and Great Britain during that period.  We have to record today that Harold Wilson played a major role in helping to build better relationships and create a friendlier atmosphere between the Governments of Ireland and Great Britain.  The large number of Irish people in his constituency may have given him this special understanding.  It is appropriate on the occasion of his sad passing to his eternal reward that we should express our appreciation for the work he has done.</P>
      <P>He faced many major problems and history will record whether all his decisions were correct.  Today we can say that he made a very valuable contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased to hear the reference to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement of 1966.  I participated in that debate and the treaty did not receive praise from all sides of the House but history <Col N="1152" /> has shown that a good job was done.  In his memoirs Harold Wilson referred to the tough Irish negotiators and how he thought they had done better than the team he was leading.  I thought he paid a nice tribute to the then Taoiseach, Mr. Seán Lemnass, and to Jack Lynch and Charles Haughey, the three principal negotiators on Ireland's behalf on that occasion.  He has left a legacy that his family can be proud of and which we deeply appreciate.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Democratic Left I join with my colleagues in other parties in conveying our sympathy to the wife and family of the late Harold Wilson and to his colleagues in the British Labour Party.</P>
      <P>Harold Wilson was an outstanding political leader with a keen intellect and a shrewdness essential for success in politics.  Some of his critics have described him as a manipulative man but a fairer verdict is that he was a superb political tactician who was able to use the strength of his allies and exploit the weaknesses of his opponents.  Perhaps his greatest achievement following his election as leader in the early 1960s was to restore the sense of self-belief to the Labour Party which was at a low ebb after almost 15 years in Opposition.  That he led his party at four general elections in what were often the most difficult political and economic circumstances is an achievement almost without parallel in modern British politics.  That he did this despite the fact that his own party was often riven with internal dissent is testimony to his political skill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He had a genuine interest in Irish affairs and often liked to boast there were more Irish people living in his Liverpool constituency than in most Dáil constituencies.  He was the first British Prime Minister for more than 40 years to have to deal with the problem of violence in Northern Ireland.  If I did not always agree with his political judgment as to how it should be handled, there <Col N="1153" /> was no denying his genuine concern for the people of this island.</P>
    <P>Harold Wilson was very much a man of the post-war era in Great Britain and came to epitomise British politics of the 1960s.  One of his more enduring monuments from which thousands of Irish people continue to benefit is the Open University, one of his own initiatives. Harold Wilson was a unique figure among British Prime Ministers in that he voluntarily departed the political stage and determined the time and circumstances of his going.  He will be remembered for many pithy sayings.  &ldquo;A week is a long time in politics&rdquo; is one of the most memorable and it is likely he did not reckon with Irish politics when he thought up that.</P>
    <P>He will be remembered for his many achievements that have been outlined already.  I convey my sympathy to his family and friends.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Independent Group and my Green Party colleagues in Britain, who do not have an elected representative in that parliament, I join in the expressions of sympathy on the death of Lord Wilson.  I have largely childhood memories of the late Harold Wilson but for all that they are vivid.  His sure and confident voice and his perennial pipe marked him as somebody who belonged to an age different from today's age of Government health warnings.  He is to be remembered as someone who came from modest beginnings, a working class background.  Through his personal achievements and determination he leaves a fitting legacy for all, not just those in political life.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam uasail.</P>

    <Title>White Paper on Education: Statements (Resumed).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to participate in this debate.  Like other Members I received two copies of the White Paper, one a pre-production copy which was a modest document and the other a heavy, glossier document.  I compliment the Department of Education on its presentation and on the wonderful justice done to the Minister in the magnificent picture on the foreword.  In that regard she is only trotting after her colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>The White Paper is the outcome of one of the lengthiest and most comprehensive processes of consultation ever undertaken and by that I do not mean the lengthy process in which either the present or previous Minister was involved.  Many of the matters contained in it go back to 1984 and I am not sure they were original then.  There have been proposals for local education councils or boards since 1984 when the former Deputy Hussey was Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>The White Paper covers a wide range of issues.  I welcome the statement of objectives for educational policy set out by the Minister &mdash; the promotion of equality, pluralism, partnership, quality and accountability and the protection and promotion of fundamental human and civil rights, together with the promotion of social and economic wellbeing. That is what she calls the philosophical rationale of the document. While these are laudable objectives and I would not dare enter into a debate of substance on them, I have a different concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1159" /> If the policies contained in it are followed, the White Paper will shape education policy for many years.  It would be absolutely wrong to undertake a major recasting of our educational structure if we were not determined that the new structure to be put in place would be durable.  However, given my background I am surprised there is very little in the White Paper or in the Minister's comments on it, about the resources which will be used.  In introducing the White Paper on 4 May the Minister dealt with the treatment of resourcing and while this is interesting and instructive &mdash; I do not find it at all surprising for reasons which I will come to in a moment &mdash; it does not get us anywhere. I strongly urge the Government to get more clarity on the question of resources before it goes any further with the process, which includes a number of Bills.</P>
    <P>Reading the comments of the Minister on 4 May I was reminded of the last minute in the twelfth round of a professional heavyweight fight.  The Department of Education in the White Paper has launched a ferocious assault on the Department of Finance &mdash;&ldquo;the Government will aim to provide during its period in office the resources for the development needs identified in the White Paper&rdquo;.  However, this haymaker of a punch is blocked by the Department of Finance which replies with a left hook &mdash;&ldquo;within the framework of the budgetary parameters set out in the Government of Renewal Policy Document&rdquo;. It then delivers a right cross, &ldquo;including the acceptance of the Maastricht Treaty convergence conditions&rdquo; and follows this up with a body blow &ldquo;the amount which can be made available in any given year will have to be decided by the Government in the context of its financial position and its other public expenditure priorities at that time&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That looks like the end of the match so far as the Department of Education is concerned but it makes a counterattack by referring to the needs of education and the principle informing the <Col N="1160" /> approach to funding, which we are told implies prioritisation on those with greatest need, diversified provision to meet varying abilities and aptitudes and that provision for education must take account of the nation's overall resources.  The Department of Finance is not without resources and makes a counterattack, &ldquo;this latter dimension embraces the priority needs of other social services, for example, the health and social welfare services and the budgetary and fiscal parameters underpinning the management of the public finances, including Ireland's international commitments, specifically (and this is the final body blow) its commitment to the Maastricht Treaty convergence conditions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What are we to make of all that?  I know what goes on there having sat in on innumerable arguments of that kind where the Department of Finance, which is trying to retain some control of the future course of expenditure, is countering all the arguments other Departments bring up.  When it cannot convince one by referring to what it is doing today, it puts it in a wide context and says this is important socially or politically or it puts it in an even wider context and says we cannot be the only people in the world who do not do this. This type of toing and froing and punch and counter punch is clearly set out in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>At the end of that exchange the two participants are absolutely exhausted; they are in a clinch and there is no clear winner.  All we have is blood on the canvass and sweat all around the place and nobody knows what the outcome will be.  We then find there is a rematch and there is another short sharp bout.  The Minister for Education comes back and puts the whole process of education policy into the context of wider economic and social planning by saying &ldquo;This integral linkage of education into economic planning processes builds upon authoritative reports in recent years from national and international bodies, for example, the National Economic and Social Council and the work of the <Col N="1161" /> Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  It also reflects the central place afforded to education in successive national understandings with the social partners&rdquo;.  That is a very shrewd shaft indeed, it is telling the Department of Finance it is unaware of the wider important context of the argument and it is just being bloody-minded by refusing to give <i>carte blanche</i> or an open cheque for this whole process.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance then comes back with a very crafty counterattack and says &ldquo;Though it may not always have been recognised, the debate on the allocation of resources to education is at the centre of the debate on economic policy.  In short, in the context of funding of education the White Paper establishes the importance of investment in education rather than seeing education simply as a social service expenditure&rdquo;.  That looks fine and eyes light up in the Department of Education because they think they have made their point.  However, then comes the killer blow, &ldquo;Accordingly, the White Paper establishes key benchmarks for the continuous evaluation of investment in education by the Government in the context of the annual consideration of the priorities for public expenditure&rdquo;.  We are back again to stalemate and are still none the wiser about what will be done to put all these principles into effect.</P>
    <P>This is not what a White Paper should do; it should not leave us in a state of total uncertainty about what will be done.  Unfortunately, this White Paper does this because it contains no projections for the future and no plan, however aspirational, on how the principles enunciated or the practices recommended will be given effect.  It does not say what this means in terms of education or investment and it does not set out the kind of investment, the period or the balance between the different sectors of education.  All we are told &mdash; I understand this is subject to confirmation &mdash; is that the implementation of all the proposals set out in the <Col N="1162" /> White Paper would involve the expenditure of some £1.2 billion over the coming decade.  We are not told how much of that is current expenditure or capital. Neither is there any breakdown by sector &mdash; we are not told how much of that will be for primary, second level or third level education, special education or education for people with special needs. Other Deputies may have heard more about this than I have, all I have heard is that it has a price tag, not officially confirmed, of approximately £1.2 billion over the next decade.  That seems to be a lot of money and in all conscience it is.</P>
    <P>The four Estimates for 1995 that are principally involved in education &mdash; the Office of the Minister for Education, first level education, second level and further education and third level education &mdash; come to just short of £1.9 billion.  If the proposals in this document cost £1.2 billion over the next decade I assume that is £1.2 billion in current money terms.  If that were spread evenly over the next ten years it would be an increase of 6.3 per cent per annum in educational expenditure in addition to whatever else is involved in maintaining the current level of services or the current provision.  It may be that a case can be made for spending money in that way.  It may be that I am wrong to assume it would be evenly spread.  Some of it could be front loaded, some of it could be back loaded.  If that kind of expenditure is the realistic ballpark figure for what is involved we are talking about a further increase of a very substantial amount in annual expenditure on education and it begs several questions.</P>
    <P>If we agree to spend, over the next decade, £1.2 billion more on education than we would otherwise spend, are the measures set out in the White Paper the best way of doing it?  If we find that over the next decade we can spend £1.2 billion more than we would otherwise, would we necessarily come to the conclusion that we would spend it all on education?  Are there other ways in which we could use it to the greater <Col N="1163" /> benefit of the national community, to people with disadvantages, to people who suffer some of the handicaps of not having access to the kind of education we would wish for them, rather than putting it into the measures contained in the White Paper?  I do not know and it is very difficult to judge that because we are not given any breakdown in this document of where the different expenditure items would fall or what the result of it would be.</P>
    <P>On page 24 of the White Paper there is a shortish section dealing with the provision to be made and the means of making provision for students with special needs.  I do not find anything there to which I can take exception.  In fact, I would support it.  Like many other Members I frequently meet people parents, managers of schools and people in voluntary organisations who are up against the problem of dealing with the educational needs of children with disadvantages of various kinds. While it is easy to say we should make better provision for them &mdash; I am happy to say the provision is improving year by year &mdash; I do not think they ever get the kind of consideration they should get.  I am sure other Deputies will agree that the tendency is to look year by year at what more we can do for the education of children with disadvantages of various kinds to see whether we can fit in some other little bit of progress in the context of what is available that year.  It is looked at on a kind of incremental basis and year by year we add in a little here and a little there and gradually we will make some improvement.</P>
    <P>I had hoped the White Paper would have reset the context and would have looked at the total provision.  I am thinking principally of primary level, but of primary and second level education in total, and that we would have looked at the total context of education at those two levels, the way we make educational provision for children with disadvantages, to decide whether a reordering of the priorities and the <Col N="1164" /> resources in those two parts of education &mdash; and particularly at primary level &mdash; would not give us a more equitable, compassionate and efficient result in terms of the achievement of our objectives in education, bearing in mind the special needs of some groups in our population.  That does not seem to me to be what is proposed in this White Paper.  I have read it very closely and I cannot find any real indication of that kind of reordering.  If that is not involved in this White Paper then I think an opportunity has been lost which the Minister should seek to regain when she comes back to us with the measures which are required to put this White Paper, or so much of it as will require legislation, into practice.</P>
    <P>I come to the question of investment. I have no information on how much of this £1.2 billion extra cost would comprise capital investment.  I find it difficult to envisage any major improvement or reshaping of our educational system over the next decade that would not involve some substantial amount of capital investment, perhaps not in buildings where on the whole quantitatively we are reasonably well supplied although not qualitatively.  If we are serious about some of what is contained in the White Paper we will require investment in equipment in our schools and in third level education.  There is no specification here.</P>
    <P>In page 37 of the document an item entitled &ldquo;Framework for Funding&rdquo; deals with primary level.  All the tables stop at 1995 and do not say anything about future years.  On page 40 under the heading &ldquo;Investment in Primary Education&rdquo; there is a warm picture of a teacher with four young primary school children and three paragraphs of text. The sharpest thing I can find in the text is the following:</P>
    <P>The provision of adequate resources for primary education will continue to be a priority.  National and international research indicates <Col N="1165" /> that primary education is fundamentally important in determining children's life chances.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Government has been well served by whoever put that draft together.  Quite honestly if I were asked to produce a statement about education I would be ashamed to produce that.  It seems to be so banal as not to need repeating: &ldquo;that primary education is fundamentally important in determining children's life chances&rdquo;.  I believe that and it is so much part of my being that I have a hobby horse about education which does not appear in this White Paper because it is probably not the popular or politically correct way to think about education.  I honestly cannot see that we will have additional expenditure of £1.2 billion available over the next decade on top of what is already built in, in terms of expenditure growth in education.  I suspect the Government did not see that that is available because if so it would have said it.</P>
    <P>From what I know about education and from what I hear as a Member and from meeting people constantly I come to fairly simple conclusions.  As with all simple conclusions they are capable of attack and outrage on all sides but there is a virtue in them.  If we believe what the White Paper says about the importance of primary education &mdash; which I believe firmly &mdash; surely it would be valid for us to ask whether we should take the following approach.  Since there is going to be a limitation on our resources and since we want to get an efficient result, should we not decide that for a period of years any extra resources we can put together for education should be devoted exclusively to the improvement of primary education, without which we will not get educational, social, spiritual, morale or economic value for money out of second and third level education?</P>
    <P>Should we not say that whatever period it takes, three or five years, that will be our period for getting things as right as we can in primary education and that we will follow that up by doing the same <Col N="1166" /> thing for second level education in our second period and then go on to third level education?  Unless we do that, not only will we do an injustice to a great many people, we will also frustrate part of our action at primary school level.</P>
    <P>Other Members will have had a similar experience to mine quite a number of years ago when I was amazed to be told by the principal of a vocational school in my constituency that one third of the pupils entering it for the first time were unable to read or write, although they had been through the primary school system.  He told me that his school was perhaps not typical of all second level schools but that it was certainly typical of the entry classes to vocational schools in areas with a similar population mix.  That indicates a major failure or deficiency in our primary education system.  There is not much point in spending more money on second and third level education if the primary level is inadequate.</P>
    <P>After all the consultations, we should have seen an analysis of that kind in this document, but we did not.  I suspect there is a good reason for that.  If the Government wants to produce a policy document with which everybody in every sector will agree, that document will not contain priorities because no group will admit that another group should have a higher place at the table. The parents' association of a secondary school, diligent, well meaning and well motivated people who are doing their job as they see it, will not agree that primary schools should get a better shake out of any resources allocated to education. However, it is the job of Government to decide those priorities and there is no analysis of that kind in the White Paper.  It suffers as a result and is less useful as a guide to what we should do for the development of education in future.</P>
    <P>I could say more in a similar vein about second and third level education. However, my point is that this White Paper does not deal properly with the priorities that should be dealt with if we are serious about getting the maximum <Col N="1167" /> impact from the very considerable resources we properly devote to the education of our children.</P>
    <P>I can impart education, but the process is a mystery to me.  I can learn, but that process is also a mystery to me, so I will not speak on the educational theory in the document but will leave it to others.  I will deal with the proposed structures.  One of the principal parts of this document deals with the establishment of education boards.  That idea seems to have been around at least since 1984.  The Minister for Education at the time, Gemma Hussey, proposed it in a White Paper.  The proposed boards were slightly different but they were still education boards so the idea was not new even then.  I was suspicious of it in 1984, and nothing I have heard or seen in the meantime makes me any more seduced by it today than I was then.  These boards are supposed to improve the quality, equality, efficiency, relevance and flexibility of delivery of all educational services but I cannot see how establishing ten education boards will improve quality, equality, efficiency and relevance.  It may do something about flexibility of delivery, but that is compromised by other factors referred to later in this chapter.  It is not, therefore, obvious that splitting the operation into ten different boards will do any more for the delivery of education services than eight health boards do for the delivery of health services.  This thinking was fashionable and current and perhaps even relevant in the 1960s and early 1970s, but it is far less relevant today.  If people looked honestly at our structures of public administration they would rapidly come to the conclusion that we do not need eight health boards, and I mean no disrespect to the people working in the health boards, the people working under the aegis of health boards or the members.  However a different structure is required today. Eight health boards were needed in the days before we had facsimile transmission and the kind of technology that allows us to put medical data on-line at <Col N="1168" /> the end of a computer terminal anywhere in the country.  They were a major improvement on the kind of fractionalised delivery we had from county health committees and it is not obvious that they are the kind of structure best suited to the requirements today.  Nor is it obvious that setting up ten education boards has any great advantages for our education system now, particularly in the light of the restrictions on what they do.  We are told in the White Paper of what is called the desirability of releasing the Department of Education from much of its current involvement in the detailed delivery of services to schools. That is fine if we want to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is a problem for the Department of Education, why is it not proposed that we should transfer its involvement in the detailed delivery of services to schools to an executive body charged only with that and not with policy making functions?  The Minister could then get irritating day to day problems out of her hair and concentrate on policy issues.  It is by no means obvious that the way to do that is to set up ten education boards, and it seems the Minister and her Department half suspect this because at page 166 we are told, in heavy black type, that the Government has decided that after a period of five years there will be a full independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the boards.  The Minister will say that that is a proper prudential provision, that we should not tell the boards <Col N="1169" /> that they can carry on <i>in saecula saeculorum</i> doing what they are set up to do now.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Department suspect that they may not have the right answer and are taking out insurance by saying they are not indissolubly wedded to this but can change their minds in five years' time.  Another decision is that there will be legislative reform and rationalisation of the vocational education committee system.  Although it is proposed to set up ten education boards to rationalise all the things the Minister wants to get out of her hair, we will still have a separate vocational education committee system.  Why?  I suspect the answer is that it was not possible to obtain agreement from the vocational education committees.  I do not see any obvious justification for having ten education boards plus a separate, albeit rationalised, vocational education system.</P>
      <P>What will these boards do?  They will have substantial co-ordination and support service functions but in carrying out these functions &ldquo;they will not impinge on areas of responsibility and discretion proper to individual school boards&rdquo;.  I do not know what that means.  How does it fit in with the rationale of education?</P>
      <P>They will also be co-ordinating bodies for adult and continuing education, vocational education and training and &mdash; as an afterthought &mdash; outdoor education centres in their regions.  They will channel Exchequer funding to the vocational education committees.  Why? Do we need another body to perform this function?  We already have a mostly adequate system to channel Exchequer funding to the vocational education committees.  The Department of Education either posts them the cheque or transfers funds electronically.  Why do we need education boards to do this? Our financial institutions already have good systems designed for this purpose. We do not need another body as funds are channelled to the vocational education committees without any great interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1170" /> The boards will be developed on a phased basis.  There will be statutory empowerment of the boards to recruit core staff, including a director, and to prepare draft plans for educational delivery for their regions within the context of national policy.  What does this mean?  To my mind it comes close to saying that the boards will have to prepare draft plans for what is already happening. We do not need more bodies to do this.</P>
    <P>There will be ten education boards. An illuminating map is to be found on page 168.  Unless I am wrong, with the exception of the county and city of Dublin for which there will be separate boards, the boards will be largely coterminous with the eight health boards.  I am not going to argue about whether there should be ten boards; it should be obvious by now that I think there should not be any education boards but at least there is an element of congruity.  We should be thankful for small mercies.</P>
    <P>Certain groups will be represented on the core board by additional agreed nominees.  In a document prepared by the Department of Education and agreed by the Government &mdash; this goes back to the time Deputy O'Rourke was in the Department and way beyond &mdash; under the heading &ldquo;Composition of the Board&rdquo; to my utter astonishment and amazement there is not one reference, good, bad or indifferent, as some of Deputy de Valera's colleagues would say, to gender balance.</P>
    <P>On the question of operational issues, it is accepted that the establishment of the new education boards will result in direct costs.  It is stated that concern has been expressed throughout the debate that the education boards might become an expensive bureaucracy.  That is the understatement of the century.  No one can point to any single instance in the history of public administration in this State where a new body did not become an expensive bureaucracy.  It is stated, in heavy type, that any additional costs will <Col N="1171" /> be outweighed by the positive outcomes, Unfortunately, these are not mentioned.</P>
    <P>If it is accepted that these boards will involve some extra costs, we should look at the alternative.  If we agree to spend extra money or additional resources on education, should we not make sure that better services for the children in our school are provided rather than new bureaucracies which need new chief executives and boards?</P>
    <P>It is stated on page 170 that the funding of schools will be protected by the provision of a separate budget line for school funding in education board budgets and by the publication of nationally determined criteria for the funding of schools.  This means that the Department of Education will continue to lay down policy.  The purpose in having separate budget lines is to make sure that the Department knows what is going on.  In addition, any plans will have to be approved by it.  The Department will continue to retain control in terms of how much money is spent, on what it is spent and how.  The only difference is that we will have this superstructure of ten supposedly independent education boards but because of the restrictions they will have little autonomy. If that is the case, there is no point in having them.</P>
    <P>On the question of staffing the following comment is made: &ldquo;Ministerial approval for the operational functions of the education boards will be contingent on there being agreement issues, including transfers and secondments&rdquo;. This includes the transfer and secondment of staff to the education boards from the vocational education committees and the Department of Education.  I suggest that these two and a half lines represent a minefield as it will be very difficult to work this one out.  No one should be under any illusions that this can be done quickly, easily and without contention.</P>
    <P>Restrictions will be imposed on the education boards.  In the section dealing with funding the following statement is <Col N="1172" /> made: &ldquo;Ultimately, all Department aids towards the recurrent expenditure of first and second level schools will be made by way of a block grant to the education boards subject to the retention of a centralised pay roll&rdquo;.  The Department of Education will continue to pay teachers in much the same way as it does now.  The safeguard to which I referred earlier is that there will be a separate budget line for school funding in education board budgets and nationally determined criteria for the funding of schools.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the funding of schools under nationally-determined criteria will be under outside control and retention of a centralised pay roll will mean that the Department of Education will continue to pay teachers.  What else will the education boards do?  It is said that approved schools will have statutorily-based entitlement to current funding on the basis of nationally-determined criteria and that additional funding will be made available, on the basis of locally-determined priorities consistent with national criteria.  This means that in those other areas also, there may be other small portions of money the education boards can spend but it will be done in accordance with national criteria and the statutory-based entitlements of schools.  I cannot envisage any expectation that these education boards will have a separate and independent role.</P>
    <P>Then I find that grant aid for vocational schools will be channelled, through the education boards, to the vocational education committees, so that the education boards will be nothing more than a <i>poste restante</i> for the money on the way to the vocational education committees.  I cannot see any great virtue in having these education boards, or that they will add anything creative to the manner in which our educational service is delivered.</P>
    <P>There are some useful suggestions in the White Paper to improve appointment procedures and for laying down criteria and guidelines to be followed in making such appointments.  We would <Col N="1173" /> all like to ensure that appointments are made as fairly as possible but there will be a framework, we are told, which will be sufficiently flexible to allow for the continuance of different arrangements, for example, in regard to the vocational education committee schools, or in any school where the employer is a board of governors.  In that regard I have to say: &ldquo;<i>Plus ça change, plus ça la même chose</i>&rdquo;; I cannot see what change is there.</P>
    <P>There are references to appointment standards where Exchequer funds are used to fund teachers.  I hope that is not an indication that somewhere in the Department of Education there remains a temptation to pursue the argument that we should interfere with the funding of teachers in fee-paying secondary schools because, if that argument is to be advanced, it should not be under the cloak of a rather mystifying phrase in this document, it should be brought out in the open.  There is no case for interfering with that procedure.  That argument is not advanced in the White Paper but it should be made clear so that people will know.  To my certain knowledge on every side of this House, within every party, there are Members whose children have been or are attending fee-paying secondary schools. Indeed much of the criticism we hear of the alleged priviliges enjoyed by fee-paying secondary schools is nothing more than prejudice without substantation. In any case, if one stops paying the teachers in those schools the children will move to State-funded schools, where the same number of teachers will have to be paid anyway, so there would be no gain from so doing.</P>
    <P>That is sufficient to cast doubt on the concept of establishing these education boards.  Indeed the more one reads through Part 5 of this document dealing with the &ldquo;Organisational Framework&rdquo;, the more it appears these education boards will be so circumscribed, so invigilated from outside, they will have very little, if any, independent function. If that is to be the case, there is no point in having them because the last thing we need is to spend money on an extra <Col N="1174" /> layer of bureaucracy rather than on teachers.  For example, if one looks at the summary of what will be provided in the education boards legislation &mdash; on pages 175 to 177 of this document &mdash; one will see that the education boards will not be the masters of what they do, but will be hedged about with criteria and conditions, in effect, with schemes of the Department of Education.  Therefore, it appears that these education boards will end up like the last chance saloon in a Hollywood set, nothing more than a facade, nothing behind it.</P>
    <P>I hope saner counsels will prevail, that we do not go to all the trouble and expense of establishing these education boards just for the sake of it.  People may very well argue that this is the voice of the centralised State still speaking.  It is not, because there is an enormous difference between what is called decentralisation and real devolution. Undoubtedly, these education boards will be decentralised but that is not devolution because they will not really have control over most of the projects on which they will spend their money; they will not have a creative input to education policy.  Decentralisation only is usually more costly than a centralised administration; it is not devolution; devolution is something that should be approached much more carefully.</P>
    <P>When we talk about European Union policy, we all talk about the principle of &ldquo;subsidiarity&rdquo;, which is that decisions should be taken at the level most appropriate to them and, in every case, as close as possible to the people who will be affected.  That is what devolution is about, and what most people think they have in mind when they talk about decentralisation, but that is not what we will get with this structure any more than it is what we get within our current structure of health boards.  What is proposed here and what obtains within our health boards is not decentralisation, but rather decentralised arms of a central administration where all the policy is still formulated at the centre.  It would be a scandalous waste of resources to do that in the education sector just for the <Col N="1175" /> sake of being politically correct and having the appearance of doing it.</P>
    <P>I hope I will not be out of order if, in conclusion, I make two passing references to the de Buitléir report which also features on today's Order Paper.  It is a much crisper document, dealing with third level education but it contains a fair bit of nonsense.  I am astonished that a body like this could produce some of these recommendations.  One recommendation is that there should be a capital test for eligibility for third-level grants which, it is proposed, should be based on the market value of capital, discounting the value of a principal private residence up to the threshold for residential property tax, discounting the first 50 per cent of the market value of agricultural land and disregarding the value of pension rights.</P>
    <P>What has any of that to do with people's ability to pay?  Or is it being suggested that, whenever people have capital assets and their incomes are just about or below the income threshold normally applicable in order to allow their children participate in third level education, they should divest themselves of their capital assets irrespective of what type of assets they may be?  Is it seriously being suggested that, as part of our education policy, parents who own or manage the typical owner-managed small business we see in most of our small towns should be required to sell a part of their income-generating assets to fund third level education? Some people have to do so.  I would have thought that a function of our third-level grants system should be to help people avoid having to dispose of such assets.  Are they supposed to eat the seed corn?  Is that what is proposed because, if it is, it is absolutely nonsensical; there is no point or justification in doing so, nor are we required to do so by any consideration of social equity.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the argument about the way we will deal with third level fees is over &mdash; they will be halved this autumn and abolished at the end of next <Col N="1176" /> year.  I again plead in that context &mdash; and in the context of the White Paper &mdash; for the Government to give serious regard to issues of equity in education and in the way we spend taxpayers' money.  It is proposed, for example, in the third level student report that students should be assessed independently for third level grants if they meet one of the following conditions: first, if they are 25 years or over; second, if they have been married for at least two years: third, if they have been self-supporting and living away from home for at least three years and, fourth, if they have no parent living.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will forgive me if I give what may seem a sexist example; it is not intended that way but it mirrors the reality of many cases today.  If a woman aged 26 years has been married for two years &mdash; there are a number of such people &mdash; to a person with an income of £200,000 of £300,000 per year and both her parents are dead, she would qualify on four different counts to have her university fees paid by the taxpayer.  Let us take the example of a new man engaged in home duties married to a woman on an income of £250,000 per year, if he is over 25 or has been married for at least two years he would be independently assessed for a grant.  If the couple has an arrangement whereby all the income belongs to the principle wage earner, the other person would be entitled to university fees.  In the circumstances where there will always be a limit on the number of third level places available and, therefore, there will always be rationing, if such a person gets a place in a third level college somebody else whose needs may be greater and whose means are certainly less will be denied a place.  That is neither just nor equitable.  I hope when the Government considers this report further in the context of the White Paper or outside it, it will have a little sanity and consider equity in the use of the money we extract so painfully from our taxpayers to do all the things mentioned here.</P>

      <P>I listened with great interest to Deputy Dukes's learned dissertation on the White Paper, many of his views are certainly worth considering and exploring.  However, has he forgotten he is no longer on the Opposition benches?  I wonder whether he is expressing his own view on education, those of the Fine Gael Party or perhaps, in a very strange way, those of the Government.  It is a great shame &mdash; I mean this sincerely &mdash; that Deputy Dukes did not have the opportunity to talk to the Minister for Education about his ideas before publication of the White Paper, or, if he did I am very sorry the Minister did not take those issues on board.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes expressed his views very strongly and stringently, using words such as &ldquo;banal&rdquo;, &ldquo;ashamed&rdquo;, &ldquo;nonsensical&rdquo; and &ldquo;grave doubts about financing&rdquo;.  There seems to be a grave distinction between the views expressed by the Deputy and those expressed by the Government.  Perhaps on another occasion he will explain whether these are his views or those of the Fine Gael Party and whether they are accepted around the Cabinet table.</P>

      <P>I hope in future a more co-ordinated policy will be <Col N="1178" /> adopted by the three parties who make up the Government on issues of education and every other issue of major importance.</P>
      <P>In the context of the White Paper I wish to deal with arts, culture and heritage. There is a general belief in the arts sector that our formal education system makes little provision for developing an awareness of creativity among our student population.  Without such an awareness young people are denied the opportunity to develop fully as informed and imaginative individuals. Equally, without this openness to creativity among young adults, it makes the job of professional artists more difficult in terms of winning an audience or market for their work.  The arts practitioner will know only too well from the very few people who can make a reasonable living from their work.  It has been often said that the biggest employer of the arts has been the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>The process of creating genuine access to the arts must begin at a much earlier stage in the existing social and educational chain.  While some work has been done in this area we need to initiate dialogue with the Department of Education, treacher training colleages, teachers' unions and other interested parties to move this whole process in a meaningful way.  If there are arguments for greater cultural input to our education system, which include better opportunities for personal development, positive spin-off for our national commercial life and an opportunity to increase public willingness to purchase our artistic product, why are we not doing more about it?</P>
      <P>The White Paper, at best, nods in the direction of a cultural dimension for our future education system.  This document is an opportunity for interested parties to make an input to Government policy. It has been recognised since the 1980s that the education system holds the key to future cultural and artistic development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Arts Council in 1979 with the Benson report underlined the central <Col N="1179" /> importance of education in any policy formation for the arts.  Its full time education officer since the late 1970s has demonstrated the council's right to pursue education policy.  The council can only hope to influence as it does not have the resources or mandate to provide for arts education in schools.  It must be commended for its programmes to date, namely, artists' residencies, theatre in education and writers in schools.</P>
    <P>In its submission to the National Education Convention in October 1993 the Arts Council expressed not only the educational significance of the arts but the arts contribution to economic development and employment and said there should be discrimination in favour of the arts.  In a 1994 survey, The Public and The Arts, commissioned by the Arts Council, 73 per cent of those surveyed agreed strongly with the concept that arts education in schools is as fundamental as science education.  In the same survey 74 per cent of the population regarded the lack of arts education at school as a significant obstacle to developing an interest in the arts. Surely it is the primary responsibility of the Department of Education to develop policies and structures for the arts in the creative, social and personal development of the young person. Surely there should be an integrated educational approach to the arts if our education system is to live up to its philosophy of being holistic and child centred.</P>
    <P>While the Arts Council is committed to arts in education its remit is not arts education, that is the prerogative of the Department of Education.  <i>The Arts in Education</i> published in 1985 by the interim curriculum and examinations boards considered changes in the system to make the arts accessible through education. The NCCA has referred to the need for the young person to have substantial experience in the arts and in science and technology pointing out that every young person is entitled to an arts <Col N="1180" /> education irrespective of social, economic or geographical determinants.  I understand the Arts Council wants art and music as a requirement at junior cycle level.</P>
    <P>To promote the arts in education from primary level up a number of areas must be explored.  There must be greater emphasis on arts education in colleges of education and in the higher diploma in education courses.  In-service training for teachers in the arts and, perhaps, the provision of specialist support services are required.  What about discussing the prospect of specialist teachers for the arts at primary and secondary levels?  As we know, at present there is an opportunity at primary level for exposure to the visual arts, music and drama, but perhaps in an era of specialisation in schools trained teacher specialists could be introduced.  At secondary level our education is very much subject focused and there is perhaps an even greater need for specialised attention to be focused on the arts.  I would be interested to hear the views of the teacher unions and the Minister for Education on that suggestion.  At second level there is little emphasis on the importance of the visual arts and drama, literature being the only area given attention and recognition.</P>
    <P>Music has long been a neglected subject in school.  It has been suggested, because of the difficulty in getting good grades and points in that subject at leaving certificate level, that many students have been dissuaded from taking that subject.  If that is the case, perhaps a study could be initiated to promote a broad strategy to encourage more students to study music and to dispel the present public perception which indicates a negative approach.  I understand that the publication of a survey known as &ldquo;PIANO&rdquo; is imminent.  Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on that issue when she addresses the House.  I hope that survey will give us sound ground on which to work.  Perhaps from that information appropriate criteria and modes <Col N="1181" /> of assessment, together with revised syllabi, can be put in place as well as giving the inspectorate a development role.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Irish language and its promotion in schools, I agree that Teilifís na Gaeilge will be of great importance and help in encouraging the further use and knowledge of our language and traditions.  I consider such a service necessary, particularly with the growth of gaelscoileanna throughout the country, especially in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In schools with a transitional year and where, according to the White Paper, each school can tailor the syllabus to its needs surely this could be an opportunity to explore the cultural area.  In many of our third level colleges it is quite common to have industrial research and development centres on campus.  Would it be possible to have artistic development centres attached to a humanities department on the same campus?</P>
    <P>It should be of particular interest to the Government and local authorities, particularly the vocational education committees, that the 1994 survey to which I referred stated that the greatest single proportion of the population selected as its first priority arts programmes and facilities dedicated to working for and with young people. While 75 per cent of those surveyed agree that family support and interest is the most important factor in fostering an interest in the arts, there is significant public expectation that the Department of Education should invest in the arts for our young people.</P>
    <P>The traditional concept of education has created a belief that the process is confined within the parameters of primary, post-primary and third level institutions and that it begins at the age of four and ends somewhere between 16 and 25, but we know nothing could be further from the truth.  Education is an ongoing activity, a life-long response to the constantly changing and challenging curriculum of our contemporary world and any attempts to place limits on the range and potential of the many new initiatives through which education is <Col N="1182" /> taking place at present must be regarded as a regression which can only lead to greater exclusion and inaccessibility. The most worrying indication of this in the context of the arts is the recent Government decision to attempt to reduce the level of participation in FÁS community employment programmes nationally by 40 per cent thereby cutting the employment and educational opportunities of almost 7,000 workers.</P>
    <P>The whole area of second chance education must be included in our discussion on how to promote access and participation in the arts, especially at a time when there is increased leisure time and high levels of unemployment. The recent arts plan and White Paper on Education recognise and affirm the centrality of arts in charting the educational future of the young.  Clearly, there needs to be close collaboration between the Arts Council and the Department of Education if an effective arts policy for the young is to be devised and, more importantly, implemented.</P>
    <P>I have taken part in a number of discussions in this House with the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and at every opportunity raised the need for the further inclusion and greater emphasis to be placed on arts within our educational system, but I am disappointed that he referred to arts education in one paragraph of a 19 page reply to a debate on the arts plan.  Perhaps that was because he found it difficult to find any conclusive or lasting references to arts in education apart from his reference to the importance of the arts for young people ranging from infants to sixth class.  Surely our educational system does not end at that level and our arts education should not end at sixth class.  I appeal, even at this late stage, to the Minister for Education to ensure that a far greater practical emphasis is given to the inclusion of arts education in the system.</P>
    <P>There was a recent fruitful debate in the arts community on access to and participation in the arts.  I am sure we all agree that we cannot talk about <Col N="1183" /> access or true participation in the arts without giving everyone the opportunity to learn and appreciate the arts within our educational system whether at primary, secondary, third level, second chance or at a transitional level within schools.  I hope that view is taken on board by the Minister as I believe it is a necessary and important part of what should be our educational approach.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Tugann sé an-áthas dom labhairt anseo faoin bPáipéar Bán seo &mdash;<i>Charting Our Educational Future</i>.  Is leabhar mór é agus is dócha gur oiriúnach an rud é sin, mar is ábhar mór é an t-oideachas atá le fáil ag páistí óga ar fud na hÉireann.  Tá sé tábhachtach do na páistí, do na múinteoirí agus do na tuismitheoirí.  Tá a lán rudaí sa Pháipéar Bán.  B'fhéidir nach bhfuil gach rud ceart ach níl maitheas ar bith a bheith ag gearán faoi na rudaí atá ann.  Tá a lán teoiricí ann.  Ní leor teoiric sa scoil agus sa seomra: caithfidh múinteoirí a bheith praiticiúil.  Sin an treo ina mbeidh mé ag dul sa mhéid atá le rá agam.</P>
      <P>This paper is very strong on theory and, in practice, it is difficult to know what can be achieved.  Having spent many years teaching I am somewhat biased towards the practical side of education. I understand the difficulties involved when a teacher carries a similar line of theory from one school to another when all schools and children are different.  A weakness of the old system was that it treated all children as having equal ability.</P>
      <P>Student teachers spend a great deal of time studying the philosophy of education; the end of term examination in that subject was held a few days ago. While it is important to know that philosophy and it keeps teachers on the correct line, it quickly moves to the background and is not something about which teachers talk in the pubs or in the staff room at break time.  Debate on the philosophy of education is still associated with the experts of long ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Practicality is an important matter in <Col N="1184" /> teaching and the first issue this paper should have dealt with was the need for dedicated teachers.  Nothing can replace a dedicated teacher in a classroom.  We are very fortunate to have thousands of dedicated teachers who go way beyond their call of duty in terms of teaching. While some parents view this cynically and believe teachers take pleasure from organising football, hurling and debating teams and so on, most parents appreciate their work in this regard. Some parents regard a school tour to Dublin as a free day for the teachers. Having often set out to Dublin with 60 pupils in two buses I realise that the only time a teacher can give a sigh of relief on such an outing is when the last pupil leaves the bus at his or her home that night.  A teacher will not get credit for leaving for Dublin with 60 pupils and arriving home with 59.  That teacher will not be told he or she did a great job in losing only one pupil.  Teachers who take pupils on such outings are concerned for their safety from the time they leave in the morning until they arrive home that night.  Even though children may be drilled to the nth degree about how they should behave, the teacher's role is still difficult.  Dedicated teachers are worth their weight in gold and I realise that now more than ever.</P>
    <P>Teachers who lack motivation in the classroom are a cause of concern for everybody, especially pupils who must sit in class and not benefit from their teaching.  Taking into account my time in training college and so on, one of the best lessons I received was when I returned to university after a few years teaching and attended a lecture given by a lady in her eighties.  She lectured with her back to the class and scribbled continuously on the blackboard.  Every now and again she would say to the class, &ldquo;tá caint ar siúul&rdquo; or &ldquo;tá comhrá ar siúl&rdquo;.  We were mature students, but none of us understood what she was talking about. As a result, at the start of every school year I informed my pupils that if at any stage during the year they did not understand what I was talking about <Col N="1185" /> they should tell me, and they did that. After a number of years teaching many teachers believe that because they know the subject off by heart it is simple. There can be nothing more frustrating for pupils than to have to listen to a teacher, especially in a mathematics class, if they do not understand what he or she is telling them.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the question of how we should deal with slow learners and in this regard small classes are very important.  Most people believe that teachers want an easy life, but I never had less than 36 in my class &mdash; I often had up to 40.  Regardless of how cynical people may be, it is difficult for teachers to help slow learners in a class with up to 40 pupils.  They must strike a balance.  They cannot hold back those who are academically brilliant and must also cater for the average pupil and the slow learner.</P>
    <P>The primary sector must receive the most backing from the State because everybody benefits from it.  After completing primary education, children go to second level with a view to going on to university or leave school at the age of 15. Those who cannot read or write are disadvantaged. Therefore, primary education must be seen as the most important facet of education, not because primary teachers are more important than others, but because all children benefit from it.  The Minister must ensure this happens.</P>
    <P>I could never understand why capitation for children at primary school was only a fraction of that which applied to second level schools.  Is it not more likely that a child at primary school than a 15 or 16 year old will fall down a manhole? People tend to believe that because it is primary level and that everybody benefits from it, it is not as important as a second level education, but that is not my view.</P>
    <P>Many teachers do not like to be told they have a vocation because they believe they cannot live on a vocation. While that is true, if teaching is not created as a vocation schools will suffer. A vocation is what makes the art of <Col N="1186" /> teaching appealing and gives the teacher the patience required for the job.  While there are thousands of very dedicated and able secondary school teachers, many of them studied English and history or Irish and history in their degree with a view to taking up journalism or a job in RTE.  However, when they did not secure such jobs they did a H.Dip and took up teaching.</P>
    <P>Some 180 people undertook an 18 month course in the teacher training college and will qualify as primary teachers.  The college had 800 applications and, following a screening of the applicants, they chose 180.  I am quite sure the majority of those will be dedicated teachers but the problem is they did not set out to be teachers.  They want to become teachers now because they found that with the type of degree they had there were not openings in other professions.  I am sure some of those students did the degree course because they wanted to become teachers but I hope the screening process weeded out those people who merely regarded teaching as a job. Teachers who regard their work as a mere job are not the kind of teachers we want.</P>
    <P>Teaching is a difficult life, despite the fact that teachers are supposed to work only two or three hours a day and spend six months on holiday.  It is the kind of occupation where one needs a great sense of humour.  It is important that children also can have a legitimate laugh at the expense of the teacher if the teacher can have a laugh at the expense of the children.  Life should be made as easy as possible for children who are required to go to school up to the age of 15.  It should not be a long hard slog. Much work can be done in a happy atmosphere.  Times were hard long ago, not through the fault of the teachers but because of the system that was in place. It is important to have a happy, dedicated teaching force.</P>
    <P>The question of early retirement for teachers, which is in the public domain at present, should not be seen merely as teachers looking after their own <Col N="1187" /> interests.  Teachers who have spent 30 or 35 years in that profession find themselves teaching now in a completely different era.  When they began teaching they had four lines of desks in front of them, discipine was strict, the children listened and learned.  However, that has all changed.  Teachers who would make children sit in rows of desks would almost be regarded as fossils.  Children are supposed to run around, be active and learn in that way.  I am not sure if all this research will benefit children if it has been carried out over hundreds of years and the answers are already known.  I admit there is a certain value in research but it can be a waste of time to carry out research and come to the wrong conclusions.  There must be a balance in this area.</P>
    <P>The question of early retirement for teachers should not be seen in a global way.  Teachers who are happy and dedicated in their work &mdash; thankfully, most of them are &mdash; will not want to retire but it is important to allow early retirement for those teachers who feel they cannot continue, not so much in their interests but in the interests of the children they teach.  Children are given only one chance to get an education.  If they are in a large school and have a bad teacher for only one year, that will not adversely affect them.  However, if they are in a small school they may have such a teacher for perhaps three years and that can be very serious.  If a teacher feels obliged to remain in the teaching profession for financial reasons, and if there is no way out for them because their pensions are not paid until they reach the age of 60 or 65, as is the case at secondary level, that can adversely affect the children.</P>
    <P>I hope a compromise will be reached because going on strike is not the way to settle a dispute such as this.  It is the teachers and the children who will suffer, particularly those at second level. Strike days have a negative effect with examinations looming.  I hope the dispute will be settled and discussions must take place with a view to achieving this. <Col N="1188" /> The figures that have been bandied about must be examined.  With modern technology, surely it is possible to assess the true figures that are at the centre of this dispute.</P>
    <P>There should be far more emphasis on teaching skills.  Students in the training colleges were required to teach classes in primary schools.  The inspector in charge of teacher training in the college would sit at the back of the class and say &ldquo;Bhí an ceacht sin go maith ach&mdash;&rdquo;.  He would then proceed to tear strips off the student.  That was an important lesson.  Having knowledge is one thing but being able to import it is another.  That requires a definite skill which should be learned.  The H.Dip. was not sufficient to qualify teachers to teach.  I did the H.Dip. in Maynooth but I would not have been as good a teacher without the back-up I received in the training college.  More emphasis must be put on teaching skills than on the theory of teaching.  We can read all about Aristotle and Socrates but we cannot always talk about theory &mdash; we must deliver the goods and the children in the charge of teachers expect them to do that.  We need more courses that will produce good teachers by giving them proper instruction.</P>
    <P>We must tackle the problem of bad teachers.  It is wrong to say that there are not any black sheep in the teaching profession.  Some of those are doing their best, others are not.  They are careless in their work and it surprises me how they can get away with that.  The various teacher unions, the ASTI, the INTO, the TUI and others will have to address this problem because these teachers can have a bad effect on the students under their charge.  Some parents worry during the summer months that their children will have a particular teacher when they return to school in September.  That problem should not arise.  Other parents want to have their children taken out of a certain class because of difficulties with a particular teacher.  If teachers feel they are getting too old for the job, they should be given a way out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1189" /> In-service training should be provided for all teachers.  It is ridiculous that a person who was trained as a teacher 40 years ago has never undergone in-service training, particularly in this age of computerisation, etc.  Teachers should be required to attend refresher courses every few years.  I realise that will cost money but if doctors never availed of refresher courses since leaving medical school, and if they were continuing to issue the same type of drugs, etc, we would all be in a panic.  It is important that a teacher should do refresher courses, even for six months in any particular year.  It would give them a new insight to attend lectures, although I am sure they will realise that some lecturers cannot lecture.  The higher up one goes at university level, the more one realises that lecturers are great academics but they only want to talk about what concerns them and leave everything else to the students.</P>
    <P>We must have proper facilities in our education system.  Thankfully, most of the bad schools are now closed although strikes can occur because of the conditions of schools.  In some schools the toilets are outside the building and it is not good enough that they are not up to modern standards.  I have taught in many schools and I know that having a carpet in a school makes a huge difference to the atmosphere.  There must be an opportunity for learning and bad conditions in schools do not help in that regard.</P>
    <P>In fairness all Ministers have made a reasonable effort to provide remedial teachers but more are needed to help the weaker children.  If we do not help them we are serving no great purpose. The bright children will get on almost in spite of teachers whereas the weaker pupils must be helped.  I accept that Ministers, past and present, have gone out of their way to provide extra teachers and it is far more practical to do that than to set up costly education boards across the country.</P>
    <P>The mentally handicapped must be looked after.  The parents and friends of the mentally handicapped are involved <Col N="1190" /> in all sorts of fund raising events to provide the back-up facilities to educate their children.  I am involved in a training centre for mentally handicapped teenagers and adults.  We have received over £100,000 from the organisation of parents and friends of the mentally handicapped to provide facilities.  The health board gives us 80 per cent funding and the Minister who visited us the other day gave us an extra £15,000.  Why should the parents and friends of the mentally handicapped have to spend their time raising funds to provide facilities that should be provided by the State?  Surely, the mentally handicapped should be at the top of our education agenda.</P>
    <P>In <i>Charting our Education Future</i> there is a photograph of a lovely boy and girl with their bicycles but it would have been more appropriate to have a battered yellow bus &ldquo;Bus Scoile&rdquo; showing all the signs of wear and tear.  With the advent of school transport, cycling to school is almost a thing of the past and in later life people will suffer hamstring injuries because their muscles have never been stretched.  We have to set up the school bus service to suit minorities as well as the majority and Church of Ireland and Presbyterian students are entitled to be transported to schools of their own denomination. More money should be spent to facilitate this.</P>
    <P>Ó thaobh na Gaeilge de ní dóigh liom go mbeidh an tsuim chéanna ag na múinteoirí óga inti is a bhí ag na seanmhúinteoirí. Bhí brú ar na sean-mhúinteoirí. Bhí sé go huafásach nuair a tháinig an cigire isteach.  Cheap seisean go mbeadh gach duine sa rang líofa ó thaobh labhairt na Gaeilge de.  Níor thuig sé nach raibh daoine in ann an Ghaeilge a labhairt agus chuir sé anbhrú ar na sean-mhúinteoirí.  Dá bhrí sin chuir na sean-mhúinteoirí an-bhrú ar na páistí.  Anois níl sé riachtanach go mbeadh an Ghaeilge mar phríomhábhar ag na micléinn.  Tá Gaeilge proifisiúnta le déanamh acu agus tabharfaidh sé deis agus eolas dóibh.  Ach tá súil agam go mbeidh an tsuim chéanna acu <Col N="1191" /> is a bhí ach ní dóigh liom go ndéanfaidh Gaeilge proifisiúnta an tionchar céanna is a rinne nuair a bhí an Ghaeilge mar phríomh-ábhar.  Braitheann sé go mór ar na múinteoirí.  Má tá dearcadh ceart ag na múinteoirí beidh suim ag na páistí sa Ghaeilge.  Muna mbíonn an dearcadh ceart acu agus munar maith leo an Ghaeilge a mhúineadh ar chor ar bith beidh fadhb ann.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh an tsuim cheart ag na múinteoirí óga ag teacht amach mar muna mbíonn beidh fás níos mó ag teacht ar na gaelscoileanna. Tá an-suim agus an-fhás ag teacht ar na gaelscoileanna cheana féin. Diaidh ar ndiaidh beidh na gnáth scoil-eanna ag rá &ldquo;is cuma faoin nGaeilge; tá scoileanna speisialta ann di; tá ranganna níos lú acu ná mar atá againn; tá níos mó airgid le fáil acu&rdquo;.  Tá an-dáinséar ann go mbeidh sort déistin ar na gnáthmhúinteoirí mar a thugaim orthu nach mbeidh an tsuim acu sa Ghaeilge.  Ní thiocfaidh athbheochan na Gaeilge chun críche muna mbíonn suim ag na múinteoirí inti.</P>
    <P>Chapter 15 deals with the role of the inspectorate.  I hope this will lead to improvements in the evaluation and advisory role of inspectors.  Some of the older inspectors will be standing by the wall in heaven if St. Peter has any particular interest in teachers.  One of my earliest memories &mdash; and I was probably only five years of age &mdash; is of an inspector turning back on his way out from the school who, having looked down at the master's dog, said &ldquo;the dog there knows more than ye&rdquo;.  He got away with that but in this day and age I hope a young teacher would have enough backbone to chase him and let him know what basic manners are.  That was his attitude to a marvellous teacher.  Then, inspectors put awful pressure on teachers whose salaries depended on what the inspector said about them.  During my teaching career the children came in and said there was a man behind the pier.  I investigated thinking perhaps that somebody had escaped from the mental hospital who might be a danger to the children. As I got near the pier this fellow shot <Col N="1192" /> up and said &ldquo;An tusa an príomhoide?  I said &ldquo;Is mise&rdquo;.  He said: &ldquo;Cá bhfuil na múinteoirí?&rdquo;  Rith sé síos isteach sa scoil ó sheomra go seomra.  Gealt a bhí ann agus bhí sé ag dul timpeall na tíre mar chigire scoile.  Ba chóir dó cabhair a thabhairt do na múinteoirí ach ní raibh sé ach ag cur isteach orthu.</P>
    <P>The attitude of inspectors then was that all teachers were guilty until they proved themselves innocent.  That era is over and the younger inspectors have a more enlightened approach.  When I was doing practice work for my diploma I recall an inspector spending half a day showing me how to teach certain parts of the curriculum but when it came to the diploma examination he told me I should not do what he had spent half a day telling me to do.  I was wise enough to keep my mouth shut.  Teachers had to put up with an awful lot from inspectors. I am glad inspectors now have an advisory role.  If they have any talent they will be able to assess what is going on in the classroom when they walk into it.  Some inspectors believed in the theory of education, believing that teachers with written notes were doing their job well. Very often the teachers with years of experience were able to work with the minimum of notes but they would draw trouble on themselves because an inspector would not be able to assess the work being done in the classroom.</P>
    <P>In latter years I had visits from inspectors who had a proper attitude, one of whom was snatched by the GAA to run their organisation.  Inspectors will play a central role.  Teachers are paid to give a service and it is important that standards are maintained.  If inspectors find teachers are not giving a good service they should be wise enough to do something about it.  They should encourage teachers rather than discourage them as they did in the past.  Dedicated teachers were often shattered when inspectors criticised one aspect of their work.  They did more harm than good.</P>
    <P>There is no reference in the White Paper to school furniture.  It is scandalous that children are asked to sit at flat topped desks.  They damage their backs <Col N="1193" /> if they are not able to sit up straight.  I am supported in this view by the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists and by Dr. Mandol, who is an expert in Denmark.  I have given evidence to the Department and have been told that studies will be carried out.  Some children may have lordosis.  Many people suffer from backache and I am sure much of it was caused when they were at school.  I do not expect the Department of Education to throw out the furniture in schools but it should note what the experts say.  We should do as our forefathers did.  Long before the philosophy of education people used sloped desks.  Draftsmen use them and they can still be found in some solicitors' offices.</P>
    <P>People love to talk about education, particularly Church-State relations.  I had the greatest assistance from the church.  When I began teaching, the parish priest had antiquated ideas on heating but, apart from that, I was very lucky to have the same manager for over 30 years.  He provided every possible facility for the school, including a piano.  There is much debate on whether religion should be taught in schools.  I believe it should as the sooner we have a stronger form of religion in schools, whatever it may be, the more hope there is for civilisation.  I am not sure if religion plays a part in anyone's life the way we carry on.  We all know there is bullying and I have no qualms about defending the role of the church in education.</P>
    <P>The church has come to the rescue of the Department of Education umpteen times.  Very often it was the parish priest who provided heating for the school and organised its cleaning.  The Department of Education got away with murder.  It is easy to criticise the church but, without it, people would not have been educated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes dealt scathingly with education boards.  I would accept them as long as they did not cost extra and reduce the resources available to provide, for example, remedial teachers.  I do not know what role they will play.  I do not see any advantage in having <Col N="1194" /> them if they are the Department's messengers and not independent.  No matter how often they meet or what views they hold on Socrates or Plato it will not make any difference to teaching in schools.  We can set up boards but what will they do for education?  If they absorb money which should be available for schools they will be a waste of time.</P>
    <P>Boards of management were a bone of contention.  It seemed as if teachers did not want power taken from them. The board of management is an important part of any school.  The role of parents is not sufficiently emphasised and I do not know how a school could function without their involvement.  It would be impossible to explain anything to parents if they felt they could not approach the school for fear of a teacher or principal blowing a fuse.  Parents often get the wrong end of a story and go to the school to find out what happened.</P>
    <P>There is a chapter on the role of principals. They are rare animals who are supposed to know everything about the school.  When I was a teaching principal of an eight teacher school for a number of years, the theory on the role of principal went out the window.  I had 38 children in my class, most of whom wanted to be educated and my role was to teach them.  I was lucky because my teachers were dedicated.  In my early career I had a problem with a water pump and if I am appointed Minister for Education I will get my file and read an article I wrote for the Department called &ldquo;the pump is cut off Sir&rdquo;.  It is in the Department's archives.  When the toilet was blocked one of the roles of the principal was to leave the classroom&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As a former Minister for Education I very much welcome the opportunity to contribute to this historic debate on the future of education. Deputy Martin, our education spokesperson set out Fianna Fáil's position on education.</P>
      <P>When I had the honour of being Minister for Education I formally published in June 1992 a Government Green Paper on Education which was widely debated.  According to the foreword to that Green Paper which I had the pleasure of signing:</P>
      <P>The Irish people are rightly proud of their Education System which has served the Country superbly.  But no Education System can be frozen in time.  If it is to continue to deliver quality it must constantly adapt to changing Educational needs and to changes in the world it serves.  At key times there is a need to take a fundamental look at the Educational System and to re-direct it, to reflect new needs as those needs emerge.  Such a moment is now.</P>
      <P>I compliment all those who contributed to the publication of the Green and White Papers.  As the Minister correctly stated, they do not belong to any individual but to the country.  I know from personal experience, of the enormous dedication of the officials in the Department of Education, the teaching profession and all those who made the Green and White Papers possible.  Dáil Éireann and the nation owes a debt of gratitude to them.</P>
      <P>Education is about developing the person as a whole and it is central to the life of the individual and the nation.  It is central to the future of work and personal development.  The future development of education centres around three pillars &mdash; equality, mobility and access. We must make real progress under each of these headings and not under any particular one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The peace process in Northern Ireland will also affect our educational system.  The Framework Document <Col N="1196" /> highlights the need for positive educational initiatives to bring the educational systems North and South closer together.  We must make urgent progress on the mutual recognition of teacher training qualifications.  It is ridiculous on a small island like this that there is a difficulty in recognising the qualifications of teachers.  There is no room for partition in education.  The development of the EU and demographic changes will also affect the type of education service we offer.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise and appreciate that there can be no such thing as a valueless education.  The section in the White Paper dealing with this issue is extremely good and thoughtful.  Education must impart values, principles, and responsibilities.  A valueless education would be barren and would not develop the moral character of the individual. To be blunt about it, if the moral character of the individual is not developed there can be no true education.</P>
    <P>Teachers are in the front line of education and there are enormous demands on them.  These demands are created by the curriculum, the growing expectations of parents and the day to day stress which is part of the profession.  I am glad the White Paper salutes the professionalism of teachers and proposes tangible assistance to help them develop their careers and psychological well being.  The time has come for us to again re-empower professional teachers. In recent years we have taken some of that power away from them.  While they must share the educational system with parents, interested bodies and others, teachers have a special responsibility in this area on a day to day basis.</P>
    <P>Most research shows that disadvantage in life can often be traced back to the primary school sector.  More positively, it has been conclusively shown that a sound and balanced primary education is essential for the future development of the individual.  It is imperative, therefore, in the scramble for resources that the primary school sector is not left behind.  The primary <Col N="1197" /> school sector does not have the same corporate muscle or connections as the third level sector and it requires special protection and investment by the State. After all, this is the sector where formal education begins.</P>
    <P>The second level sector is very much the bedrock of the knowledge society.  I pay tribute to the religious orders which for many centuries have unselfishly developed the second level system.  This generation must acknowledge the wonderful contribution they have made to the development of education.  Our second level system provides a fine base of skills and it is encouraging to see it broadcasting out into new subject areas and providing greater choice for students.</P>
    <P>OECD reports consistently pay tribute to the high standard of our third level education system.  We now have eight universities, including the Dublin Institute of Technology, all of which provide a first rate education.  When I was Minister for Education I secured a commitment from the Government to give the Dublin Institute of Technology degree awarding status.  This should be done without any further delay as that institution has proven itself to be one of our finest educational establishments. The regional technical college network also constitutes a central part of the national knowledge system and we must chart its future with great care.</P>
    <P>Third level fees are but one of four factors affecting access to third level education.  The others are entry standards, availability of places and maintenance, all of which are as important as fees.  When I was Minister for Education I believed that free third level education should be introduced and I convinced the minority Fianna Fáil Government to include this proposal in its 1992 election document.  I did this for two reasons. First, I strongly believe access to education at every level is paramount and that third level should not be any different from second level in this regard. While generations ago one may only have needed second level education, today third level education is necessary <Col N="1198" /> to avail of the same opportunities. Second, as very few third level students pay fees I calculated that the cost of abolishing fees would not be too great. For example, most regional technical college students do not pay fees, up to 60 per cent of third level students receive grants and approximately £20 million is given by the Exchequer through tax relief on covenants.  These figures are from memory and would require to be checked carefully.  When one adds in the cost of administering the grants system then the real cost to the State is minimal.  The management of the transition from a fee paying system to a non-fee paying system is important and the new system must be introduced over a number of years, having regard to the resources of the State.</P>
    <P>Before I left the Department of Education I had began to form the opinion that the points system for entry to third level education was in need of substantial reform.  I have now come to the conclusion that the system should be critically examined to establish whether it will be practical in the future.  We must have a points system so as to ensure fairness, quality control, rationing of scarce places etc. but we must also look at the enormous pressure on students and the increasing number of students who do not have sufficient points to get a place in their local third level education institution and who have to attend an institution in another county.</P>
    <P>Does it make any sense to pay out tens of millions of pounds in maintenance grants, an enormous proportion of which is paid to students in, say, University College Galway to do a BA when they live a mile or two from University College Dublin?  Does it make any sense for a Cork student not to be able to get into University College Cork and to have to attend, say, St. Patrick's College Maynooth at State expense just because there is a disparity in the points system? Whatever argument one can make for capital intensive areas, such as medicine and science, surely it is time to sort out this anomaly in the area of the liberal arts, where a BA is a BA.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1199" /> There is also the factor of how much of this so called demand is actually a fashion rather than a genuine demand for a particular college.  I ask the Minister for Education to consider establishing a high powered commission to examine the administration of the points system and its relationship with the maintenance grants system and to instruct it to bring forward proposals to resolve the anomalies in this area.  It is not good enough to say there is no alternative to the points system.  I believe there can be.  Will the Minister say how many other countries in the European Union have a points system?  The answer is very few.</P>
    <P>There is a chapter missing from this White Paper.  I had deliberately inserted in the Green Paper &mdash; Education for a Changing World &mdash; a chapter on the need for an enterprise culture in our education system.  I accept that education is about the development of the whole person but we must also inculcate into every individual the need to be innovative, enterprising, inquiring and constantly seeking new openings.  A key element in developing a competitive economy is to ensure we have the skills base to do so.  Those skills must come from our education system and must complement education in the area of literature, arts and culture generally.  Is it any wonder that an enormous number of small companies fail?  Is it any wonder that most of our new companies are started by people who have not had the benefit of advanced education?  Why is it that the more education received the less likely a person is to start a small company to give employment and create wealth for the nation?  I regret the Minister has removed from the White Paper any reference to the need for an enterprise culture in our education system.  I predict the decision to remove that chapter will be to the detriment of the future development of this nation.</P>
    <P>How are we to develop our economy if students leave the education system without appreciating that the target <Col N="1200" /> should not only be to have a post in the Civil Service, in banking or in the professions? Is it not true that they are leaving our education system today with a certain suspicion and disdain and a certain lack of respect for the entrepreneurial spirit which this country so desperately needs.  That chapter was put into the Green Paper to try to bring back respect for people of enterprise.  I ask the Minister for Education to think again and to include in our education system the development of an enterprise culture alongside and complementing our very fine liberal arts education which we have developed over the generations.</P>
    <P>The world is changing and workforce structures are changing.  As the nature of work changes so must our education system.  It is, therefore, important that we continue to invest in adult education. It is also important that our education system should continue to adapt to the needs of society.  As society changes over future generations, it will become more and more important to invest in second chance education &mdash; to allow people who have missed out to avail of our education system, in order that they are better able to meet the changes rather than have the changes swamp them.</P>
    <P>In the middle of all of this education debate, it is important to state clearly that our education system should always be a child centred one.  The education system is not about the Department of Education, the teachers or the parents but the children.  The total environment in this country and in our education system should be supportive of the needs of the child.  Sometimes we put too much focus on the needs of parents, the rights of teachers and the duties of the Department of Education.  These are important but they are not as important as focusing totally on the needs of the child and continuing to design our education system around the requirements of the child.  Structures in themselves are useless unless they meet the needs of a particular student.  I criticise the <Col N="1201" /> White Paper in being too structure oriented, with too much discussion on what structures are needed, the number of boards and who should be on them, and the structures that run the education system, rather than the requirements to develop the individual child.</P>
    <P>The White Paper is very thin in the area of sport, an area which was highly developed by the former Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Liam Aylward.  His fine work does not appear to have been continued. Surely the Minister must realise that sport is the foundation of a healthy lifestyle and is as much a part of our education system today as the formal curriculum.  We should remove the Cinderella image of sport from our education system.  We should use lottery funds to develop our facilities within schools.  We can make no better investment for the future.</P>
    <P>I had deliberately inserted in the Green Paper a proposal that we change the way we teach the Irish language.  I specifically proposed in that paper that in examinations, extra marks &mdash; up to 60 per cent &mdash; should be allotted to oral Irish rather than written Irish.  I am disappointed that the Minister has not followed it through fully, as it is only by teaching our students to speak the language fluently than it will develop.  How many of us have gone through primary, secondary and third level education and have written article after article, at those three levels, composition after composition as Gaeilge, yet at the end of the day are unable to hold a full conversation in the Irish language?  I inserted that proposal because we need a radical new method.  The proposal on Irish in examinations is one which would have the greatest impact in the long term.  In the education system one should be rewarded by getting marks in examinations for being able to speak the language rather than write a large sliocht of poetry.</P>
    <P>The challenges facing education today are daunting.  The focus should be on the need to equip students with the ability to think and solve problems, <Col N="1202" /> rather than accumulate knowledge; the need to develop students for life as well as for work; the need to ensure that social and economic disadvantage is alleviated by our education system, not made worse; the need to educate our people for the role of citizens of Europe, while preserving our unique Irish identity; the need to focus increasingly on second chance education; the need to respond to the demands on teachers who continually have to adapt to changing circumstances; the need to get a good return for the taxpayers from our education resources, which will always be less than we would wish or can afford; the need to respond to increasing levels of expectation from education; the need to reflect the rights of parents to be informed about and involved in the education of their children, while at the same time recognising the central role of teachers on a day-to-day basis; the need to ensure greater gender equity throughout the education system &mdash; that needs positive action, not pious platitudes; and the need to respond to the demands for greater openness in society today.</P>
    <P>To meet these challenges we must deal with some problems.  Many disadvantaged children still fail to enjoy the full benefits of education.  A small number of children still encounter basic literacy problems.  The current liberal arts dominated system is not sufficiently balanced to meet the world of work.  There is still not enough emphasis on technology and enterprise.  Our learning performance in European languages does not reflect our needs in the new Europe.</P>
    <P>The curriculum and exam system is still strongly biased towards acquiring factual knowledge rather than developing critical thinking and problem solving skills.  The education system is still over-centralised with even the smallest decisions on everyday administration being taken by the Department which simply must separate its policy making functions from the day to day management and operation of the education system.  That is critical, and the structures and skills necessary to make <Col N="1203" /> that happen need to be developed. There is a need for further development in the training of teachers after initial qualification, and for more openness throughout the education system.  Very little information is shared throughout the system.</P>
    <P>We must now forge ahead to establish greater equity in education, broaden education, make the best use of our educational resources, train and develop our teachers, create a system of quality assurance and ensure greater openness throughout the system.  Although I have many objections to elments of the White Paper, I compliment the Minister for Education on having the determination to see through the process which has now been going on for too long, and on bringing forward the White Paper which will allow us to continue to develop one of the best systems of education in the world today.</P>

Is rud maith é freisin go bhfuil seans ag daoine taobh amuigh &mdash; agus ní amháin ag polaiteoirí anseo sa Teach &mdash; díospóireacht a bheith acu.  Tharla sé go raibh an-chuid díospóireachta i gCaisleán Átha Cliath agus in áiteanna eile: aithním é sin agus tá áthas orm go raibh sé ann. Le cúnamh Dé, beidh reachtaíocht ag teacht ón bPáipéar Bán seo agus tá súil agam nach mbeidh moill ró-fhada air. An dtabharfaidh an tAire dáta dúinn, mas féidir, agus an gcuirfidh sí in iúl dúinn cén sórt reachtaíochta atá i gceist aici go n-éireodh ón bPáipéar Bán?  Tá cuma ar an scéal, má léann duine an Páipéar Bán, nach mbeidh oideachas ar bith ann ach trí scoileanna agus scolaíocht, ollscoileanna agus na hinsititiúidí éagsúla a chosnaíonn an-chuid airgid, mar is eol dúinn.  Ba cheart a aithint, agus níos mó béime a chur air i dtús báire &mdash; más féidir liom é a phlé ar feadh cúpla nóiméad &mdash; an bunriachtanas atá le hoideachais don chine daonna agus <Col N="1204" /> don duine féin.  Is ceart a aithint go dtosnaíonn cúrsaí oideachais leis an tuismitheor agus leis an leanbh.  Is féidir an-chuid a dhéanamh chun cabhrú leis an mbunchéim sin.  Má táimid ag iarraidh níos mó airgid a chaomhnú, seachas a bheith ag iarraidh ar na scoil-eanna níos mó a dhéanamh, is fearr an toradh agus is lú an infheistíocht má chuirtear béim ar dtús ar na deiseanna atá ag éirí as an suíomh sa bhaile.  Ní féidir le Rialtas ar bith a rá go ndearna sé a dhóthain chuige sin go dtí seo.  Beidh an tAire ag maíomh go mbíonn tuismitheoirí an-ghnóthach na laethanta seo agus tuigim go bhfuil roinnt tuismith-eoirí chomh ghnóthach ag dul amach ag obair nach féidir leo mórán ama a chaitheamh lena gcuid leanaí.  Tá roinnt tuismitheoirí eile atá chomh bocht sin nach féidir leo, ach an oiread, a bheith ag díriú a n-aire ar chúrsaí oideachais.

    <P>Is féidir pointe eile a dhéanamh anseo atá an-tábhachtach do shaol leanaí agus cúrsaí oideachais na hÉireann maidir le polasaí atá fós ag An Daonlathas Clé agus ag Fine Gael agus atá pléite ag Páirtí an Lucht Oibre &mdash; níl a fhios agam an bhfuil sé mar pholasaí acu nó nach bhfuil.  An pointe atá i gceist agam ná an &ldquo;guaranteed basic income&rdquo;.  Tá an-chuid ráite mar gheall air agus bacheart díospóireacht cosúil leis seo a bheith againn chun gach rud a bhain-eann leis an phlé.  Tá neart daoine taobh amuigh den Teach seo &mdash; ESRI, Con-ference of Religious in Ireland agus go leor údaráis eile &mdash; atá ag moladh gur féidir cabhrú le daoine, le leanaí na hÉireann, má tá tuismitheoirí na tíre in ann níos lú ama a chaitheamh ag dul amach ag obair agus ag fágáil leanaí sa bhaile nó ar scoil agus, ag an am chéanna, an méid áirithe airgid a fháil i dtreo agus gur féidir leo leanúint ar aghaidh agus gan a bheith bocht ag an am chéanna.  Is rud é sin atá an-tábhachtach don díospóireacht seo ach atá níos leithne ná an Páipéar Bán féin.  Ba cheart don Rialtas machnamh a dhéanamh air mar baineann sé le saol <Col N="1205" /> leanaí na tíre seo chomh maith agus le saol eacnamaíoch na tíre seo.</P>
    <P>An cheist a chuirfinn ar dtús ná: cad is fiú oideachas foirmeálta?  An freagra gearr atá air sin ná gur ullmhúchán é don saol atá roimh an duine &mdash;&ldquo;ullmhúchán&rdquo; ar an gciall is leithne.  Rinne an Teachta Ó Braonáin tagairt don &ldquo;enterprise culture&rdquo; agus aontaím leis go bhfuil cuid de sin ann.  Go bunúsach, ní féidir a bheith i gcónaí ag brath ar an &ldquo;enterprise culture&rdquo;, mar atá sé faoi láthair, mar go bhfuil an saol ag athrú. Tá an-chuid de na deiseanna atá ann le haghaidh fiontair ag athrú freisin.  Níl na monarchana céanna ann agus a bhí fadó.  Níl na monarchana ann agus a bhí le linn saol Harold Wilson &mdash; a raibh Teachtaí á chaoineadh inniu &mdash; nuair a bhí seisean ag fás suas.  Tá saol andifriúil ann agus ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh do chlár raidió a chuala mé ar maidin.  Baineann sé seo leis an rud atá i gceist agam.  Faoi láthair, tá eachtra ar bun ag Mr. Gay Byrne ar a chlár raidió.  Má fhaigheann aon duine seans éisteacht le cuid de, b'fhéidir go mbeadh suim acu ann i gcomhthéacs na díospóireachta seo.  Cuireadh grúpa gnáthdhaoine go háit nádúrtha &mdash; ní mhaith liom &ldquo;fiáin&rdquo; a rá.  Is áit é nach bhfuil seirbhísí, ó thaobh siopaí nó aon chineál cabhrach, ag na daoine sin ó lá go lá.  Tá sé fágtha futhu féin dul ar aghaidh agus a gcuid bia a fháil, dul ó áit go háit, a gcuid dídean a fháil agus gach rud a dhéanamh atá riachtanach chun maireachtáil.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé sin ag dul thar fóir ó thaobh chúrsaí oideachais de.  Ní bheidh muid fágtha ar an ngannchuid ach amháin má tharláionn pléasc ag Sellafield, rud nach dtarlóidh le cúnamh Dé.  Ó lá go lá táimid ag brath ar an-chuid seirbhísí.</P>
    <P>Is cuspóir ceart, nach bhfuil ag an gcóras oideachais go fóill, na scileanna a thabhairt do dhuine chun ullmhúchán a dhéanamh don saol atá roimhe.  Is triail chrua é an teachtaireacht atá ar bun ag lucht Mr. Gay Byrne ar a chlár raidió ach, mar mhúinteoir mé féin, tugann sé an-chuid ábhar machnaimh dom.  Cuireann sé cúpla ceist os mo chomhair amach.  Cé atá in ann, tar éis <Col N="1206" /> saol scoile, bia a chur ag fás agus é a ullmhú?  Cé atá in ann iad féin a choimeád tirim?  An dtuigeann daoine gur mór an t-athrú olann a chaitheamh agus cadás a chaitheamh, ó thaobh báistí agus fliuchais agus mar sin de?  Is iad seo rudaí atá bunúsach go leor, má tá duine dífhostaithe, má tá sé bocht, má tá sé ag ceannach éadaí do leanaí, má tá sé ag iarraidh maireachtáil ó lá go lá.  Is scileanna bunúsacha iad seo atá in easnamh nuair atá muid ag iarraidh dul isteach sa &ldquo;golden circle&rdquo; nó ag iarraidh a bheith cosúil le cúpla gnó-eagraithe atá an-saibhir.</P>
    <P>Ó thaobh sláinte de, is fearr &mdash; de réir na daoine ar an gclár raidió &mdash; gan siúl ar an mbóthar má tá duine ag siúl ar feadh i bhfad.  Tá comhairle faighte acu gan a bheith ag siúl ar an mbóthar go ró-mhinic mar go ndéanann sé dochar do na cosa.  Tá mé ag dul thar fóir maidir le riachtanais an tsaol ó lá go lá. Níl mé ach ag iarraidh cur in iúl go bhfuil scileanna ann nach bhfuil i gceist sa chóras scolaíochta atá againn.  Mar shampla, cén sort plandaí atá nimhneach? Tá go leor daoine a cheapann, tar éis a saol a chaitheamh ar scoil, gur ionann planda amháin agus planda eile. Is cinnte nach dtuigeann siad cad iad na cinn atá nimhneach.  B'fhéidir go dtuigeann siad an difríocht eatarthu ó thaobh féachaint orthu de ach sin an méid a thuigeann siad.  Ní fhoghlaimíonn siad a leithéid de rudaí phraiticiúla ar nós conas inneall a dheisiú, conas rothar a dheisiú, conas a bheith neamhspleách ón gcóras, má theipeann ar an gcóras sin.  Ní gá domsa a rá go bhfuil ag teipeadh ar an gcóras ar an-chuid daoine in Éirinn.  Is cuma cé chomh holc nó maith agus atá cúrsaí eacnamaíocha, beidh scileanna an tsaoil tábhachtach i gcónaí do dhaoine, ag dul tríd an scoil agus mar dhaoine fásta.</P>
    <P>Níl a ndóthain aitheantais tugtha do na bunscileanna saoil atá ag teastáil ó dhaoine atá ag fás aníos sa tír seo, ní amháin go bhféadfadh siad a bheith neamhspleach ach &mdash; mar is ceart agus is cóir &mdash; go mbeadh scileanna acu chun saol sona a chaitheamh agus go mbeadh an sásamh pearsanta acu a thugann an <Col N="1207" /> sonas sin don saol.  Leis na figiúirí ó thaobh daoine atá ag cur lámha ina mbásanna féin agus atá caillte ina meonta féin agus atá in ospidéil agus atá ag cosaint an-chuid airgid ar an Stát &mdash; níl aon dabht faoi sin &mdash; tá sé tábhachtach féachaint ar na bunriachtanais sin nach bhfuil á gcomhlíonadh sa chóras mar atá faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Agus mé i mo mhúinteoir, bhí seans agam féin béim a leagan ar na bunriachtanais seo sa scoil a bhí faoi mo chúram féin i mBaile Bhrigín.  Tá sé tábhachtach an sampla seo a thabhairt.  Is féidir le go leor daoine a rá go bhfuil sé an-éasca a bheith ag caint ach go bhfuil sé i bhfad níos deacra an rud praiticiúil a dhéanamh. I mo chás féin bhí seans agam gáirdín scoile a chur ar bun.  Tá áthas orm go raibh agus aithním go raibh an t-ádh orm, mar phríomhoide, mo rud féin a dhéanamh sa scoil, suas go dtí pointe áirithe.  Bhí seans agam gáirdín a leagann amach mar ba mhian liom. Leag mé amach é i gcomhpháirtíocht leis na leanaí agus leis an múinteoir eile a bhí ag obair sa scoil liom.  Tá an gáirdín fós ann, chomh fada le m'eolas. An rud a bhí ann ná córas, ní amháin conas bláthanna a chur agus plandaí a chur ach conas bia a chur, conas bia a ullmhú, conas daoine a chothú, agus conas gur féidir le duine a bheith chomh neamhspleách agus is féidir ón siopa trasna an bhóthair nuair a bhíonn gá leis. Dár ndóigh, nílim ag rá gur féidir le duine a bheith neamhspleách ar fad.  Tá sé tábhachtach do oideachas daoine gur féidir leo a bheith neamhspleách, más gá.  Bhí grúpaí sa scoil, ceann acu freagrach as glasraí ar nós cabáiste agus grúpa eile freagrach as prátaí, cur i gcás.  Bhí na grúpaí seo go léir ag cur cineálacha bia éagsúla ag fás.  San fhómhar, bhí bia ar fáil.  Bhí an-cheacht le foghlaim ag na leanaí.  D'fhoghlaim siad nach féidir leo a bheith ag brath go hiomlán ar an rud a chuireann siad féin; gur gá iad a mhalartú; gur féidir gnó a dhéanamh gan airgead a úsáid i gcónaí; agus go bhfuil slite eile ann chun dul ar aghaidh sa saol.  Tá an éagsúlacht sin <Col N="1208" /> tábhachtach.  Bhí comhoibriú á mhúineadh: comhoibriú nach bhfuil a dhóthain de sna scoileanna anois.  Tá mórán cloiste mar gheall ar chomórtas, mar gheall ar strus, agus mar gheall ar dhaoine a bheith tinn de bhárr an chineál meoin atá sna scoileanna faoi láthair.  Tá sé an-tábhachtach samplaí a thabhairt den tábhacht a bhaineann le comhoibriú.  Is rud praiticiúil a bhí ar bun sa scoil, ní amháin conas bia a ullmhú agus dul ar aghaidh sa saol i gcoitinne.  Dár ndóigh, bhí baint idir an scoil agus an baile.  Beidh sa todhchaí agus, le cúnamh Dé, neartófar an bhaint sin amach anseo tríd an bPáipéar Bán. Má tá an bhaint sin láidir agus má tá tuiscint sa bhaile agus sa scoil cad iad na cuspóirí atá leagtha síos do na leanaí agus don chóras oideachais, beidh sé sin sláintiúil.  Sa chás seo, tháinig neart rudaí sláintiúla as.  Bhí an bia sin á thabhairt abhaile; bhí sé á ullmhú ina bhéilí do na teaghlaigh; agus bhí an bhaint idir an scoil agus an baile á neartú ar bhealach a bhí difriúil agus a bhí praiticiúil ag an am chéanna.</P>
    <P>Tá an-chuid déanta ag tuismitheoirí na hÉireann agus ní thugtar i gcónaí an t-aitheantas dóibh agus is cuí.  Ní dóigh liom go dtugtar an t-aitheantas is cuí do na múinteoirí go ró-mhinic, ach an oiread.  Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh do shampla amháin den obair atá ar bun ag tuismitheoirí nach bhfuil róshoiléar on bPáipéar Bán.  Is é sin an réabhlóid is mó a tharla sa tír seo ó bunaíodh an Stát.  Tá mé ag déanamh tagairt do na gaelscoileanna.  Tá na gaelscoileanna sa tír seo ag dul ó neart go neart.  Tá siad ag féachaint ar an bPáipéar Bán seo agus, i ndáiríre, is beag treoir nó machnamh atá sa Pháipéar Bán don chineál struchtúir, córais agus coinníollacha a bheidh le comhlíonadh agus a bheidh mar chuspóirí ag an Roinn agus ag na gaelscoileanna féin amach anseo.  Is gá don Aire níos mó machnaimh a dhéanamh air sin agus féachaint an féidir an bearna sin a líonadh.  Is bearna an-mhór é sa Pháipéar Bán.</P>
    <P>Is é an meon atá ag an Roinn faoi láthair ná go bhfreagraíonn sé éileamh <Col N="1209" /> na dtuismitheoirí.  Glacann an Roinn go bhfuil éileamh ann do ghaelscoileanna ach ní dhéanann sé mórán níos nó ná sin: glacann sé go bhfuil an t-éileamh ann agus fágtar faoi na tuismitheoirí teacht le chéile agus an scoil a chur ar bun.  Ní leor sin, ar chor ar bith, de bharr go bhfuil an-chuid tuismitheoirí atá ag iarradh gaelscoileanna a chur ar bun.  Ní féidir leo é sin a dhéanamh i gcónaí mar go bhfuil na coinníollacha atá in áit andaingean. Caithfear méid áirithe leanaí a bheith ar fáil roimh ré nach bhfuil ag freastal ar aon scoil eile.  Caithfear a bheith an-eagraithe mar phobal deonach. Is beag cabhrach a fhaightear ón Roinn ach amháin nuair a iarrann siad aitheantas.  Fiú amháin ansin, bíonn an t-aitheontas an-mhall ag teacht, cé go bhfuil sé ráite ag an Aire go mbeidh sé níos tapúla amach anseo.  Ní leor é sin ar chor ar bith, go mór mór nuair atá struchtúir réigiúnda nua á lua sa Pháipéar Bán.  Cá fhágtar na gaelscoileanna ansin?  Faoi láthair, is mionlach iad lucht na ngaelscoileanna.  Cé go bhfuil siad ag fás go tapa, beidh siad ina mionlach ar feadh tamall eile.  Leis na struchtúir réigiúnda atá ag teacht ar an saol, de réir dealraimh, beidh ar na húdaráis áitiúla aire a thabhairt do na gaelscoileanna.</P>
    <P>An bhfuil an tAire sásta gach rud a fhágaint faoi na structúir réigiúnda seo? An cuma léi má cheapann na structúir réigiúnda nach fiú nó nach féidir leo ó thaobh costais de a bheith ag plé le gaelscoileanna? Nó an bhfuil sí chun structúr náisiúnta a chur ar bun le haghaidh gaelscoileanna i dtreo is gur féidir leis an mionlach sin comhoibriú le chéile agus a bheith níos eifeachtaí ó thaobh costais, eagraíochta agus mar sin de?  Ba cheart don Aire agus impím uirthi dul chun cainte leis na gaelscoileanna agus comhoibriú leo a leithéid de structúr a chur ar bun.  Faoi láthair is cosúil go bhfuil sí ag fágaint na ngaelscoileanna gan mórán aird a thabhairt orthu.  Ní amháin sin ach tá sí ag fágaint scoil-eanna na Gaeltachta mar sin freisin.</P>
    <P>Tá roinnt tagartí sa Pháipéar Bán do oidhreacht na tíre agus do shaibhreas na hoidhreachta sin ach fós féin is beag eile <Col N="1210" /> atá ann maidir le cabhair phraiticiúil agus treoir a thabhairt.  Is ceart dúinn an bearna sin a líonadh gan a thuilleadh moille.</P>
    <P>Tá roinnt ceisteanna eile a bhaineann leis an bPáipéar Bán agus is rudaí iad sin a phléifidh mé go dátheangach.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Special education&rdquo; is a term used widely nowadays but such terms can be meaningless unless backed up with adequate resources.  In the White Paper on Education much emphasis is placed on the need to integrate pupils with special needs into the mainstream education system.  While that sounds praisworthy and desirable, one must ask how teachers, already subjected to enormous pressure in overcrowded classrooms, will cope with the implementation of such an idealistic aspiration.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient to say there will be &ldquo;in-service&rdquo; training.  The Minister must specify exactly how this will be done, when, its cost, where such training will take place and how it will be structured, before she can convincingly implement it.  &ldquo;In service&rdquo; training is a top priority with many teachers but, equally important, the general classroom is in need of careful ministerial examination. For example, some children with special needs can easily be integrated in the general classroom, but there will be others who may be incontinent, who must have everything done for them and require the services of professionals such as speech therapists, apparently all of which will be provided on top of the already enormous pressures to which teachers are subjected.  The Minister should clearly specify whether she recognises that teacher numbers will have to be significantly increased, or pupil numbers reduced, within classes containing a child or children with special needs in the manner envisaged in this White Paper.  I should like to see the integration of children with special needs implemented as much as is humanly, practically possible but not to the detriment of the general quality of education being striven for; everything must be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>Some people might say it is easy for <Col N="1211" /> me to talk in this Chamber, standing on a very thick carpet in a peaceful environment. It is tempting for the Minister to have very idealistic objectives in her working environment which, while exerting considerable time pressures on her, would be regarded as the lap of luxury compared with conditions in most, if not all, our schools.  It is grand to observe school children in the public gallery being extremely quiet compared with their behaviour generally in classrooms.  Realism must permeate any implementation of the aspirations contained in this White Paper on Education and their attendant legislative provisions.</P>
    <P>There is reference also in the document to the desirability of the earliest possible intervention if and when something goes wrong in the education system. This rings hollow in the case of many people at present involved in education, many of whom are unable to avail of &ldquo;in-service&rdquo; training or the continuous back-up support required if that intervention is to be effective.  For example, the general pre-school scene here has been clouded by a haze of voluntary groups and organisations doing excellent work in this field and the Department of Education seems happy with the <i>status quo</i>.  However, many communities with which I am familiar, certainly in north County Dublin, experience enormous difficulty in maintaining these services, must engage in fund-raising and are merely surviving from one week to the next.</P>
    <P>Last evening I attended a table quiz organised for the benefit of a pre-school organisation in my constituency in the Swords area, at which there was a great atmosphere, people willing to help and support the cause.  Nonetheless, this means that the Department of Education gets off scot-free, merely giving lip service to the value of pre-school education, without being prepared to assist financially; the Department cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>The document also mentions the <Col N="1212" /> desirability of developing rigorous procedures for evaluating educational effectiveness, about which I have a couple of questions to put to the Minister. First, will such procedures be related to the diversity of pupils' abilities and their socio-economic backgrounds?  It would be very difficult, indeed dangerous, for the Department to jump in with both feet in evaluating educational effectiveness without also taking into account the overall diversity of opportunity that is part of life nowadays.</P>
    <P>Implicit in that evaluation aspiration, is the schools inspectorate in need of a thorough and serious overhaul?  Having listened to Deputy Browne talk about his experiences as a principal with schools inspectors, I pose that question tongue in cheek.  There is probably a need to take a serious look at the effectiveness of the schools inspectorate in addition to the relevance of some techniques used in the evaluation of education in this country.  However, I know a number of inspectors who have developed to the extent that they are operating within the 1990s, clued in very much to present-day educational needs, done in spite of the Department rather than with its support or encouragement.</P>
    <P>The question of value for money permeates the White Paper and that is understandable.  I would be interested to know whether the Department of Finance can give more information on what is referred to as value for money. Yesterday at Question Time the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, said the Department had undertaken some analysis of the cost of implementing the White Paper's proposals, but he said he could not make a public statement on it.  We await further information on this matter and I hope we will not have too long to wait.</P>
    <P>A number of questions arise from the value for money there in the White Paper.  I hope the Minister will change the old system of what I call factory education whereby children were regimented and were fed information like fodder and then swapped their school seat for a factory seat where they <Col N="1213" /> worked in a regimented fashion until they received the gold watch when they retired at 65.  If we accept such a system in the post-industrial society that is evolving in spite of Government initiatives we will not get value for money. The value for money concept needs to be broadly costed, and to include for example hospital costs.  Children should be taught how to look after themselves when they leave school so that they will not end up in hospital.</P>
    <P>Another cost factor relates to early retirement for teachers.  The present crisis should be considered in a broad context.  I recall a Victorian verse in Irish schools about happy English children, and it is certainly important that we have happy children and happy teachers.  Serious problems will arise for teachers and pupils if the resourcing of education is not considered seriously.</P>
    <P>I would be interested in the results of a survey on our prison population to determine the adequacy of education in preparing people for life.  I suspect that the system fails mostly at primary level. It is at that stage basic literacy, numberacy, social and other skills should be taught and if that is not done great difficulties arise in later life which result in a cost to the State.  There is a price to be paid for under-resourcing education and that should be considered.  I hope the Minister will influence her colleagues at Cabinet to take on board that suggestion.  Much of our prison population would not be in prison if the level of resources available in other countries was made available to primary education. Children who attend second and third level and further education benefit from the foundations laid at primary level and I am concerned the Government does not appreciate the significance of resourcing primary education.</P>
    <P>I would be interested in a survey to assess how many schools would comply with the health and safety standards which should apply in schools.  Deputy Browne spoke about the harm caused to children, perhaps unintentionally by <Col N="1214" /> using furniture.  It is within the Department's remit to decide who should provide furniture through the Office of Public Works and other organs of Government.  A number of questions arise in regard to health and safety in schools.  Before the White Paper proposals are enacted in legislation what efforts will be made to ensure a safe environment in schools?  We have heard time and again &mdash; I will not go into the details &mdash; about the dreadful conditions in some schools, which is a cause for great shame.  I hope improvements are made so that visitors to the country can see our schools as an example of how we treat our young people.  Not long ago there was controversy about President Robinson's visit to Argentina as she was not allowed see disadvantaged areas.  If the President of Argentina visited Ireland, would we be prepared to show that President our schools?  I doubt it.</P>
    <P>There is no reference in the White Paper to the provision of recreational space.  It is lamentable that there is only a passing reference to sport and physical education.  Due to Irish weather conditions very often physical education and sport in schools is almost non-existent. Provision should be made for alternative indoor pursuits.</P>
    <P>There is a passing reference in the White Paper to school attendance.  The Government should realise that non-attendance at school is no longer only due to children going off to a wood, fishing or taking part in some other activity in a Tom Sawyer like fashion.  In many cases nowadays children are kept at home by their parents who perhaps are ill, have a drink problem or are not able to ensure that their children go to school.  The school attendance system needs to be updated and the Government should take that into account.</P>
    <P>In the area of adult and third level education there is an anomaly in terms of free fees.  Maintenance is still a huge problem in that such fees are restricted to undergraduates and those outside that category pursuing further education must pay their own fees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1215" /> The aspiration that students should attend third level colleges in other European countries on the basis of being citizens of the European Union is also relevant.</P>
    <P>A student in my constituency whose parents are not in paid employment, her father having been made redundant shortly before she was due to go to college, managed through the kindness of a relative with whom she stayed in England to attend a college there.  I am sure the Minister agrees that student's pursuit of third level education in England is saving this country a great deal of money.  The student, who is pursuing a business studies course in a college in Northumbria, is required as part of her course to spend a year in a college in France midway through her course.  That ties in with what Deputy Brennan referred to as the enterprise culture.  The British Government will cover the cost of a British citizen spending a year in that French college and recognises it as part of his or her education, but it will not cover the cost of an Irish citizen attending that college. This matter has just come to light as that student could not have known when applying to that English college and securing payment of her fees that a problem would arise midway through her course.  She is facing a major problem and it is one which the Department must consider.  The Department has saved a great deal of money as a result of that student being prepared to pursue third level education in an English college. However, the Department has not replied to a letter from her seeking assistance.  She has been left high and dry midway through her course and prevented from pursuing it by spending a year gaining experience of business practice in France.  I urge the Minister to respond and assist that student who has saved the Department a significant amount of money by having the courage to pursue her studies abroad, thereby saving taxpayers' money.  I intend to follow up that case and I hope the Minister will consider it positively.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1216" /> Maidir le dul ó thír go tír agus múinteoirí ag teacht go dtí an tír seo tá go leor ráite mar gheall ar chaighdeán na Gaeilge agus an riachtanas atá ann ó thaobh Gaeilge de do mhúinteoirí.  Mar bhall den bhFóram Síocháin agus Athmhuintireas mé féin tá roinnt de na hargóintí atá ann cloiste agam maidir le cúrsaí Gaeilge agus múinteoirí atá oilte i dTuaisceart na hÉireann ag iarraidh a bheith mar mhúinteoirí anseo.  Tuigim go bhfuil deacracht ann.  Glacaim go bhfuil sé an-tábhachtach a bheith anchúramach faoi seo.  Tá baol ann má tá laghdú ar an gcaighdeán Gaeilge ó thaobh riachtanais i gcomhair múinteoireachta sa tír seo.  Má bhíonn múinteoirí ó Thuaisceart na hÉireann in ann teachtanseo mar mhúinteoirí gan Ghaeilge ar bith gur cineál cúl-doras é sin do dhaoine atá lag sa Ghaeilge sa Tuais-ceart nó sa Deisceart.  Bheadh baol ann go bhféadfadh daoine dul ón dtaobh seo den oileán suas go dtí an Tuaisceart, oiliúnt a fháil agus teacht thar n-ais anseo gan Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Seasaim féin leis an riachtanas atá ann don Ghaeilge agus iarraim ar an Aire é a dhéanamh chomh maith mar ní dóigh liom go bhfuilimid ag cabhrú leis an dtír nó leis an nglúin atá ag teacht aníos má táimid sásta é a laghdú.  Tá sé lag go leor, tá fhios againn.</P>
    <P>I know the area of gender equality is one of some interest to the Minister, but some of the theory and practice in that area have yet to be married.  Recently I learned from a good friend who sought a policy document on gender equality in primary education that the document is sketchy and not well developed, but it is welcome that at least one exists.  While the White Paper refers to the Higher Education Authority being responsible for gender equality, and that reads well, it is worrying to learn that it does not know very much about its responsibility in that area and is not prepared for or aware of its role.  There is no need to match theory with practice in that area because the White Paper is devalued if references in it are proved to be untrue.</P>
    <P>The question of why so many women, <Col N="1217" /> proportionately, are involved in teaching and so many men in inspecting requires a separate debate.  It is not only those men and women, but children who suffer from that.  It is worrying from the point of view of role models that the authority figure who enters schools is a man and the person with whom the children spend most of their time in school is a woman.  That discriminates against men and women in terms of how the pupils view each gender.  We need to examine different schools to ascertain how they manage.  I was lucky that the school in which I taught was a two teacher school and the second teacher was female.  The issue of gender equality in education needs to be considered separately.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a teaching council is necessary to ensure that teachers are not bad mouthed and maliciously discredited and teachers who have problems can get a fair hearing.  It has been repeatedly reported that there is unsatisfactory teaching and I recognise it is necessary to consider that matter seriously.  When dealing with teachers we must ensure that high standards are maintained.  Parent associations are somewhat unsure of their brief.  Some consider their role is that of fundraising and are not sure if they have anything more to contribute, while others consider they are the alternative board of management and find themselves in direct competition with the board of management proper.  A more detailed briefing is necessary if parent involvement in education is to be harmonious.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister is in the House to hear the views of Members. When will the various legislation referred to in the White Paper be introduced? Will the Minister indicate the extent of the legislative programme that will arise as a result of the paper?  This would enable us to focus on specific areas of education because, of necessity, this debate is wide-ranging.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister for Finance can give more details about the cost of implementing the recommendations of the White Paper than he gave yesterday <Col N="1218" /> at Question Time.  It appears some analysis of the cost has been carried out, but we have not yet received that information. If the aspirations in the White Paper are not implemented we are merely talking hot air, with no objective in mind.</P>
    <P>In analysing the cost of implementing its recommendations the Department of Finance should take into account the fact that according to the OECD, historically the Irish Government has invested less per pupil than any other developed country and confirmed that Irish primary teachers work longer hours than their counterparts in almost every other country.  This should be borne in mind in the context of the present discussions on the extra 30 hours, pressures on teachers and so on. Regardless of the logic of catering for pupils with special needs in mainstream schools, without proper resources, in-service training and so on, it will not work.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's leadership in this area and ask her to ensure that the recommendations of the paper are implemented in a partnership arrangement. As there is a great deal of anger among teachers, they should be consulted in this regard.  All partners in education have an important role to play and we cannot do anything without full co-operation.</P>

      <P>Of the 235 pages in the White Paper I will concentrate on the five which address the needs of people with disabilities.  While the report does not deal with this area in detail, I acknowledge that the emphasis is on the right direction.  Education of people with disabilities is not given priority either in terms of policy or funding.  I hope the reference to it in the White Paper will lead to the inclusion of more people with special needs in the education system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of the role of the education system to the lives of people with disabilities cannot be underestimated. Our society has failed to constructively address their needs and <Col N="1219" /> aspirations in the education system and, up to now, has continually promoted the exclusion and marginalisation of such people.  A total of 87 per cent of people with disabilities are unemployed and our education system must determine how it failed to include those people along the way.  Recent research by the Irish Wheelchair Association highlighted an alarming scale of isolation and forced dependence.  Surveys highlight that 50 per cent of those in residential care are there involuntarily, that 42 per cent of people with disabilities are not involved in social activities outside their homes and that 74 per cent are not involved in education or training programmes. Unfortunately, because a person cannot walk or must use a wheelchair, we cannot be certain that is the only disability he or she will encounter in life.  Our education system must ensure that such people can become involved with their peers in the community and not be excluded from education in their parishes.</P>
    <P>Historically, Ireland has conformed to the model of sending children with disabilities to special schools.  While such schools provide them with a fine education, many of them would prefer to be educated in mainstream schools.  This trend has been developed in many other countries, but appears to be ignored here.  Evidence suggests that significant numbers of children with disabilities would benefit from enrolment in mainstream schools if provided with accessible facilities and some additional support. In drawing up plans for schools the Department of Education must ensure the buildings are accessible.  A new school opened in Ashbourne last September, but when a pupil confined to a wheelchair enrolled he had to apply to the Department of Education for modifications to be carried out so that he could enter the school building.  While the building was accessible in terms of the width of the doors and corridors, because of gravel outside the front door the wheelchair could not enter the building.  We should also adopt a <Col N="1220" /> planned approach towards making all existing school buildings accessible to such people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the sections of the White Paper which aspire to redirect official policy and propose the objective of ensuring that education provision for children with disabilities is flexible enough to meet there particular needs, ranging from mainstream to special schooling.</P>
    <P>Progress in this area has been slow. Five years ago the EC Council of Minsters for Education, under the Presidency of Deputy O'Rourke, adopted a resolution on the integration of children with special needs; three years ago a Green Paper outlined similar points and two years ago a special education review committee published its report, a task force was set up and the National Education Convention endorsed the idea of inclusion.  In the past five years many reports were published and resolutions adopted.  However, parents are concerned that while their hopes have been raised by the publication of documents, there has been no follow-up progress.</P>
    <P>A recent one day seminar of the Parents for Integration Group was held in Dublin.  Those parents stressed the fact that while many reports have been published, there has not been enough action.  On a recent visit to the Department of Education a delegation of parents from that group expressed the need for the Department to understand their concerns about having their children educated in their local parishes.  They are concerned that the years seems to have added nothing to the development of inclusive education for children with disabilities and are appealing to the Minister to make progress in this area. Parents are so frustrated in this regard that they have raised money to take legal action against the Department, two such cases have been taken in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>We have long since reached the time for action on this important issue.  I hope it will be a priority in the Government's policies, particularly in regard to funding.  If not, the references to it in <Col N="1221" /> the White Paper and the commitment on special needs will ring hollow.  It has come to my attention recently that the publication of this document took some time.  It is a glossy document, which cost £260,000, containing 25 pages of colour photographs.  That money could have been used to provide facilities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I commend the proposals to give statutory responsibility to the education boards for implementing the inclusion objective.  That is a good idea but only if the education boards are required to report to the Department of Education on an annual basis and the Department of Education collates that information and publishes national data with regard to their responsibililty in this area. There is little point in handing over powers on this special area to the education boards if the Department does not keep a watching brief by way of annual report in regard to what is taking place.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from the White Paper that this aspect of education will come within the responsibility of a special committee.  For these committees to respond properly to the needs of the people in the special care area, it is important to ensure parental involvement on the committee.</P>
    <P>With regard to integrated facilities, there is a risk of removing the onus from each school to provide for the reasonable needs of children with disabilities and of undermining the core principle that children should be educated, as far as possible, with their peers in their own community.  The idea of an entirely distinct sector within the education system is likely to be continued if basic issues of concern to students with disabilities do not form an integral part of mainstream education.  It seems likely that the Minister is essentially proposing another tier of slightly less segregated schooling.  This is an advance but it does not address the core issues.  There is a need for special schools and the idea of special schools serving as regional resource centres in the community is to be commended.  However, we must <Col N="1222" /> always be mindful of the needs of individual children in individual parishes.</P>
    <P>The important area of teacher training is not properly addressed in the White Paper.  This is a major issue with parents, children with special needs and teachers.  Many parents feel that teachers frequently resist integration of children with disabilities within their classes due to lack of experience in teaching such children.  I question whether sufficient thought is put into teacher training.  We talk about in-service training for teachers of students with special needs but we are not ambitious enough.  The White Paper also promotes the perception of the exceptional marginal position of such students within the school system and that is unfortunate.  Training to cater for students with special needs should be a part of the teacher training curriculum. This should also be included in the preservice education for second level teachers.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently pointed to an increase in the number of travelling special need teachers.  These teachers are exceedingly important in the community and they provide an invaluable service.  Unfortunately, they are thinly spread throughout the country and are generally unable to devote more than one or two hours per week to each pupil.  Pupils attending a blind school, for example, who also have difficulties with hearing urgently require the services of a travelling special need teacher for more than one or two hours per week.  The number of hours currently available are insufficient and the service should be broadened because these teachers are essential.</P>
    <P>Transport is an area that must be examined also.  It is not mentioned in the White Paper under the section dealing with special needs but it is an area that is very much to the forefront.  I drew to the Minister's attention the case of an 11 year old child in Bandon who had previously attended a mainstream school 15 miles from his home, but who has not been to school for eight months <Col N="1223" /> because no accessible transport is available to that school.  Obviously there are other such children and if progress is to be made on inclusion, there must be a radical development in accessible transport for these children to their nearest schools.</P>
    <P>I understand there is a difficulty with regard to the absence of a relevant technologist within the Department and a budget, independent of special schools, for the provision of equipment.  This is an area in which the Minister could act rapidly because there is not any major funding implication involved.  It is important that technologists within the Department have a special budget for equipment for mainstream schools to cater for pupils with special needs.</P>
    <P>The White Paper is weak in regard to this area in third level education.  At primary and second level it is proposed to establish a clear statutory framework but there is no such proposal for third level.  It is suggested that institutions will be encouraged, rather than obliged, to take action.  The access programme, which has been in operation in UCD since 1989, has been successful and it should be copied in other colleges.  The Minister should give the Higher Education Authority specific statutory responsibility for monitoring and reporting on the efforts of colleges to promote inclusion.  The word &ldquo;encouraged&rdquo; should be changed to &ldquo;obliged&rdquo; in dealing with third level because there is not enough emphasis on the importance of this.</P>
    <P>Advanced academic study on disability issues should be supported whenever possible.  As such, the suggested national institute for mental handicap studies would be a welcome development and, beyond this proposal, every possible effort should be made &mdash; and I presume is being made &mdash; to locate the European Centre for Excellence on Research in Disability in Ireland.  The presence of such a body would be an invaluable catalyst on the domestic and European issues concerning people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1224" /> I urge the Minister to give effect to a promise to prioritise this area by immediately commencing to take the obvious steps which need to be taken to promote inclusion in all of our schools. Many of the long term statutory proposals in the White Paper are welcome and will get considerable support. However, the Minister should reemphasise the idea of designated schools and stress that the first choice should always be to give each child an opportunity of being educated in his own community and among his own peers.  If we are attempting to enact an educational blueprint for the next century, we must not make the mistakes of the past by marginalising children with disabilities.  Like those of other children, their needs should be part of our education system, and not just a certain area of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate on the White Paper on Education.  The Minister and her officials, must feel a sense of satisfaction in finally having this White Paper published.  It is a long time since the Green Paper began and we have had many Ministers for Education since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education is central to the development of any nation.  The principles we hold and the philosophy we adopt as a people are handed on by us through the education system.  Hardly any Government Department touches the lives of so many people as does the Department of Education.  One million students currently attend educational institutions at one level or another from pre-school to post graduate studies.  Their teachers and parents are directly affected by any decision of Government which influences the lives of these students.  The taxpayer who foots the bill for this most important Department, the business community to whom many of our students will turn for their employment and the hard pressed pensioners whose hope for a better future lies in the civic spirit of future generations all have a <Col N="1225" /> vested interest in the promotion of policies which will produce the best system of education possible.</P>
    <P>We, as legislators, have a responsibility to all sectors of society where education is concerned.  It is our duty to ensure that any change we propose to make at any level of our education system will lead to improvements.  Education policies adopted by us since the foundation of the State have led us to the point where we have, by and large, a well educated population.  It is time for change and we all recognise that.  Our young people must be given the opportunity to face the forthcoming millennium with confidence.  The foundations on which we build are as good as they can be.  Indeed, the record of this House on its approach to education is a proud one.</P>
    <P>In particular I want to mention my party's record.  It is important that we examine carefully any new development put before us.  The White Paper on Education, Charting our Education Future, is designed to put in place structures which will have a profound effect on those who we will represent in the years to come.  We cannot afford to make any mistakes in dealing with the contents of this document.  The White Paper is the result of years of hard work by many dedicated people.  I am well aware of the great effort put in by officials in the Department and that should be recognised.</P>
    <P>The White Paper has been influenced by the National Education Convention which heard submissions from almost every group who could claim a legitimate interest in the educational process. During the plenary sessions of the convention we were privileged to hear the suggestions, aspirations, desires and fears of the widest range of interest groups ever to be heard in the history of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 3, 7, 17, 26, 28, 30, 45, and 46 together.</P>
      <P>Treatment for those diagnosed positive for hepatitis C, irrespective of the source of infection, is being provided at the following six designated hospitals:&mdash; Beaumont Hospital, Dublin; Mater Hospital, Dublin; St. James's Hospital, Dublin; St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin; Cork University Hospital; and University College Hospital, Galway.</P>
      <P>The treatment may initially involve an out-patient visit which may be followed by a short admission for clinical investigation and follow-up treatment, if required.</P>
      <P>The treatment, including prescribed medication, is being provided by the public hospital service free of charge.  A counselling service is available at the following locations: Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Tipperary, Clare, Donegal, Wexford, Sligo, Mayo, Galway, Cavan-Monaghan, Westmeath and Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board (BTSB) will arrange transport for people from Meath, Kildare and Wicklow to attend at the BTSB or the Well Woman Centre for counselling.</P>
      <P>Arrangements for counselling may be made by contacting the Blood Transfusion Service Board (BTSB) or by contacting a general practitioner.  The counselling service arranged by the BTSB is currently being reviewed to ensure that the service is responsive to the great variety of needs of those diagnosed positive for hepatitis C.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The services put in place for persons <Col N="1229" /> who have tested positive for hepatitis C will be available for as long as they are required.  The needs of those who have been diagnosed as positive for hepatitis C will be monitored and re-assessed on an on-going basis to ensure that the necessary support services are provided to meet their needs.</P>
    <P>I have asked the BTSB to ensure that information required from the board is forthcoming on request to people with hepatitis C who received blood transfusions or anti-D.  In this regard, a free phone service is being operated by the BTSB.</P>
    <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board is currently implementing a targeted look back programme to identify persons who may have been infected with hepatitis C as a result of receiving a blood transfusion.  This programme has two phases, the first phase will attempt to identify donors who have tested positive for hepatitis C, the product (red blood cells, platelets or plasma), the hospital to which the product was issued and the recipient.  The second phase will trace the recipient with a view to offering screening.  Phase one of the programme is well advanced.</P>
    <P>The BTSB has advised that it has identified approximately 100 donors to date who were anti-D recipients who may have donated while positive for hepatitis C and whose donations will be traced.</P>
    <P>The BTSB is also endeavouring to trace the infection source of those persons who are known to be positive for hepatitis C and who received a blood transfusion in the past.</P>
    <P>A limited <i>ex gratia</i> expenses scheme is being operated by the BTSB to ensure that all anti-D recipients are in a position to avail of the screening, counselling and treatment services.</P>
    <P>The policy document, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, included a commitment to fair compensation for women infected by the hepatitis C virus from anti-D. The Government has decided to establish, as a matter of urgency, a tribunal which will assess compensation on an <i>ex-gratia</i> basis in respect of anti-D <Col N="1230" /> recipients who are infected with hepatitis C antibodies-virus and the partners and children of these women who are also infected with hepatitis C antibodies-virus.</P>
    <P>Other groups who have members who are positive for hepatitis C are also seeking compensation.  There is on going consideration in my Department of the position in relation to people who are positive for hepatitis C or who were recipients of blood transfusions.  I have met with representatives of Transfusion Positive, who represent 48 blood transfusion recipients who are hepatitis C positive and advised them that decisions in relation to access to the compensation tribunal, when established, for groups other than anti-D recipients will be made in due course.  Further discussions will take place in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>The BTSB has advised that there is no evidence that HIV infection can be transmitted through anti-D.  Furthermore, worldwide, no cases of HIV transmission have ever been reported with intravenous immunoglobulin.</P>
    <P>I am not considering referring the hepatitis C files to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated in the House some time ago that he had accepted the Miriam Hederman-O'Brien report but has he accepted full and complete liability for the injuries caused?  Why does he feel that an <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal rather than a statutory tribunal would satisfy the continuing needs of these women and their families, some of whom have children as young as five years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There was nothing about liability in the report of the expert group chaired by Miriam Hederman-O'Brien.  I have indicated that I would like to proceed to pay compensation to women who have hepatitis C as a result of receiving anti-D product. Women have a perfect right to go through the courts and the setting up of a tribunal does not take away the right <Col N="1231" /> of anyone to process her claim through the courts.  If they decide to process their claim through the tribunal that I set up, the tribunal will offer compensation by way of full and final settlement but only if that is accepted will recourse to the courts end.</P>
      <P>There are advantages for women to process their claim through the tribunal. Previously as Minister for Justice I inherited the difficulties that litigants were experiencing in respect of the Stardust fire and I was involved in setting up that tribunal which expeditiously dealt with between 800 and 900 claims.  It was very difficult as cases had been embedded in the courts for years.  Women might seek recourse to the tribunal for the following reasons: (1) it will be faster than the courts; (2) because compensation will be on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis the women will not have to prove liability in any way and all they will have to establish is that they were infected with hepatitis C as a result of receiving anti-D product.  The argument before the tribunal would be the degree of compensation in proportion to their medical situation and their needs; (3) cases before the tribunal can be pursued in private whereas it would not necessarily be the case before the courts.  That is an important consideration because many of the women who have hepatitis C have not told anybody outside their immediate family circle and in a number of cases they certainly have not told their employers in case it would have an adverse effect on their employment prospects.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister totally agree with the assertion of the Blood Transfusion Service Board that there was absolutely no risk to Irish women who received one of the 10,000 doses of anti-D from a donor who was later found to be HIV positive?  What steps has the Minister taken in the public interest to ensure that the assertion of the Blood Transfusion Service Board is true?  Can he stand over the board's competence in this matter given what <Col N="1232" /> happened in the past?  This was known in 1985 when testing for HIV began but it was not revealed until 17 February 1994.  What steps has he taken to independently evaluate the potential risk, which is quite frightening, especially in light of the other shocking revelations about the blood bank?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Testing for HIV was not carried out until 1985. The Hederman-O'Brien report points out that one donor tested positive.  The advice available to me from the Blood Transfusion Service Board and others is that the process of fractionation involved in the manufacture of the immune globulin product removes all risk of HIV infection.  While the blood of the donor could be HIV positive the process of manufacturing the anti-D product eliminates any risk.  This is the international experience.  No cases of HIV transmission from intravenous immune globulin has been reported worldwide.  Testing of the product proved negative.  In the Munster area 3,000 women were checked and all were negative. I appreciate the way in which the Deputy put the question.  It is a frightening topic.  All the evidence is that the process involved in manufacturing the anti-D product from the infected donor's plasma eliminates all risk.  We are talking about a blood product manufactured prior to 1985 and if there was a risk it would show now in cases of HIV and AIDS.  There is no evidence of that.</P>

      <P>It is in the interests of the Minister and those infected with hepatitis C to have the matter resolved by a tribunal.  Positive Action and the Transfusion Positive group have put this case to the Minister. We must accept, as the Minister does, that these women were the victims of the actions of a semi-State company. Whatever support is available to them must be State guaranteed, not just now but in future.  The tribunal must look at injury already caused, future injury, injury that will be caused to the infected <Col N="1233" /> children who are as young as five years old, the ongoing health care and counselling that will be necessary.  The Minister will not always be the Minister for Health and the women need to be assured that it will be State guaranteed. Does the Minister accept the truth of what I am saying?  Will he ensure the tribunal is statutory based?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I accept that the Deputy's interests are similar to mine.  The concerns of the women is the priority issue.  A statutory tribunal would not have the flexiblity to deal with individual cases.  It is not a case of there being any particular advantage to the State in going the non-statutory route but it would be a more effective way of delivering what may be required. We are having discussions with Positive Action and other groups to see how best to achieve the objective of fair compensation. Under the Infectious Diseases Act, hepatitis non A B, which was the designation prior to 1989 and which would now be deemed to include hepatitis C, is an infectious disease.  Any person who has the disease is entitled to free medical care in public hospitals.  I am looking at the possibility of giving further statutory help in this area.  I do not want to be tied to this but for discussion purposes it may be possible to have a card which would entitle the holder to the same rights as a medical card.  I do not know what it would be called but something along those lines which would have a statutory base might be appropriate.  I make a distinction between ongoing medical care which the Minister is obliged to provide &mdash; regardless of how hepatitis C was contracted &mdash; and compensation.  We are talking to women, Positive Action and the representatives of other groups. There are advantages in having a non-statutory tribunal which I wish to tease out.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Bain report is a consultancy one and not relevant to this topic.  However, the Hederman-O'Brien report is relevant.  It is open to anyone to refer anything to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn and others suggested that this bordered on criminal negligence.  As I understand it, that is a common law offence.  If, as a result of our conversation today, the Director of Public Prosecutions were to take the file, he would not be able to act under statute law.  The proof would be &ldquo;beyond reasonable doubt&rdquo; and the best that could be established, from a close reading of the report, was that people did not do certain things rather than that people did certain things.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I met representatives of both the Irish Haemophilia Association and the Irish Kidney Association and I am disposed to helping them.  They have the same access to health care and counselling and the <i>ex gratia</i> expenses scheme as the women from the two anti-D groups.  On the question of compensation, unfortunately the members of the Irish Haemophilia Association are going over the same ground &mdash; they had difficulties previously with HIV-AIDS.  However, they found that the way in which compensation was delivered on that occasion was effective and met their needs.  I am discussing with them whether their needs would be best served by inclusion in the tribunal or by <Col N="1236" /> something along the lines done previously. I will meet with them again and my officials are in ongoing contact with them.</P>
      <P>Similar arguments apply in regard to the members of the Irish Kidney Association. In terms of compensation, their needs would be more similar to those of haemophiliacs than those of the women in Positive Action and other associated groups.  There is ongoing discussions between me, my Department and the representatives of various groups and we are trying to fulfil the commitment in the Programme for Government to give fair compensation.</P>
      <P>On the measures being taken to check the source of the infection, the primary sources of infection identified in the Miriam Hederman-O'Brien report was from anti-D product from a donor in 1976-77 and from a second donor in 1989.  Some of the women who received the anti-D product and contacted hepatitis C subsequently became blood donors.  This is where the targeted lookback programme comes in.  One is tracing donations of blood from women which would not have gone into blood product and one must look at both men and women in the follow up.  Since hepatitis C has only been a recognised manifestation of hepatitis since 1989, some blood donors during the 1970s and 1980s had hepatitis C.  There was no way of screening these people out of the system until screening was introduced here in the autumn of 1991.  Consequently, there is another trace back here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, donors who were active in 1991 when screening was introduced and whose donations were refused as a result of testing positive for hepatitis C are documented and one can trace them.  However, one cannot do the same in regard to donors in the 1970s or 1980s as some of them discontinued being donors because they changed jobs, emigrated, died or got married.  There is a background level of hepatitis C in every country which has nothing to do with infection from blood.  This is a wide, complex and difficult issue and I am <Col N="1237" /> proceeding carefully with a view to being fair to everyone.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Current personnel policy for health service provides that health agencies which are managing resources within allocation may fill replacement non-consultant posts, including social worker and public health nursing posts, without recourse to my Department.  For this reason the information sought by the Deputy in relation to vacancies is not readily available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am aware that some boards are experiencing difficulties in recruiting social workers here.  This has <Col N="1238" /> resulted in a recruitment drive in the United Kingdom.  One of the main reasons for the shortage of social workers is the major expansion in social work services in the child care area over the past two years.  Since 1993 my Department approved an additional 200 social worker posts for the purpose of implementing the Child Care Act.  This represents an increase of approximately 50 per cent on the pre-1993 level.</P>
    <P>The scale of the increase in the number of posts over such a short period is unprecedented and has contributed to the recruitment difficulties now being experienced.  I am confident, however, that the steps being taken by the health boards, together with the recent establishment of the Social Work Validation Body, will help to ease the problem.</P>
    <P>On the public health nursing side, my Department is currently reviewing the public health nursing service.  The review will take into account the greater focus on primary health care at community level as spelt out in the national health strategy, &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo;.  This review will provide essential information to allow for enhanced planning of public health service provision particularly in regard to addressing local needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that in order to ease the situation in the social worker area much more investment should be made in the public health nursing area?  From their <Col N="1239" /> first day of training nurses are involved in both the practical and theoretical side of the job.  Nobody objects to a public health nurse calling to a house in the locality &mdash; from the time a child is born public health nurses have occasion to visit homes.  In order to complement the social work service the Department should consider investing more heavily in public health nursing and give public health nurses more involvement in the implementation of the Child Care Act.</P>

      <P>As part of this Government's ongoing commitment to the further development of services to people with mental handicap, a total of £12 million in additional funding has been made available in 1995.  Of this £2 million was used to meet identified needs in existing services.</P>
      <P>The sum of £8 million revenue and £2 million capital is being allocated for the development of new services.</P>
      <P>An amount of £7.1 million revenue has been allocated to the health board regions for the development of a broad range of services including: 189 additional residential and respite places; 418 additional day care places; further extension of the home support services; improvement of services for persons with mental handicap who are behaviourally disturbed; provision of hepatitis B vaccinations for staff working in the mental handicap services and client groups who are considered to be at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remaining £900,000 will be made available for the development of services for persons with autism and for the <Col N="1241" /> transfer of persons with a mental handicap from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements.  This funding will be allocated for allowing further discussions between my Department and the health boards.</P>
    <P>The capital expenditure of £2 million will be directly related to the agreed service developments.</P>
    <P>In addition £4.2 million is being provided in 1995, as part of the EU Structural Fund Programme 1994-99, for the development of training centres which will benefit people with disabilities including those with a mental handicap.</P>
    <P>The precise services to be put in place in each region will be agreed with the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees within the guidelines issued by my Department and subject to my approval.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the provision of additional services for persons with a mental handicap has a very high priority within my Department.  Between 1990 and 1994 a cumulative figure of £26.5 million revenue and £6.08 million capital in additional funding has been invested in services for people with mental handicap.  In the same period overall expenditure on services to persons with mental handicap increased from £161 million to £238 million.</P>
    <P>The Government has outlined its commitment to the continued development of these services in both the policy document, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, and the Health Strategy.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Will the Minister agree that it is unacceptable that we should have a waiting list for mental illness patients, especially the handicapped?  The president of the association has said it is unacceptable.  Yet, in Áras Attracta, County Mayo, there are 40 vacant beds. I appreciate that much is being done and that substantial amounts of money are being allocated but this is an area that has not been looked at sufficiently.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of waiting lists is receiving priority in the Department. When I came to office I discovered there had been no census of the mental handicap population since the general census of 1981.  A database is being developed within the Department and information has come back from the various health boards.  That information is being thoroughly analysed.  This is an important initial step in the context of an ongoing commitment of further resources to the sector.  It is important to know exactly the number of people for whom we need to cater.</P>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point.  None of us likes to see waiting lists.  Under successive Governments, substantial moneys have been allocated to this area and a great deal of improvement has been wrought.  Home support which was introduced by a former Minister for Health, Deputy Rory O'Hanlon, in 1992, is developing and is welcomed by parents and relatives, the carers generally of mentally handicapped persons. In the past we have tended to focus on the mentally handicapped who could not come through the Rehab programme grades 1, 2 and 3 by placing them in sheltered workshops and the problem was regarded as solved.  This was greatly to underestimate the potential of those people whom Members on all sides seek to help in every way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The model for the future may well be a mixture of respite care, home support and resource centres rather than the old concept of the sheltered workshop.  We need to find more places in the private sector where some of these people can go for a day or two in the week and become more involved in the community and with other people.  In a resource centre, in the context of what many people regard as the sheltered <Col N="1243" /> workshop, people would be exposed to a wide range of activities.  On the basis that every person has some special talent, the special talent of the individual can be identified and a programme developed around it.  I would like to see emphasis on the individual.</P>
    <P>We all wish to see the waiting lists eliminated.  The method by which they are to be eliminated is a question we should all address because no person has a monopoly of wisdom on that issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have figures which are subject to analysis and rechecking.  The data received indicate that about 1,453 persons are waitlisted for residential services and 1,526 persons for day care services throughout the country. Obviously we have to check for duplication and to quantify the level of care required and differentiate between current and future needs.  For instance, a person on a waiting list may not require service for five or six years.  We want to do this job well and as accurately as possible.  The figures I have given are relatively accurate but subject to rechecking.</P>

Because of the planning and financial implications involved for the two hospitals, it is not possible to say, at this time, when the move will take place.</P>
      <P>Pending relocation to the Mater Hospital site, a programme of improvements is ongoing at the Children's Hospital, Temple Street.  In the interim, it is intended that the hospital will be provided with adequate facilities to enable it perform its important functions in the delivery of paediatric hospital care.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister recognise that because the patients are children one is dealing with more than one person, because when a child goes to hospital it is usually accompanied by at least one parent, if not both, and this has the effect of multiplying the numbers passing through the hospital?  In 1994 the hospital had a throughput of <Col N="1245" /> 120,000 patients which is probably greater than some of the other high tech hospitals in the Dublin area.  The casualty department dealt with 50,000 children and their parents in a totally inadequate accident and emergency department.</P>

The Sisters of Charity and all the staff there are to be complimented. It does need investment but plans which were put in place a long time ago to relocate it on the same campus as the Mater have not moved ahead.  In one way the grand plan has inhibited smaller plans which might remedy the problems. It is still the intention to put it on the same campus as the Mater.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Under the new dental treatment services scheme which was introduced by my Department on 1 November 1994 dental treatment for all adults with medical card eligibility will be phased in over a four year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the initial phasing of the scheme persons aged 65 years and over have <Col N="1247" /> been identified as a priority group and additional resources have been made available to health boards to enable them to provide dental treatment including denture treatment for this group.  Emergency dental treatment for the relief of pain is, of course, available to all medical card holders irrespective of age.</P>
    <P>However, where their existing resources allow, health boards will continue to provide routine dental treatment to adults who have not yet reached 65 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Respite care services are provided for persons with a mental handicap, for the elderly and for people with physical or sensory disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1248" /> The provision of respite care for persons with a mental handicap is an integral part of service provision.  Respite care is provided in a flexible manner through the use of a variety of service elements.  These include dedicated respite places, the use of five day residential places at week-ends for respite purposes, holiday respite, host families and the home support services.</P>
    <P>In the period 1990 to 1994 more than 780 additional places were provided for residential, emergency and respite services. In 1995 a total of £12 million has been made available for the development of services of which £8 million revenue and £2 million capital is for new services.  These new services will include up to 189 additional residential and respite places and the further extension of the home support services.</P>
    <P>When allocating additional funding over the past few years, health boards were instructed to ensure that the services were directed at those waitlisted for services.  Particular emphasis was placed on the provision of appropriate support services such as home support and respite care.  These support services, when taken in conjunction with the provision of appropriate day services, are vital in enabling families to continue to care for their family member with mental handicap.</P>
    <P>Supporting dependent elderly people at home is a major objective of health policy.  As Minister for Health I am very conscious of the contribution made by carers to the maintenance of dependent elderly people in their own homes.  In recent years my Department has encouraged health boards to provide support services for the elderly and their carers whether by services in the home such as home help or by way of respite care in a hospital or nursing home.  This year the sum of £7.5 million is being made available to improve further health and welfare services for the elderly and their carers, including respite care.</P>
    <P>In the case of services for people with physical and sensory disability, the development of health care services, <Col N="1249" /> including the provision of respite care, is currently being examined by the Review Group on Services for people with Physical and Sensory Disability.  The group's final report is expected within the coming months.  The extension of respite care will be considered in the light of the review group's report. However, even in advance of the report, my Department has, from development funds allocated in 1993 and 1994 for physical and sensory disability services, provided approximately £250,000 for the extension and improvement of respite care facilities.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware the respite care fund of £500,000 which was formally administered by the Department of Social Welfare has been transferred to my Department.  I will be making an announcement shortly on the allocation of this fund.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy can see from my reply, the provision of appropriate support services for carers and, in particular, the provision of respite care is an issue which is very much to the forefront of the Government's policy in the development of community based services for the elderly and for persons with a disability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that 89 additional places will be provided during 1995 for persons who are mentally handicapped.  Will he clarify how many additional places will be provided for the elderly and those with physical and sensory disabilities?  Is he aware that of the 30,000 carers throughout the country only 2,500 are in receipt of the carer's allowance?  The remainder receive little recognition for their considerable work within the community. While there has been much talk about moving from institutional to community care the necessary back-up services are not being provided.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I appreciate the Deputy's concern.  While the carer's allowance has been helpful it is restrictive in its application.  I intend later this year to re-examine a range of <Col N="1250" /> services for the elderly and will take this matter into account.  On the question of places, the number is divided between the health boards but this year an additional £7.5 million is being made available to improve health and welfare services for the elderly.  This is in line with the commitments in the policy document <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of funding for respite care, I am concerned about the geographical spread.  Caring for the elderly, particularly those suffering from Alzheimer's disease, places enormous demands on carers.  I am concerned that insufficient respite care beds are available.  There should be an onus on the health boards to ensure that additional beds are provided from the additional £7.5 million over and above the figure of 89 additional places mentioned by the Minister, that these are spread evenly throughout the country and that emphasis is placed on patients suffering for Alzheimer's disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is difficult to ensure an even spread when funding is provided by way of a block allocation to health boards which have discretion in deciding how it should be spent.  Sometimes they give priority to one area of activity rather than another but as a matter of general policy I would like to see more places provided for persons suffering from Alzheimer's disease and greater attention paid to those who care for them.  It is almost a cliché now to say that we could easily end up with two patients if we are not careful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that one will not get better value for money than by providing respite care facilities?  Most health boards are now in a position to appoint geriatricians who will not allow patients to be placed in institutions as has been the case heretofore. There is a great need to provide respite care beds to give those caring for elderly relatives at home time off.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I agree that greater priority must be given to the provisions of respite care beds.  The elderly have different needs.  It is not true that being old is synonymous with being ill.  Most of the elderly are in great form, in good health and enjoying life. The policy is to ensure that as many of them as possible remain at home and active within the community.  As they have more needs the role of carers is vital.  The interests of carers as well as the interests of the people for whom they care have to be taken into account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie) Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>The central recommendation of the report of the Kilkenny incest investigation was that the necessary resources be made available to facilitate the implementation of all sections of the Child Care Act, 1991, particularly those provisions which relate to the care and protection of children who are being abused or neglected. In accordance with the commitment in the policy agreement <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, the remaining provisions of the Act will be implemented by the end of 1996.  I am determined that this objective will be achieved and that the legislation in its entirety will be fully operational within the timeframe set by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next phase in the implementation programme involves the commencement of Parts III to IV which deal respectively with the protection of children in emergencies, care proceedings and the powers and duties of health boards in relation to children in their care.  It is my firm intention that these provisions will be implemented before the end of 1995.  Their early introduction will greatly strengthen the powers of the health boards, the Garda and the courts <Col N="1252" /> to intervene on behalf of children who are in need of care and protection.</P>
    <P>Parts III to VI contain the most complex provisions of the Act and must be brought into operation at the same time. Various sets of new regulations are required to give full effect to them. Extensive preparatory work is under way in my Department to facilitate the commencement of these provisions before the end of the year.  Draft new foster care regulations and a new guide to standards in children's residential centres have been prepared and circualted for comment to the various interest groups, in accordance with a commitment given when the legislation was being processed through the Oireachtas.  Further draft sets of regulations relating to the placement of children with relatives and in residential care are in the pipeline and will be circulated for comment before they are finalised.</P>
    <P>When Parts III to VI of the Act have been brought into operation, arrangements will then be made for the commencement during 1996 of Part VII which deals with the supervision and inspection of pre-school services and Part VIII which relates to the registration of children's residential centres.</P>
    <P>It has always been recognised that for the legislation to be effective, it must be backed up by a sustained programme of investment in the development of new child care services and family supports which are capable of responding to the needs of those whom the Act is designed to help.  The implementation of Parts III to IV in particular have enormous resource implications.  The various new initiatives, approved during 1993 and 1994 at an annual cost in the region of £20 million, were specifically aimed at preparing the health boards for the introduction of those Parts.</P>
    <P>The Government is anxious to build on the progress that has so far been achieved in developing and expanding services and supports for children and families in disadvantaged circumstances. A sum of £10 million has been set aside this year to finance a further round of <Col N="1253" /> new child care developments which will again be targeted at strengthening further the capacity of the boards to meet the new demands about to be imposed on them.  Details of these developments are currently being finalised by my Department in consultation with the health boards.</P>
    <P>These allocations represent the largest ever investment of resources in the child care services and reflect the concern of the Government and the community in general that a comprehensive framework be put in place for the care and protection of vulnerable children.</P>
    <P>The Kilkenny incest report also recommended that procedures for the identification, investigation and management of child abuse should be revised and that agreed Protocols should be put in place which clearly identify the roles and responsibilities of the relevant staff and provide for appropriate inter-programme collaboration within health boards.</P>
    <P>At regional level, each of the health boards has reviewed its child protection procedures in the light of these recommendations and has taken specific measures to improve arrangements in this area.  For example, the North Eastern Health Board recently launched a manual of child protection guidelines, intended to promote good practice by ensuring that child care professionals are provided with standardised guidelines on the detection and inter-agency management of child abuse.  Similar procedures are currently being developed by the other health boards.</P>
    <P>At national level, a new procedure for the notification of suspected cases of child abuse between the health boards and the Garda was recently launched. This procedure amends the child abuse guidelines issued by my Department in 1987 in relation to the interaction between health boards and the Garda in child protection matters.  It clarifies the circumstances in which the health boards and the Garda are to notify suspected cases of child abuse to one <Col N="1254" /> another and gives guidance on the consultations that should take place following such a notification.  A central feature of the procedure, which is in line with a key recommendation of the Kilkenny incest report, is a standardised notification system between the agencies. This is designed to facilitate a uniform approach to the notification of suspected child abuse on the part of health board and Garda personnel throughout the country.  The document has been framed in a way that will facilitate the twin objectives of protecting the child and the full investigation of any alleged offence.</P>
    <P>I believe that the new procedure represents a significant step forward in achieving the closest possible co-ordination and co-operation between the health boards and the Garda, who are the two key players involved in the difficult area of child protection.  The operation of the procedure will be evaluated on an ongoing basis and, if it emerges that it needs to be strengthened or extended, this will be done.</P>
    <P>The Kilkenny report also recommended that there should be mandatory reporting of child abuse by designated professionals.  The new notification procedure gives effect to this recommendation on an administrative basis in so far as health board personnel and the Garda are concerned.  In the light of experience in the operation of the procedure by the two main players involved in child protection, it is intended to produce a discussion document on mandatory reporting as a basis for widespread consultations with the various interested parties.</P>
    <P>In relation to the reporting of child abuse coming to the notice of general practitioners, the Medical Council has revised its guidelines on medical confidentiality as it relates to child abuse. This is in accordance with a recommendation of the Kilkenny report.</P>

      <P>I thought it would be generally considered that this was a very important matter, particularly appropriate for answer at present.  Therefore I wish to give the fullest possible reply to the House.</P>
      <P>The recommendations in the report relating to the development of appropriate diagnostic, treatment and support services and facilities in each health board area for victims of child abuse and their families are being addressed in the context of the programme of investment in new child care services under the Child Care Act, 1991.  A significant proportion of the additional funding made available for the implementation of the legislation has been used to improve and expand services in this area and to recruit additional psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, nurses and other professional staff.  Further progress will be made this year in developing these services.</P>
      <P>In the area of prevention, the Kilkenny report recommended the extension of the &ldquo;Stay Safe&rdquo; child abuse prevention programme to all classes in primary schools.  This important programme is currently being implemented in schools throughout the country with the active support of my Department, the Department of Education and the health boards.</P>
      <P>My Department is also providing financial support to the Women's Aid organisation for the development of a Protocol for hospital personnel dealing with victims of domestic violence who are admitted to accident and emergency departments.  Such a Protocol was also recommended by the Kilkenny report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report also contains proposals concerning the role of agencies outside the health services in relation to child abuse.  Developments in response to these include the establishment by the <Col N="1256" /> Garda Síochána of a woman and child Unit to specialise and ensure an expertise in dealing with cases of child abuse. In addition, the recommendations relating to barring orders are being considered by my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, in the context of a review of current legislation in this area.  The implementation of the other recommendations in the report that relate to the health services will be pursued in the context of developing comprehensive and integrated structures and services for the care and protection of children.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State is lucky that he is dealing with Deputies O'Donnell, Moffatt and myself rather than Deputy Gay Mitchell in giving a response of that length to one parliamentary question.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that, with regard to the new notification procedures, never again will circumstances arise in which health board officials investigating a case of child sexual abuse will wait up to nine months before notifying the Garda of such investigation? How many of the 62 outstanding provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991 have been implemented since 15 December 1994?  Furthermore, does the Minister consider that the group established by the North Western Health Board this week to handle an inquiry into the horrific case of child sexual abuse will be, or can be, independent?  For example, will all of the parties involved in the case be interviewed separately, including health board staff and general practitioners who may have been involved? When does the Minister expect a report from this group?</P>
      <P>Would the Minister of State not consider it more appropriate, efficient and effective that an independent inspectorate be established by his Department to examine each of these cases of complaint in relation to child sexual abuse, its reportage, notification and handling so that the inspectorate could build up an expertise not necessarily available to all health boards?</P>

      <P>There were at least five questions included in the Deputy's supplementaries which I will do my best to answer.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn asked whether I can give the House an assurance that never again will certain things happen.  The reply is no.  I do not think any Minister should give assurances of that kind.  Nonetheless I am satisfied that the guidelines drawn up over a period, issued jointly by me and the Garda, will be effective.  I have also stressed that if, over a period of time, they do not prove to be effective, we will have no difficulty in re-examining them.  I must take this opportunity of paying tribute to the Garda for the manner in which they have co-operated in this extremely sensitive matter, one we all hope will continue to be handled sensitively.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked how many of the recommendations of the Kilkenny incest report are outstanding.  I have heard a number of figures bandied about in relation to how many of them have been implemented.  There has been what I would consider creative accounting in calculating the number of implemented to date.  There are in the region of 22 substantive recommendations in that report, but there are also subsidiary ones.  The guidelines issued jointly by the Department of Health and the Garda covered ten of the subsidiary recommendations contained in that report.  I hope that answers that part of the question.</P>

      <P>The great majority of them have either been implemented, or are in the course of implementation, but there are a couple that must await other developments before being implemented. It depends largely on the implementation of the Child Care Act and I have spelled out the position in that regard.  The inquiry into the terrible and well publicised case in the west has been set up and I have nothing further to state in that regard.  It was made clear that the inquiry will be completed within weeks.  The independent inspectorate, in relation to which a question was put to Deputy Noonan and referred to me, is one of a number of suggestions being considered in the Department and it has much to recommend it.  As far as the Government is concerned the implementation, as quickly as possible, of the Child Care Act is the main goal.</P>

      <P>The Minister went into great detail on the additional resources required.  Will he agree that not all recommendations cost money? No amount of resources can compensate for failure of accountable management systems.  Will the Minister agree, in view of the last three disasters in our health boards &mdash; the Kilkenny incest case in the South-Eastern Health Board area, the Kelly Fitzgerald case in the Western Health Board area and the present case in the west which comes under the North-Western Board &mdash; that it is time to introduce answerability for health boards?  These cases clearly indicate culpability and failure of management and inter-agency co-operation, which is unacceptable.  Will the Minister also agree, if we are to delegate responsibility to health boards for child protection services there must be accountability &mdash; for example, has any member of a health board, a social worker or other person dealing with these matters, who has failed in their duty ever been fired?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the necessity for accountability.  I have been very well aware from an early stage that full <Col N="1259" /> implementation of the Child Care Act depends to a large extent on the way health boards operate its provisions.  I have spoken to some health boards about this matter and I intend to speak to the remaining health boards in the near future.  I hope I do not have to point out their great responsibility under the Act but I will emphasise it anyway.  I do not wish to add further to certain matters which are currently under investigation.</P>

      <P>On the independent inspectorate, as Deputy Currie is also Minister of State at the Department of Justice I urge him to follow the example of the Garda.  When all these cases came to light the Garda discovered it could not operate on a Garda division basis in the inspection and investigation of these cases and it very quickly set up a domestic violence unit in Harcourt Square to build up the expertise necessary and feed it to each division.  Does the Minister agree that to overcome the problems experienced day in and day out in each health board area with child sexual abuse and domestic violence the immediate establishment of a national inspectorate is necessary? That would ensure the expertise required is available and that whatever investigation takes place is carried out independently by experts?</P>

I also pay tribute to the Garda on the matter raised by the Deputy as a result of her experience in the Department of Justice.  I have an advantage in that I am Minister of State at the Departments of Justice, Education and Health and I can take a wider view because I exercise a co-ordinating role.  While I have considered with great interest the suggestion made by the Deputy on the inspectorate I am also considering other ways in which this necessary job may be achieved.  The Deputy can rest assured that sufficient <Col N="1260" /> weight is being given and will continue to be given to her suggestions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Deputy will be aware that since 1987 an extensive national programme of hospital rationalisation has taken place. The number of acute consultant staffed beds was reduced from over 15,000 in 1986 to 12,000 by early 1990.  In February 1990 the then Minister undertook to maintain acute bed availability at approximately 12,000 beds, and this remains the policy.  The current number of acute hospital beds stands at 12,431.</P>
      <P>Because of increased productivity and efficiency gains within the hospital service, the current level of bed stock enabled hospitals to treat approximately 522,000 in-patients and 187,000 day patients in 1993.  This compares favourably with a total of 512,000 in-patients and 88,500 day patients treated in 1987 prior to the rationalisation.  This represents an increase of 18 per cent in total numbers of patients treated.</P>
      <P>In recent years there has been a marked shift towards day case surgery and treatment of patients at out-patient level.  This trend is very much in line with general developments in medical practice and is supported by my Department. The Deputy may wish to know that in 1993 there was a total of 1.8 million attendances at out-patient level.</P>
      <P>In looking at acute hospital service delivery it is inappropriate to focus solely on in-patient beds as a measure of hospital resources.  The emphasis is on overall activity levels and throughput, whether this is achieved by in-patient care, day care or out-patient attendances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that, in view of the great need for <Col N="1261" /> additional beds in areas where the number of people in the 65 plus age group is above the national average, provision will be made for such beds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Deputy is entering another area relating to care of the aged.  A strong case can be made for increasing the number of sub-acute beds in certain parts of the country and for the involvement of district nurses, as Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn suggested.  I am considering a series of initiatives, including the provision of step-down facilities, to support the acute beds already available.  That would ensure that acute beds are used to their maximum effect and that adequate step-down facilities are available for an increasingly ageing population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point, but according to reports from medical people it is not only step-down facilities that are needed, the elderly population by its nature demands more acute beds.  In Northern Ireland and Britain the needs of the elderly population are taken into account in determining the medical beds to be provided in acute hospitals.  In areas such as Cavan and Monaghan where 15 per cent of the population is over the age of 65 there is a greater need for beds than in areas with a lower percentage over the 65 year age group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Practically every part of the country makes a case for extra facilities, including extra beds, and consultants in practically all specialities will say they require extra beds.  That is an indication of the demand.  On the supply side, internationally there is increasing movement towards ambulatory and outpatient facilities, and treatments one would not dream of undergoing previously without spending a week in hospital are carried out now on a visit to out-patient facilities or ambulatory care.  I do not consider it necessary to increase the number of acute beds nationally, but I <Col N="1262" /> accept the point that with better use of acute beds and step-down facilities we might meet the prospective needs of an ageing population.  The Deputy has identified a factor which will become increasingly relevant.  As the years go by the proportion of people in higher age groups will increase from the present 15 per cent the Deputy talked about in Cavan to almost 30 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally thought that the criterion used by the Department is that a medical bed is provided per 8 per cent per 1,000 of the population. Is that figure correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not have that figure in my brief.  In 1987 it was decided to reduce the number of hospital beds from approximately 15,000 to 12,000 and we consider that the present number, approximately 12,300, is about adequate for our needs, but there is a problem regarding back-up facilities which I stated on a number of occasions, particularly with step-down accommodation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate if a national survey has been carried out to ascertain how far one day and five day care surgery facilities could be developed to improve matters in hospitals?  Will he agree that the increase in numbers attending out-patient clinics is a serious problem and there is a need for greater co-operation to ensure that GP practices have more funding to develop their practices so that fewer patients will need to attend hospital clinics and more will be seen to in doctors' surgeries as was the position 20 or 30 years ago?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The provisions in the health strategy, if implemented effectively, will involve a move back towards community care.  As I said earlier, that would incorporate greater involvement of district nurses and family doctors.  I agree that the line Deputy Leonard suggests is the direction we should follow.  Regarding his <Col N="1263" /> question as to whether studies have been carried out to ascertain the scope of day care facilities as against patients staying in hospital for a period of days, some figures are available, but we are significantly behind as regards present international trends.  It appears that there is significant scope in Ireland to develop that further.</P>

    <Title>White Paper on Education: Statements (Resumed).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier I referred to the valuable data collected by the education convention which resulted in the publication of a comprehensive report.  Professor John Coolahan and all those <Col N="1327" /> involved in the compilation of the report were deservedly warmly congratulated at that time.  They placed on record and set out for our scrutiny an analysis of all the issues of concern to a modern nation seeking to modernise its system of education.  Hot on the heels of the report we now have the long awaited White Paper.  The culmination of this debate will be the acceptance or rejection of the proposals in the White Paper.  It is vital that the decisions arrived at by us prove to be the correct ones for our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the publication of the White Paper.  Broadly speaking many of the recommendations in it will find widespread acceptance and will not be challenged by me.  Before I address the contents of the document I must say I share the reservations expressed by others regarding the cost of its publication. If it is true that the launch of the White Paper cost in excess of £250,000, then we are off to a bad start.  As the Minister gave us that figure it must be accurate, but I am sure there are many Deputies who find that unacceptable.  I can think of a half a dozen primary schools in my constituency where the accommodation needs well into the next century would be more than satisfied if that amount were made available to them.  Likewise, that money could have provided an additional dozen badly needed remedial teachers during the next year.  That would have improved the lot of hundreds of educationally disadvantaged students for at least one year.  Doubtless those schools and parent groups who are presently put to the pin of their collars would have found good use for that amount of money, but I have no doubt that those I mentioned, together with all those who consider they are underfunded, will appreciate the quality finish of the post-launch copy.  I am sure they will also treasure the full colour photograph of the Minister which precedes the foreword should they be fortunate enough to secure a copy.  Given the range of legislation contemplated by the Government, we can <Col N="1328" /> rest assured that at least Irish photographers will be in secure employment for some time to come.  As study of the document was conducted using the original launch copy I was not distracted too much by the graphic illustrations and the glossy pictures.  I had time to study the facts in black and white and despite that they made interesting reading.</P>
    <P>The identification of quality, equality, pluralism, partnership and accountability as the guiding principles of this State's approach to education is good.  It is time for us to place emphasis on each of them.  We have established quality in our education system for many years past.  However, quality control is an established practice in most fields today and education, above all else, deserves to be hallmarked.  I am sure all those involved in it wish that to be so.</P>
    <P>Regarding equality, although great efforts have been made in the past there are still many areas where much still needs to be achieved.  We have made great strides towards full equality of the sexes and our schools and colleges have played a vital role in helping to eliminate discrimination of that nature.  Yet, there are many in our society who are disadvantaged on physical, mental or socio-economic grounds.  I very much welcome any commitment by the Government which will level the playing pitch for all our children regardless of their abilities or backgrounds.  Pluralism is perhaps the buzz-word of the 1990s. In the context of education it is the most often quoted and most widely misunderstood word in use today.  The recent and regrettable public controversy between the Minister and church authorities has led many in our society to believe that pluralism means lessening the influence of our churches in the education of our young.  That is unfortunate.  While education should always be a subject for continuing analysis, it should never be the cause of unseemingly public squabbling. There is far too much at stake for any party to take issue with another on a matter of personal pride.  I am glad the role played by our churches and the vocational education committees in the <Col N="1329" /> service of education is publicly recognised in the document.  The part played by them and by any others in the fine framework on which we will build for the future must never be forgotten.</P>
    <P>Partnership is the key to success in any venture.  The Irish proverb &ldquo;ar scath a chéile mairimid&rdquo; is perhaps more relevant in education than in any other facet in life.  Pupils, parents, educators and managers all must play their part in creating a vibrant effective system.  All have rights and they must be recognised and promoted by the State.  Each also bears responsibilities and one of the outstanding features of the national education convention was that the various parties while showing themselves to be conscious of the rights of others also displayed a firm commitment to their responsibilities.  We must give all partners proper support mechanisms which will help them shoulder their burden of responsibility while at the same time safeguarding their rights.</P>
    <P>Accountability has become something of a sacred doctrine in recent years and rightly so where education is concerned. In 1995 the State will invest £2 billion of taxpayer's money in education.  That is a large sum for a country of our size and it is our duty to ensure that we get the best value possible for all concerned. While I am satisfied that is largely the case, it must be seen by everyone to be the case.  The Government's approach to the publication of the White Paper may well be an aberration in expenditure, but we must be vigilant where aberrations of that type are known to exist.  The public will demand that of us and that is their right.  Of all the governing principles enshrined in that document, accountability will be the one which will arouse the greatest level of public interest.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution recognises the rights of all parents as prime educators of their children.  Since the majority of parents choose to send their children to school, it is our duty as Members of the Oireachtas to ensure the State offers suitable education to our people.  The <Col N="1330" /> provision of education may be broken down into four main areas, primary, second level, higher and further education. Excellent structures have been in place in all those areas for many years, but there is also much room for improvement.  The process of improving structures and facilities has been ongoing for the past number of years. While Minister of State at the Department of Education, with my colleague, Deputy Brennan, I guided legislation on higher education through this House. The White Paper is yet another link in the chain of events in which we have all played a part.</P>
    <P>I do not propose going through the provisions of the White Paper page by page.  Rather, I will make some general observations about its content.  With 500,000 children currently attending primary level, that must be a target area for development.  I welcome the commitment in the White Paper to extend the availability of pre-school services and note with interest the attention that will be paid to the Child Care Act, 1991 which lays down regulations governing all services offered in this area.  I welcome the expanded role of the State in the early start programme.  I also welcome the intention to integrate into the system the children of our travelling community and the promise to improve conditions for those with special needs who have not been treated equally up to now.</P>
    <P>While the rights of all our children must be recognised as soon as possible, will the Minister ensure the necessary supports are put in place in our primary schools?  It is pointless paying lip-service to the notion of improving the lot of those who truly deserve our care if, in reality, the practical difficulties are mainly ignored.  While each education board fulfils its statutory responsibilities by writing a statement of special education needs, those boards must have the resources to meet those needs.</P>
    <P>A generation of people has passed through primary school since the introduction of the present curriculum.  The National Council for Curriculum and <Col N="1331" /> Assessment has done valuable work recently and I am glad we have faced up to the fact that times are changing fast and that curriculum needs are changing just as fast.  In the White Paper it is proposed to make major changes in a number of areas, notably arts, science, languages and the promotion of health and well-being.  Will the Minister indicate the proposed timescale for the introduction of the various changes set out in the paper?  We must act sooner rather than later in this regard if we are serious about improving the present curriculum. However, I would sound a note of caution in this regard.  Major changes in the curriculum may necessitate huge increases in resources.  This was certainly the case on the last occasion changes of this order were made when the State did not meet its obligations in a proper manner and countless members of management boards and parents councils can testify to that.</P>
    <P>I have been approached by many parents who want to become more involved with their children's schooling, but find that much of their time is taken up with supplementing, from local resources, the capitation grants from the Department of Education.  This is not acceptable, nor will it be in the future.</P>
    <P>Assessment of pupils and aggregated assessment outcomes for schools are necessary, but we must be careful in this regard.  The opportunity to develop and the acquisition of learning skills may be influenced greatly by the socio-economic factors prevailing in certain areas. The yardstick applied in one region may not suit another.  Before commenting more fully on this important aspect of education, I would need to examine the nationally agreed guidelines.  Of course it will be necessary to ensure that teachers who form a central part of the curriculum and assessment are properly equipped to implement the provisions of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>I welcome the firm commitment to pre-school and inservice development. The estimated cost of £40 million over five years does not seem realistic given <Col N="1332" /> that there are more than 40,000 teachers in first and second level schools alone. If money were not expended on higher or further education this would break down to approximately £200 per capita per year.  If this work is to be done effectively, we must re-examine the costs involved.  The establishment of an in-career development unit in the Department of Education and the provision of development programmes for parents and boards of management are positive steps.  I hope the budget allocated to the unit will be sufficient to meet its needs.</P>
    <P>A very important facet of education at all levels is the physical condition of the school.  We are setting out ambitious targets in the White Paper but many of our schools are sorely in need of improvement.  From my time as Minister of State in the Department of Education I am aware that enrolment projections for the closing years of the century show a decrease of some 65,000.  I am also aware that this is taken into account as a factor when assessing the needs of current schools.  Must we wait six years and in the meantime do little for the present accommodation needs of schools? Those questions must be answered to the satisfaction of all.  Without making proper provision for a sound primary school system we will merely build a house on sand that will not withstand the rigours of time.</P>
    <P>Our second level sector is complex and comprises secondary, vocational, community and comprehensive schools. Those schools are managed and funded in different ways and have differing needs.  As this sector provides us with the first nationally standardised assessments of our pupils in the form of junior and leaving certification examinations, it is a vital element of the entire education process.  It is regrettable that the White Paper recommends, as a major objective, the increase to 90 per cent of 16 to 18 year-olds completing the senior cycle.  The admission that large numbers cannot or do not complete the senior cycle can be made only with deep <Col N="1333" /> regret.  I accept that Youthreach programmes do much to redress the imbalance in the system, but the most welcome proposal in this area is that the school leaving age will be raised.  At the very least the fact that school leavers have completed the three years of junior cycle education will impact favourably on their futures.</P>
    <P>Our second level sector faces many of the problems I outlined in my review of primary education.  Those problems are added to by the range of external influences which impact on those involved in this sector.  Because of their age pupils at this level must come to grips with negative forces which do not figure on as large a scale on the lives of younger children.  Much more is expected from teenagers in the education process. They must contend with the trauma of changeover, additions to their academic portfolios, increased workloads and the pressure to perform well in the points race.  Lifetime choices must be made during those years as they will determine, or greatly influence, the audit lives of the students in question.</P>
    <P>A number of questions must be asked regarding the junior and senior cycles.  I note with interest the provision made for the introduction of leaving certificate applied and leaving certificate vocational.  I hope the Government is prepared to provide proper resources to make these initiatives viable.  Changes are already envisaged in the junior cycle which is not long in operation.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is again proving its worth here.  If we must face the fact that the junior cycle does not address the needs of a small, but important minority, it is reasonable to suppose that we must give serious thought to any proposed initiatives. We can afford few mistakes at this juncture.</P>
    <P>We recently introduced a transition year into the second level system.  The varied reactions to the initial transition year should be noted.  Many of those involved have benefited greatly from this year.  I recently visited a school in my constituency where great results <Col N="1334" /> were shown by those in the transition year, but those results were possible only by increased financial support from parents, past pupils and the business community in the area.  While the State may have shown initiative with this development, it was remarkably shy in matching enthusiasm with hard cash.</P>
    <P>The White Paper also places great emphasis on the statutory responsibilities of education boards.  Once again they are the authors of statements and the owners of buildings.  I presume the bold type used in the launch copy to emphasise their powers highlights the democratic nature of education for the future.  If I were more cynical I would advise potential members of such boards to look less at the fact that they appear to be empowered and more at where resources can be found to exercise that power.  As numbers in primary schools decrease there will be a slight increase to the year 2001 in the numbers attending second level schools and a major increase in accommodation needs at third level.</P>
    <P>We have already been told that traditional parochial boundaries will be phased out at first level where accommodation needs are in question.  Does this mean the traditional catchment areas will go down the same road in the near future?  Will there be open competition between boards similar to the supermarket bread wars?  Fianna Fáil opposes the replacement of vocational education committees by regional education boards on the grounds that the new structures will be unwieldly and will cover areas much too large to administer effectively.  At a time when we are asking more of our schools and of our teachers, we must not fall into the trap of asking too much of those who form the intermediate tier in our system.</P>
    <P>Positive steps are being taken in regard to second level education.  I have already mentioned the junior and senior cycle changes.  I would mention also the commitments made to those with special needs, the travelling community, <Col N="1335" /> the development of the national foundation certificate programme and the liaison between the Departments of education. Health and Justice.  Indeed, while in office I identified the latter as of crucial importance and I would go so far as to include the Department of Social Welfare in this group.</P>
    <P>I do not want to appear to be the singer with only one song in his repertoire but I must again raise the thorny question of funding.  Pious aspirations are fine and stated policy objectives are important, but our pupils, their parents and teachers &mdash; and we in this House &mdash; deserve more than precious packaging. We deserve to see the means of making the package a reality.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to explain more fully the cost of each of the steps in this White Paper and to explain precisely where the funds to meet these costs will be found.  Everybody in this House, in common with those outside it, wishes to make things better for all those in education. We must be in possession of all the facts before we can be expected to reach any decisions on issues as important as those we debate here today.</P>
    <P>For those who are fortunate enough to have the chance to complete their second level education, there may be an option to continue in the process or to return to it at some future date.  Further and higher education is being availed of by greater numbers of students year after year.  We have made great strides in those fields over the past 20 years. There are opportunities now to make even further progress in vital areas. These are the final years in the educational life of any person.  It would not do any harm, when considering future developments, to remember that we are dealing with adults, not children.  I am not suggesting there is no involvement at this stage by parents and guardians, but those availing of further and higher education are well able to speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>They are in a much better position to articulate their needs than those in the <Col N="1336" /> primary and second level sectors.  They have a better understanding of the nature of their needs and must be treated in a manner which benefits the qualifications and achievements already gained by them.  I need hardly remind the Minister that they possess the most powerful weapon which can be used in any national debate &mdash; they can vote. They can see through the public relations machine.  They are intelligent, rational human beings and can strike back in a manner not open to their younger brothers and sisters.  They are our immediate future and they need consideration on this basis alone.</P>
    <P>There have been some excellent developments in further education over the past few years.  My party was involved in many of these and I am justifably proud of this fact.  Post-leaving certificate courses, the vocational training opportunities scheme and the adult literacy community education scheme have opened a world of opportunity for thousands of our citizens.</P>
    <P>Excellent results are being achieved in the area of FÁS administered apprenticeships which by September of this year, will cover all 24 designated trades. The partnership in this area between Government, business interests and the trade unions demonstrates well the totality of involvement by all sections of society in the process of education.</P>
    <P>The OECD, our own NESC, and the European Union have all produced reports and studies over the past two years which emphasise the vital role of this sector of education in the enhancement of economic performance.  We would be unwise to ignore their findings. For this reason I welcome the establishment of a further education authority, as proposed in the White Paper, and the approval for the establishment of Teastas as a national certification authority.  However, I hope we will not see a mushrooming of new boards for the sake of creating new appointment opportunities.  Replacing authorities which have provided sterling service to the community, such as the NCEA, without making significant gains <Col N="1337" /> would be foolishness of the highest degree possible.  Further clarification of the issues involved would be necessary before we could make rational decisions on these proposals.  The White Paper on training, due to be published by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, should be made available before we are asked to sanction any changes in this key area.</P>
    <P>Higher education will face the greatest challenge of all four sectors over the next ten years.  The rise in numbers of those seeking places in higher education institutes will be astronomical.  Accordingly, I would have expected major initiatives from the Government in regard to higher education.  The reality is that, taking the enormous spectrum covered by regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology as a sub-sector in themselves, we have nothing more than commitments to maintain the <i>status quo</i> and expand the remit of the Higher Education Authority, coupled with vague suggestions based on future reports and the possibility of guidelines being published from time to time.</P>
    <P>There are many quotations from the report on the national education convention. While this recent report is relevant to the questions of the day, it has already been published.</P>
    <P>For the Minister to proudly present us with a report of its contents is not the proper way to treat such an important element of higher education.  Warning bells should sound for all of us when we read that the Higher Education Authority will assess and approve applications for programme development in the context of the annual budgetary allocation exercise.  Those warning bells should be very loud when we hear that the Higher Education Authority will be responsible for providing appropriate support.  The colleges are being asked to live before they get grass, provided of course there is grass.  Considering the rate of public expenditure by the Government at present, one wonders what the future holds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1338" /> The encouragement of the Irish language is to be praised.  I have had a number of representations from interest groups which wish to see third level institutes established to cater for the growing number of students coming from gaelscoileanna.  Will the Minister indicate whether she favours such a proposal? I am anxious to have an answer to that question.  Commitments to developing links between third level institutions and designated second level schools are important, although I would like to know the criteria that will be attached to designation of schools.</P>
    <P>I note the Higher Education Authority will advise on means of raising participation by students from lower socio-economic groups in third level education. I sincerely hope the advice, when given, is acted upon and that this is not yet another cog in the great PR machine.  Surely the area of maintenance grants will need to be targeted if this long-overdue improvement is to become a reality.  To centralise the application and payment process is not sufficient to achieve this aim.  The further resources mentioned in the White Paper would need to be seen by us, and by the people who depend on them becoming available, before time runs out for them.</P>
    <P>New legislation on governing bodies is promised for this year.  An amendment of the National University of Ireland legislation is also promised for 1995.  The introduction of more comprehensive legislation for the university sector as a whole is contemplated.  We will have a very busy year in this House by all accounts.  I sincerely hope this raft of legislative measures is approached by Government in a more serious manner than it has shown with this White Paper. We will need to see specifies, not platitudes, at that time.</P>
    <P>I am happy that each third level institution will develop and publish an explicit policy on research.  The role of research is of great importance to us as a nation and can only enhance our position in the field of international competitiveness.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1339" /> I also welcome the move towards new control regulations for private colleges. The growth rate in this area has been great in recent years and it is time to ensure that the public has some yardstick to go by when it comes to choosing from the services advertised.  The public has some redress when dealing with most commercial enterprises and it is fitting that it would see some Government intervention in this area also.  I know the good private colleges, and they certainly exist, will welcome this proposal in the White Paper.  The new regulations will enhance, rather than diminish, the standing of the private colleges in the public mind.</P>
    <P>We are told in the White Paper that teachers are of central importance in the education system, which we have known for years.  Without teachers there would not be any system.  We are also reminded of the enormous contribution by teachers to society.  We are further informed that the profession's standing has been recognised internationally. Such is the Government's high regard for teachers that it brought thousands of them on to the streets of Dublin last Tuesday to publicly accept the thanks of a grateful nation.</P>
    <P>We may lay down conditions for preservice training, provide in-career development programmes, establish a teaching council and a welfare service for our teachers, and we may find a welcome for all these measures from both the profession and the public, but they will be of little value to us if our teachers are on the streets instead of in their schools.  The hundreds of pages of proposals and provisions in this White Paper will amount to nothing if our children are not in classrooms gaining education under the guidance of those whose professional standing has been recognised by the international community. How can any Government have the nerve to present us with a document such as this White Paper when it cannot come to some accommodation with those who are central to its implementation? I call on the Minister to take <Col N="1340" /> immediate positive steps to restore harmony to the system and allow our children avail of one of their most basic rights &mdash; the right to be educated.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier of the importance of parents in the partnership that must exist for education to flourish.  There are several references in the White Paper to statutory rights and entitlements which will be given to parents and to the statutory duty to be placed on boards of management regarding parents' associations. It is time to give full and formal recognition to the role of our parents in the system.  The positive contribution by parents at present cannot be properly quantified.  There is so much more they can give, and are willing to give, to the system that it would be sheer folly not to take full advantage of all that is on offer.</P>
    <P>The home-school link, which Fianna Fáil identified as a major area for development, can only lead to better understanding.  This in turn can have a positive effect on the educational lives of many thousands of children.  I hope, however, in granting statutory entitlements to parents the Government does not intend to extract from them even more by way of financial commitment to the schools.  For this reason, no less than the reasons I have given already I would like an assurance to be given to parents that the financial resources necessary for the task they will be asked to undertake will be available when required.</P>
    <P>In general, I accept that the section of the White Paper dealing with organisational framework contains much that is rational and good.  I have, however, major reservations about the proposal for education boards and I believe the proposal to have ten education boards is not well founded.  It may be suitable in a tightly formed geographical unit such as Dublin city and borough to have a single education board.  It may be more difficult to provide for the education needs of an area as large as the north east or the midlands.  It will certainly prove more difficult in the case of my region, which covers five counties. <Col N="1341" /> Even if we allow for the establishment of the specialist boards we are still faced with the prospect of board members trying to come to terms with the needs of communities 50 to 60 miles away from them while at the same time trying to solve totally different demands in their own community.  In view of the burden placed on each board I believe the proposed regions need to be again examined with the objective of finding a more reasonable geographical limit for an amended number of regions.</P>
    <P>The proposals for the additional responsibilities of boards of management, the expanded role of school principals, the importance of central and regional inspectorates and the pivotal role of the Department are topics which demand more time than is available. This is not to dismiss issues of great importance in this debate and I reserve the right to return to them on another occasion.</P>
    <P>Two areas with which I have been closely identified over the period of two successive administrations are youth and sport and it is only natural that I should have more than a passing interest in each of them.  We are constantly told the greatest resource this country has is its youth.  The four and a half pages reserved for youth work in the White Paper will do little to convince the youth that they are regarded highly by this Minister.  I worked very closely with the youth sections of the Department of Education.  The account given of youth work in the White Paper does not begin to explain the range of valuable services which have been put in place for youth.  Neither does it make any serious attempt to evaluate the huge contribution made to youth work by large numbers of deeply committed voluntary workers.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest problems facing Government has always been the fragmented nature of many of the youth services, giving rise to the need to channel funding for individual services through other bodies.  Much work has already been done during my term as Minister <Col N="1342" /> of State to improve this.  The announcement of a national youth advisory committee is not surprising and is welcome. However, the chorus which runs through the entire White Paper, such as &ldquo;the education board will be given statutory responsibility for...&rdquo; again comes into play and instead of unity we will have yet further fragmentation.</P>
    <P>Sport plays such a major part in the lives of our people that I would have expected greater emphasis on it in the White Paper.  Chapter 6 contains little or nothing that I had not put into practice in the past and anybody who has had an opportunity to study the speeches I made during the past three years will realise that 90 per cent of the document is simply a review of what I had to say.  I am glad to see that most of the good practices which were honed and refined by the previous administration are very much to the fore.  I welcome the appointment of sports development officers and I feel that the co-ordination of the efforts of those who are already working within the community is a very worthwhile objective. As a former member of the Council of Europe I did all in my power while Minister of State with responsibility for sport to further aims and aspirations of the Sport For All Charter.  I consider it to be of primary importance in the context of sport in Ireland as it sought to extend the benefits of sport to as many people as possible across all sections of society.  I am proud of my personal involvement as Minister of State with responsibility for sport in many initiatives taken throughout the country by various bodies to further the concept of sport for all.</P>
    <P>The recognition of the role played by our schools, between teachers and pupils in the development of sport during the years is another feature of the report which I welcome but, of course, I have always recognised this and have long paid tribute to it.  I am happy to see that the grants paid to national governing bodies of individual sports will continue to be paid because this is very important both for the development of <Col N="1343" /> the sport and the emergence of sports persons of excellence which has been the trend here in recent years.  It is particularly important to continue to identify the need for the provision of facilities for particular sports and to locate them in the areas where they would have maximum effect.  The needs of areas of major disadvantage will be looked at and this also was one of my objectives during my term in office.  I am happy to see this being continued as I believe it is the correct stance to adopt.</P>
    <P>I cannot let this opportunity to pass without recording my disappointment at the manner in which the small grants scheme for recreational facilities has been treated.  Under this scheme many clubs and community based organisations were able to undertake projects which they otherwise could not afford. Let me assure everybody that value for money was the standard.  The investment in facilities at local level by the State was matched many times over by the investment made by the local groups themselves.  The facilities built will be of benefit to their communities for many years to come.  The failure on the part of the Government this year to make an allocation is scandalous.  It reneges on the commitment made by me and others to give our people, particularly our young people, healthy alternative lifestyles.</P>
    <P>From my preliminary examination of this White Paper I can see many areas of agreement and a number of areas of conflict.  How much consultation was there with all the partners in education before the document was finalised?  It is a pity, having had the benefit of a number of years of preparation and a national convention to which all the partners in education were invited to make submissions, that we should arrive at a situation where the most important document in Irish education for many years appears to take little or no account of some of the concerns raised during the national convention and in the subsequent debate.  When one seeks people's opinions they must be listened <Col N="1344" /> to and account must be taken of all the views expressed.  If that is not done then we have set ourselves on a course which will lead to chaos and confusion and this most certainly cannot benefit Irish education in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I have not more time.  The fact that the debate is over subscribed is indicative of the interest in the White Paper and I know that many more of my Fianna Fáil colleagues would wish to contribute but the time factor has taken over.  The inclusion of a chapter on youth work demonstrates the role of youth work in the overall provision of education.  It also recognises the important role of voluntary organisations in the provision and development of youth services.  This section relies mainly on aspiration and many issues of fundamental importance to those involved in youth work are not addressed.</P>
      <P>The functions of the proposed local education boards include the identification of local youth needs, the development of links with other areas of education and the allocation of resources provided by the Department.  However, there are no details as to whom the resources will be allocated and how they will be allocated.  Does the Minister envisage a role for voluntary youth organisations and, if so, when will she enlighten the House?  Shall we be left depending on some Government press release at a later date?  Is it the Minister's policy that the local education boards can allocate resources directly or to the vocational education committees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister also inform the House on the decision-making role of voluntary youth organisations?  Regarding the composition of the local education boards, I note the Minister has not included youth representatives by right.  While almost everyone concerned with education, parents, teachers, trustees, governors, local representatives are all to be represented on the local education board there is no provision for youth representatives.  I find this <Col N="1345" /> amazing when more than 43 per cent of the population is under 25 years.  Will the Minister make the necessary provision for young people to be adequately represented on these boards?  Will the Minister give a commitment to appoint as one of her ministerial nominees a youth representative to each local education board?  Is the Minister serious about involving young people in decision-making, especially when it directly affects the services they receive?  Is she prepared to give this commitment?</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact the White Paper provides for a youth development officer to be employed by the local education board to carry out the youth work function of the board.  However, as with most other things contained in the White Paper it is not clear what this position will be.  Is it envisaged that some form of a specialist committee on youth under the auspices of the local education board will be established and, if so, which body will the youth development officer work to?  The question also has to be asked if the necessary resources will be made available or if this proposal is largely aspirational.  I regret that I have not more time.</P>

      <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate.  The White Paper has excited much debate and comment in the public arena and that says something not only for it but for the consultative process.  The comments from all sides of the House were positive. While questions were asked &mdash; Deputy Ahern concluded the debate for Fianna Fáil with a question &mdash; they were asked out of a genuine interest in education. The name of the White Paper spells out how, as Deputies and partners in education, we see the future in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the launch of the White Paper I said it was a landmark in the development of education.  This sentiment has been echoed time and again in the last few weeks since we debated the White Paper.  The debate in the Seanad has yet <Col N="1346" /> to conclude.  The White Paper builds on the best features of the education system. It recognises the need for change to meet the needs of students, parents and partners in education.  It does not pull the curtain down on what was good and what we owe those who served before us.  As public representatives we shoulder the responsibility for education. We are preparing for the next generation in a time of rapid change but we are helped in the preparation by the considered and thoughtful responses of Members of the House to the debate. The shared ownership of the White Paper will ensure an enduring charter for the development of education in the future.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to answer some of the trivial criticism of the visual impact of the White Paper.  This is not a legal brief which a junior counsel will read and prepare for a senior counsel. It is not a departmental circular couched in bureaucratic language.  It is a document which I ask people to read.  It is their document.  It is the plan for the future.  If it sits more easily in a bookshop of the 1990s than did some of the previous documentation, it is as a result of a deliberate decision I made.  I expect parents and others will buy this document. It is widely available.  I hope people will read it from the beginning to end.  If it is a document which, unusually for the Department of Education, features reminders of children in the classroom, students in comprehensive schools or adults in a learning experience and contains bar charts and pie charts, it reflects the age of technology &mdash; a chapter we were told was not dealt with.</P>
    <P>We have produced a document which is easy to read and breaks down the information in a visual pattern.  The age of technology has crept into the classroom even if it has not done so in every Deputy's life.  The document is a readable one.  Some 7,000 launch copies were printed and circulated.  All Members of the Oireachtas received a copy as did all the participants in the national education convention and <Col N="1347" /> teacher, management and parent bodies. It is on Internet.  An advertisement was placed in the newspapers over the Easter weekend inviting people to apply for copies free of charge.  A total of 80,000 copies of the summary guide was printed.  The printed version of the White Paper is on sale and I am pleased that the Irish language version will shortly be available.</P>
    <P>Deputy Martin spoke about the information technology strategy.  He said it was not dealt with in the White Paper but I would refer him back to the text. If he looks at the pictures as well as the text, he will see information technology is reflected from primary to leaving certificate levels.  Deputy Keogh spoke about the lack of specific targets.  Specific targets are set out, for example, the establishment of the boards, restructuring of the Department of Education and targets for travelling children.  Both Deputies spoke about pre-schools and said those involved in this movement were not consulted.  There is a committee on which such bodies are involved in consultations with the Department of Health.  That process will continue. Deputy Coughlan spoke about the boundaries for the boards being based on the evacuation strategy in the 1940s. Despite the fact that we wish to decentralise I do not see it as an evacuation strategy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes spoke about the education boards and he was not convinced about them.  We are responding to criticisms levelled by very eminent bodies which pointed out that the Department of Education is centralised.  Deputies know how true that is when they approach me about the most minute matters which are of great concern to their constituents and which cannot be decided on without being referred to me.  The public would benefit from a devolution of power.  Deputy Sargent asked when legislation would be introduced. I hope it will be at the end of the year when the purpose and composition of education boards will be spelled out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan asked about <Col N="1348" /> regional technical colleges and the exclusion of Letterkenny.  I have given positive attention to this.  A decision was taken by the regional technical college body and far be it for me to interfere with something that works well.</P>
    <P>I was taken aback by the references to the absence of education on drug abuse.  Chapter 13 deals with the role of schools in promoting the social, personal and health education of students. Substance abuse programmes for students, parents and staff are encouraged in the schools' planning process. These programmes will deal with issues which impinge and, at times, take over children's lives.  The participation of parents and boards of management in the formulation of plans will ensure that issues which affect their communities are dealt with in the health promotion initiatives.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies Costello and Broughan for their endorsement of the White Paper and their suggestions on how the chapter on philosophy could be developed.  They both referred to the early pre-school programme, and Deputy Costello referred to the longstanding commitment of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to the publication of a Green Paper, a White Paper and, finally, legislation.  We are now well on our way to the publication of legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera referred to the role of arts in education.  If she looks at her copy of the White Paper she will see that the role of the arts in education is more than secure.  I will refer at a later stage to the specific improvements which have been made.  On the question of how these will be funded, I have a budget of more than £2 billion.  I would point out to those who said there is no chapter on funding that this is a White Paper which sets out how best the funding can be spent in future and how we can seek more resources.  Like the previous Government, this Government is committed to increased funding for education. The Department of Education is not a big spending Department, it is an investment Department.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Séamus Brennan, who published the Green Paper when <Col N="1349" /> he was Minister, for his generous and wide-ranging contribution.  I also thank Deputies Wallace, Sargent, Ahern, Browne and Aylward for their contributions. This debate began when Deputy Aylward was a Minister of State in the Department of Education.  It is often said that Ministers for Education are on a pilgrimage but there are many people involved in this journey, which is not yet completed.  However, we have signposted the cross-roads and the map has been drawn.  Despite the criticisms, I am satisfied that there is a genuine commitment on all sides to the education system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter relates to the need to ensure that the interests of the six Border counties are fully represented at the Washington Conference. Some people may think I am raising this issue too late but I do not think so.</P>
      <P>Most people regarded the Washington Trade and Investment Conference as a unique opportunity for Border regions, North and South, to catch up on entitlements they had not received for many years.  The economies of these regions have been severely damaged by 25 years of violence.  Following the announcement of the conference I did all I could at meetings of the Monaghan County Enterprise Board, of which I am a member, and the IDA to ensure that we would have a well documented case to put at the conference. When the co-ops and farming organisations gave evidence at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation I put it to the President of the ICOS, Billy Nagle, that the co-ops in Monaghan engaged in exports, including three of the major co-ops in Border counties with acquisitions in the US, were ideally placed to develop joint ventures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 25 April I put down a question to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs asking the steps, if any, he had <Col N="1350" /> taken to ensure that Government agencies in the six counties south of the Border had a well documented submission for the Washington Trade Conference in seeking inward investment.  He replied that in preparation for the conference, Government Departments and State agencies were co-ordinating closely to ensure the best possible presentation of our case.  My county enterprise board informed me that at no time was it contacted regarding a submission. The chief executive officers of the enterprise boards were best placed to know the needs of their counties &mdash; they had all the statistics and knew the sites and personnel.  The county manager in Monaghan was willing to give his invitation to the conference to the chief executive officer of the enterprise board but he was not allowed do this.</P>
    <P>I was so concerned about this matter that I wrote to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs on 16 May stating:</P>
    <P>I wish to express my grave disappointment at the failure to issue chief executive officers in the County Enterprise Boards with an invitation to attend the White House Conference for Trade and Inward Investment in Ireland.  I believe they would have been ideally placed to make positive contributions to industrial development and investment in Ireland.  From enquiries made by me recently there does not appear to be any co-ordinated effort by Government development agencies in the Border region to avail of this opportunity to secure additional funding.</P>
    <P>Last night I watched &ldquo;Marketplace&rdquo;, half of which was devoted to the Washington Conference.  It featured four Northern Ireland firms and discussed the conference with an MEP, MP and an economist from the University of Ulster.  The only person who referred to the six counties south of the Border was Séamus Mallon who said that the conference was for the six counties north of the Border and the six counties south of the Border.  This morning I contacted <Col N="1351" /> RTE to let it know now displeased I was with this programme.  We have been short-changed in the past and we should not put up with it any longer.</P>
    <P>It has been generally accepted for many years that Cavan and Monaghan have fared badly from inward investment. They depend on local entrepreneurs in their food, furniture and engineering industries.  We had a unique opportunity but we blew it on this occasion.  I will pursue this issue until I get an answer to the case documented and as to who was contacted when the people who had most to offer were ignored and not allowed to attend the conference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Mitchell) Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Mitchell)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to comment on the representation of the Border counties at the White House Conference for Trade and Investment in Ireland, which is currently under way in Washington.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to President Clinton and the US administration for their generosity and commitment and the great efforts they have made towards the peace dividend in organising this conference and for their attitude generally. We owe them a debt of gratitude for what they have done so far.</P>
      <P>The interests of the Border counties are being fully represented at the White House Investment Conference in Washington by national, regional and local representatives.  This is best illustrated by the high-powered team that makes up the Government delegation at the conference which includes the Tánaiste and the Ministers for Finance, Tourism and Trade, Enterprise and Employment, and the Ministers of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and at the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  In addition, the majority of the representatives that form the Oireachtas delegation come from Border counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At county level, the county council <Col N="1352" /> chairperson and manager of the six Border counties have all been invited. There is also a number of representatives from county or local-based economic development groups at the conference.</P>
    <P>The primary emphasis of the conference is on trade and investment. Accordingly, the greatest representation of the Border counties is from its business community.  The US organisers have brought forward a specially designed &ldquo;Matchmaker programme&rdquo; that will match 50 Border companies with American companies.  Under this programme a Border company will be matched with several appropriate American companies to develop a particular venture or commercial relationship that will be of mutual commercial benefit.  Contact between the &ldquo;matched&rdquo; US and Border companies will be arranged by the US Commerce Department at the conference.  It is anticipated that this will be a very significant element in the strategy to direct even more US inward investment to the Border counties.</P>
    <P>All Government Ministers, State agencies and Government officials at the conference are also emphasising the need to recognise and target investment opportunities at the Border counties as these are the areas in this jurisdiction which have been most affected by the negative impact of the Border and the troubles of the last 25 years.  For example, the IDA will be represented not only by its top executives from its headquarters in Dublin but also by its regional directors in Sligo and Dundalk. In addition, the IDA has produced a very attractive promotional package for distribution at the conference which highlights the economic, social and environmental benefits for US companies locating in the Border counties.</P>
    <P>The US Commerce Department has also produced a strategic overview paper that highlights the benefits of locating in the region for potential US investors.</P>
    <P>Deputies from the Border counties will recall their meeting with the <Col N="1353" /> Tánaiste last March at which he gave them a commitment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that he would seek to ensure maximum representation from the political, economic and community development groups in the region.  The American organisers have achieved a reasonable balance in representation from the Border counties.</P>
      <P>The invitation list for the White House conference was a matter for the American organisers and could not be determined by the Government.</P>
      <P>I express our wholehearted appreciation of and gratitude for the work done and the attitude and approach adopted by the American Administration to date in bringing about this wonderful opportunity to secure a peace dividend for Ireland, North and South.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the imminent closure of the Irish Wheelchair Association's driving school.  On 30 June next the Irish Wheelchair Association will be forced, due to a lack of finance, to close its driving school which has been in operation for the past 23 years.  This comes after a lionhearted struggle by the association to maintain this essential and unique service.  In recent years it has reduced the number of instructors as well as secretarial staff employed in the school.  It has raised in excess of £100,000 per annum in an endeavour to keep the school in operation.</P>
      <P>The association considers it is no longer in a position to continue the service and has been lobbying in recent months for statutory funding from the Department of Health for its survival. To date its quest has been ignored and the school is no longer accepting new students and will cease to operate in over a month's time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is particularly disappointing <Col N="1354" /> when one considers that the amount required to secure the future of the school is £135,000 per annum, a very small amount when one considers the vital and unique nature of the service the school provides.</P>
    <P>To understand the problem we have to look at the issue in a broader context and highlight the fact that people with mobility impairment, in particular wheelchair users, find our public transport system is completely inaccessible. Wheelchair users who wish to lead normal and independent lives have no option but to learn to drive.  The closure of this school will compound an already shameful and unacceptable situation and ultimately make life even more difficult for wheelchair users.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister and his Department to find the necessary £135,000 to save the school.  Apart from the obvious need for such a service, there is also a sound financial logic behind providing the funds.  This service reduces the dependency of wheelchair users on society and provides them with an opportunity to lead independent lives.  Instead of forcing dependency on the association's members the Government would be assisting in providing opportunities for wheelchair users to make a financial as well as a practical contribution to society.  It is also worth considering that the school employs four instructors and if it closes these four jobs will be lost.</P>
    <P>It is worth pointing out that the closure of this school would be another blow to voluntary organisations in our community.  It raised £100,000 per annum in the past number of years but its fund raising activities like other voluntary organisations have been hit by the national lottery.  It will also feel the impact of the Government's failure to give tax relief on donations to it while providing for such relief in the Finance Bill for Third World charities.</P>
    <P>The Irish Wheelchair Association has worked tirelessly to develop and maintain this vital service.  It has engaged in fund raising and has endeavoured to keep the school in operation because it <Col N="1355" /> is such an essential service.  It has filled the gap left by the State for many years but is now at the point where it simply cannot continue.  It is important that such a service is not taken for granted. I plead with the Minister to give this matter the urgent attention it deserves and to provide the funding for the school's continuation.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I thank Deputy Wallace for the opportunity to speak on this subject. I am fully aware of the difficulties the Irish Wheelchair Association is experiencing in funding its driving assessment-instruction course.  As the Deputy knows, current statutory funding for this service is provided through capitation payments by health boards towards trainees who pass the regular driving test.</P>
      <P>I met representatives of the IWA in January this year to discuss all aspects of its services including the financial difficulties of the driving instruction course. Following this meeting, I made arrangements with the National Rehabilitation Hospital, Dún Laoghaire to recoup the IWA for the cost, £7,000, of providing driving assessment and instruction to clients at the hospital.  Contact was also made with the Department of the Environment but, despite its appreciation of the work of the association, the Department said it did not have funds at its disposal to provide assistance to the driving school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I then asked my officials to carry out a comprehensive examination of funding options for the driving school.  This involved contacting all health boards for <Col N="1356" /> their views and a request to the IWA for detailed information on the operation and cost of the driving instruction course.  The IWA submission was received in my Department on 11 May 1995.  My officials have examined this submission and the information received from the health boards and have recently completed a report to me on funding options for the driving school.</P>
    <P>I intend to examine the funding options carefully and I will communicate with the IWA in the near future concerning my decision.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to note that the Disabled Drivers' Association of Ireland based in Ballindine, County Mayo, also provides a driving instruction course for people with disabilities; 23 disabled drivers have availed of this course in 1994 at a cost of approximately £11,000 to the health boards.  So far in 1995, nine disabled drivers have been trained at the Ballindine centre.</P>
    <P>This matter has been addressed by me and the Department with concern and considerable commitment.  We are endeavouring to find a satisfactory solution and have worked closely with the association in doing this.  As a meeting has been arranged with the chief executive officer of the association next week, it would have been reasonable to await its outcome before raising the issue for consideration at this level.  I am disappointed that the association does not seem to have appreciated the evident goodwill and commitment on my part and that of my Department in seeking to help it in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.05 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 30 May 1995.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Government Strategy to Prevent Drug Misuse, which was published in 1991 advocated that treatment for drug misusers should be provided in their own community in so far as is possible.  It was envisaged that general practitioners would be involved in providing this community based treatment, including the prescribing of methadone while pharmacists would be involved in dispensing.</P>
      <P>In order to lay the groundwork for the greater involvement of general practitioners in the treatment of drug misusers, it was necessary to devise guidelines for the prescribing of methadone by such practioners.  An expert group, representing my Department, the Eastern Health Board, the Drug Treatment Centre, the Irish College of General Practitioners and the voluntary drug treatment sector was established, therefore, with the aim of setting out Protocols for the treatment of drug misusers. The report of the Expert Group on the Establishment of a Protocol for the Prescribing of Methadone was made available in March 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1264" /> The expert group made a number of recommendations relating to co-ordination and liaison between the statutory and other agencies to ensure that the prescribing of methodone was carried out in a controlled and secure manner.</P>
    <P>One of the key recommendations in the report was that a central treatment list of all patients on methadone maintenance should be established.  Following receipt of the expert group's report officials of my Department commenced discussions with representatives of the appropriate agencies to establish a list, in the first instance, of those on methadone maintenance with the Eastern Health Board's satellite clinics and the Drug Treatment Centre.  This list, together with agreed Protocols for adding to or taking from the list, was completed in the summer of 1994, with in excess of 600 patients on the list.</P>
    <P>The next step was to add to the list the names of patients on methadone maintenance with general practitioners and the expert group's report was circulated to each general practitioner in the Eastern Health Board area in September 1994, accompanied by a letter from the chief medical officer of my Department.  The letter referred to the establishment of the central treatment list and requested that any general practitioner prescribing methadone for a drug misuser should check that such patient was not already in receipt of methadone by consulting the authorities operating the list and, this being so, should supply details of the patient, in the strictest confidence, for addition to the list.  The letter emphasised that the expert group's report offered the necessary support and protection to any general practitioner involved in prescribing methadone, provided this was done in consultation with the statutory agencies.</P>
    <P>Since that letter issued a total of 14 general practitioners have come forward with details of over 400 patients on methadone maintenance.  My Department will be reminding general practitioners by letter in the near future of <Col N="1265" /> the need to comply with the recommendations contained in the expert group's report.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the concern of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union about the need for strict control over the availability of methadone and I share that concern. For this reason my Department has been proceeding in a step-by-step basis with implementing the recommendations made by the expert group.  It is intended to continue to try to involve more general practitioners in the treatment of drug misusers and as part of that process, discussions will be held with representatives of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union to allay any concerns they might have.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can be assured, that this matter is receiving my Department's close attention.  It is important that we work towards involving a number of general practitioners in prescribing methadone.  This will help reduce the waiting lists for treatment which have built up at the Drug Treatment Centre and the satellite clinics.  It will also lead to a more even spread of pharmacists dispensing methadone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): In July 1991, the then Minister for Health established a committee to review the qualifications necessary for employment as a social worker in a health board and to assess the qualifications of social workers holding foreign qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee reported in March 1994 and recommended that those recruited to entry grade positions in <Col N="1266" /> social work under health boards should have a minimum entry qualification of four to five years combined academic and practice training and education i.e. an academic and professional qualification. This recommendation was accepted.</P>
    <P>A survey carried out by the committee in 1993 showed that out of 499 social workers employed under health boards, 386 held the professional qualification, the CQSW.  In practice, the recognised qualification for both recruitment and promotion over the past fifteen years has been the professional qualification.</P>
    <P>The committee, in its recommendations, also advised on the setting up of a permanent successor to itself, an advisory body in the form of a national validation body to oversee standards in social work training and education.  This task was formerly carried out by the UK Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work (CCETSW) until their planned withdrawal in 1993.</P>
    <P>The national validation body held its inaugural meeting on 17 May 1995. Among the issues to be addressed by the group is the question of social workers currently in post who do not hold a professional qualification and in particular the requirements to facilitate such social workers in obtaining a professional qualification.  While primarily a matter for the new body, I have every confidence that due credit will be allowed for work experience and qualifications already obtained.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it is essential that all those involved in the delivery and supervision of social work be appropriately qualified and experienced.  I want to assure the Deputy that every possible support will be given to those who may require additional training and/or experience in order to comply with the minimum professional requirements.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are draw up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annualy in line with the consumer price index. However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>Persons aged 16 to 25, including students, who are dependants of a person who is not a medical card holder, are not normally entitled to a medical card except where they have an entitlement under EC Regulations or where they are in receipt of a disabled person's maintenance allowance.  The decision on whether or not a person is regarded as a dependant or as being financially independent is made by the chief executive officer of the health board on the basis of the circumstances of each individual case.  Students who are financially independent are entitled to apply for a medical card in their right and are assessed on the same income criteria as all other applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also point out that when assessing the medical card entitlement of parents, the income guidelines <Col N="1268" /> include an allowance for each dependant, and where the dependant is in fulltime third level education and is not grant-aided, this allowance is doubled.</P>
    <P>It is open to all persons, be they parents or students, to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves and their dependants without hardship.  I am satisfied that health boards give sympathetic consideration to such applications when the circumstances warrant it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): A comprehensive treatment service is available for people with conditions such as asthma incorporating hospital and general practitioner services and assistance towards the cost of prescribed medicines.</P>
      <P>The major form of treatment for asthma at present is drug therapy.  The General Medical Services Scheme provides without charge general practitioner services, drugs, medicines and appliances to persons covered by medical cards.  Approximately 36 per cent of the population are at present covered by medical cards.</P>
      <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of on-going expenditure on medical expenses &mdash; general practitioner fees, prescribed drugs etc. &mdash; due to a long term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  In some cases a medical card may be issued to a family member on a personal basis.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
      <P>In the case where a particular child or member of a family is incurring heavy expenditure due to their asthma condition, the chief executive officer may grant a medical card to cover that child or individual, rather than issuing a card to cover the whole family.</P>
      <P>Persons who suffer from an on-going medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for people who do not have a medical card and are certified as having a long term medical condition such as asthma with a regular and on-going requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of an amount per month, currently £32.</P>
      <P>Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, <Col N="1270" /> any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive treatment and support is being provided to asthma patients on a nationwide basis through the existing range of services and support schemes which I have outlined.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 19 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>In February 1995 I announced that I was making the sum of £907,000 available to the rape crisis and sexual abuse counselling centres/services throughout the country.  This represented an increase of £250,000 or 38 per cent on the total level of funding provided from both the Department of Health and the health boards to the centres in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In pursuit of the recommendations of the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, published in 1993, I particularly made available funding to those health boards in whose areas there were no rape crisis or counselling centres to assist in the establishment of new services in these areas.  I have also ensured that from now on, secure funding will be available to the centres through the health boards.  Funding is in <Col N="1271" /> the form of a block grant based on the level of service provided from each centre.</P>
    <P>In February 1995, there was a total of 14 centres.  There is now a new centre in the process of being established in Tullamore, County Offaly.</P>
    <P>There are four rape crisis and sexual abuse counselling centres in the South Eastern Health Board region in Clonmel, Kilkenny, Waterford and Wexford. In 1995, the Waterford centre received an increase in funding of 45 per cent over the level of funding provided in 1994.  I understand that the centre is in discussion with the South Eastern Health Board concerning its future service development.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): My Department has made inquiries of the South Eastern Health Board in regard to the matter raised by the Deputy as the board has the statutory responsibility for the provision of dental treatment to eligible persons in County Wexford.</P>
      <P>The board has informed my Department that the letter in question refers to the demand for orthodontic treatment and the need for guidelines to ensure that those most in need of orthodontic treatment receive treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The letter was a standard letter which has since been amended to take account of the introduction of the new scheme <Col N="1272" /> to provide dental treatment to medical card holders, the dental treatment services scheme, and the improved dental services for children in County Wexford.</P>
    <P>In 1994 significant funding was provided for children's dental services in County Wexford which now allows the board to screen and treat children in second and sixth classes in Wexford in the current school year; to address the waiting list for children's dental treatment in Wexford, which built up over the past number of years, with an expectation that it will be completed by August this year; incorporate the extension of eligibility for children under 14 years of age in the dental service in Wexford; increase the provision of preventive programmes including fluoride mouth rinse for children in non-fluoridated water areas, fissure sealant programmes and oral health education programmes.</P>
    <P>In addition funding was provided in 1994 to build and equip five additional dental surgeries, at Wexford (two), Enniscorthy (two) and New Ross.</P>
    <P>Two additional dentists were approved in 1994 to improve orthodontic services throughout the region.</P>
    <P>Adult medical card holders are receiving treatment under the dental treatment services scheme or by health board dentists if they fall into the special needs category or are medically compromised.</P>
    <P>I have recently provided funding to the South Eastern Health Board for the further development of children's dental services and orthodontic services in the region which will allow for the employment of an additional seven dental teams for the childrens dental services and an additional dentist and dental nurse to work with the consultant orthodontist in the region's orthodontic unit.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the provision of these additional resources will result in significant improvements in the provisions of dental services to eligible persons in Wexford.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1274" /> The detailed examination by my Department, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, of the implications of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Keegan <i>v.</i> Ireland has now been completed.  An appropriate legislative response to the issues raised in the judgment is currently being developed.  It is my firm intention that the necessary amending adoption legislation will be introduced at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I might mention that in the light of advice obtained from the Office of the Attorney General, the Adoption Board recently issued further guidance to the adoption agencies in relation to the involvement of fathers of non-marital children in the adoption process.  This guidance is helping to eliminate the delays that arose in the processing of a number of adoption cases since the European Court delivered its judgment.</P>
    <P>I might also mention that a number of important developments have taken place in our adoption practice since the Keegan case was disposed of by the High Court in 1990.  Procedures initiated by the Adoption Board on an administrative basis have helped to promote greater understanding and awareness among adoption agencies of the position of the natural father in the adoption process.  While these measures could not have been taken into account by the European Court, they are acknowledged in its judgment.</P>
    <P>The extent to which these procedures need to be extended is being actively considered in the context of the development of an appropriate legislative response to the judgment of the European Court.</P>

      <Quest>the bed management policies that are in place in hospitals; the way in which they differ from hospital to hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I would like to stress in the first instance that bed management policy must be a matter for individual hospital management.</P>
      <P>On a broader level, the issue was looked at in the recent past by the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group, which was chaired by Professor David Kennedy. The group made wide ranging recommendations regarding the more efficient use of all acute hospital services in the Dublin area, including bed management practices.</P>
      <P>Following the publication in September 1991 of the reports of the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group, a second group, the Dublin Hospital Advisory Group, which was also chaired by Professor Kennedy, monitored and reviewed progress in relation to the implementation of these reports &ldquo;good practice&rdquo; recommendations.  This group found that the implementation of &ldquo;good practice&rdquo; recommendations was broadly satisfactory, although it was recognised that to put these fully into effect would take some time.</P>
      <P>Specifically in relation to bed management, the advisory group found that the hospitals covered by the initiative group exercise had bed managers in place and that hospitals were agreed that the introduction of these posts had been a welcome and positive development. Accident and emergency consultants in particular, said that they had removed a considerable burden on accident and emergency departments.</P>
      <P>The Advisory Group envisaged the bed manager's role as one of facilitating the admission arrangements and policies negotiated and agreed with admitting clinicians, within the constraints of the bed stock available in each hospital. The group's view was that it is a matter for clinicians to agree with management the number of beds required for their practice, to agree Protocols which balance accident and emergency and elective admissions, and to introduce acceptable systems for the audit of bed utilisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> I should mention that in the context of the recent debate on accident and emergency services my Department has urged hospitals to look again at how they manage their workload, having regard to the level of admission through accident and emergency.  Hospitals must accept that they are going to be under pressure at particular times of the year and they must organise themselves to deal with the problem.  This is as much part of their role as providing specialist services on an elective basis.</P>
    <P>Finally, I recognise that it is necessary that there are sufficient appropriate care facilities available for those patients no longer in need of acute care. This has been a particular problem in Dublin in recent years and one that has faced different governments.  The resolution of this problem is now a priority and will be the subject of intensive and sustained attention until we have achieved a satisfactory balance between acute and continuing care provisions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the newspaper report to which the Deputy refers.  I understand that an advisory committee to the UK Department of Health is due to <Col N="1277" /> issue a report shortly on the subject of E. coli 0157 infection and that the newspaper article deals with the likely content of that report.  Although it is not possible for me to comment further on a report which has not yet been published, my information is that the number of deaths attributed to E. coli 0157 infections in the UK is considerably lower than the level suggested by the newspaper.</P>
    <P>I am very aware of the food safety aspects of E. coli 0157 infection.  The report of the Food Safety Advisory Committee on this matter was brought to the attention of the eight health boards by my Department and all health boards staff involved in food controls have been alerted to its recommendations especially on the proper cooking methods for minced meat and hamburgers. These are considered to be the major sources of the infection.  This, in my view, is the most effective way of minimising the risks associated with this micro-organism.  I do not consider that an information campaign directed at the general public would serve any useful purpose, at this stage.</P>

This is the first time that psychiatric cover will be required on a statutory basis in this country and the 40 days proposal will give a guarantee to subscribers that some level of such cover will be available to them.</P>

      <P>The board has already agreed a captial programme with my Department for the years 1994-97.

As the Deputy will be aware, proposals for further developments are being considered by the board and are likely to be submitted to the Department shortly. I welcome this initiative by the board, which seeks to address one of the most pressing service problems in the Dublin area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary focus of the health boards in the area of child abuse relates to the provision of appropriate assessment, support and therapeutic services to the unfortunate victims of such abuse.</P>
      <P>Health boards submit to my Department annual statistics relating to child abuse.  These detail the number and categories of alleged cases of such abuse reported to them and the number of cases confirmed by health board professionals following investigation.  Information on the number of victims of child abuse who receive counselling from the health services is not readily available and could not be obtained without making inquiries from a wide range of professionals including social workers, psychiatrists, psychologists, doctors, nurses and other relevant staff.</P>
      <P>In the Dublin area, units for the investigation and management of alleged cases of child abuse cases exist at Temple Street and Crumlin Children's Hospitals.  Funding has been made available to both hospitals for the development of therapeutic services for children affected by sexual abuse.</P>
      <P>Services for the management of child abuse cases in the seven health board areas outside Dublin have also been significantly developed in recent times with moneys set aside for the implementation of the Child Care Act.  These services are multi-disciplinary in nature and are designed to best meet the various and complex needs of such victims. They include the provision of counselling to all victims of child abuse who require it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1280" /> There is an increasing recognition of the complementary role of the voluntary rape crisis centres in the provision of a comprehensive service to adult survivors of child sexual abuse.  In February last, my Department made available funding of £907,000 to the rape crisis and sexual abuse counselling centres, which was an increase of £250,000 over the level of funding provided in 1994. Counselling services for adult victims of child sexual abuse are also available through the mental health services of the health boards.</P>
    <P>Arising out of emerging research and work being undertaken in the area of child sexual abuse, it would appear that a significant proportion of child sexual offenders are adolescents.  In response to this, services targeted at adolescent abusers are beginning to be developed.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, the northside inter-agency project operates a programme for adolescent offenders and is comprised of staff from Temple Street Hospital, the Mater Hospital and the Eastern Health Board.  I understand that, to-date, this programme has shown encouraging signs of success and it is hoped that it will prove to be an effective measure to prevent many adolescent abusers from reoffending in the future.  A similar service for adolescent perpetrators of child abuse is also being developed by Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin.</P>
    <P>During 1993 and 1994, additional funding amounting to £20 million in full year terms was provided to develop a range of new child care and family support services throughout the country in preparation for the implementation of the remaining provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991.  A further sum of £10 million has been set aside this year to continue the process of improving services for the care and protection of children who are being abused or who are otherwise at risk.</P>
    <P>This funding has been allocated to the health boards under their community care programmes.  Having regard to the multi-disciplinary nature of services for those affected by child sexual abuse and <Col N="1281" /> other froms of abuse and neglect, and the fact that such services are organised on an inter-programme basis, it is not possible to give a precise breakdown of the financial resources allocated for the treatment of persons affected by child sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>However, I would like to assure the Deputy that a significant proportion of the funding provided for the implementation of the Child Care Act is being used to develop treatment and other services for the victims of child abuse and their families in each health area.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The patient concerned was placed on the out-patient waiting list on 4 March 1994 and should be called for assessment within the next four years.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the scheduling of hospital appointments is a matter for the consultant concerned and urgent cases are always given priority.  Should the patient feel concerned that her condition has deteriorated she should return to her general practitioner who will be in the best position to emphasise the urgency of her case directly to the consultant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that, under the 1994 waiting list initiative, a total of £850,000 was allocated to the Western Health Board for the provision of 1,222 additional procedures including 109 orthopaedic procedures.  In addition, development funds of £400,000 were provided to the board in 1994 for the <Col N="1282" /> expansion of orthopaedic services at Merlin Park Regional Hospital.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently seeking proposals from various health agencies for measures to further reduce hospital waiting lists &mdash; both in-patient and out-patient &mdash; under the 1995 waiting list initiative.  The aim of the 1995 initiative is to further reduce the overall waiting time for patients in a number of targeted specialties, including orthopaedics.</P>
    <P>The Western Health Board has also submitted proposals to my Department for the development of orthopaedic services at Mayo General Hospital and these proposals are under examination at present.  I do not consider the current level of orthopaedic service available under the Western Health Board to be acceptable and I intend to effect further improvements in the service as quickly as possible.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The basic working week for all non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs) is 39 hours.  However, they are liable to be rostered to work up to an average of 65 hours per week.  The 65 hour week was implemented in 1989 following a Labour Court recommendation and in consultation with the Irish Medical Organisation which represents the interests of NCHDs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A joint pilot study on unrostered hours of non-consultant hospital doctors carried out by a group representative of the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board, the Irish Business Employers Confederation, the Irish <Col N="1283" /> Medical Organisation and my Department was concluded late last year.  The study was undertaken at five hospital sites to identify the factors which give rise to NCHDs working unrostered hours in excess of 65 hours per week. The aim of the study was to pave the way for a structured mechanism to be put in place at hospital level to oversee the implementation of agreed rosters and to address issues leading to the working of unrostered hours.  Discussions have been taking place since then between the parties to the joint pilot study and I understand that agreement has been reached on the detail of a mechanism to monitor and control working hours which will be introduced when other related matters which the parties are considering are agreed.</P>
    <P>Under existing arrangements for NCHDs, no distinction is made between basic hours, hours spent &ldquo;on-call&rdquo; or time spent working while on call. Consequently information is not collected on the length of shifts worked by NCHDs.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the existing conditions which govern the hours worked by NCHDs are broadly satisfactory.  I believe that the mechanism which I have mentioned already will deal satisfactorily with problems which may arise from time to time in individual hospitals.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I presume that the <Col N="1287" /> Deputy is referring to the training programme and information pack for general practitioners which has been prepared by the Irish College of General Practitioners in response to the legislation on information about pregnancy termination outside the State.  While the pack will be extremely helpful to doctors as a guide to sympathetic and effective counselling, it must be appreciated that guidelines on medical ethics are the responsibility of the Medical Council.  The council has not yet issued any guidelines arising from the recent legislation but I expect it to do so in due course.  The advice available to me is that the current code of medical ethics states that a doctor who has a conscientious objection to a given line of treatment must refer the patient to an appropriate colleague, and I would assume <Col N="1288" /> that the same principle should apply in relation to pregnancy counselling where it is in compliance with the relevant legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Under the Child Care Act, 1991, statutory responsibility for the provision of child care services, including services for homeless children, is vested in the health boards.  I have no plans to change these arrangements.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties that currently exist in relation to the provision of accomodation for certain adolescents whose behaviour is such that they cannot be cared for within the existing range of child care facilities.  The health boards have developed a variety of  responses to try to care for these children, including the establishment of special fostering schemes and other special care arrangements.  While these initiatives have had some success, it has become apparent that a number of specialised residential centres providing intensive therapy need to be provided.</P>
      <P>I am currently making arrangements for the establishment of special child care facilities by the health boards to provide care in a controlled environment for children who are out of control but have not been convicted of offences.  As a first step, it is proposed to develop special residential facilities in the Eastern Health Board area.  The board is currently assessing the requirements in terms of accommodation, staff numbers, training and skills mix and the cost implications, both revenue and capital.  There are to be further discussions between the board and the Department when this process is completed. It is planned to have the first such facility in place by the autumn of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): In the past, the rate of suicide in Ireland was genuinely low but has increased over the last 20 years. Among persons aged 34 years and under, the number of deaths attributed to suicide rose from 41 in 1974 to 154 in 1993.  The proportion of suicides among young people as a proportion of total suicides has risen from a figure of 35 per cent of total in 1974 to 41 per cent in 1993.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the need for further research on the factors which lead people to take their own lives and the most effective way of intervening to prevent premature loss of life, my Department is contributing towards the cost of a pilot project on attempted suicide in Cork, carried out by staff of the Southern Health Board under the direction of Dr. Michael Kelleher, Consultant Psychiatrist.  The aim of this project is to reduce the occurrence of para-suicide and to develop intervention skills which may be applied in this area. The project forms one of the participating centres in the WHO-EURO Multi Centre Study on Para-suicide.  I am pleased that the Mid-Western Health Board has recently become a participant in the study.</P>
      <P>I am examining ways of involving experts in the examination of the annual statistics on suicide and to make recommendations which might help to prevent some suicides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of suicide prevention, the World Health Organisation suggests the need for improvements in the underlying societal factors that put a <Col N="1292" /> strain on the individual, such as family stress, social isolation of elderly people living alone and failure at school.  It emphasises the need to develop the individual's ability to cope with events of life and provide a better network of social support.  The ability of people to cope with life is a crucial factor in preventing and managing mental illness. Health Boards are already involved in a number of ways in promoting better coping skills through parenting programmes, pre-school playgroups, life skills education in schools, alcohol and drug awareness programmes and social support for elderly people living alone. The Health strategy &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo; recognises the importance of health promotion, including the promotion of mental health.  Over the next four years the health services will continue to support and provide programmes to promote mental health and prevent suicide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I do not accept that it is necessary to make the consumption of a controlled drug a criminal offence under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984.</P>
      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that, under section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, it is an offence for a person to have a controlled drug in his possession, without an appropriate licence or other authority under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, in order for a person to consume a controlled drug it would be necessary that it be in their possession.  It is suggested that it would be very difficult to enforce a provision in respect of consumption in view of the need of the individuals concerned to be caught in the act.  I am advised that it is <Col N="1293" /> more appropriate to continue to deal with the matter via the offence of unlawful possession.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The water supply in the Ballycroy area is a private group scheme.  Environmental health officers from the Western Health Board monitor the quality of water in the scheme on behalf of Mayo County Council.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Western Health Board that in both 1976 and 1982 tests indicated contamination of the supply and appropriate recommendations were made to the trustees of the scheme to rectify the problem.  Subsequent tests between 1985 and 1989 showed the water quality to be satisfactory.  Tests in 1991 and 1992 again indicated the need for remedial action, appropriate recommendations were made and samples taken during 1993 indicated an improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A series of samples taken by the health board on 13 and 26 October 1994 indicated serious contamination in terms of the levels of micro-organisms in the supply.  A notice to boil all water before use was then issued by the health board in consultation with Mayo County Council immediately following <Col N="1295" /> receipt of the test results on 4 November. To date that notice has not been withdrawn as samples taken on 2 May 1995 indicate that the supply has not improved sufficiently to withdraw the notice.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Department of the Environment invited the group to submit proposals for grant aid towards the necessary improvements to the scheme and that these proposals are now being considered.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): As the Deputy will be aware considerable investment has taken place in the development of general practice since the November 1992 General Medical Services Agreement with general practitioners.  The development funds made available on foot of this agreement have been invested as follows; the upgrading and improvement of the fabric of practice premises and in diagnostic and treatment equipment, the recruitment of additional practice secretaries and practice nurses, the improvement of rota arrangements and out of hours cover, the upgrading of health centre accommodation used by GPs, the improvement of practice records systems by introduction of computerisation, support for continuing medical education of GPs, the provision of paramedical services such as physiotherapy, dietetics and the provision of additional services by GPs such as palliative care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1296" /> The general practice units in the health boards are also encouraging GPs in single handed and two handed practices to combine with other practices to form group practices.  A group practice allows for greater efficiencies in terms of sharing of practice premises, cover arrangements, expensive medical/ diagnostic equipment, practice nurses, paramedical and secretarial services and because of its size can provide a more comprehensive range of services for patients.  As part of this process a number of medical centres on the lines referred to by the Deputy are currently being planned.</P>
    <P>In addition the Deputy will be aware that general practitioners in the GMS scheme provide surgery services in many health board health centres around the country.  These centres also provide a focus for community services such as public health nursing, social work services and paramedical services such as speech therapy, physiotherapy and occupational therapy for a wide range of client groups.  As part of the commitment to developing primary care services I will be allocating funding this year to health boards to allow for upgrading, refurbishment and the provision of new health centre premises.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Open heart surgery operations for adults, including coronary artery by-pass grafts.  CABGs are currently performed for public patients at the national cardiac surgery unit in the Mater Hospital, Dublin and at Cork University Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> The number of patients currently on the waiting list for all open heart surgery in these two hospitals is 1,652.  The scheduling of surgery is a matter for the clinical judgment of the consultant concerned, is based solely on the patients condition and not on the length of time on the waiting list.  Emergency cases are given priority.</P>
    <P>In 1993, a sum of £1 million from the waiting list fund was allocated to enable the necessary facilities to be put in place at the national cardiac surgery unit, Mater Hospital to increase the annual throughput of open heart surgery at the hospital from 750 to 1,000 &mdash; an increase of 33 per cent.  In addition, in 1993 and 1994 funding of £2.8 million was provided to facilitate the doubling of cardiac surgery at Cork University Hospital from 200 to 400 patients each year.</P>
    <P>Over 1993 and 1994, in excess of £2 million revenue and £3.5 million in capital was allocated to the Mater Hospital for cardiac surgery and related developments. The building works which were associated with this development, were completed in mid-1994, include additional cardiac maintenance beds, intensive care facilities and high dependency facilities which are required to support the cardiac surgery programme. These new facilities at the hospital have now become operational and the additional cardiac surgery activity has commenced.  Additional resources of £200,000 are being provided in 1995 to the Mater Hospital to ensure that throughput in cardiac surgery in 1995 reaches the target of 1,000 open heart operations per year.</P>
    <P>The development at the Mater Hospital, together with the development for cardiac surgery at Cork University Hospital which were opened in November 1994 will have the effect of increasing the number of cardiac surgery operations performed on an annual basis in the public hospital sector by 47 per cent from 950 to 1,400.  The question of the provision of further additional facilities for cardiac surgery will be considered as sympathetically as possible in <Col N="1298" /> the context of the many competing demands for resources throughout the health services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): A major review of orthopaedic services in the south east region was undertaken by a joint Department of Health-Comhairle na nOspidéal Review Group during 1991-92. The main impetus for the review was the general level of dissatisfaction at the organisation of orthopaedic services in the region.  Waiting lists for elective orthopaedic surgery were growing because of the volume of trauma cases being dealt with in Lourdes Orthopaedic Hospital, Kilcreene.  It had been envisaged that Kilcreene would be solely an elective orthopaedic hospital but for a variety of reasons the situation had developed to one where approximately 60 per cent of the workload being performed there was trauma.  The review was undertaken to advise the South Eastern Health Board on the organisation of orthopaedic services for the region in the most effective and efficient manner.</P>
      <P>The main recommendations were as follows:</P>
      <P>&mdash;that in the best interest of patient care, elective orthopaedics in the SEHB region should be centralised in Waterford Regional Hospital.  As the building programme is completed at Waterford Regional Hospital and as finances permit, the hospital should be staffed appropriately to meet the regional role envisaged for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1299" />&mdash;that the best interests of patient care would also be served by all major orthopaedic trauma in the south-eastern region being transported directly to Waterford Regional Hospital where the patients would be managed by a team of orthopaedic surgeons to be based there.</P>
    <P>&mdash;that the centralisation of both elective and major orthopaedic trauma at Waterford Regional Hospital would facilitate the development of a centre of excellence of orthopaedic practice in the south-east. The review group envisaged that the centre would be staffed by six orthopaedic surgeons.  A centralised orthopaedic service would provide a 24 hour service for major orthopaedic trauma producing a higher standard of care than existed previously.  A higher standard of orthopaedic surgery, and consequently patient care, would result in a larger throughput of patients requiring regular practice of a wider spectrum of orthopaedic skills.</P>
    <P>&mdash;that regular and frequent consultant orthopaedic in-put should be made to each of the three general hospitals &mdash; St. Lukes, Kilkenny, Wexford General Hospital and Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel &mdash; by the consultant orthopaedic staff based at Waterford.</P>
    <P>&mdash;that a reorganisation of the ambulance service should take place.  This reorganisation should have, as a major objective, the minimisation of additional travel impositions on patients as well as the efficient transporting of trauma cases from the scene of accidents to the regional centre.</P>
    <P>&mdash;that the implementation of the review group's recommendations required the designation of about 60 beds for orthopaedic trauma <Col N="1300" /> from within the total bed complement of Waterford Regional Hospital.</P>
    <P>&mdash;that the transfer of elective orthopaedics from Kilcreene Hospital to Waterford would require the provision of additional facilities.  Pending, the emergence of such facilities, it envisaged that all elective orthopaedics for the region would continue at Kilcreene Hospital.</P>
    <P>&mdash;that the medical benefit to patients and the economic advantages in centralising orthopaedic services outweigh the disadvantages.  The review group was convinced that the opportunity existed to dramatically improve the orthopaedic service for the people of the south-east by centralising both the trauma and elective services in Waterford Regional Hospital.</P>
    <P>The report of the review group was discussed at the general hospital programme committee of the South Eastern Health Board and subsequently at the board meeting on 11 February 1993, where a full discussion on all the issues took place.  The South Eastern Health Board decided that the treatment of major orthopaedic trauma cases should be centralised at Waterford Regional Hospital.  In parallel with this, a decision was also taken that elective orthopaedic cases should continue to be performed at Kilcreene Hospital.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the decisions made by the South Eastern Health Board in relation to the re-organisation was completed in late 1994 with the centralisation of major orthopaedic trauma cases at Waterford Regional Hospital.  I understand from the South Eastern Health Board that the improvement in the service has resulted in patients seeking orthopaedic services within the region who would in the past have travelled outside, mainly to Dublin.</P>
    <P>The consultant orthopaedic surgeon has not been withdrawn from Wexford General Hospital and continues to see <Col N="1301" /> patients at fracture clinics and out-patient clinics.  I would like to point out however, that under the existing arrangements none of the consultant orthopaedic surgeons in the South Eastern Health Board region works exclusively in any one hospital.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am aware of the considerable research and development work which is being undertaken in the search for new treatments for cystic fibrosis.  Much of the research being currently conducted is in the area of biotechnology, including gene therapy and recombinant DNA research.</P>
      <P>The breakthrough referred to by the Deputy in respect of a drug which has the potential to assist young people with this illness is assumed to relate to a drug known as dornase alfa, otherwise known as DNase.</P>
      <P>The drug is a product of recombinant DNA research and is an enzyme which reduces the viscosity of the mucus, or sputum, present in the airways of those suffering from cystic fibrosis.  It is in this manner that essential pulmonary function is improved in these patients.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to answer Questions Nos. 54, 64 and 70 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised by the National Drugs Advisory Board that on foot of requests from it to companies marketing organophosphate based sheep-dips the board was notified of two suspected adverse drug reactions occurring in 1992 and three in 1993.  The board also received five complaints during this period from <Col N="1304" /> individuals who reported side-effects of various sheep-dips over many years including some relating to products no longer on the market here.  In 1994 two further reports were received by the board, one of which involved side-effects of unspecified organophosphate sheep dips over a ten year period.  The National Drugs Advisory Board monitors suspected adverse drug reactions to veterinary medicinal products by means of a voluntary notification system by the medical, pharmacy and veterinary professions and by direct requests to companies marketing sheep dips.</P>
    <P>Both the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and my own Department maintain close contact on issues such as this.  The memberships of the National Drugs Advisory Board and the Food Safety Advisory Committee are largely drawn from both Departments as are the members of the Poisons Board.</P>
    <P>The National Drugs Advisory Board is currently preparing a full report on the use of organophosphate based sheep-dips and has advised that the report should be completed within two months.  Officials of my Department are keeping in contact with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and with the National Drugs Advisory Board regarding developments.</P>
    <P>As pointed out by my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in a reply to a question on this matter on 16 May it is advisable for flockowners to observe the manufacturer's instructions in using sheep-dips. There is a responsibility on the user to take the recommended precautions.  In a survey of sheep farmers carried out in 1992 only 10 per cent of individuals questioned wore the correct protective clothing.  In assessing the safety of these products the National Drugs Advisory Board takes account of possible hazards to persons who handle or administer them.  The board recommends that farmers follow precisely the precautions and directions stated on the labels of all medicinal products.  When the board has <Col N="1305" /> completed its report I will be in a position to determine what action, if any, needs to be taken to further safeguard the health of persons using sheep-dips.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 77 together.  Oncology services are already provided on a national basis at a number of major regional hospital locations and through the operation of a comprehensive network of out-patient clinics at local level.</P>
      <P>On taking office I set as a priority the further development of services to combat cancer.  Accordingly, I established a review group in the Department, under the chairmanship of the chief medical officer, to prepare a comprehensive cancer strategy which is due for completion in the coming months.  The initiative will concentrate on four main areas: prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care.  The objective is to take all measures possible to reduce the incidence of cancer and to ensure that those who develop cancer receive the most effective care and treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to cancer treatment services the review group is initially carrying out an audit of existing cancer treatment services provided in each health board area.  The group is also consulting widely with interest groups and recently met with the Irish Society of Medical Oncologists to discuss the recommendations which it outlined in a report submitted to the Department in November 1994 on how our cancer services should be developed in the future.  The review group also had discussions recently with the Faculty of Radiologists of the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland.  In addition, I am aware that a joint working group of consultant medical and radiation oncologists is formulating a more detailed plan which I look forward to receiving in the near future.  This type of inter-specialty co-operation is an example of how I wish to see our cancer <Col N="1307" /> services organised.  The integration of the various medical professionals involved in the cancer service will be essential in developing a multi-professional input into the care, management and treatment of persons suffering from the disease.</P>
    <P>The cancer review group will draw up its recommendations with regard to treatment services on completion of the audit and the consultative process. When I have had an opportunity to consider the findings of the review group I will be bringing any necessary proposals to Government for approval as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the prevention of cancer through health promotion activities must form a key element in any cancer strategy.  In relation to smoking, I will be seeking to develop further health prevention initiatives aimed at reducing the incidence of smoking related cancers. These initiatives will build upon the success of previous preventative strategies which contributed to a decline in the incidence of smoking from 43 per cent of adults in the early 1970s to 28 per cent today.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Proposals for the amendment of the existing appeals arrangements within the health boards, to place them on a formal and independent footing are being actively pursued in my Department at present.

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The latest figures available to me indicate that the total amount of money paid in overtime in respect of the bodies covered by the Deputy's question was £23.24 million in 1994.</P>
      <P>This figure represents about 2.4 per cent of the pay expenditure of these agencies.</P>
      <P>Overtime is defined as hours worked over and above normal hours.  I am satisfied that the cost of overtime represents a reasonable cost of providing essential services in what is a highly labour intensive service where there is constant demand on services, equipment and facilities.  The Deputy will appreciate that in a twenty-four hour, seven day a week service meeting these service demands will continue to involve the incurring of overtime costs.</P>
      <P>However this is an area that is constantly under review both in my Department and in health agencies and we continue to look at ways to reduce this cost to a minimum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received several submissions from the Tibet Support Group Ireland since the beginning of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1310" /> The human rights situation in Tibet is a matter of great concern to the Goverment which has taken up the issue bilaterally with the Chinese authorities and at the United Nations.  I am also conscious of the reports that serious environmental damage is being caused to Tibet itself and the damaging effects that that is having on other countries.</P>
    <P>I told the House in reply to a parliamentary question on 4 April that, during my visit to China last September I met with Vice President and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and raised with him the question of human rights and the treatment of prisoners in Tibet.</P>
    <P>The Irish delegation to the UN Commission on Human Rights, CHR, which took place in Geneva from 30 January until 10 March 1995, played an active role in drafting a proposed Resolution on Human Rights in China and ensured that appropriate reference to the situation in Tibet was included in the text. The draft Resolution, which Ireland co-sponsored, highlighted how inadequate <Col N="1311" /> is the situation for Tibetans, their ethnic identity, religious freedom, language and culture.  The Minister of State, Deputy Joan Burton, received the Dalai Lama's European Representative, Mrs. Kelsang Takla, on 27 April 1995.  She specifically expressed thanks for Ireland's co-sponsorship of the draft Resolution which came much closer to being adopted than at previous sessions. As in previous years China moved a no-action motion but for the first time it was unsuccessful.  Members of the EU voted against China's no-action motion. As a result the draft Resolution was taken and it was defeated by only a single vote.  China always campaigns strongly against the tabling of this draft Resolution.  I know that this outcome constitutes an important message from the international community to the Chinese Government concerning its treatment of the people in Tibet.</P>
    <P>Representatives of EU embassies in Beijing visited Tibet last November and made clear EU concerns about the human rights situation there.  They once again raised with the authorities the list of prisoners which had been presented by the EU ambassadors when they visited Tibet in May 1993 and they also handed over a list of 14 nuns who had been arrested.  I understand that a small number of Tibetan political prisoners have been released but the situation of political prisoners in Tibet remains an issue of concern.</P>

    <P>In relation to facilities available at the Dublin paediatric hospitals, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a major capital grant of £500,000 was made available in 1994 to Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin for extension and refurbishment of the accident and emergency department.  I understand this work is nearing completion.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I am pleased to say that funds have been provided this year for the appointment of an accident and emergency consultant to the National Children's Hospital, Harcourt Street. This should result in the more efficient use of resources and will enhance the service available to children presently attending the hospital's accident and emergency department.</P>
    <P>The top priority agreed by my Department and the hospital authorities for the Children's Hospital, Temple Street is the upgrading of the outpatient department.  This upgrading is required because outpatient facilities at this hospital are antiquated and because of the volume of patients seeking such services. Temple Street Hospital has submitted a proposal to upgrade and refurbish its outpatient department at a cost of £700,000.  On the basis that Temple Street Hospital will contribute £275,000, I have approved a capital grant for the balance i.e. £425,000.  Building work should start in June 1995 and the development will take approximately six months to complete.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The total amount in balances due at present is estimated to be £3.732 million.  The details are contained in the following table.  Of this £2.613 million is due in respect of 1994 allocations and an estimated £1.119 million due in respect of 1993.

      <Col N="1316" /> Health boards are funded by way of an approved level of net non-capital expenditure which is notified to each of them at the beginning of the year.  The level of cash approved for each board in a year combines cash in respect of the current year and previous years.  This cash together with the approved working capital levels set for the boards, allows them to operate within the expenditure levels approved and meet their liabilities within the approved time limits.</P>
    <P>The cash is issued in line with profiles agreed at the beginning of each year and as part of this process it is normal that balances are issued in the first half of the year.  The current position is therefore in line with the normal procedures operated by my Department.</P>

      <P>The section of the document, Recycling for Ireland, referred to in the question deals with the principle of producer responsibility for wastes.  It promised full statutory support for this principle which is reflected in the Waste Bill, 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1319" /> The recycling strategy also envisages the possibility of alternatives to statutory arrangements being developed by Irish packaging interests on the lines of industry-led schemes which operate successfully elsewhere in the European Union.  The strategy does not speak of industry making suggestions but of its formulation of proposals which will be fully assessed by Government as to their acceptability.  Proposals of this kind are at present being finalised by the Industry Task Force on Recycling, whose report I am awaiting.  The recycling strategy made it clear that, if the alternative arrangements proposed are not found to be satisfactory, the provisions of the Waste Bill will be used to ensure attainment of recycling targets.</P>

      <P>The number of civil cases for which notices of trial had been lodged and which were awaiting hearing in the High Court as of 31 July 1994 was 14,428, of which 12,140 were personal injury actions.  Records of civil cases for which notices of trial had been lodged and which were awaiting hearing in the Circuit Court as of 31 July 1994 were maintained only in respect of the two largest Circuit Court offices, i.e.  Dublin and Cork.  There were 7,412 such cases in Dublin and 6,510 such cases in Cork. Arrangements have been put in place to maintain corresponding statistics in respect of all Circuit Court offices in the legal year ending 31 July, 1995.</P>
