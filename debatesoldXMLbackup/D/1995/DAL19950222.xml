      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday evening I had begun to talk about the number of worthwhile initiatives in the budget which will help to develop and enhance a society based on the principles of social cohesion.  I referred to the major improvement in the children's allowance which represents the greatest step forward in enhancing the welfare of children for many years.  A family with four children will be in receipt of £1,400 per year and that is an important step towards providing a basic income to support all children.</P>
      <P>The initiative taken by the Minister to provide funds to sustain a further 7,500 people on community employment schemes is also welcome.  That will allow them become part of the workforce and obtain work experience.  It will also allow for the provision of more community schemes which will be of considerable benefit in many parts of the country.  The Minister is to be commended on the full and frank way he has acknowledged the major difficulties involved in solving the problem of the long-term unemployed.  If we are to solve this problem, we must face up to it frankly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard I ask the Minister to act <Col N="1162" /> on the proposal in the National Economic and Social Forum Report No. 4 which refers to the potential to create approximately 10,000 full-time jobs in local authorities.  That is a worthwhile proposal and the Minister should act on it as soon as possible.  Those jobs would be suitable for many long-term unemployed people.  This work is necessary and will greatly enhance our country.  It will also provide a framework which will be of considerable benefit, particularly to the tourism industry.  I hope we will see some move to implement this worthwhile proposal.  The net cost to the State would be relatively small, approximately £5,000 per job and, for a total investment of perhaps £20 million or £30 million, it should be possible to make considerable progress in that area.</P>
    <P>The introduction of free travel for pensioners both North and South is an imaginative proposal.  It will be of great benefit to pensioners and I hope many of them will avail of the opportunity to travel to the North and many people in the North will travel to the South.  I hope people from Dublin will travel to Belfast and <i>vice versa</i> for shopping and other leisure pursuits.  Such cross-Border traffic can only be favourable for everyone.</P>
    <P>The proposal to remove third level fees is very welcome.  It will relieve a great burden on many families struggling to put their children through college.There is considerable scope for further improvement in maintenance costs, etc., but it is an important first step and I have no doubt it will be of great help to many families.  It will also help to change attitudes about going to college.  It will provide a support framework and encourage many people to attend college who may have been deterred from doing so in the past because of the expense involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposal on Third World charities is welcome.  It is particularly appropriate in the year in which we begin to commemorate the Famine. One of the paradoxes of this country's position in providing funds for overseas <Col N="1163" /> aid is that, while we remain at the bottom of the league in terms of the proportion of gross national product contributed in comparison to other OECD countries, our contributions over the past number of years have tended to increase while the contributions of many of the developed countries have tended to decline.  We appear to be moving contrary to the international trend and that is encouraging.  I hope the changes made in the budget will encourage people to make a special effort to contribute to Third World charities and it is appropriate that they will now be in a position to nominate the charity or aid group they wish to support.</P>
    <P>The initiative to provide £1,000 for people selling a ten year old car is welcome.This idea arose from the efforts of the Society of the Irish Motoring Industry and, in particular, Mr. Cyril McHugh, its chief executive.  I am glad the Minister has taken action in this regard.  To a large extent it also came from the lobbying by the SIMI last year which proposed that, if certain changes were made in the budget, it would generate increased revenue and would increase the levels of employment in the motor industry.  That happened and is one reason we can feel confident this proposal will further improve the motor industry and will have significant benefits in terms of improving the environment.</P>
    <P>At the conclusion of his contribution the Minister outlined his vision of this country 15 years from now.  He was right to set high objectives and standards for our country to be reached by the year 2010.  There is nothing wrong with being ambitious but it will not be easy to achieve these targets.  We will need to reach very high standards if we are to close the gap between average income in this country and European member states.  To achieve this we will have to invest in products and services that can be sold in Europe and elsewhere so that we are as good as the best in terms of the quality of our goods and services. <Col N="1164" /> That objective will be considerably enhanced by the levels of infrastructural investment which will be available to this country from the Structural Funds. However, we need to go much further, in particular we need greater investment in science and technology, research and development than in the past.</P>
    <P>The level of investment in science and technology has been pitifully low.  I do not understand how we hope to develop products and services without investing in science and technology to a degree comparable with our competitors.  If we do not, we will not be in the race in terms of creating new products, changing production processes and so on.  Science and technology has been treated very badly in the past decade.  I believe there is an element in Irish society that is quite ignorant of the value and significance of science and technology and how it can be harnessed to advance the country.  I know that the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Rabbitte, is responsible for the White Paper on Science and Technology and since he took up office he has sought to try to attract attention to the value of science and technology. He is beginning from a very low base and has a very steep hill to climb in terms of the levels of changes needed. I wish Deputy Rabbitte well but unless there is a considerable change in attitude among the Irish establishment it is difficult to see the levels of change that are needed coming about.  However, they are essential if we are to attain the objectives the Minister for Finance set for the year 2000.</P>
    <P>Considerable changes are needed in Irish industry.  I believe most Irish industries are too small and it is necessary to consolidate, particularly in the food industries.  If Irish food companies are to penetrate international markets, they have to attain a certain scale. Unless they are able to invest in marketing, research and development, infrastructure and capacity they will continue to supply commodities to the European and world markets but that is not the way forward.  We have to be able to <Col N="1165" /> develop branded products so that the consumer will choose our products rather than being dependent on those who control what is sold in the outlets.</P>
    <P>There is considerable scope for further investment in tourism, in areas of Dublin outside the city centre.  There has been a reasonable level of effort and development in the city centre areas but there are attractions in the suburbs and the Dublin mountains.  A sustained effort should be made to promote those attractions which to a large extent have been neglected.  In the promotional literature on Dublin there is virtually no mention of the Dublin mountains or historic houses outside the city centre.  I wish the new Minister well and hope he will do something about this.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is right to put the emphasis on enterprise and social cohesion because without social cohesion it would be very difficult to have enterprise and <i>vice versa</i>.  We need to consider the best way forward.  I wish there was greater anxiety to achieve co-operation and cohesion.  To some degree Irish life has become preoccupied with cantankerous argumentative questions but that is not of much use in terms of making progress.  Certainly there are questions but it is not so much that we want answers to the questions as solutions to the problems to which those questions relate.  Instead of dissent we should be trying to generate harmony and consensus on how very serious problems can be resolved.  The way forward is through the development of social cohesion and the promotion of enterprise.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on remarks made yesterday by the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Durkan, when he spoke about the changing attitude and cognitive restructuring when people move from this side of the House to the other.  The only advice I give to Members on both sides is to exercise an element of restraint. Given the unpredictable nature of politics it is not easy to be sure where Members will be in the next few months or in the next few years and caution <Col N="1166" /> could save people the embarrassment of having to eat their words in future.</P>
    <P>The reality of political life is that leaks are part of what we are: it is a dull Monday now that we do not have a leak to fill up the newspapers because as we all know Monday is a bad day for news. The phenomenon has developed to the point at which the same old stuff can be releaked with minor adjustments.  I think the former Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, was unfortunate to be caught up in the works as to some degree all he was doing was taking one step further what others were doing anyway, in other words acting in a cavalier fashion.  That is not to seek to justify what happened.</P>

      <P>Tá an-áthas orm deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an gCáináisnéis.I dtosach báire ba mhaith liom a ráa, ag tagairt don rud adúirt an Teachta Upton, go dtagaim leis go gcaithfidh duine a bheith cúramach faoi cad a deireann sé ar an dtaobh seo den Teach.  Tá súil agam, áfach, sa mhéid atá le rá agam, ainneoin go mbeidh cáineadh láidir le déanamh, gur cháineadh é a rinne mé nuair a bhí Fianna Fáil i Rialtais le dreamanna eile.  Beidh mé ag rá rudaí a chreidim go diongbhálta.</P>
      <P>I regret the overall thrust of the budget in returning to a current budget deficit.  As far back as 1987 when I entered politics I said that current budget deficiting is spending our children's future.  That is not acceptable and I cannot condone it.</P>
      <P>If we look at the record for the past three years, a clear trend emerges, the actual out-turn for 1993 was a deficit of £379 million, for 1994, the post-budget project was a current budget deficit of £262 million but the actual out-turn was a surplus of £15 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What did we do in 1995?  The post budget projection is for a current budget deficit of £310 million.  I cannot understand the logic behind that or the justification for it.  It is a weak argument to say we are talking about 9 per cent of GNP which was the figure given in the <Col N="1167" /> post budget deficit projection last year. The trend has been for the current budget deficit to come down in real terms.  Once we cleared the hurdle of disposing with the current budget deficit we should have maintained it.  There is no justification for what has happened. When does the Government intend to return to a current budget balance?</P>
    <P>Borrowing for capital development is justified because if spent wisely it will create wealth and raise standards of living.I welcome some of the taxation features in the budget.  Changes in capital gains tax, farmers' stock relief, motor cars for business purposes and capital acquisitions tax are all welcome.  In the past there was great difficulty in transferring farms from one generation to another.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in residential property tax but given the small amount of money collected it would be better to abolish it in total.  I welcome the taxation and PRSI measures in the budget as far as they go but we are still tinkering with the system in a piecemeal fashion.  We have had too little reform and we always further complicate a system which is riddled with anomalies.  I welcome the £50 exemption limit from PRSI.  Taxation, PRSI and the various levies must be amalgamated into one cohesive system.  I have often spoken about the need to arrive at a position where there would be a £100 per week exemption from PRSI and levies for a single person and £200 exemption for a married couple, with extra exemptions for those with children.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how we got ourselves into the tax mess we are in and how we managed to devise a system which is so complicated.  Many people, especially those on low incomes, are crying out for a simple taxation system which they can understand and which does not have myriad complications. They want one they can comply with easily but they do not want to end up going backwards instead of forwards.</P>
    <P>The tax relief on service charges is a <Col N="1168" /> gimmick.  The value of that little measure to somebody paying tax at the standard rate and living in Galway city is 23p per week, while in Galway county it is 51p per week.  There should have been a better way of doing this as it is totally unfair to those living in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I am not particularly enamoured with the BES or profit sharing schemes so beloved of those with high disposable incomes.  Such schemes favour those with high discretionary disposable incomes who avail of them to give themselves very high tax free allowances.  It is possible for a person with an income of £200,000 per annum to have a tax free allowance of up to £30,000 a year.  When one considers that a widow has a tax exemption limit of £3,700 a year one realises there is something radically unfair about the system.  Most people want to see an end to these schemes and a simple, no frills system put in place with greater basic allowances and decent tax exemption limits.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at the changes in tax exemptions and marginal relief. There was an increase in the personal tax free allowance of £150 for a single person and £300 for a married couple. The increase in the tax exemption limit was only £100 for a single person bringing it to £3,700 per annum and £200 for a married couple bringing it to £7,400 per annum.  There was no increase in the tax exemption limit for children.  Last year I supported the taxation of short term social welfare benefits, unemployment and disability benefit.  However, I said it would only be fair if tax exemption limits were radically increased.  I supported it because, in a family, one of the couple could receive unemployment or disability benefit throughout the year but the combined income could be £40,000.  I supported the taxation of the total income because it does not make any difference where the income comes from.  However, taxing unemployment benefit and disability benefit without raising exemption limits has led to those in seasonal work bearing an unfair burden of taxation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1169" /> At present the tax exemption limit for a married couple with four children is £9,600 or £184 per week.  The family income supplement ceiling is £235 a week.  If one is anywhere between the £184 and £235 the following is the effect of receiving a £10 wage increase per week.  A person would lose £4 because he or she would be taxed at the marginal rate of 40 per cent, not 27 per cent. The person would lose £6 in family income supplement and 77p a week in PRSI.  The net take home family income, including family income supplement, would decrease by 77p a week, although the person would have received a nominal pay increase of £10 a week.  If you compare the net take home household income of a person with four children, earning £9,600 and someone earning £12,220, the person earning £9,600 is better off by £3.92 a week than the person earning £12,220.  In other words, the person earning £51 more per week ends up with a net household income of £3.92 less per week, in addition to which, if one takes any intermediate point on that scale, one finds that one ends up somewhere between the two.</P>
    <P>This Government has talked about incentive to work and it is about time we addressed that issue.  In the case of a married couple with three children, the exemption limit is £172 per week and the family income supplement ceiling is £215 per week.  A person unfortunate enough to get a pay rise of £10 per week from £172 loses £4 in tax relief, £6 on the family income supplement, 55p in social insurance and, because the levies hit one between the £172 and the £183, a loss of a further £4.  Therefore, for the privilege of receiving an extra £10 per week one's net take home or household income is reduced by £4.55 per week. That is a total nonsense and leads to a poverty trap.</P>
    <P>I might refer to another anomaly we are adding to our taxation system, that is the position of married couples, <Col N="1170" /> between one-earning families and two-earning families.  Whereas we give lipservice to the role of the full-time homemaker in our society, in reality we penalise them to the hilt.  Let us compare the position of a two-earner family on, say, £16,000 per annum with a one-earner family on the same income and how they are taxed or treated by the system.  One discovers that the two-earner family will have a net household income of £7.62 per week more, or £396 annually, than the single-earning family. The reason which is quite simple has been aggravated this year.  The single-earning family does not receive a double PRSI allowance, in addition to a single £50 PRSI exemption for the single-earning household.  One might contend that in the double-earning household both are paying PRSI, but both will have the advantage of having social insurance paid and of being fully covered by the system.</P>
    <P>The position of those on a higher income paying 48 per cent tax is worsened in that the difference in the household income between the one-earner and the two-earner family with the same annual income &mdash; in other words, where the two incomes are equivalent to the one income &mdash; is £11.44 per week better in the case of the two-earner family than the one-earner family, or £594 annually.</P>
    <P>It might be said it is easy for me to highlight all of the shortfalls and weaknesses within the system but what can be done about them in practice?  Last year, before the Minister announced his budget I proposed graphs showing how, as one's income rose, one's net household income dropped into a valley and rose again.  In that exercise I was not taking into account the loss of indirect benefits such as medical cards.  I was concerned about this.  At the time I made proposals to the Economic and Social Forum on the issue.  This exercise is relatively easy.  I was able to draw a model giving a net increase in household income related to an increase in wages by effecting some very simple adjustments to the system.  The first thing we should do is exempt the first <Col N="1171" /> £60 of income from PRSI contributions. The reason I chose the figure of £60 rather than £50 is that there is already a total exemption of £60.  This means that at present £50 is disregarded if one's wages are in excess of £60 but the figure £60 is used if one's wages are under £60 so that, for the sake of the £10 involved, they should have abolished that anomaly.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the levies and PRSI contributions should be amalgamated into one two-rate system and there should be no connection between levies and eligibility for a medical card.  I am advocating that on the first £60 of income one should not pay any PRSI contributions, on the next £140 &mdash; in other words between £60 and £200 &mdash; one should pay 6 per cent PRSI and, in excess of £200, one should pay 9 per cent contributions.  This could be rendered revenue-neutral by adjusting the cut-off ceiling for employees' PRSI contributions.  In addition, for administrative convenience, there is no good reason for not having the employers' and employees PRSI ceiling struck at exactly the same figure.</P>
    <P>On taxation, a reduction should be effected in the number of allowances to include only superannuation, VHI and medical expenses and mortgage relief because all income, with the exception of child benefit, should be taxable.  Then one could dramatically increase the basic allowance and widen the tax bands.</P>
    <P>In the short term the exemption limits must be revised &mdash; I drew up some models in this respect &mdash; so that the tax exemption limits in all cases would be higher than the ceiling applicable to the family income supplement, thus abolishing the hollow, so that, as a person's income increases, their net household income also increases.  I would favour also the reduction in the marginal rate of tax for people on low incomes, just above the exemption limit, to 35 per cent.  Finally, in order to eliminate the anomaly to which I referred between the one-earner and two-earner family, <Col N="1172" /> all allowances to married couples should be doubled; in other words, irrespective of whether a married couple's income is derived from one or two sources, they should be treated as a couple in every way within the taxation system, as in the case of some of the basic allowances.</P>
    <P>In regard to social welfare benefits, I was aghast at the 2.5 per cent increase and, when I observed that the child dependant allowance had not been increased.  I was further dismayed.  Last year, the corresponding increase was 3 per cent in addition to which certain other rates and categories were accorded an increase far in excess of that figure.  For example, last year, there was the introduction of a widower's pension, a 10 per cent increase in the short term rate of unemployment and disability benefit whereas this year that increase is 2.5 per cent for adults and nothing in the case of children.</P>
    <P>Last year also we saw the introduction of a significant exemption for carers accompanied by changes in the free television licence, ESB allowance and telephone rental schemes in addition to revisions in means-testing.  Some progress has been made this year; for example, I am delighted that all social welfare recipients will qualify for a free colour television licence.  The free travel allowance between North and South is a nice touch which I welcome.  Nonetheless, the overall, general increase is meagre.</P>
    <P>The argument has been advanced here that the reason for these most recent budgetary proposals is the encouragement of people to go to work. We must remember that there are 385,000 pensioners here.  Is the Government proposing to put those people to work; are we going to forget those people who, through ill-health or old age, depend on us for their livelihood? Those people with children and those on social welfare fared relatively worse than those in receipt of a decent salary, the former might well have expected at least the 2.5 per cent increase in social welfare or the 40p given last year. Therefore, their real increase through <Col N="1173" /> the child dependant allowance amounts to £1.21 per week only whereas, for those of us on salaries, the real increase amounts to £1.61 per week.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the principle of early payment proposed this year, I do not foresee my constituents, dependent on social welfare, dancing for joy at the crossroads because they will receive their increase of £2.40 or £1.50 per week six weeks earlier.</P>

      <P>We will deal with that.  Regarding child benefit, I welcome the increased rates and the extension of the scheme to include 19 years olds.  The increases are welcome even for people in the middle class bracket.  Most people pay tax and this increase in benefit in effect gives people the benefit of some of the tax they will pay at a higher rate towards the end of their working life at a time when they are under the most severe financial pressure due to the costs involved in educating their children and meeting their mortgage repayments.It does something to level out the position between families and people who do not have children.  Having regard to the reduction in the cost of the scheme resulting from a 28 per cent average decrease in the birth rate during the past few years, it was inevitable that there would be an increase in child benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the extension of the carer's scheme to non-social welfare pensioners.Many people caring for a widow of a garda and others were not entitled to the allowance because they were not social welfare pensioners.  I would ask the Minister or the Minister of State to consider a position that often arises in rural Ireland where one family member stays at home and lives on a small farm with perhaps three cows and cares for an old person.  The income earned from <Col N="1174" /> that small enterprise should be exempt, just as a spouse's income is.  The present position is an anomaly and I hope it will be rectified in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>I am appalled that means testing of unemployment assistance has not been mentioned in the budget.  The worst off and most heavily penalised people, to whom enterprise can mean nothing, are those living on small farms, fishermen and craft workers who are dependent on social welfare.  Small farmers in my constituency have no hope of ever being able to earn an adequate income from their farms to support their families.  For every pound they earn a pound is deducted from their unemployment assistance.  That is the most penal system operating in the State and it is time it was changed.  I have raised this matter with many Ministers, but little progress has been made.  It is time we grasped the nettle and recognised that small farmers need some system of income supplement which would enable them keep some of the fruits of their labour.</P>
    <P>I am also very critical of the 10 per cent means testing of capital.  What bank pays 10 per cent interest today? No bank is paying that rate, but small farmers and other social welfare recipients with £2,000 or £3,000 in the bank are penalised at the rate of 10 per cent as if banks were paying that rate of interest.  To encourage people to be thrifty and having particular regard to money saved in credit unions, the first £5,000 of money saved should be exempt from means testing and the balance means tested at 50 per cent of the interest earned.  That would ensure that people would take their savings from under their mattresses and save in the banks and other institutions.  That measure would encourage thrift which we need to foster in society.</P>
    <P>On social welfare, there is a need to unify the rates and introduce a single means test system based on the principle that the nearer one's income is to the basic social welfare payment the greater the proportion of one's earnings should be retained.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1175" /> On rural issues covered in the budget, I am surprised that the amount of money allocated for county roads this year is 6 per cent less than last year.  The greatest infrastructural problem faced by people in rural Ireland is the poor condition of roads.  Not enough is being done to address that problem.  All rural Deputies, irrespective of which side of the House they are on, particularly those from the more peripheral regions, would put that issue on the top of the agenda.  The measure in respect of VRT relief is welcome and I had proposed something similar previously, but its operation will prove disastrous for rural Ireland and the poor.  I would have favoured a measure which entitled everyone who handed in a scrap car to a rebate of £200, irrespective of whether they bought a new or secondhand car. Such a measure would ensure that many cars were taken out of the ditches of rural Ireland and that people in cities would not buy and use such cars for illegal purposes.</P>
    <P>I hope to have an opportunity at a later date to speak on the provisions for third level education.  I welcome free fees but it does very little for people in receipt of medium incomes in rural Ireland.  People earning £23,000 a year with mortgage repayments of £3,000 per year and two children in college would not be eligible to qualify for maintenance grants for their children at present and would be left with a net income of £8,000 a year, which is equivalent to the income they would receive if they were on the dole.  I hope the Minister will radically increase maintenance grants and the qualifying income limits otherwise the provision in respect of the third level fees is anti-rural, welcome as it is. Similarly, regarding second level education, the means test for islanders and people living in remote areas, who have children attending boarding schools in respect of whom they have to pay half the costs involved, should be abolished. I hope to speak on the matter in the Dáil at an early date.  There is no provision for free travel for islanders in the <Col N="1176" /> budget as many islands do not have a ferry service.  There is a need for a subsidised ferry service to all islands, irrespective of whether they are in Gaeltacht areas.  The extension of free travel to the North is welcome, but such a provision should be extended to our islanders.</P>
    <P>Regarding service charges, there is no mention of tax relief for people paying into the group schemes or for the unfortunate people who have to obtain their water supply from wells at great personal expense without any State assistance.</P>
    <P>On the flood and storm damage allocation, I will make representations that this problem be treated seriously and that adequate funds be provided.</P>
    <P>On the pilot renewal scheme for traditional seaside resorts, I cannot understand how none of the towns and seaside resorts in County Galway which, has a coastline stretching from Leenane in the north to Kinvara in the south, is included.  My colleague from Galway west, Deputy Molloy, mentioned Salthill.I am very surprised that the town of Clifden was omitted from the scheme.  I am sure that was an oversight on the part of the Minister.  That town needs refurbishment and is totally dependent on seasonal tourism.  I hope that when a final decision on the scheme is made both of those towns will be included.</P>

      <P>Having listened for the past half hour to Deputy Ó Cuív, one would swear that he had the cure for all ills, but it is regrettable that he was not such a good spin doctor when his party was in power and that he did not have the necessary clout at parliamentary party meetings to have some of the good points he made in his contribution put into practice.  This is a very positive budget but, naturally, there is room for improvement in some sectors.  However, miracles do not occur overnight, especially in financial matters, in a country which has seen indiscriminate borrowing policies through the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The international economy during 1994 showed a rapid growth in the <Col N="1177" /> OECD area, with recovery extending to all major regions.  Output expanded by 2.25 per cent, compared to 1.25 per cent in 1993 and inflation declined further. Nominal wage growth remained low against the background of continuing high unemployment in most countries. Employment increased modestly and unemployment declined in the second half of the year.  Nevertheless, taking the bright outlook into consideration the public finance position remains unsatisfactory in nearly all countries.  Debt remains high and the gross debt as a percentage of GDP continues to rise.</P>
    <P>Individual countries showed differences in growth performance, reflecting the different phases of their economic cycles.  In the United States, where the recovery is entering its fourth year, output expanded by four per cent, helped by the continued strength of private consumption and investment and an improvement in exports.  Canada followed a similar pattern.  In Japan, the wonder economy of the world, the recovery slowly gathered pace as private consumption strengthened in response to continued monetary easing for a substantial fiscal stimulus package.  In the United Kingdom the recovery which began in 1992 intensified with GDP growth reaching 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>World trade picked up considerably during 1994.  It expanded by almost 9 per cent compared to 3.25 per cent in 1993 and this was mainly reflected by more buoyant trade among OECD countries.  Ireland's markets for manufactured goods increased by 9 per cent. This was a very good performance when one considers we are the only island nation in the EU.  However, unemployment in the OECD countries peaked during the first half of 1994 at about 35 million or 8.25 per cent of their labour force.  However, it has been declining slowly, and I emphasise &ldquo;slowly&rdquo;, since.</P>
    <P>The Irish economy showed a GNP growth of 5.5 per cent in 1994.  The pick up in the second half of 1993 continued apace in 1994.  A very welcome aspect of last year's performance was the domestic contribution to growth.  This <Col N="1178" /> approach of sharing the fruits of growth must continue in the interests of the many who will be unemployed in the years to come.  It is also critical to future employment prospects that the opportunity afforded by this year's growth to further reduce the burden of debt on the economy is taken up.  This will help to maintain the comparative improvement in interest rates, which has emerged over recent years and will ease the pressures on the public finances when it is inevitable that the present international recovery has run its course.  It will also enhance both international and domestic investor confidence in Ireland's longer term prospects, further securing the foundations already laid for continuing strong employment growth.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's response in the budget to the demands of the trade unions for adjustments in the income tax code to enhance the real value of take-home pay in keeping with the objectives of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  It is also appreciated that the Minister favoured the low paid section of the community as far as possible in the provision of additional income tax reliefs, especially in view of the fact that the tax adjustments in budgets of the past have tended to favour the better off disproportionately. However, the measures announced in the budget must be seen as the beginning rather than the end of a process of significant reform of our tax system.</P>
    <P>The changes in employers' PRSI contributions, with other pro-business measures such as the reduction in corporation tax, should provide a further boost to employment prospects as long as the business community takes up the challenge.  The budget offers a substantial carrot to employers to maintain and create additional jobs.  In the package now available the Minister throws down the gauntlet and the employers' response to this challenge should be in the affirmative.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1179" /> While I welcome the increase given by the Minister to social welfare recipients, there are anomalies which I wish him to correct if possible.  It is nonsensical for the Department of Social Welfare to impose a law whereby widows aged over 60 years are entitled to free electricity, free telephone, winter fuel and so on only on the provision that their late spouses were in receipt of the same.  This is a deplorable policy initiated by the previous Government. It is an anomaly which must be corrected as soon as possible.  This regulation is totally unjust and should be completely erased by the Minister for Social Welfare.  There is no difference between a widow whose husband was entitled to the free schemes and one whose husband was not in receipt of them.  They are widows and should benefit from all schemes applying to widows.  The Minister should be generous on this important matter and grant the same allowance for those free schemes to all widows and widowers over 60 years of age.  That would not break the economy of the country, nor would it be the end of the national purse.</P>
    <P>Social welfare officers who investigate the entitlement of old age pensioners for non-contributory pension purposes operate a criteria whereby all savings held by pensioners, for burial purposes etc., are subject to a flat interest rate assesment of 10 per cent. Where will you get 10 per cent rate of interest on your deposit at the moment? You would be lucky to get 2 or 3 per cent.  This rate is completely nonsensical when one considers the fact that interest rates on deposits now range between 3 and 4 per cent per annum.  Surely then it is not correct for the Department to be operating a flat interest rate of 10 per cent when estimating the income from pensioners' savings, much of which is put by to pay burial expenses.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Ó Cuív who said that the first £5,000 of all savings should <Col N="1180" /> be exempt from tax, especially for elderly people who have invested money to pay their undertaker's bill.  I request the Minister for Social Welfare to have this matter thoroughly investigated and corrected if possible.</P>
    <P>The forecasted acceleration in output growth in the industrialised economy in 1995 will provide a favourable external environment for continued strong growth in the Irish economy.  Consequently, consumer spending should continue to grow strongly.  Further increases in employment, with pay increases in line with those provided for in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> the budgetary measures and moderate inflation, will lead to an increase in real personal disposable income of 6 per cent or more this year.</P>
    <P>A continuation of the stronger consumer confidence evident in 1994 should lead to a further modest fall in the underlying personal savings ratio. The recovery in investment which began last year should strengthen in 1995 given the prevailing level of interest rates, increased European Structural and Cohesion Fund expenditure, and improved consumer and business confidence generally.  Construction investment will benefit from increased expenditure under the Public Capital Programme and from further growth in private sector house building.  An increase of about 9.5 per cent in the volume of construction investment is forecast.Investment in machinery and equipment seems likely to accelerate this year as firms increase capacity in response to a second year of strong growth in domestic and international demand.</P>
    <P>The volume of total fixed investment is projected to grow by about 9.25 per cent.  The 1995 budget will deliver strong employment growth this year.  It will also increase the employment potential of the economy and actual employment, not only this year but in the immediate years to follow.  Furthermore, the budget increases the reward to employers to employ more staff, the reward to workers for working and the <Col N="1181" /> unemployed to seek work.  This is something we must try to foster and nurture because if we do not make it more attractive to the unemployed to seek work &mdash; rather than staying at home, idly drawing unemployment assistance &mdash; it will be a sad reflection on the Government of the day.  It is of paramount importance for us to make it more attractive for a man or woman to get up in the morning to seek employment and not to laze about on unemployment and other social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>This budget shows the fruits of economic growth in a way that will ensure a continuation of that growth.  The target set for the end of 1995 is an increase of 37,000 jobs in non-agricultural employment.It will also raise the living standards of those at work and support effort and enterprise.  It is geared to produce a result that will record a fall, estimated at 16,000 people, in the number out of work by the end of 1995.  It will also ensure that, on average, more employment training places will be provided for the long term unemployed than in 1994.  It gives priority to actions and investments which will make important contributions to employment and growth.  It will enhance international and domestic investors' confidence in the longer term prospects of the economy.  Therefore, it will copperfasten the foundations for the long term strong employment growth which has evaded this country for far too long.</P>
    <P>The generous increase of £7 per month in child income support will take effect from September and, in addition, child benefit is being extended to include 18-year-olds in full-time education and on FÁS courses.  This is a step in the right direction, as is the introduction of increases in social welfare pensions and allowances that have been brought forward to June rather than paid out in August as previous Governments have done.  In the carer's allowance a significant relaxation of the rules affecting assessment of income of the spouse of the carer will be introduced.  I understand that for the first time, the <Col N="1182" /> first £7,500 of the spouse's income will be disregarded when assessing the income of an applicant for a carer's allowance.  This is an important step because many geriatric people are cared for at home by the woman of the house. Her resources are extended to such a point that she finds it almost impractical to give that care without some help from the Department.  This is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>There is a serious anomaly in the carer's allowance regulations.  The first £7,500 of the spouse's income is to be disregarded and rightly so.  However, where the applicant is a widow trying to care for an elderly patient at home with no income other than her widow's pension, the latter is taken into consideration when estimating her means.  The Minister for Social Welfare should go the full hog, take a compassionate view and exclude the survivor's pension being drawn by the widow when investigating her means pursuant to an application for the carer's allowance. The Minister must realise that the applicant, who unfortunately happens to be a widow caring for an elderly relative at home, should be entitled to have her pension exempt from means testing.  It is not too much to ask the Minister for Social Welfare if, in his wisdom, he could incorporate that into the budget provisions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to increase, from £10 to £25, the minimum unemployment assistance payment to single people living in the family home. Many single people, boys and girls, are only sleeping at home because their parents cannot support them but will at least give them a bed for the night.  They were being victimised by the means testing of social welfare applications to the extent that they were only getting £10 per week.  Who could live on £10 per week?  This is a step in the right direction and I welcome the long overdue concession in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister's generosity in allowing all pensioners currently entitled to free electricity to qualify for a free colour television licence should be praised, this <Col N="1183" /> erases another anomaly.  It was only penny pinching and discriminated against the unfortunate people surviving on social welfare pensions who up to now had to rely on a black and white television licence.  It is a step in the right direction introduced by a caring Minister.</P>
    <P>The pilot renewal scheme for traditional seaside resorts will commence on 1 July 1995 for a three year period.  It is aimed to cover the construction and refurbishment of tourist buildings and structures, including accommodation, approved for the purpose of the relief by the Minister for Tourism and Trade, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, on the recommendation of Bord Fáilte and in accordance with specific codes and standards laid down by the board.</P>
    <P>I recognise that this is a pilot renewal scheme and that it is confined to seaside resorts which include Achill, Bally-bunion, Bundoran, Kilkee, Lahinch &mdash; Deputy de Valera's constituency seems to have got the greater part of it &mdash; Tramore, Westport and Youghal.  However, it should be enlarged to cover other areas along the western and south western seaboards which can be described as natural areas for tourism development, and which have similar problems, to benefit from the scheme.  The areas I have in mind are Courtmacsherry, Clonakilty, Glandore, Union Hall, Baltimore, Skibbereen, Ballydehob, Schull, Goleen, Crookhaven, Barley Cove, Durrus, Kilcrohane, Bantry, Glengariff, Castletownbere and the tourist resorts of south Kerry.</P>

It would be of immense benefit to promote and further the tourist industry in those traditional tourist areas.  I also welcome the Minister's decision to continue the stock relief for <Col N="1184" /> farmers at 25 per cent for a further two year period.  It is a step in the right direction.  This measure will assist farmers in increasing their herds so that they will produce viable incomes.</P>
      <P>I welcome the new scheme of stock relief at 100 per cent for young trained farmers under 35 years of age who qualify for the scheme of installation aid for young farmers and have completed a recognised agricultural course.  I also welcome the decision of the Minister to make the relief available for four years from 6 April, 1995 in the cases of young farmers installed between 6 April, 1993 and 5 April, 1995 and for four years after installation in the case of young farmers who were installed between 6 April, 1995 and 5 April, 1997.  There will be no claw back of this relief which will assist young farmers in building up stock to a viable level.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister's decision on the tax treatment of profits arising from cattle herd disposals under a statutory disease eradication programme. Profits arising from the disposal are excluded from assessment for tax purposes in the year in which the disposal takes place and instead will be deemed to arise in two equal instalments for the next two years of assessment.</P>
      <P>All in all, this is a budget with which I am proud to be associated.  It gives an impetus to the businessman, the developer, the farmer, the self employed, the chemical worker and the labourer.  It gives every section of the community an opportunity to look forward and plan with confidence for the future.</P>

    <P>Colleagues on this side of the House pointed out in detail the weekly meaning of that 2.5 per cent, but it is of little help to those who need financial aid from the State.  It is difficult to accept that this Government has the interests of social welfare recipients and those who might need financial aid from the State in mind when it has given such a small percentage increase.  Even in the 1987 budget, when Fianna Fáil was in power and had to clean up the economic <Col N="1186" /> mess of the previous coalition Government, there was a 3 per cent increase in social welfare.  Fianna Fáil has been known to give greater increases than 3 per cent in social welfare down the years.</P>

      <P>It is amusing to note Deputy Rabbitte's remarks at that time when he said that the 3 per cent increase was low and should not be accepted by any Government.  Yet he is now willing to stand over a 2.5 per cent increase, especially when we have a healthy economy with, for the first time in 27 years, a current budget surplus, and when the electorate had high expectations of this budget.  I welcome the small changes in taxation and the relief to employers which may help to create further employment.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Sheehan, I want to refer to the pilot renewal scheme for traditional seaside resorts.  He named a number of areas in his constituency which he felt should be included.  I can also list a number of resorts which I would like included, in addition to Lahinch and Kilkee.  The idea is good and I hope it will be extended in future years. Regardless of our political persuasions, we all recognise that tourism is a growing industry with tremendous potential for employment.</P>
      <P>When Fine Gael was in Opposition it vehementaly opposed the residential property tax and stated so on numerous occasions.  Yet, it is prepared to stand over the tax now that it is in Government.One may ask why I, a rural Deputy, am concerned about this tax. Representations were made to me by constituents, especially those living in built-up areas.  This is a matter of concern and I hope the system will be changed.  When Fianna Fáil took office, it said it would abolish the residential property tax and I supported that proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One issue which affects everybody is hospital waiting lists.  Deputy Howlin, <Col N="1187" /> when he was Minister for Health, recognised, along with his Fianna Fáil colleagues in Government, that this issue needed to be addressed and that an immediate injection of substantial moneys was needed to deal with this situation, which is causing anxiety and hardship for many people.  For that reason, I was disappointed that this budget only allocated £8 million, instead of the substantial sum given in the last budget by a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance.  I will not discuss all the difficulties which older people, geriatric patients and those who need institutional care, face when trying to seek help and residential care.</P>
    <P>One issue which has been raised on numerous occasions in this House during Question Time, on the Order of Business and in Private Members' time is flooding.  In the budget £2 million was allocated for dealing with flooding in agricultural areas.  It was interesting to note that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, was shocked when he saw the extent of the damage in the west.  He was able to visit Galway and if he had gone further south, he would have also seen the damage and hardship caused by flooding in County Clare.  I mentioned this problem in the House.  While the £2 million is welcome, it will not be enough to deal with the national problem.  I understand, although I may be wrong, that the Government has not yet made a submission to the European institutions for assistance.  It may not be possible for the Exchequer to provide funds to deal with this problem, therefore we need European funding, and I hope the appropriate submission will be made without delay.  I was disappointed at the reference to roads in the budget because our country roads are in need of repair and maintenance, particularly after the flooding, and local authorities could not be expected to meet the costs involved. We hope the Government, when seeking assistance, will bear in mind the need to increase the allocation to deal with road repairs and maintenance.  It <Col N="1188" /> will be interesting to hear the debate in the Seanad on the amendment to the Arterial Drainage Act.  Perhaps this might move the Government to amend this Act.</P>
    <P>I welcome the £2 million allocated for the arts programme.  However, as I said in the House and elsewhere, the moneys which the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht sought to cover the cost of the arts plan for 1995 are not sufficient.The Arts Council has indicated it will need £19 million for its programme for 1995 alone and as yet £16 million only is available.  I hope the Minister will make up the £3 million shortfall and I wish him well in bringing this about.</P>
    <P>In the arts plan one notes the importance given to regionalisation and to arts in education.  Arts and culture should not be seen as elitist interests or concerns.They should be shared by all within our community, men and women, the young, travellers, the disabled, etc. In years to come there will be more emphasis on the arts because of increased leisure time for those fortunate enough to have work and for the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling of great disappointment about this budget.  The Minister for Finance has the opportunity to make concessions in the coming weeks and he should do so, especially to help social welfare recipients.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy de Valera for sharing her time.  Because of the extremely healthy state of the national finances, most people looked forward to this budget with expectation and a degree of excitement.  The background had not been as positive for a generation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various economic indicators &mdash; such as the balance of payments, exports and the ratio of national debt to GNP &mdash; reflected the dramatic improvement in our economy in recent years.  The rate of inflation and interest rates were more favourable than could have been imagined a few years ago.  Substantial EU funds were about to come on <Col N="1189" /> stream.  Finally, the welcome development in Northern Ireland meant the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and their Cabinet colleagues were in an enviable position as they drafted the budget.</P>
    <P>There was little doubt in anyone's mind that the main target of their efforts would be the two major outstanding problems facing our society, namely unemployment and poverty. Thus it is against this background one must evaluate the budget presented to the Dáil by the Minister.  Was the central goal of his proposals to tackle these interlinked problems head on?  It gives me no pleasure to say that whatever his main objective, it was a long way from dealing with these problems.  It is only too easy for Members of the Opposition to claim this was simply an election budget, with Fine Gael attempting to consolidate its mainly upper and middle class support and Labour trying to hold on to its new constituency in the same classes.  Similarly we might feel the social policies of Democratic Left have been largely ignored by the rainbow coalition partners.  The main thrust of the budget supports such a cynical assessment.  My primary concern is not to indulge in such speculation, rather it is with the many urgent needs of the disadvantaged in our society.</P>
    <P>I am only too aware that people living in areas with high unemployment levels face an uphill struggle every day of their lives to make ends meet.  At a time of tremendous growth and opportunity in our economy it is only fair and just that such people reap the first benefits.  It is regrettable one has to search this budget to a point of desperation to identify isolated examples of some benefit to the most underprivileged.</P>
    <P>Even the most blinkered supporter of the Government could not find anything to celebrate in the miserable 2.5 per cent increase across a range of social welfare benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>It simply would not have been tenable for the Government to give anything less.  In the current atmosphere of economic strength an increase of about 3.5 per cent would have been both financially possible and socially beneficial.  The unspoken message from this budget is that people trapped in lives of poverty dare not hope the State will focus its substantial resources on the task of significantly improving their financial well-being.</P>
      <P>It would be dishonest to say the budget does not have some positive features.The mild reforms of the PAYE and PRSI systems are to be welcomed. While these should improve to some degree the climate for job creation one gets the impression the system is being tinkered with rather than developed in an integrated manner.</P>
      <P>Similarly a number of smaller items in the budget are worth while, including the provision of a free colour television licence for all social welfare pensioners currently receiving an electricity allowance; free cross-Border journeys for all pensioners north and south of the Border and improvements in back to school payments.</P>
      <P>Two of the main provisions are the increase in £7 per month in the children's allowance and the decision to abolish third level education fees.  I welcome the children's allowance increase since many families are dependent on benefit to supplement their basic income.  The fact that such payments are made directly to the mother is desirable; in certain cases it may constitute the only direct income of the woman in the family.  The benefit of the £7 increase will be especially evident in large families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I also see the benefit of free third level education in an ideal world, has the Minister for Education spent sufficient time establishing a sense of priority in her plans for developing education?It is highly unlikely that abolishing these fees will have a significant impact on the underprivileged since their participation rates are so low.  The main educational problem regarding <Col N="1191" /> children from underprivileged homes is the tendency to finish their formal education prematurely.  Substantial extra investment is therefore urgently required in first and second level education working class areas.  Similarly, exciting projects such as the home/school liaison programme must receive financial support suitable to their needs.</P>
    <P>With increased interest in third level education this sector is in need of capital expenditure to cater adequately for swollen student numbers and to allow for further expansion.  Simply abolishing fees does not address the twin problems of low participation among the poorest sectors of society and adequate capital resources within third level institutions.</P>
    <P>My overall concern about the budget is that it seems to have largely failed to achieve the necessary balance between the varying needs of different sectors of our society.  Similarly, the opportunity to use the positive state of the nation's finances to take a bold step towards a greater degree of equality has not been taken.  One has to ask why.</P>
    <P>One might have expected the presence of the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, in the Department of Social Welfare would have ensured improvements in living standards for poorer families.  He and his party have always highlighted the needs of the underprivileged in their public comments and policies.  The simple truth is the budget shows little or no evidence that he or his party managed to ensure a meaningful input into the formulation and implementation of Government policy.  Rather it shows that while Fine Gael may have reluctantly conceded to allowing Democratic Left into the rainbow coalition it does not intend to allow that party anything approaching a non-trivial role in that Government.  Perhaps this is not so surprising since a few years ago Fine Gael was not willing at any cost to enter into discussion with Democratic Left for the purpose of forming a coalition Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> The implication of the treatment of Democratic Left within this Government is quite serious.  It suggests that parties whose policies are far apart within the political spectrum cannot work meaningfully together in Government.While for obvious reasons there might be attempts to paper over the many cracks in the Coalition, ultimately the total lack of inter-party cohesion must come into public view.  If this budget is an indication of what lies ahead in the term of the rainbow Government, one cannot be optimistic about its survival in the short term.</P>
    <P>I welcome many of the social welfare provisions and will articulate my views on them when the Social Welfare Bill is introduced in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing their time with me.  First, I congratulate my constituency colleague, Deputy Quinn, on being the first Labour Party Member for Finance to introduce a budget.  However, what should have been a proud occasion for him and his party turned into a nightmare.  The occasion was badly handled and showed a complete lack of cohesion and team spirit in the Government with information leaks that were unsurpassed by any previous Government in the history of the State.  That culminated in the unfortunate resignation of Deputy Hogan who took the rap for other Ministers who had leaked far more detailed information.  However, they are happy to see his head roll.  If that is openness, transparency and accountability it is certainly not what many people would believe to be an honest way to conduct one's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome many provisions in the budget, especially the tax cuts for lower paid workers.  That policy was started by the previous Government and I hope will continue in future.  There was a trap in the system previously and it had to be tackled.  I wish to refer to a number of specific provisions.  I welcome rent relief for persons in private rented accommodation in so far as it will be advantageous to the Exchequer in the <Col N="1193" /> long term.  It will bring many landlords into the tax net and that is welcome.  In my constituency &mdash; which I share with the Minister for Finance &mdash; there is a huge amount of rented accommodation. However, while this relief will be a boost for the Exchequer in the long term and for tenants in the short-term, I believe landlords will try to recoup their money by increasing rents.  I do not wish to be negative about this measure &mdash; I welcome it &mdash; but perhaps we could devise a method to ensure that rents do not increase as a result of this relief.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reduction in residential property tax.  However, as I said last year when my party was in Government, I cannot understand why the Government has continued this tax.  It is extremely unpopular and unfair and should be abolished.  Despite the changes in the budget the reduction in tax for many people is not great.  I look forward to the document on local taxation.The residential property tax is a poor method of taxing people &mdash; not only is it unpopular, but yields little revenue for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Capital gains tax is an issue I have raised since I was a Member of the Seanad.  It is important for Irish companies, large and small, to attract investment from individuals.  I cannot understand why somebody who invests in an Irish company for periods of over five and ten years &mdash; investment that is badly needed by the economy &mdash; is taxed at the same rate as somebody who speculates on the Stock Exchange each week.  There should be a lesser tax burden on somebody who has done what we have always encouraged them to do, to invest long term in Irish companies. Such people should benefit from a reduction in capital gains tax rather than have to pay exactly the same rate levied on somebody who trades in shares.  I said the same when we were in Government and will continue to say it.  The current situation is unfair and is not of great benefit to the Exchequer.  We should encourage people to invest long term in Irish shares.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1194" /> I welcome the pilot renewal scheme for traditional seaside resorts.  This scheme was implemented in England and was extremely successful.  Many seaside resorts around the country have suffered as a result of package holidays to sunnier countries.  The scheme is imaginative and I do not doubt that it will be successful here.  In the long term it will benefit the areas, many of them rural, where it is applied.  I also welcome tax relief on donations to Third World charities.  That is also an imaginative provision and continues a process initiated by Fianna Fáil when it was in Government with the Labour Party.  It is a good means of encouraging people to donate to such charities and demonstrates a commitment on behalf of the Government and the country towards the Third World.  In addition, volunteers of agencies for personal service overseas will be permitted to take into consideration time spent on voluntary work abroad for pension purposes.  Many volunteers have sought such a provision and I welcome its inclusion in the budget.</P>
    <P>However, I must refer to negative aspects of this budget and I am not doing so for political purposes.  Like others, I welcome the increase in child income support.  It is a good proposal. However, Democratic Left has lectured us for years and years about the poor of this country and what it would do for them if it were in Government.  What does that party do when it is in Government and has a Minister for Social Welfare?It grants the lowest percentage increase &mdash; 2.5 per cent &mdash; in social welfare for 30 years.  Since 1987 Fianna Fáil-led Governments have never given less than 3 per cent and more often have given 4 or 5 per cent.  An old age pensioner will get £1.80 extra per week this year compared to an increase of £2.10 last year.  Over 240 pensioners will not benefit from child benefit increases. Deputy De Rossa said, following the 1994 budget increases of 3 per cent, &ldquo;the miserable level of most of the increases tell their own story&rdquo;.  I would have expected him, as Minister for Social <Col N="1195" /> Welfare, to make imaginative proposals within his Department and to propose much larger increases.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Rabbitte attack Fianna Fáil last week because we had criticised him for the social welfare increases.  I can understand why Deputy Rabbitte attacked us &mdash; he has to attack because his party has been humiliated in Government on this issue.  I do not know how that party can face the electorate.Its members should be on their hands and knees each night praying that there will not be an election in the next year because the people will give them an answer for all the promises they have made over the years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte accused Fianna Fáil of reckless behaviour and said that we had caused all this country's financial problems.  When we were in Government from 1987 to 1989 we had to make extremely difficult decisions regarding finances.  Members of The Workers' Party, as Democratic Left was known then, opposed us at every single opportunity.They were the most opportunistic bunch of people who ever walked the political map of this country; they opposed everything.  Now Deputy Rabbitte has the gall to stand in this House and tell Fianna Fáil that we are reckless, it is an outrage.  The results of the reckless behaviour of his party are now coming home to roost.  It will be remembered when he goes before the people that he and his party misled the people about the budget.  Pointing the finger at this side of the House will not work.  In the next budget we will ensure proper increases in social welfare above the rate of inflation.  We will also ensure that the people who got this miserable increase will not be let down in the next budget, because we will embarrass Democratic Left into introducing appropriate increases.  We will ensure that it sticks to the commitment it gave to people since the party was founded, and before that, when it was part of The Workers' Party.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> I cannot understand how Democratic Left or how a Government which includes Democratic Left and the Labour Party allowed this to happen.  Perhaps it was an oversight on their part because with a bit of imagination extra revenue could easily have been generated by not cutting the tax on the banks. Whether they fell asleep at the negotiating table or whatever is difficult to establish.  However, they have let people down, and we will ensure over the next year that at the time of the next budget they will not let people down.  We will highlight this at every possible opportunity, we will exert huge pressure on them to ensure that they do not let people down &mdash; the people to whom they promised so much over the years. From the viewpoint of Democratic Left this is a poor budget, and is getting a bad response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to finally have the opportunity to speak on the budget. I am aware that other historic developments are ongoing today which I hope will bring significant benefit to the people of this island and the peoples of these islands generally.  However, the daily, normal course of politics requires us to focus also on our domestic situation and on the budget which my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, introduced some time ago.</P>
      <P>The annual budget is the fiscal framework adopted by the Government to give effect to its economic and social policies.  The focus of this budget is specific, it is a budget for work.  In this respect, and with regard to Deputy Ryan's comments on the bank changes, money was not foregone in the budget. The Minister abolished the levy, which was, in any event, set against capital gains taxes.  These would have been foregone in the capital gains net, so what is not collected in levies would be collected in capital gains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thrust of the budget is towards jobs and job creation.  Its effects will bring results in the short term.  It will <Col N="1197" /> reward people at work, especially those with modest incomes, and existing employment will be more secure, because of it.  Non-agricultural employment will expand significantly and unemployment should decline.  If any Government has a duty and a responsibility, it is to tackle the scourge of unemployment, and that has been the message repeatedly given to parties in this House by the electorate.</P>
    <P>In the longer term, the budget will assist in creating the conditions for real and sustainable employment for people who are not currently at work.  The difficulties we face in securing employment for all our people are acute but not insurmountable.  We must bring all our energies to bear on implementing a coherent medium-term strategy designed to boost sustainable employment.This budget &mdash; through its taxation and related measures, its promotion of enterprise and competitiveness, and its prudent management of the public finances &mdash; is an integral part of that strategy.  It will assist in generating the increased employment so vital for the long term well-being of our economy and our society.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, we must care for the unemployed and the other disadvantaged groups in our community.  The budget does this through a range of measures: protecting the spending power of social welfare recipients; introducing a basic income for children and improving the carer's allowance scheme; reforming the deserted wife's benefit and lone parent's allowance and making available additional resources for voluntary and community organisations. Other actions by the Government take place outside the immediate parameters of the Budget Statement.  For example, the Government's commitment to 7,000 social housing starts this year &mdash; which I, as Minister for the Environment, will oversee &mdash; is given substance in the spending Estimates and is further evidence of our dedication to the principle of social solidarity.  I will return to this later.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1198" /> A central component of our overall economic strategy is to reward those at work.  It is not our intention to create a windfall for all of those in employment but rather to target those on low or modest incomes.  We have done this by providing an allowance of £50 per week for full rate PRSI contributors, by widening the standard rate income tax band and by increasing the tax threshold.</P>
    <P>The effects of these changes are twofold.The burden on individual taxpayers has been eased and we have maintained the shift in the relative burden of taxation away from earned income so that our tax system will not be a disincentive to work.  There is a growing consensus that the burden of taxation should fall less heavily on earned income, that reliefs should be focused on low to middle income earners and that the tax wedge should be tackled by the Government.  The Government has taken steps in this budget to address these concerns.  In doing so, some of the preconditions for expanding economic growth and employment are provided for.</P>
    <P>I will devote the remainder of my remarks to the programmes for which, as Minister for the Environment, I am responsible.</P>
    <P>I have spoken already of the importance the Government attaches to the creation of employment; this is evident in our approach to the construction industry for which I have a special responsibility.  In this respect, I know the Deputy on the other side of the House, who attended the south east construction industry dinner in Waterford recently, will be aware that I have taken responsibility to nurture and develop the construction industry in my term as Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>The industry is a major segment of our economy.  Building output is now approximately £4 billion per annum, or 11 per cent of gross domestic product, and the industry is especially important in the context of expanding employment opportunities.  In the last few weeks I have had the opportunity to speak to <Col N="1199" /> construction developers and they are all approaching 1995, especially in the post-budget time frame, with enthusiasm and confidence, a confidence which many of them said they have not experienced in recent years.</P>
    <P>The vitality of the construction industry is influenced principally by the prevailing economic climate.  However, the Government plays a significant role in stimulating activity in the industry through influencing private sector investment and by direct expenditure on a range of public sector projects.</P>
    <P>Through the public capital programme, we continue to make a real contribution to maintaining a strong and vibrant construction industry.  Public capital programme expenditure affecting the industry is estimated at £1.7 billion this year, an increase of £270 million, or 18 per cent on last year's out-turn.This will benefit the industry in general, help to secure jobs and, significantly, create the conditions to create additional jobs.</P>
    <P>The industry is a cornerstone of the employment market.  It gives direct employment of about 79,000 with a further 32,000 or so indirect jobs in ancillary or support services.  Put another way, 9 per cent of the work-force depend on the industry for a living.The public capital programme should sustain employment in the building industry at the high level attained last year, and jobs will increase later in the year as more and more projects come on stream.</P>
    <P>In real terms, the public capital programme affecting the construction industry has risen by almost 50 per cent since 1990, and now accounts for 37 per cent of total investment in construction, compared with 30 per cent in 1990.  I would like to see the private sector pushing ahead with projects to avoid an overdependence on the public sector to maintain growth and development in the industry.  There is no reason this should not happen in the light of the favourable economic conditions which now prevail and the variety of incentives <Col N="1200" /> which this Government has made available to the construction industry.</P>
    <P>The urban renewal programme has already stimulated private construction investment of £1.2 billion.  The new scheme, launched on 1 August 1994, is the catalyst which will enable this investment to grow and develop, albeit with a greater emphasis on residential investment, and on restoration and refurbishment of existing buildings which most people concerned with the development of our inner urban areas will applaud and support.  It is a good example of the kind of programme which assists the construction industry, while at the same time meeting important social, economic and environmental objectives.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about the need for investment in the construction industry but I also want to see an efficient industry so that the benefits of investment, much of which is from the public sector, are maximised.  The cost of any inefficiency in the construction industry is unacceptably high &mdash; each 1 per cent of inefficiency can cost the economy £40 million annually.  An improvement of 30 per cent in efficiency between now and the year 2000 would enable us to save £1.2 billion on the construction content of our national development or to invest that amount in additional projects over and above the projects already outlined. I am not suggesting that economies of this scale are necessarily feasible, but the figures illustrate the importance of making progress towards the most efficient construction industry possible, which is my objective.</P>
    <P>A fundamental study of procurement and contractual arrangements in the UK construction industry was completed last year.  I am now considering, with the construction industry council, having a strategic study of the Irish construction industry undertaken jointly with my Department.  I am well disposed to this, and I hope to develop proposals shortly to advance the matter.</P>
    <P>The total public capital programme provision for housing has increased <Col N="1201" /> from £278 million in 1994 to £358 million in the current year &mdash; up almost 30 per cent.  This very substantial increase in resources will allow for the annual target in the Programme for Government, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> of 7,000 social housing starts to be met in 1995, the Government's first year in office.  Within this total of 7,000 social housing starts, provision has been made for 3,900 local authority housing starts or acquisitions.  This represents a further increase on the already greatly expanded programme of the two previous years when 3,500 starts or acquisitions were authorised.</P>
    <P>The 1995 target of 7,000 starts also includes an expansion of voluntary housing activity and an increase in shared ownership.  Additional capital is being provided for both these purposes. Those on local authority waiting lists will see the results of the expanded social housing programmes this year. When account is taken of casual vacancies and additions to the stock by way of completions or purchases, I expect that the needs of some 9,500 households will be catered for this year.  This is in sharp contrast to the outturn of just three years ago, when only 6,000 households were accommodated.  I hope to be in a position to announce the local authority allocations in the next day or two.</P>
    <P>A sum of £18.4 million is being provided this year under the remedial works scheme, bringing the total allocated under this scheme to date to over £136 million.  This will allow local authorities to continue progress on about 70 remedial works projects around the country as well as allowing the designation for funding of a number of new projects during 1995.</P>
    <P>The allocation of £3 million for the bathrooms subprogramme will enable local authorities to continue the programme of providing bathrooms/ showers in their dwellings which still lack those facilities.  Local authorities have a legal obligation to provide such facilities in all their rented dwellings by 1 January 1998, and I am satisfied that the 1995 provision should <Col N="1202" /> enable work to continue to allow local authorities to meet this statutory deadline.</P>
    <P>A sum of £100,000 is being made available to assist local authorities in implementing selected pilot projects in the housing management area.  These projects will be aimed at securing the kind of improvements which will deliver a better service to tenants and better value for money generally.  Substantial expenditure continues to be incurred by local authorities in the management and maintenance of their housing stock, and there is a real need to maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of this large expenditure.  The new initiative will assist this.</P>
    <P>The introduction of income tax relief for rents paid by tenants in the private rented sector is a real and substantial breakthrough.  It was first promised as part of the tenants charter in the Programme for a Partnership Government, and I am delighted that this budget has delivered on that promise.</P>
    <P>This tax relief will have a number of important benefits.  It will reduce the tax disadvantage suffered by those in rented accommodation compared with persons purchasing homes.  It should also go some way towards making private rented accommodation more affordable to persons who, for whatever reason, do not intend to become owner occupiers. The tax relief will underpin demand in the private rented sector which has an important role in supplying accommodation to certain groups in the community and in providing for transitional needs and facilitating labour mobility.</P>
    <P>In tandem with the operation of rent supplementation under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme, the new tax relief system will assist in bringing the private rented sector into the legitimate economy and ensure that landlords pay their fair share of tax on profits realised, which is an aspiration we all share.  The introduction of the tax reliefs should not be seen as an assault on landlords.  Together with other measures, such as rent books and statutory minimum standards, it is one part <Col N="1203" /> of an overall package of measures for the betterment of the private rented housing sector generally.</P>
    <P>The creation of transport infrastructure networks capable of meeting our national development needs is a major focus of national and European Union investment priorities.  The case for investment in the modernisation of our national road network has consistently been endorsed by economic commentators, industrial groups and the social partners, and is central to providing the infrastructure necessary for the social and economic progress we have outlined.</P>
    <P>This year will see total State investment of £211 million in our national roads network, an 8.7 per cent increase on last year's provision of £194 million. A sum of £188 million will be invested in improving the national primary and secondary roads network, with a further £23 million being provided for the maintenance of these roads.  This investment is the second instalment of the substantial funding for road improvement provided for under the operational programme for transport.  It will enable the National Roads Authority, which has overall responsibility for the development of a safe and efficient network of national roads, to forge ahead with the ambitious development programme it has published.</P>
    <P>Notable major improvement projects for which allocations will be provided this year include the Lee Tunnel in Cork, the Northern Cross Route in Dublin and the Portlaoise by-pass. Other major projects under way are improvements on the N4 at Jamestown-Drumsna in Leitrim and Collooney in Sligo; on the N9 at Bolton Hill in Kildare; on the N2 at North Road, Finglas in Dublin; on Broomfield, Castleblaney in Monaghan; the Bishops-town end of the South Ring Road in Cork, N8; and, also in Cork, the Mulcon Valley project, N28, and Dunkettle-Carrigtwohill on the N25.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that there will be developments on both the N25 and N11 which service the south east.  In fact, some of the largest developments of road infrastructure in recent times have been on those networks.  I look forward in the immediate future to opening the most recent completed section of the N11, which will improve dramatically the road infrastructure between Dublin and the important town of Wexford.</P>

      <P>The bulk of the investment will be in the national primary roads which, although they comprise only 3 per cent of the total roads network in the State, carry 27 per cent of road traffic.  Almost £172 million is being allocated for national primary improvement projects, with an additional £12 million provided for maintenance work on this network.  The National Roads Authority intends to commence a programme to upgrade direction signage and delineation on national primary roads this year, which has been called for.  I welcome this initiative as a valuable contribution to the safety and comfort of travellers on our major roads networks.</P>
      <P>Our society has inherited an extensive network of non-national roads which, at one time, catered for the needs of twice our present population and were constructed for use by non-mechanised transport.  These roads extend to over 87,000 kilometres, or 94 per cent of the overall length of our public roads network.Our combination of low population density, allied to a relatively low level of urbanisation, makes high dependency on roads for social and economic purposes inevitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By European standards, our ratio of population to road length is small; in fact, it is half that of Belgium, Denmark and France and only one-third that of <Col N="1205" /> Italy, the Netherlands and Spain.  This presents difficulties in maintaining the network to an acceptable public standard.Other developments, such as increases in goods vehicle axle loadings and weather conditions, have further exacerbated the problems with our county roads.</P>
    <P>Against this background, I wish to make it clear that the improvement of our network of non-national roads is a priority for this Government.  Grants of almost £103 million will be provided to local authorities this year.  This is a substantial increase on the total of £75 million provided in 1993 and, while it is marginally less than the 1994 provision, it must be remembered that the amount last year was boosted by a once off allocation from the receipts of the tax amnesty.</P>

      <P>When the exceptional tax amnesty provision is taken into account, the 1995 figure is seen to be well up on the underlying 1994 figure and on the figure for the previous year.</P>
      <P>Taken with the resources which will be provided by local authorities themselves, an estimated £165 million will be spent on non-national roads in 1995. This level of investment will generate real progress in tackling the problems of poor regional and county roads.  Future strategy in relation to these roads will be set against the background of a detailed analysis of the overall situation which is currently being undertaken by my Department.  As promised by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement, I intend to prepare, in the near future, a coherent and integrated plan for the first time for bringing these roads up to an acceptable standard over the next ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reopening of cross-Border roads is an important and highly visible dividend of the peace process.  Closure orders made by the Northern Ireland authorities were applied to 113 public roads. Following the rescinding of these late <Col N="1206" /> last year, 36 roads have been fully reopened on both sides of the Border, while reinstatement works on our side have been completed on a further 32 roads.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to see the process of reopenings completed as soon as possible and intend to allocate about £1 million this year to the relevant local authorities for necessary works.  Work should be well under way, or completed on all the remaining roads, by April, with the exception of a small number where progress will be mainly dictated by developments on the erection of replacement bridges by the Northern authorities.  In the case of the only national road affected by closure, the N3 at Aghalane Bridge, I understand that the National Roads Authority has reached agreement with the Northern Ireland authority on the broad outline and financing of the works necessary to restore this link.  Last week, I had the opportunity, under the framework of the Anglo-Irish Conference, to discuss these matters directly with my Northern Ireland counterpart.  He shares my enthusiasm for bringing normality back to the road interlinks between Border counties.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> sets out a series of measures to ensure that consideration of the environment is strongly factored into Government policies and programmes.  However, the major focus of work on environmental policy over the coming year will be the preparation of a national sustainable development strategy, as indicated in the Government programme.</P>
    <P>Sustainable development strategies recognise the interrelationship between economic and social development and the natural environment, and works to maintain a balance between environmental protection and development activity.  The new stategy will guide environmental policy into the next century and will be based on national and international experience on sustainable development.  To provide a background <Col N="1207" /> and point of reference, I intend to publish shortly a report on current policy and development.</P>
    <P>There is a series of other environmental measures to which the Government is committed which time does not permit me to address on this occasion as I must devote the remainder of my remarks to the major environmental infrastructure programme with which my Department is concerned, the provision of water and sanitary services. When the Oireachtas committee on sustainable development is established, which is a mould breaking new departure by Government, I look forward to sharing my ideas and those of my Department with Members in building a new development strategy for this country, acknowledging the importance of protecting, enhancing and securing our environment.</P>
    <P>In acknowledging the importance of the water and sanitary services programme, its vital contribution to protecting and enhancing our environment, and the sustainable development of our industrial base, I am pleased to welcome the capital provision for the 1995 programme.  The provision of £106 million, including £4.5 million for group schemes, is a substantial investment in the design and construction of water and sewerage facilities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The European Union, recognising the necessity for the provision of new and and improved water and sewerage systems, has agreed an aid package of £460 million for the period to 1999.  The Cohesion Fund is, and to the end of the decade will continue to be, the main source of EU support.  Almost £75 million of our 1995 expenditure will go towards Cohesion-funded projects which will qualify for aid of 85 per cent of eligible expenditure.  Already, 47 major projects have been submitted to the EU for approval, and funding for 26 of these has been agreed.  These include schemes to remedy drinking water deficiencies or quality deficiencies in Dublin, Limerick, Tuam and Ballyjamesduff.The provision of sewerage <Col N="1208" /> works, which will replace or upgrade existing facilities, include schemes at Dublin, Ringsend and Howth, Cork, Galway, Limerick, Wexford, Clonmel, Waterford, Dundalk and Drogheda. This investment will assist in complying with EU directives, particularly the urban waste treatment and drinking water directives.</P>
    <P>The 1995 capital provision will enable the continuation of construction on already identified priority schemes, including new and improved sewerage schemes which will serve Ballinrobe, Bangor Erris, Bray, Athy, New Ross, Robertstown, Muinebheag, Greystones and Enniscorthy.  Construction work will also progress on water supply schemes at Leixlip, serving north County Dublin, Lough Mask serving the Ballinrobe-Claremorris area, south Leitrim, Ballyjamesduff, Tuam, Dún Laoghaire and Templemore.</P>
    <P>This infrastructural programme is, by its very nature, unobtrusive except where a deficiency occurs.  Although its benefits are part of everyday life, we tend to be oblivious to them unless we are directly affected by shortcomings. Nevertheless, the importance of this programme is very real to the continued protection of the environment which is largely pollution-free; to providing drinking water in compliance with very high quality standards; to upgrading the treatment levels for seweage and other water-borne wastes in line with the exacting standards of national and EU law; and lastly as a catalyst in attracting and developing employment opportunities, including tourism.</P>
    <P>The water and sanitary services programme will, in the years ahead, continue to benefit from very substantial capital investment.  Every effort will be made to extract the maximum benefit from available resources, through capital appraisal of projects, application of optimal design techniques and rigorous management of the construction phase to build schemes on time and within budget.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1209" /> No one has a monopoly of wisdom. No single budget can banish our economic problems overnight and no Government can bring about instant and universal prosperity and social justice, but we can make progress in meeting the economic and social aspirations of our people.  This year we have taken real steps towards these aspirations in a budget which rewards work, promotes enterprise, fosters social solidarity and which is deserving of the support of all Members of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the move in relation to rented accommodation but I ask the Minister to bear in mind that there are thousands of students in rented accommodation, many of whom have to put up with the worst type of accommodation.  Perhaps the Minister would discuss with his colleague the fact that students have no income on which to claim tax relief and the possibility that income tax relief should be made available to the parents or guardians involved.  It would have a double-edged effect given what is happening and our need to get people into third level education.On the other hand it would achieve the aim of getting landlords to improve their facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any objective study of the previous Community Support Framework and the Community Support Framework for 1994-99 under the transport infrastructure programme would clearly show there is a disastrous imbalance regarding the availability of funds within the south-east region.  Many independent commentators have pointed out this fact.  I cannot find the answer to it.  With regard to the Cohesion Funds specifically, I compliment the Minister on his initiative regarding the consultancy work on the development of the second river crossing in Waterford and the associated road infrastructure.  I cannot be persuaded that that project which is central to the trans-European network &mdash; to which the Cohesion Fund is specific &mdash; could not and should not be funded under the programme.  Of the major national roads that come through <Col N="1210" /> the south-east in terms of the corridors of access into Europe, three come through that junction in Waterford.  This national infrastructure which is required would have great benefits not just for Waterford and the south-east but for the whole country.</P>
    <P>I will be interested to hear the Minister's announcements in relation to the N25 and the N11, leaving aside large projects such as bridges.  The Minister is fully aware of the difficulties at Sallypark in Waterford and the work which the corporation has done in getting Bus Éireann to transfer.  Apart from building the road, which is a huge project in itself, can we please have the money for the roundabout to get the project up and running?  It is £3 million and is a matter of concern.  Originally we were to receive the full funding; later it was reduced to so much over so many years. Now it has been reduced to zero and Bus Éireann has moved out.  I ask the Minister to examine that project, which is much smaller than those to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that there was no mention in the Minister's speech of service charges or property tax.  I encourage the Minister not only to get the study group up and running but to complete its task.  The Minister knows the advantage of the driven mood now prevailing in local government and if this issue was sorted out there would be a tremendous transformation.  Local authorities should have the same status and developmental potential as their counterparts throughout the EU in regard to funding, etc.  There are many examples of this.  It is a problem that can be solved with all party agreement &mdash; perhaps I am speaking out of turn on behalf of my own party.  I am simply saying we need to examine this problem immediately and I believe it can be solved.</P>
    <P>The first question we must ask ourselves about this budget is why it has been given such a poor rating by so many independent commentators.  The range of support for the 1995 budget runs a short distance between fair and <Col N="1211" /> poor.  Did the Minister do something drastic and unexpected in his budget? Was not his budget well signalled in most areas?  Did we not generally know what to expect on budget day?  The answer is yes, we did.</P>
    <P>The real signal in the Minister's speech was a return, after 27 years of striving to create a current budget surplus or at least a nil deficit, to a current budget deficit of the order of IR£310 million.  This is a very worrying indicator of the Government's fiscal policy.  I will return to this matter later.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has chosen to use the best possible economic indicators in each fiscal area and has allowed no room for manoeuvre if less than the best case scenario is achieved. Clearly there is concern at national and international level that interest rates, inflation and economic growth may not be as favourable as in the last few years. If one or more, or a combination of these pillars, comes unstuck then the impact on Government budgetary strategy, as well as the whole commercial wellbeing of Ireland incorporated could be very serious.  The hard work and effort since 1987, which has seen a 360 degree turn in the fortunes of the Irish economy, could well be undermined.</P>
    <P>The position of the Irish pound against sterling is this week moving towards breaking parity.  The consequences of a serious difference between the Irish pound and sterling are all too clear.  I use this to give one example of what is lacking.  Ireland has a very open economy, still exporting between 50 per cent and 60 per cent of our goods to Great Britain.  The effect of a serious move in the exchange rate between our pound and the pound sterling would have serious consequences for Irish exporters.  On the last occasion when this occurred the State and the EU had to come to the rescue, providing many millions of pounds to help maintain jobs in many of our export-oriented companies.  The Minister for Finance seems to have ignored this possibility, even though it has been well <Col N="1212" /> signalled over the last number of weeks. Clearly this is another issue where he should have allowed himself room to manoeuvre.  All we have to do it look at the position of the Irish pound yesterday to see the nervousness of many of our exporters aiming at the UK market. There are serious doubts about the rainbow Government and its ability to deliver.  This is causing a serious lack of confidence which, if not corrected, will in itself produce negative effects in the areas I have outlined.</P>
    <P>The lack of authority by the Taoiseach and the independence being displayed by each of the three parties in Government to promote its own political agendas to the detriment of a coherent Government policy is, after two months, causing instability within the Government.  This instability and lack of confidence have the capacity for a serious knock-on effect into the markets.If not arrested by the Government showing its authority and control, the results could be very damaging.</P>
    <P>The Minister's decision to return to a current budget deficit was a serious error of judgment.  What has so shocked the electorate is that the Minister had for the first time the greatest opportunity to make serious inroads into real tax reform and at the same time continue to keep downward pressure on public expenditure.  The fact that he has done neither in real terms, and is once again borrowing money for day to day Government expenditure, is at best confusing and at worst incompetent.</P>
    <P>The Minister has put party ideology ahead of economic sense.  The decision to take this road, in a year when he was in his strongest budgetary position, is causing alarm.  The Minister's potential room for manoeuvre in future budgets has been seriously limited.  As a result of his decisions, the Minister will not be in as good a position in January 1996. The question must then be asked: will an increase in public expenditure, combined with minimal tax changes, be the way forward for this Government?  It is reasonable to assume that is the direction the Government will take.  This <Col N="1213" /> course of action would be hugely detrimental to the continuing development of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>For some years there has been much discussion on simplifying our taxation system, apart altogether from reforming it.  I have sympathy with the Minister on this issue.  I can understand why he has targeted new PRSI exemptions, introduced a £50 per week allowance for those paying full PRSI and raised the ceiling from £9,000 to £12,000 for the 9 per cent PRSI rate.  The targeting of tax breaks for income groups and maximising their benefits has much to commend it, but I have a healthy scepticism on whether in real terms, this creates more employment or sustains more people at work.  I am sure that it has made our taxation system more complicated and expensive to administer and has made it more difficult for employers and employees to be sure of what category they fall into.</P>
    <P>The myriad of <i>culs-de-sac</i> for special tax allowances is not the way to reform and develop a simplified taxation system.PRSI rates, together with employment and training levies and the health levy, on top of our standard rate of tax, are the greatest enemies to creating and sustaining new employment.  While it was necessary in recent years to target in the way we have done, we have probably reached the point where a broader approach needs to be taken to taxation.</P>
    <P>The Minister's approach to personal taxation has been a total failure in this budget.  The greatest opportunity in decades for substantial reform of personal taxation was presented to the Minister but he failed to seize it.  He should have adopted an approach to a sustained reduction in overall levels of PRSI and a reduction in the standard and higher rates of personal taxation. That would be a better approach in the medium to long term to developing a more manageable and equitable taxation system.</P>
    <P>The tax wedge cannot be removed by simply moving the goal posts.  In effect all the Minister is doing is changing the numbers at which the tax wedge is most <Col N="1214" /> apparent.  Workers earning just under £12,000 a year, when increased productivity provides the opportunity for overtime, will be slow to push their basic rate over the £12,000 income levels for fear of increased tax liabilities. This will totally remove the gains made by sustaining income below a certain level.  There is an anomaly in this regard in that a company employing people at £13,000 a year will be aware at the start of the year that the full 12 per cent rate of PRSI will be payable but a company employing people at £11,500 a year which backloads increases towards the end of that year will not be liable for the higher rate of taxation on income already taxed it will be charged the full rate only on income over £12,000.  This should be considered by the Minister. Perhaps the introduction of marginal relief would serve to alleviate that problem.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on increasing the annual limit of relief for approved profit-sharing schemes from £2,000 to £10,000.  I encourage all employees to participate in such schemes.  There are many changes on the horizon for our semi-State companies and most if not all of them will be restructured in the coming years.  I am anxious to ensure that in such restructuring employees should have a vested interest in the company and its performances by participating in meaningful profit sharing and share ownership schemes.  Given the rate of change in recent years, which will continue in the immediate future, whereby employees have become involved in substantial profit-sharing or share ownership schemes, it is likely there will be greater involvement by the work-force in ensuring the well being of the company in the long term.  Management in all companies should promote such schemes.  The loyalty of workers and staff within companies, particularly in times of difficulty, is an essential ingredient in overcoming adversity. Where employees have more of an interest than simply drawing their weekly income, they have a greater <Col N="1215" /> drive to ensure the company's successful future.</P>
    <P>The inequity in the residential property tax has been somewhat addressed by the budget, but this tax should have been abolished.  I encourage the Government to consider the whole area of service charges and property tax.  I sincerely hope the study of local government financing will not be a long drawn-out affair and that there will be a speedy conclusion with new directions.  In regard to the £150 tax allowance for service charges to local authorities, will that allowance apply where private contractors are employed to carry out work on behalf of local authorities &mdash; for example, in many areas private contractors operate the refuse collection service &mdash; or will it apply only where the service charge directly relates to local authorities?If it applies to one and not to the other, major difficulties will arise for local authorities in terms of the fairness of schemes operated by them.  This matter should be considered with some urgency.  Clearly the role of local government is increasing in importance and it is essential that it is put on a sound footing.  I urge the Minister to speed up this study and make its findings public.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest surprises in the budget was the way the Minister approached the whole area of corporation tax.  A 40 per cent corporation tax rate is far too high, particularly when measured against the 10 per cent manufacturing rate.  The service sector is the greatest creator of new employment. This is in keeping with international trends.  In many countries there is a breakdown of 30 to 35 per cent of job creation in the manufacturing sector and 65 to 70 per cent in the services sector.The potential in Ireland to increase employment in the services sector in the next few years is substantial and offers the Irish economy its most outstanding opportunity for employment growth. All available data, such as that from the task force on small and medium enterprises and studies commissioned <Col N="1216" /> by the National Economic and Social Forum, point to this potential.</P>
    <P>The Minister has failed to understand that the major increase in employment is in small businesses, which are usually in need of a great deal of capital, particularly in their early years.  By giving a general reduction of 2 per cent in the corporation tax rate the Minister has clearly favoured the major corporations such as banking institutions.  The 2 per cent reduction was a miscue by the Minister.  He should have substantially reduced corporation tax rates for companies below a certain profit &mdash; I am not saying what that should be, but we all have a reasonable idea.  It would have been legitimate for the Minister to adopt a tiered approach to corporation tax applicable to the services sector and eventually he could have moved to reduce the overall levels of corporation tax.  He should have adopted a targeted approach to this matter.</P>
    <P>While the tax reduction of 2 per cent will be of negligible benefit to many of the companies making a profit of between £10,000-£20,000 per year, which create these jobs, it will be of significant benefit to major institutions which make profits of between £100 million-£200 million &mdash; the figures released last week show that the AIB made a profit of more than £300 million &mdash; but will not create even one extra job; these institutions are shedding jobs as technology takes over.  There is no benefit to be gained from favouring major corporations.  The Minister compounded this problem by removing the bank levy, thereby giving a belated Christmas present to the banking institutions.I urge the Minister to rethink this decision in the Finance Bill.  I think he would be warmly applauded for adopting the approach outlined not only by me but by many independent commentators.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the new urban renewal scheme for seaside resorts is to be warmly welcomed, particularly as it <Col N="1217" /> will benefit my constituency of Waterford through the designation of Tramore.It is vital that all the areas designated under the scheme should take full advantage of the opportunities which will be available in the next few years. This scheme affords traditional seaside areas a great opportunity to catch up and develop modern tourism products which can maintain and increase their existing market and bring them into the 21st century.</P>
    <P>The Minister has shown an imaginative commitment through the introduction of a special stock relief rate of 100 per cent for young qualifying farmers.  I know this measure, which should encourage the transfer of family farms to younger farmers, will be welcomed and I hope as many young farmers as possible will avail of it.  We still need a substantial reduction in the age profile of farmers.  There are many highly qualified and able young farmers in the farming sector and organisations such as the IFA will have to adopt a more direct approach in encouraging farmers to transfer their farms to their younger sons and daughters who are well able for the challenges which will face them in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>While the maintenance of the existing level of stock relief of 25 per cent is welcome, this area has given rise to difficulties for farmers, many of whom have to pay tax on 75 per cent of paper profits.The current year assessment system causes a problem as in many cases stock is not sold within the same year, yet the profits have to be assessed for tax purposes.It is reasonable for profits to be taxed only when the sales have been completed, and I hope the Minister will look again at this issue in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The astonishing lack of commitment by the Minister to social justice in the budget has been one of the main talking points in recent weeks.  The Minister for Social Welfare clearly got his priorities wrong, the general 2.5 per cent increase in social welfare payments is derisory and falls way below what is fair or what could have been done.  This is the worst <Col N="1218" /> increase in social welfare since Fianna Fáil was returned to power in 1987.  It is difficult to understand what the Leader of Democratic Left and his Cabinet colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, were thinking of when they agreed to this increase.</P>
    <P>The Minister has clearly put much store on the increase of £7 per month in child benefit.  It is difficult not to welcome such an increase but it is a contradiction in terms of the budgetary strategy.The Government has done everything to target PRSI changes at the lower paid and to remove poverty traps and tax wedges and at the same time it displayed tremendous largesse in agreeing to a £7 increase for every child irrespective of his or her parents' income. This would be acceptable in a perfect world where the State had the necessary resources to adopt such an approach, but it does not represent an equitable redistribution of scarce resources. Clearly, there is a need to substantially increase the child benefit allowance but it should not be available to all, irrespective of income.  This increase will be of enormous benefit to less well off families but it will not make any significant difference to better off families. Increases in the children's allowance should be targeted to and heavily weighted in favour of those on lower incomes.  Children's allowance is a significant and worthwhile payment and can mean an enormous amount to mothers in the home.  However, the increase should have been more substantial and should have been targeted to those on lower incomes.  Perhaps consideration could be given to the removal, in time, of the allowance from those on very high incomes.</P>
    <P>The Minister's skewed approach to social welfare can be summed up by highlighting the magnificent increase of 10p per week in the living alone allowance, which is made available to people at a very traumatic time when they have lost a spouse and their income is halved. The Minister for Social Welfare took his eye off key issues in his brief, got totally caught up in some areas and missed the <Col N="1219" /> broader picture.  That increase sums up the attitude he has adopted.  Fianna Fáil is now the only party which not only speaks of justice and equality in our society but delivers on what it says.  The credibility of the Government and, in particular, of the Labour Party and Democratic Left, has been smashed by their treatment of the old, single unemployed and childless unemployed couples and by all those who do most work for social justice in our society.</P>
    <P>With regard to covenants, in spite of the many representations made to the Minister, the Government still does not seem to understand the position of a couple who have been separated for many years and where one or both spouses are in a new relationship. Recently, I was visited by a couple with four children who had been living together for 20 years.  As the man, whose partner does not work, cannot avail of the full married allowance he covenanted a substantial portion of his income to her, thereby making up the difference of approximately £90 per week.  This money is crucial to them in terms of looking after and educating their children.  It is astonishing that the amount he can covenant will be reduced to 5 per cent of his salary.  This is the wrong approach to adopt and the Government probably did not take the position of such people into account when it made this decision.  The position of such couples must be addressed in the Finance Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Coveney) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Coveney)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>From an Irish perspective, the principal matters considered at the December Council were the fishing quota allocations for 1995 and the Iberian Accession arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the quota allocations, an additional 6,200 tonnes of valuable whitefish stocks for Ireland over and <Col N="1221" /> above the Commission's original proposals were negotiated.  In addition, an increase of 750 tonnes in the herring quota was gained.  In overall cash terms, the increases won for Ireland at the Council were worth up to £6.6 million.</P>
    <P>The Iberian Accession issue was the most important matter considered at the Council.  I am satisfied that the agreement reached on the integration of Spain and Portugal into the Common Fisheries Policy represents a good outcome for Ireland and is in accord with the objectives set by my predecessor, Deputy David Andrews, who laid the foundations in the negotiations which I was able to complete.</P>
    <P>I supported the agreement as it addressed most of our key concerns and demands.  We must now ensure that the principles agreed will be translated into a proper legal framework which will provide for the introduction of an effective system to apply from 1 January 1996.  Thus, much hard work and difficult negotiation remain to be done.</P>
    <P>One of Ireland's key concerns relates to the Irish Box.  I am happy to say that our tough and determined approach in the negotiations helped us achieve a satisfactory outcome on this issue.</P>
    <P>The Irish fishing industry was rightly concerned about the likely adverse impact of opening of access to Spanish vessels to this sensitive area and the serious implications this would have for the existing balances and fishing activity.  It must also be remembered that the Treaty of Accession for Spain stipulated that the Irish Box must expire by 31 December 1995.</P>
    <P>The main elements of the agreement on the Irish box can be summarised as follows: continued recognition of the Irish Box as a sensitive zone; total exclusion of Spanish vessels will be Irish Sea; only 40 Spanish vessels from the entitled to fish in other areas of the Irish Box; the total number of Spanish vessels to be allowed into the Irish 200 mile control zone will continue to be limited to 93 which includes the 40 vessels mentioned above and there must be no increase in total fishing effort; new exit <Col N="1222" /> and entry reporting arrangements in and out of the Irish Box will apply in respect of vessels over 15 meters with effect from 1 January 1996 and new catch reporting arrangements to the Irish authorities will come into effect from 1 January 1998 at the latest.</P>
    <P>The Council also committed itself to the provision of additional financial support for Ireland, including for the first time operating costs, towards the heavy costs incurred by Ireland arising from its heavy surveillance commitments.</P>
    <P>These were lengthy and difficult negotiations.  I was greatly encouraged in the negotiations at the December Council by the support and advice I received from the four Irish fishing organisations and from my officials bearing in mind that I was only two days in the job.  I am confident that the agreement reached in December is a good one from an Irish point of view.  Taken together with the enhanced resources, particularly fixed wing aircraft available to the protection services, it provides for effective monitoring and control of fishing in our waters and ensures that the interests of the Irish fishing industry will continue to be protected.</P>

      <P>There must be controls, surveillance and monitoring to protect our interests.

      <P>The Deputy has raised an important question.  The principles were agreed in Brussels in December.  It is essential that the details are carefully laid down in a legal framework.  I will be extremely vigilant in this regard.  On the question of implementation of controls, in addition to the seven vessels we already possess, we will shortly take possession of two sophisticated Spanish manufactured Cessna aircraft &mdash; this is ironic &mdash; which will enable the Naval <Col N="1223" /> Service to pinpoint the position of trawlers within the Irish maritime zone and to direct ships on the surface to where they are required.  This will help us greatly.</P>

Negotiations are taking place with all parties to the agreement to bring the size of their fleets into line with their quotas.  I am most interested in the size of the Spanish fleet in this regard.  We will have to be vigilant to ensure that the Spanish fleet will not exceed its quota.  I am determined to ensure that our surveillance capability will be greatly enhanced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of the aerial surveillance is to direct the ships on the surface to the trawlers they want boarded.  The question, therefore, of identifying a trawler purely from the air and basing a prosecution on that does not arise because the trawler must be boarded anyway to determine the information on catch and so on.  I do not think it is the intention to base prosecutions entirely on aerial surveillance.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>

      <Quest>his policy on vessel licensing and decommissioning of vessels.[4109/95]</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Coveney) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Coveney)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should explain that under European Union fleet policy the capacities of member states' fishing fleets are constrained by decisions taken in the context of fleet multi annual guidance programmes.  In Ireland's case capacity targets set for the end of 1996 require that the fleet be reduced by approximately 3,000 tonnes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against this background, sea-fishing boat licensing policy is designed to maintain strict control on all proposed <Col N="1225" /> new entrants to the Irish fleet.  Licences can only be approved where the applicants undertake to remove capacity from the sea fishing boat register that is at least equal to the capacity of proposed new boats.</P>
    <P>Other licensing policy requirements include the submission by applicants of documentary evidence demonstrating that proposed new entrants to the fleet are safe and seaworthy and that no decommissioning grants have been paid in respect of the boats in any other member states.</P>
    <P>In the operational programme for fisheries, which I launched yesterday, provision has been made for the introduction of a decommissioning scheme to assist the achievement of Ireland's multi annual guidance programme fleet targets.Over the next two years it is envisaged that national and European Union funding of about £6 million will be made available for decommissioning.  The scheme will be administered by BIM.  In addition, implementation of the scheme will lead to improvements in the overall structure and age profile of the fleet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware there is great disappointment at the delay in putting into effect the decommissioning scheme which it was envisaged would be introduced late last year or early this year and is now being put back for at least another year?  I am informed there is considerable confusion and lack of transparency in the area of licensing.  Since the fleet now has a restricted capacity and with the transfer of licences between the fleet categories, we need a much more open and transparent system.  Will the Minister outline his plans to ensure that confusion is eradicated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Deputy's first question, I am hopeful the scheme will be launched within the next two to three months and that applications from the industry will be invited with immediate effect from that time. One of the reasons it has been delayed relates to queries concerning the tax <Col N="1226" /> position of payments and we are currently in discussions with the Department of Finance in that regard.  I am anxious to clear as many hurdles as possible before introducing the scheme. A final decision has not yet been taken on the grant level but it is accepted, that it will have to be pitched at a level that is likely to attract a sufficient number of applications.  I am anxious to proceed quickly with the scheme but those who wish to avail of it will require as much clarity as possible.  One of the first issues about which I heard many expressions of concern since coming into the Department was the uncertainty about licensing.  People were unsure of the rules and there was a question mark over whether people were being treated on an equal basis.  There is some evidence to suggest that in the past licensing was dealt with in a less than even-handed way.  I have asked my Department to produce a discussion document so that the Minister of State, my officials and I can examine the whole area of licensing to make it more transparent &mdash; I do not like using the word &ldquo;transparent&rdquo;.People will then be familiar with the rules and they will realise that everybody is being treated on the same basis.  I am determined to do that as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because it was very much needed in the past few months.  Obviously, when one is in power it can be a little more difficult than when one is in Opposition.  Will it be possible to transfer licences between the beam trawler multipurpose vessels and the pelagic sector?  In relation to decommissioning, will priority be given to people with older boats?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>On the second question, the Deputy's assumption is correct in that it would be primarily targeted at older boats to allow older people to retire from the fleet.  I do not quite understand the Deputy's first question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It dealt with the question of transfer of tonnage between the fleet categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been some transfer, for example, in the case of the <i>Veronica</i>.  Because the owner of the <i>Veronica</i> was unable to purchase sufficient tonnage from the pelagic sector he was permitted to buy some white fish tonnage.A number of similar cases have been negotiated by my Department.  I have sought to end that practice because I am concerned that if too much white tonnage is used in this way, there will not be sufficient white tonnage for the smaller boats to buy and sell within the white fish sector.  That practice has been suspended and I hope that answers the Deputy's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the EU funded upgrading and renewal scheme which is confined to boats up to 30 years of age, and since the Minister will accept that many boats are older than that and are likely to remain in commission, does he envisage introducing any State support for owners to at least make provision for adequate safety in the older boat fleet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look sympathetically at applications for assistance to provide safety measures for older boats likely to stay in commission, but I am not sure if I am precluded from giving such assistance.  The Deputy has raised an obvious question about boats over 30 years old, used for fishing but which are unsafe yet the owners have insufficient money to upgrade them from their own resources.  I will check the matter out and communicate with the Deputy.</P>

Has the Minister any plans to shorten the length of time it takes to deal with these claims? <Col N="1231" /> Would he agree that the appointment of a claims manager in the office of the Attorney General to deal with these claims on a commercial basis would speed up the time it takes to deal with them and would result in a saving to the economy?</P>

      <P>On the question of the average costs of claims, it would not be appropriate to disclose that information but expenditure in my Department on all civil compensation claims was £4.75 million in 1994 and a provision in this year's Estimate is £4.8 million.  It would not be correct from the Department's point of view to give out the cost per claim.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm or deny that some of these claims are from former members of the FCA, Slua Muirí, or the Irish Navy, given the artillery ranges and 303 rifles that young people would have been familiar with in the Wicklow area in that period when there was no ear protection?  Have there been claims from members other than full-time members of the Defence Forces?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of Border security as such is not separately compiled.However, the extra security costs attributable to the Northern Ireland situation in so far as the Department of Defence is concerned amounted to £143 million in 1994.  It is not possible at this stage to assess the effect of the peace process on expenditure for 1995.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister foresee a reduction in expenditure on Border patrols in view of the continuing peace process?  What criteria are used to determine the degree to which Border patrols are maintained at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>We all hope the peace will continue and that the level of involvement of the security forces and military will be substantially reduced in the years to come.  The criteria used is more an operational matter for the authorities and I would not interfere with that.  The number of people required at a specific time to produce a certain result would be a military rather than a politicial decision.  We all hope that the peace process will lead to a significant reduction in the numbers required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister serious when he says there would be no need to reduce expenditure in his Department arising from a reduction in military operations due to the peace process and a reduction in Border patrols which were at the high level of 23,000 in 1993? What is the purpose of the efficiency audit to which the Minister referred?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt very much if the Minister for Finance would agree but I too would like to be able to retain some moneys because I would have no shortage of worthwhile investments to make in plant and equipment which is necessary in the Army.  The proportion of pay to equipment in the Army is out of kilter.  It would need to be 70:30; at the moment it is 82 per cent pay, 18 per cent equipment.  It is clear we need to <Col N="1234" /> invest in equipment and it is in that context I would like to receive additional resources.

      <P>How many officers were recruited from the 1992 course?  In the Minister's consideration of holding another course, is it his intention to maintain the level of personnel in the Army officer corps?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>A class of 24 NCOs was commissioned in June 1992 following successful completion of a potential officers course.  As the Deputy will know, there is at present taking place a review of the Defence Forces, which has been well publicised, on which the Government has as yet made no decisions.  I cannot answer that question in the detailed manner sought.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Michael Ahern, I wish the Minister well in his new portfolio.  The Minister has said that he is considering another potential officers course and we all know what that means.  Would he agree it is unfortunate that he is not in a position to give us a more definitive answer?  The Minister will recall that the Gleeson committee strongly recommended these courses being held regularly.  This is important because there is no doubt that they improve morale within the Defence Forces.  Will the Minister ensure that another such course is arranged as speedily as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not planning to change that excellent concept.  This practice dates back to a scheme in 1962 when 20 NCOs participated.  There was <Col N="1239" /> not another until 1970 when 31 more were recruited.  The next were in 1975, 1979, 1981, 1986, 1991 and 1992.  The House will see that the sequence has not been interrupted by not beginning another immediately but I would have it in mind to do so within a reasonable period.  I am not thinking of abolishing such courses; they are an excellent idea. I am heartened by the support I am receiving from Cork Deputies.</P>

      <Quest>the number of officers from the Southern Command selected for overseas service in 1994; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Forty-four officers from the Southern Command served overseas in various missions during 1994, of whom 36 were actually selected for overseas service that year.</P>
      <P>To allay any fears Deputy Lynch may have that somehow the proportionality was unfavourable to the southern part of the country, the relative percentages are as follows: number actually selected in 1994, 20 per cent from the Southern Command, 17 per cent from the Eastern Command, 17 per cent from the Western Command and 19 per cent from the Curragh Command.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As usual, the Minister has been more than helpful.  I avail of this opportunity to congratulate him on his appointment and wish him well in the journey ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tabled this question because there had been allegations at the annual meeting of the officers' association in November when it appeared there was a golden circle in existence in Army Headquarters in Dublin from which officers were more likely to be selected for service abroad than from the provinces.I have an affiliation with one of the provinces, so I am glad to observe <Col N="1240" /> from the figures he has given that is not the case.  I hope that will continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I observed that comment also and was as interested in the answer as Deputy Lynch.  There would not appear to me to be any evidence of that selectivity.</P>

      <P>I would be in favour of a general proportionality between the various regions but I presume it is not possible to effect it on any precise basis, it being dependent on the number of officers and so on.  Of course, personnel from the south were always anxious to engage in service overseas and take the risk others might not.  Nonetheless I do agree with the import of the Deputy's question, that there should be approximate parity between the various divisions.</P>

      <P>As the statistical data requested is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose to circulate it in the Official Report.  The establishment figures are a notional concept and have never been attained.  The strength figures are related to the actual requirements of the Defence Forces to carry <Col N="1241" /> out their allotted tasks at home and abroad.  In that regard the Deputy will be aware that a review of the organisation and structure of the Defence Forces has been carried out by the Efficiency Audit Group &mdash; EAG &mdash; whose report which was submitted to the Department of the Taoiseach in late December 1994, has not yet been considered by the Government.</P>

    <P>Will the Minister confirm figures quoted in this morning's newspapers on a reduction in the Defence Forces?  I observed a reduction from 13,200 to 8,200, an enormous reduction in personnel numbers which would have an <Col N="1242" /> adverse effect on the structures within the Army and from the point of view of personnel having to be transferred from one region to another, irrespective of marital status and so on.  Did the Minister consult with representative bodies of the Army before the report of the Efficiency Audit Group was submitted?</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Decisions have not been taken but I should like to allay the Deputy's fears, in that there is no substance to the suggestion that the personnal numbers within the Defence Forces will be reduced under any proposal this Government would accept along the lines referred to in today's papers.  I can assure him that will not happen. While I cannot tell the Deputy what the actual numbers will be, they certainly will not be as low as those reported.  I shall be meeting both Army representative bodies later today to engage in discussions and obtain their views.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is probably the single most important issue overall.  Any required adjustment of personnel numbers &mdash; for reasons related to the question just posed &mdash; is because the average age of our Army personnel is too high. A decent retirement package needs to be devised which would be a very significant element in considering the recommendations in the Efficiency Audit Group report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness I should say my predecessor made no commitment on my behalf.  The intention is that we would take in new recruits this year.  I cannot give the precise number or exact date, but that is the intention.  It is a <Col N="1243" /> two-pronged agenda in that we must create a favourable incentive for older personnel to retire and, at the same time, take on recruits regularly, at school leaving age and so on.  Otherwise we will never attain the correct age balance.I too am committed but I cannot inform the Deputy when we shall take in such recruits or their precise number just yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister is committed but it would appear that the remainder of his colleagues sitting around the Cabinet table are not as committed as he.  We have an ageing force and the practice of stop/start recruitment is very disruptive to proper manpower planning.  Would the Minister agree that there must be a policy of regular recruitment to eliminate the &ldquo;Dad's Army&rdquo; spectre, that what we need is a highly trained, well armed, mobile force necessitating regular recruitment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can guarantee there will be recruitment this year.  I do not know how many will be recruited or when the recruitment campaign will begin, but I will have that information at an early date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended asking a similar question to that asked by Deputy Power.  There is a vast difference in the average age of troops sent overseas for peace-keeping duties and those sent to Iraq during the Desert Storm operation.  I suggest that a recruitment campaign should not be undertaken on a once-off basis, but every year to help drastically reduce the average age of our troops.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The advice we have got through the review process is in agreement with the Deputy's suggestion that we must have new recruits each year.  A recruitment campaign combined with an early retirement package for older members will help reduce the average <Col N="1244" /> age of personnel in the Defence Forces and that is what we are aiming to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore) Eamon Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1994 expenditure on fish stock assessment amounted to £1.218 million.  The provision in the Department's 1995 Estimate for fish stock assessment has been increased by 16 per cent to £1.413 million.Monitoring of the fish stock resources in the seas around Ireland is essential to ongoing fisheries management both at EU and national level.</P>
      <P>In 1994, the fish stock assessment programme concentrated on assessing the size of the different fish stocks which are subject to EU quota regulation.  In particular research work focused on mackerel, herring, cod, haddock, whiting, plaice, sole, hake, megrim, monkfish and nephrops in Irish waters.  For non-quota species, research work was concentrated on tuna, deep water species, eels and whelks.</P>
      <P>In addition to Exchequer funding of fish stock assessment research work, the Department is endeavouring to secure the greatest possible assistance from EU funding programmes to augment national expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1995 research programme for fish stocks will build on the species coverage in the 1994 programme and the existing <Col N="1245" /> stock database to inform fishery management decisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that the level of expenditure on research in this area is adequate?  Does he envisage greater expenditure, as a percentage of the total value of the catch, in the future?  Will he agree that increased expenditure is essential if we are to be properly equipped to manage and exploit our fish stocks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There are obvious Exchequer constraints on the scale of resources which can be deployed for fish stock assessment work.  As a first step the Government has strengthened the budgetary allocation for 1995 and the Department is seeking to maximise potential funding from EU sources.  I will be reviewing the stock assessment programmes prepared for 1995 to ensure work is prioritised and provides the best value for moneys expended. The commitment of resources to marine research generally is increasing.  In addition to the 16 per cent to which I referred in respect of fish stock assessment, there has been a substantial increase in the allocation to the Marine Institute this year.  In the operational programme for fisheries launched yesterday there is a provision in excess of £8 million for research.</P>

      <P>The Marine Institute is in existence and has a statutory function to promote and co-ordinate research work in the marine area.  It is not confined to research of fish stocks but also deals with marine technology, engineering and so on.  The Minister and I met with the chairperson and director of the Marine Institute recently to discuss the institute's programme.  I have had discussions also with the director of the Fisheries Research Centre and I intend to visit the centre within the next few weeks.  I plan to visit the Salmon Research Agency at the end of this week.  Given the increased commitment to expenditure on marine research, one of our concerns is to ensure we get the best value for money and have the greatest degree of co-ordination possible of the entire research effort.</P>

      <P>An amount of £8.76 million of that has been allocated to finance the activities and operations of the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards and represents an increase of almost 5 per cent over the 1994 allocation.

Exchequer matching finance will also be provided in <Col N="1247" /> respect of proposed expenditure of £1.1 million by the fisheries boards and the Foyle Fisheries Commission under the EU surveillance package.  Such expenditure will relate to patrol vessels, radio communications systems, specialised surveillance equipment and other equipment to enhance anti-poaching activities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 24 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>I intend to publish the supplement to last year's scientific sea trout working group report as part of the 1994 report which will be available within the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> The working group has been in session over recent weeks to evaluate the results of the 1994 sea trout research programme.  Its work is being completed next week and I expect to receive an agreed report from the group shortly thereafter.</P>
    <P>The working group will advise on its assessment of the results of the sea trout research effort last year.  Its report will also review, re-evaluate and update all relevant scientific papers and emerging data.  In that context, the analysis and conclusions contained in a supplement prepared last March to the group's 1993 report are also being evaluated alongside latest findings and in light of further statistical work on sea lice parameters carried out in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The supplementary report and the group's current evaluation of its data and findings will be incorporated in the 1994 report which, as I said, will be published within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>In line with agreed practice, the 1994 scientific findinngs will be forwarded for consideration by the sea trout monitoring and advisory group which was set up to ensure implementation of the practical framework for action recommended by the sea trout task force.</P>
    <P>While the importance of ongoing research on all aspects of the sea trout problem is acknowledged, the key priority continues to be implementing the practical framework for action recommended by the task force, notably to ensure the effectiveness of measures to control sea lice levels.  Ongoing results from monitoring programmes show that lice levels are being maintained at very low levels on salmon farms.  The monitoring group will continue to closely oversea these programmes and I have asked for regular progress reports from the chairman.  I acknowledge that there have been problems recently with participation on the group by fishery owners and fish farmers.I am very anxious that these are overcome and that the work can continue with the full involvement of all interests.  A consensus approach is the <Col N="1250" /> most constructive way forward in our search for solutions.</P>
    <P>For my part, I am fully committed to continuing my dialogue with fishery owners and fish farmers alike on all matters of concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister inform the House why his Department has refused, up to now, to publish the supplement to the sea trout working group report as he indicated that it has been available since March 1994?  Is it true, as reported by the &ldquo;save our sea trout&rdquo; campaigners, that this supplement showed there was some connection between the attack of sea trout by lice and the proximity of salmon farms?  The Minister will be aware that this has become a contentious issue between salmon farm promoters and sea anglers.  In view of the fact that the State promotes and fully supports the development of salmon farming &mdash; we all do and hope it can be done in a way in which no damage will be caused to other fisheries &mdash; will the Minister give some assurance to the House as to the findings contained in the supplement?  Is it now a requirement following the recommendations in that supplement that licences for salmon farms will not be given where the proposed location is within 20 kilometres of a sea trout fishery?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there were a number of difficulties as I am sure the Deputy will be aware.  There was a difference of views within the working group in relation to the methodology used in the assembly of material for that report.  The analysis and findings of the supplement have been widely disseminated, although not formally published, up to now.  I understand publication was held over pending further analytical work which was acknowledged in the <Col N="1251" /> supplementary report as being necessary and a clear review of the research findings on which it was based.  That further evaluation is nearing completion.I emphasise I am anxious for the report to be published and made available with the more recent findings. I am particularly anxious that the question of the decline in sea trout stocks is addressed.  I am also concerned about the problems on the monitoring group with regard to participation.  I hope, as a result of some recent approaches, that those difficulties may be resolved.  The general approach has to be the implementation of the recommendations contained in the task force report, chaired by Dr. Ken Whitaker.  I have asked the chairman of the monitoring group to prepare a progress report on the implementation of those recommendations.  I have met the chairman of the &ldquo;save our sea trout&rdquo; group.  During this weekend I will be meeting representatives of the salmon growers' associations and fishery and angling interests and I hope to get a more co-operative approach to dealing with the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct that there was a reference in the supplementary report to a 20 kilometre limit.  That will be considered in the context of the work being done by the group.  I expect its work to be completed next week when we will have up-to-date information.  A range of recommendations made by the task force have been implemented.  They deal with the control of lice and the general management of fish farms.  As I said earlier I asked the chairman of the monitoring committee &mdash; which is monitoring the implementation of the task force recommendations &mdash; to produce a progress report. <Col N="1252" /> It is my intention to have regular progress reports on the implementation of the task force recommendations until we are all satisfied that the problem has been adequately addressed and resolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to visit many of these areas during the coming weeks.  Is he aware of the importance to the economy of the locations of salmon farms and the valuable sea trout fisheries?  Is he aware that the development of salmon farming has resulted in employment and many other benefits to the economy and that the tourist revenue is enormous from sea trout fishing which has been affected? There is an urgent necessity to ensure a coming together of both sides.  I appeal to the Minister to take every step possible to reconcile the differences, where different views are held by both sides, and to try to find a solution whereby salmon farming can be supported and developed and brought to its maximum potential in view of the huge revenue potential to the State and the employment provided in remote areas and that the valuable trout angling&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Molloy.  A balanced approach must be taken on this issue.  Salmon farming is important economically and in terms of employment, particularly in parts of the country where there is little or no alternative employment.  I recognise that and it is my intention to support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1253" /> Equally, the fisheries interest is very important economically in those areas.  I am conscious that to some extent dogmatic positions have been adopted by both sides on this issue.  I am anxious that a commonsense approach is adopted in resolving it.  I am very keen that fish farmers and fishery owners get around the table again and I very much regretted that legal action has been threatened.  I hope the issue can be resolved in a commonsense approach.  I have had a number of meetings with various interests and I intend to avail of the Salmon Growers' Association conference in Clifden this weekend to visit farms and talk to fisheries and angling interests as well as the Western Regional Fisheries Board with a view to making progress on the issue.

      <Quest>if he supports the EC Commission's proposal to phase out the use of drift nets by community vessels by December 1997; and his views on whether this will have a serious effect on the salmon and tuna fish industry in Ireland.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 25 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Current EU regulations require that drift nets used in the fishing of tuna must not be more than 2.5 kilometres in <Col N="1254" /> length.  At the meeting of the Council of Fisheries Ministers last April, the Commission presented a proposal on drift nets which had the following elements: all drift netting, for tuna, salmon, and certain other species, to be phased out over a period of four years; during this four year period, nets of up to 2.5 km could be used, but their use would be reduced each year; boats which previously held the derogation to fish with nets up to 5 km could continue to do so, for 1994 only.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Commission indicated that funding might be made available to assist fishermen who fish with drift nets to change over to alternative methods of fishing.  The Commission's proposals created difficulties for a number of member states, including Ireland. I am particularly concerned that the phasing out of all drift netting would have very serious implications, economic and social, for Irish fishermen involved in these fisheries.</P>
    <P>At the Fisheries Council on 28 September 1994 it was agreed that the matter be referred back for scientific evaluation prior to its being further considered at Council, possibly in December 1994.  In the event, there was no substantive discussion of the issue at the December Council.  I support fully the Council's action to refer the matter for further scientific evaluation so that any future decision will be underpinned by the appropriate biological justification.</P>
    <P>I am determined to ensure in any further discussions at Council on this issue that the long term interests of the Irish fishing industry will be secured and safeguarded to the maximum extent possible.  I am satisfied that there is no immediate prospect of the Commission's proposals being adopted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very complex issue and there is little consensus on it between the various interests in the <Col N="1255" /> inland fisheries sector.  I intend to have a thorough look at the position.  I expect an internal report on the matter from my Department by the beginning of next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a constant chorus of complaint from inland fisheries that the mouths of rivers such as the Shannon have been dominated by monofilament fishing and the run of salmon is greatly curtailed.  This has an effect on the tourist industry in Limerick, Castle-connell, Killaloe and other areas along the river.  I would be grateful if the Minister would use his good offices to ensure fair play for inland fisheries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister say there is no immediate prospect of phasing out drift netting and I hope he will continue to pursue that policy.  Will a meaningful effort be made to ensure fair play in drift netting for salmon?  The areas around the south coast and east coast in particular are not getting a good run of salmon, as they are fished out by the time they reach those areas.  Something must be done about this if the livelihoods of fishermen in those regions are to be preserved. What plans has the Minister in that regard?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very complex issue.  Terms such as &ldquo;fair play&rdquo; have different meanings for different groups.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is reassuring to hear the Minister say there are implications involved in the banning of drift net fishing and I am sure he will keep that in mind in further negotiations.  Salmon <Col N="1256" /> fishing was mentioned by my colleagues. There are conflicting, if not competing interests in this area.  Many small coastal communities in the west have survived because they were able to avail of drift net fishing.  When considering drift net fishing the Minister should consider the interests of these people.</P>

The Department of the Marine, through the Central Fisheries Board who own some estuary fisheries, is netting salmon in enormous numbers which, if allowed breed could lead to a successful salmon angling tourism business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 22 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies have indicated, I visited Kilmore Quay on 10 February 1995 to see the development works at first hand and meet representatives of the local fishing community.  I was particularly impressed by the work completed to date and feel sure that the scheme, when completed, will result in an excellent harbour which will benefit primarily the fishing industry and also the leisure and tourism industry to some extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has never been any question as to the common sense of completing the works in Kilmore Quay in a single phase.  If sufficient funding were available for fishery harbour development works all projects would be completed in a single phase.  During my visit to Kilmore Quay I informed the fishermen that the Department of the Marine wishes to complete this project during 1995 and that I will be endeavouring to obtain additional Exchequer funding to provide for a berthing wall along the reconstructured breakwater and slipway <Col N="1258" /> for the lifeboat.  I am vigorously pursuing the allocation of this additional funding and I will keep the Deputies informed of the progress made in this matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to Duncannon, which I also visited on 10 February, there are two development options available. Option 1 provides for stabilising the existing pier and increasing the berthing facilities at the head of the pier and over 55 metres along its length by dredging which would cost approximately £500,000 while option 2 would cost approximately twice that amount.</P>
    <P>The funding available to my Department for fishery harbour development works in 1995 &mdash; approximately £2.38 million &mdash; is insufficient to provide for current projects, not to speak of taking on a new project such as the one at Duncannon.  In the context of the £8 million under the National Development Plan for fishery harbour works for the period to the end of 1999, I am afraid it is unlikely that works at Duncannon will proceed in the short term. As I stated, I am already actively pursuing additional Exchequer funding to complete the major development at Kilmore Quay.  I am aware of the need for additional funding for fishery harbour development generally and will be working to secure further funding, including funding for Duncannon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for visiting Duncannon and Kilmore Quay. Given that the work already completed at Kilmore Quay has provided value for money, will he insist that funding be made available to ensure that this golden opportunity is not lost and that the job is completed?  Given that jobs, which he claims are the hallmark of the Government, will be provided at Duncannon, will the Minister insist that funding is immediately made available for this harbour?  Landings by the fleet suggest that Duncannon, which has no berthing facilities, has a much lower status than Dunmore and Kilmore.</P>

      <P>As the House will be aware, earlier today in Belfast, the British Prime Minister and I together launched a Joint Framework Document. The document is a shared understanding between the British and Irish Governments and its purpose is to assist discussion and negotiation involving the Northern Ireland political parties.  Copies of the document have been circulated to all Members.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I wish to put on record my thanks and appreciation to the Tánaiste and his departmental staff who have negotiated with considerable skill, patience and tenacity to achieve this outcome.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste has shown himself in a long and patient process of negotiation of this document to be a tenacious and effective negotiator, as all in this House who have dealt with him will know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>He has also proven to be an extremely good colleague.  That combination has helped him, with the Minister for Justice and many others, to bring about today's agreement. It is also appropriate that I pay tribute to my predecessor as Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, and his advisers, without whose vision and considerable courage the peace process, of which this document is an integral part, would not have been possible.  It was entirely appropriate that there should be applause for the introduction of this document from both <Col N="1332" /> sides of this House.  All have played a good and constructive part in bringing this about.</P>
      <P>May I again emphasise what this document is?  It is a shared understanding between the two Governments to assist discussion and negotiation involving the Northern Ireland political parties.Deputies will recall that in 1992 talks involving Northern Ireland political parties came to a halt.  It was suggested then that it would be helpful if both Governments were to set out their shared view on the broad lines of a possible political accommodation.  It was felt this might give impetus and direction to the process of negotiation.</P>
      <P>In response to this suggestion from the political parties, the British and Irish Governments began a painstaking and detailed exercise which has led to the publication today of the Joint Framework Document.  The document also draws on the Downing Street Declaration of 15 December 1993.  In a sense, the publication of today's document brings together two separate but parallel exercises &mdash; the talks process and the peace process are now, formally, one process.</P>
      <P>Lasting peace and stability on this island requires that three sets of relationships be addressed: the relationship between the two communities in Northern Ireland, the relationship between both parts of this island, and the relationship between the sovereign Governments in Dublin and London.  In the documents published today, the two Governments have set out their shared view of the points that need to be met if the three relationships are to be satisfactorily accommodated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I briefly say what the Framework Document is not?  It is not a prescription for an unpalatable dose of medicine.  It is not a blueprint rigidly to be imposed on the people of Northern Ireland.  It is not a cage within which their political leaders will have their dialogue confined.  It is not an Irish nationalist agenda.  It is not a British agenda.  What is it?  It is a view, shared by two Governments, as to what might <Col N="1333" /> most usefully be done to deal with the three, fraught and difficult, sets of relationships to which I referred.</P>
    <P>It represents an assessment by the two Governments of what we think might be an agreed outcome from future talks involving the Governments and the Northern Ireland political parties.We believe we have got it right.  We are open to persuasion by anyone who believes otherwise.</P>
    <P>It is now a matter for the people of Northern Ireland, and also for the people in this part of Ireland, and in Britain to study the document, and I recommend that they do so in a constructive and calm way.  No party will regard this document as meeting all its requirements and aspirations.  The document represents balance and compromise.If its main elements become the basis for new institutions and political arrangements, I believe that they will ultimately command the widespread support necessary to ensure a fair and effective management for the three sets of relationships to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>This document is the contribution of two Governments together.  It aims at balance between aspirations that are, if put within a traditional, absolutist and territorial matrix, basically irreconcilable.However, the document does more than just attempt to balance two irreconcilable aspirations.  It is the beginning of work towards a wholly new form of expression of traditional aspirations, focusing on individuals and communities rather than on territory.  By expressing aspirations in this new way, we hope that the two otherwise irreconcilable sets of aspirations can, in fact, be reconciled.</P>
    <P>The Governments will welcome the detailed papers and contributions of political parties, especially in Northern Ireland.  We challenge them to seek the same balance; the same rethinking, and the same radical reconciliation that we have sought in our joint proposals.  Let Nationalist parties show how their proposals accommodate Unionist aspirations.Let Unionist parties show how <Col N="1334" /> their proposals accommodate Nationalist aspirations.  Let both recognise the reality of the divisions that exist and the need to bridge them creatively.  That is the challenge to both of them.  Do not just recite your own fears and aspirations. Tell us how the fear of the other community can be assuaged.  Tell us how the other community's aspirations can be given legitimate express, that is the challenge.</P>
    <P>Let me turn to the document itself. The document is founded on four guiding principles: the principle of self-determination as set out in the December 1993 Downing Street Joint Declaration; the principle that the consent of the governed is an essential ingredient for stability in any political arrangement; the principle that agreement must be pursued and established by exclusively democratic peaceful means without resort to violence or coercion; and, finally, the principle that any new political arrangements must be based on full respect for, and protection of the expression of, the rights and identities of both traditions in Ireland and, must in an even handed way, afford both communities in Northern Ireland parity of esteem, including equality of opportunity.  The document seeks to build such a framework on four main pillars: structures within Northern Ireland; North-South institutions; east-west structures and constitutional issues.</P>
    <P>The Joint Framework Document commends direct dialogue with the relevant political parties in Northern Ireland to develop new internal political structures.  The dialogue is one for the political parties in Northern Ireland. The Governments confirm that cross-community agreement is an essential requirement for the successful establishment and operation of such structures. While the principles and overall context for such structures are a recognised concern of both Governments, the structures themselves should be negotiated in direct dialogue involving the relevant political parties in Northern Ireland, who will have to operate them.  In a separate document published today, the <Col N="1335" /> British Government has unilaterally set out its ideas for structures in Northern Ireland.  Neither my predecessor nor I felt it appropriate to become involved in the detail of this document and I do not propose to comment on it.</P>
    <P>Moving then to the second pillar, the North-South institutions.  We envisage that new institutions should be created to cater adequately for present and future political, social and economic interconnections on the island of Ireland enabling representatives of the main traditions North and South to enter agreed, dynamic, new, co-operative and constructive relationships.</P>
    <P>These institutions should include a North-South body involving Heads of Departments on both sides, duly established and maintained by legislation in both sovereign Parliaments.  This body would bring together Ministers representing the Government and political heads of departments from the new democratic institutions in Northern Ireland.  Its function would be to discharge or to oversee delegated executive, harmonising or consultative functions over a range of matters.  In the first instance, the two Governments acting in agreement with the parties will designate these functions.  Subsequently, the two administrations North and South may agree to designations of further functions to be added at a later stage.</P>
    <P>It is our intention that the functions for the proposed North-South body would be designated by the two Governments in agreement with the Northern Ireland political parties.  Our approach on this, as on all other elements in the document, is based on the principle of consent.  We wish to see a North-South body which will be flexible and dynamic.  Its terms of reference, its legal status, and arrangements for its political, legal, administration and financial accountability will be established by legislation in both sovereign Parliaments, but again only following the pursuit of agreement with the participants in the Northern Ireland talks process, and only following endorsements by the <Col N="1336" /> people of both parts of Ireland voting separately in referendums on the same day.  In this process, emphasis will, of course, be placed on making sure that the arrangements are workable and useful.Everybody's views on this will be welcome.</P>
    <P>Functions which might be designated to the North-South body would fall into three main categories: consultative, harmonising and executive.  The range of functions that might be designated at the outset for executive level action would include sectors involving: a natural or physical, cross-Border or all-Ireland framework; EC programmes and initiatives; marketing and promotion activity abroad; and culture and heritage.</P>
    <P>Again I emphasise that no function whether executive, harmonising or consultative will be carried out without the agreement of the Northern Ireland representatives on the body.  I would also like to make it clear that functions will be designated only where it makes practical common sense.  I do not envisage a North-South body with an imposing headquarters.  I do not envisage thousands of civil servants working out how all the people on this island might be brought together under some uniform arrangements.  The North-South body that I envisage will consist of, say, three Ministers from this Government and three Ministers from whatever administration emerges in Northern Ireland, sitting down together from time to time and making decisions.  They will be doing this without in any way diminishing the separate traditions and aspirations of the people they represent.  The emphasis will be on practicality and workability.</P>
    <P>The third pillar in the Joint Framework Document deals with east-west structures.  Both Governments envisage a broadly based agreement which will maintain a standing Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference chaired by the designated Irish Minister and by the Secretary of State for Northern <Col N="1337" /> Ireland with a small supporting permanent secretariat.  The Inter-Governmental Conference will have as its main objective the deepening of co-operation between the two Governments, and will provide a continuing institutional expression for the Irish Government's recognised concern and role in relation to Northern Ireland.  It will provide a forum for agreement on bi-lateral matters not covered by other specific arrangements and excluding matters for which responsibility is transferred to new political institutions in Northern Ireland; consider ways of enhancing community identification with policing in Northern Ireland; review the workings of the agreement and promote, support and underwrite the fair and effective operation of all its provisions and the new arrangements established under it; monitor those provisions and where necessary provide a forum for the resolution of disputes; and provide a framework for consultation and co-ordination between both Governments and the new North-South institutions.</P>
    <P>Let me now deal with the constitutional issues, the fourth and final pillar which I referred to earlier.  The Irish and British Governments are prepared to address them as part of an overall accommodation.</P>
    <P>In the case of my Government, I am prepared to introduce and support proposals for change in the Irish Constitution to implement the commitments in this document and in the Downing Street Joint Declaration.  I will return to this point in a moment.  In the case of the British Government, their new approach for Northern Ireland, vesting the constitutional future in the people of Northern Ireland, will be enshrined in British constitutional legislation.  This will embody the principles and commitments in the Joint Declaration, and in this framework document, either by an amendment of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, or by its replacement by appropriate new legislation and appropriate new provisions entrenched by agreement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1338" /> For reasons which I explained yesterday, I do not propose at this stage to table details of proposed amendments to the Constitution.  More time is required for consultation and consideration.The detailed wording of the redrafting of the Constitution is properly a matter for the Government and the Oireachtas, not for negotiation at that level of detail with another government.What I can say is that the principles and immutable political commitments underlying the changes to our Constitution will be to remove any jurisdictional or territorial claim of legal right over the territory of Northern Ireland contrary to the will of the people of Northern Ireland; to provide that the creation of a sovereign united Ireland could therefore only occur, in circumstances where a majority of the people of Northern Ireland formally chose to be part of a united Ireland; and that the existing birthright of everyone born in either jurisdiction in Ireland to be part as of right of the Irish nation would be maintained.</P>
    <P>It is also important to say to Unionists that the document contains a recognition by both Governments of the legitimacy of whatever choice is freely exercised by a majority of the people of Northern Ireland with regard to its constitutional status, whether they prefer to continue to support the Union or to opt for a sovereign united Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the framework document, both Governments also commit themselves to finding a means in their own jurisdictions to protect specified civil, political, social and cultural rights.  Obviously, there will be widespread consultation with the relevant political parties.  There might also be a covenant enshrining a dedication to mutual respect between the two traditions to the exclusively peaceful resolution of all the differences between them.</P>
    <P>So much for the document itself and for the background developments which lead to it.  In conclusion, the problems with which this document is attempting to deal are deep rooted and of long standing.  I will not attempt an historical <Col N="1339" /> analysis nor do I think it relevant to rehearse the wrongs, the grievances, and the injustices felt on all sides.  Much pain has been inflicted, much damage has been done, much trust has been forfeited, and much sorrow has been caused.  Those of us who share the island of Ireland have certainly not been enabled to realise our full potential.  The tensions between the two communities in Northern Ireland, between the two parts of Ireland and between Britain and Ireland have diminished all of us.</P>
    <P>Traditional political structures have not provided solutions to our problems. We must find new and imaginative structures which will provide security to both nationalists and unionists.  Paper declarations can only go so far.  As long as a significant section of people feel systematically alienated from the structures of government, no one will feel secure.  Our proposals today are, I believe, balanced and should if fully implemented, provide security for everyone.  Security does not come from constitutions or statutes.  It comes from knowing that your neighbour, of a different tradition, can feel that same loyalty to the State, and can identify with it on the same terms of equality and esteem, as you do.  That is what we want for Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>As we embark on this new phase in our discussions, I am encouraged by a number of things.  I am encouraged by the excellent and positive spirit in the Anglo-Irish relationship which has made possible the launching of this Joint Framework Document.  I am encouraged that it was possible for my party and for this Government essentially to work with a document inherited from a Fianna Fáil-led Government.  I am encouraged by the cessation of violence in Northern Ireland and by the considerable discipline and skill which has been shown in maintaining that cessation on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>I welcome the way in which Sinn Féin has embraced the political process and joined with other parties in working the political institutions to which it now has <Col N="1340" /> access.  I think in particular of its role in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation where it is making its mark.  Senior figures in that party have demonstrated political courage and a sense of openness to new ideas.</P>
    <P>What should perhaps most encourage us this year, when we look back 50 years to the end of the Second World War, is that we can see that new and imaginative political institutions, the European Union in particular, made possible the maintenance of peace and gradual reconciliation between European states which had for generations engaged in war as a means of resolving disputes.</P>
    <P>I hope that a similarly imaginative and courageous approach on the part of all the political elements on this island and in Britain would achieve the same degree of trust and co-operation.  My Government and I are ready to play our part.  A successful settlement in Northern Ireland, reconciling different loyalties within the one land area, can provide an Irish and British model for resolving many similar conflicts in the emerging states of central and eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I ask only that all other parties approach the document, published in Belfast today, in a constructive and calm way.  Read it, think about it, give us your ideas, but above all, give us your commitment, your faith in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil warmly welcomes the publication of the Joint Framework Document and supports its final content.  The Framework Document is the next major step in the peace process following the Downing Street Declaration, the two ceasefires and the establishment of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  During negotiations for a new agreement we wish to see it amplified in certain directions.  We intend to participate fully in the broader political debate and discussions on it. We will judge on its merits any new agreement which emerges from negotiations.We have always maintained that any new agreement, if is to be achieved or to work, must be balanced <Col N="1341" /> and even-handed and respond to the ideals and interests of both communities in the North, both traditions on this island and both countries on these islands.</P>
      <P>The talks processs which the Framework Document is designed to assist was originally based on the three strand concept laid down by Mr. Peter Brooke when Secretary of State in consultation with the Irish Government in March 1991.  It would deal with three sets of relationships, strand one within Northern Ireland, strand two between North and South and strand three between Britain and Ireland.  It was a basic principle of the talks that nothing would be agreed until everything was agreed. Northern Nationalists are not prepared to proceed with internal institutions without assurances about the institutions which will reflect the North-South relationship.  The Unionists say they are not prepared to proceed with North-South co-operation without constitutional change or the establishment of an assembly.  All three strands therefore are interlocking.  The Framework Document recognises this reality. Unionists and Nationalists will want to consider together as a balanced whole the Framework Document covering strands two and three in conjunction with the other internal framework published by the British Prime Minister this morning.</P>
      <P>The Joint Framework Document in its final form contains no important or substantial variations from the document as we left it.  The compromises reached are reasonable and sensible. We may not have achieved everything we sought but the final outcome represents all that we could reasonably expect to achieve at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two phrases I would have preferred to be stronger.  For instance, I am not sure why paragraph 17 does not read as it did in November: &ldquo;New arrangements should therefore build on [rather than just be in accordance with] commitments in the Anglo-Irish Agreement and in the Joint Declaration&rdquo;.I regret that the broad category outlining areas for executive action <Col N="1342" /> described as &ldquo;marketing and promotion activities abroad&rdquo; does not specifically include tourism, the most obvious area for joint endeavour, but its inclusion is meant to be understood.  I also regret, as I shall set out in more detail later, that the understanding on constitutional change was not tied up fully.  The Tánaiste and Sir Patrick Mayhew at their meeting in mid-November, prior to the break-up of the last Government, intended to refer the matter for final decision to the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is proud of the part it played in Government in the formulation of the Framework Document and in elaborating certain of the key concepts within it.  We have always held that the two Governments have a duty to lead the way towards a new agreement by setting out for the Northern parties and the people parameters for discussion and negotiation and by providing them with a clear focus on the key points to be addressed and resolved.</P>
    <P>The Framework Document represents the considered view of both Governments and, to a large extent, both parliaments on where agreement needs to be found if real potitical progress is to be made.  The aim and purpose of the document is to help the parties and the two Governments to arrive at a balanced overall settlement that will underpin and consolidate the peace process and can be endorsed by the people, North and South, in a new act of self-determination, the first on an all-island basis since 1918, although this time concurrently.</P>
    <P>This is more than a discussion document and less than a rigid blueprint. Both Governments have put enormous effort into identifying the main issues and realities that require resolution. These will not go away by rejecting a document; they will promptly resurface in any future discussions or negotiations.While the position papers of individual parties will add to the basis for discussion and should be regarded as welcome contributions, I doubt if any individual party would be able to <Col N="1343" /> produce such a balanced framework on its own.  The two Governments have put forward a coherent view which takes all the necessary elements into consideration in a balanced way.  The parties in Northern Ireland should be ready to address all aspects of the problem and not be tempted to try to turn their backs on the realities.  A one-sided approach will lead up a blind alley and go nowhere.  We have been up that road many times before, for example, with the 1975 Constitutional Convention and the 1982 Prior Assembly.  I therefore urge the parties to adopt a positive and constructive approach.  Let them take the Framework Document as a basis for discussion and add to or subtract from it or put their own position papers alongside it but there is no point in rejecting it.</P>
    <P>Great credit is due to the Irish negotiating team.  The Framework Document has been negotiated by the liaison group under the political direction of the Tánaiste and the Secretary of State. When Fianna Fáil was in Government a constitutional working group was established following a bilateral meeting between the then Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister at the European Council in Corfu, answering directly to the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister. It was chaired on the Irish side by the special adviser to the Taoiseach and covered sensitive sections of the Framework Document dealing with the principles of a balanced constitutional accommodation as well as the underlying specifics of change.  That work stands, in the latter case, as we left it.</P>
    <P>Great credit is due to my predecessor, Deputy Albert Reynolds, in setting out from his first day as Leader of Fianna Fáil the argument for constitutional balance as between Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution and section 75 of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920.  This was an argument that met with some scepticism at first but it was eventually accepted as a valid basis of discussion by both the British Government and all parties in this House.  He also made <Col N="1344" /> most of the running in the argument for North-South bodies with executive powers, with the main emphasis being on the mutual economic benefit for North and South.  While the Framework Document was 90 per cent complete by the time Fianna Fáil left office on 15 December and required a few weeks intensive work I compliment the Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, and the Tánaiste for bringing the document to a successful conclusion within a reasonably short period.  I also congratulate those dedicated officials who worked with him through all that time.</P>
    <P>We all appreciate the difficult political position of the British Prime Minister, John Major.  He made a tremendous commitment to the peace process and did not back off the Framework Document following the recent inevitable leaks, despite great political pressure on him from many sides to do so. Mr. Major will enjoy an honoured place in Irish history books for his part in the Downing Street Joint Declaration and the Framework Document.  Whatever specific complaints we have from time to time regarding particular actions &mdash; or lack of action &mdash; by his Government, we in Fianna Fáil acknowledge his statesmanlike contribution to peace in Ireland.  He has, on many occasions, risen conspicuously above selfish but nonetheless vital party political interests.  We hope he will maintain his Government's commitment to the basic understandings in the Framework Document and that both Governments will continue to work together in partnership to reach the urgently needed agreement that is discernible within its parameters.</P>
    <P>The just and lasting peace of which all sides have spoken will transform peoples' lives in Northern Ireland and throughout the island.  Progress, even this far, with the peace process is a real achievement for both communities.  It is not correct for Government Ministers or spokespersons to downplay what we have at the moment and describe it as a truce or a ceasefire, as if it were merely <Col N="1345" /> provisional and contingent.  The paramilitaries on both sides and the organisations associated with them made a definitive commitment last autumn to the success of the democratic process. Sinn Féin said this will hold in all circumstances and it would be wrong to suggest that a gun is being held to any-body's head in the process.</P>
    <P>The return to normality means it is safe for people to go out in the evenings, to mix more and to open the door to neighbours.  It means more economic opportunities and investment in jobs.  It promises, over time, an end to the ghetto existence, the removal of the army and army installations and the gradual phased release of prisoners.  In a personal sense, it is a promise of freedom.For the community as a whole it is an immense opportunity to transcend the fears and deeply entrenched divisions of the past.  Whatever the temporary setbacks, the disagreements, the frustrations and provocations, peace is far too valuable to contemplate going back to the dead-end and destructive violence which cost over 3,000 lives and which created such misery and hopelessness.The democratic path, however difficult, slow and frustrating it may be, offers far greater rewards to all in the long term.</P>
    <P>All the parties have a conscientious obligation to contribute to the building of peace.  That is why I hope there will be a measured reaction to the Framework Document, in deeds, if not in words.  When the people of the North listen in the coming weeks, as they probably will, to negative and warmongering language from any politician, they should ask how much the speaker has personally contributed to the peace process over the past 18 months or indeed to efforts for peace over the past 25 years, and ask if they, the citizens of Northern Ireland, care as little about peace, as the speaker seems to, even if appearances are misleading?  Are their political rights and beliefs, despite being fully democratically respected, worth pursuing to the point of resuming the <Col N="1346" /> carnage?  No side can be comprehensively dismissive of the concerns of the other community.  The benefits of peace should not be lightly ignored but the peace cannot be complete, until it is secured by a political settlement.</P>
    <P>Unionists should recognise that in the past two years the two Governments have gone a fundamentally different route from the Anglo-Irish Agreement. The Anglo-Irish Agreement imposed institutions and arrangements on the people of Northern Ireland, without their representatives being consulted or involved.  The agreement was not open to negotiation.  In contrast, in the run-up to the Joint Declaration, the leadership of the Ulster Unionist Party, as well as the Loyalist organisations, were informed by a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach in broad terms about the initiative and the views of both were, as far as possible, substantially incorporated and taken into account in the Joint Declaration. With regard to the Framework Document, it represents the joint position of both Governments, but their understanding will not be implemented unless it is incorporated by broad democratic agreement into a new settlement.  This time, there is no <i>fait accompli</i>.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, an opportunity for unionists to participate actively in shaping a new agreement.  In their absence and without their participation, there can be no new agreement, as recognised by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, John Hume and Gerry Adams, when they met in Government buildings last September.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the approach today is quite different <i>vis-à-vis</i> Republicans.  The intention of the authors of the Anglo-Irish Agreement was to isolate and defeat them.  The Joint Declaration, in contrast, was intended to encourage them in from the cold to the democratic political process, by addressing their core political ideological concerns.  The Framework Document, and the wider peace process of which it is part, is intended to provide the basis for a far better life in the most deprived urban <Col N="1347" /> areas of Northern Ireland in particular, and it will fail if it does not do that.</P>
    <P>We must look at the fundamental issues we face.  Why did the troubles arise in the first place?  It was because the previous settlement of 1920-21 allowed the nationalist community to be treated systematically like second class citizens for over 50 years and denied, in many cases, their full civil rights.  James Connolly predicted, as far back as 1913, that the majority would have scant regard for the rights of the minority left to their mercy, and that partition or exclusion was, for this reason, a proposal that should never have been made.  However, if we want to be honest, the troubles equally arose, because all demands for reform were systematically brushed aside as a challenge to the constitutional security of unionists.  The lessons that Northern nationalists have drawn from their experience is a determination to claim and enjoy equal citizenship within the North, and never again to allow themselves to be largely isolated from the rest of the people in the island of Ireland.  Unionists, on the other hand, have sought removal of the constitutional threat that they believe they face behind every reasonable nationalist demand.</P>
    <P>Twenty one years ago the principle of power-sharing was bitterly contested, when Sunningdale was brought down by the Loyalist workers' strike.  There has been a considerable evolution in unionist and Loyalist thinking on the internal Government of Northern Ireland in the intervening period.  There is a general acceptance that any institutions will have to be based on partnership rather than majority rule.  Partnership, equality and parity of esteem are the three main concepts that need to underlie any new Northern Ireland institutions.  Peace will not be founded on the restoration of any hegemony.</P>
    <P>Partnership and equality can only be built on parity of esteem.  At the New Ireland Forum, two weeks ago, a former President of the European Parliament and Dutch Minister, Piet Dankert, <Col N="1348" /> spoke of the need for a triple equality in a divided community; equal rights, equal opportunity and equal treatment. Fianna Fáil would like to see all three principles as a concrete expression of parity of esteem contained in any new agreement to be negotiated.</P>
    <P>The talks in 1991 and 1992 made considerable progress in the Strand I discussion, which is broadly reflected in the British internal framework document. Our attitude as politicians is that internal arrangements are mainly a matter for the Northern Ireland parties and the British Government, even though under Article 4 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement we have the right to put forward views and proposals.  I am sure the nationalists parties in the North will analyse the British Government document closely and ensure that adequate safeguards against a return to majority rule are provided in any new agreement. They will have our full support in that regard.</P>
    <P>While not fleshed out in the Framework Document, reform of the police, the courts and of emergency legislation are bound to become an important part of the negotiations from now on.</P>
    <P>Many unionists have difficulty recognising that the logic of equality and partnership within the North also extends to relationships outside the North.  While their right to maintain constitutional links to Britain is recognised as long as a majority so wish, there is an extreme reluctance to accept formal institutional links between North and South, even where the case for greater North-South economic co-operation is acknowledged.  This is the main reason for the so far somewhat negative attitude of some Unionists to the Framework Document.</P>
    <P>They seem to forget that North-South institutions were an integral part of the deal that established partition.  I would like to quote from the third volume of Ian Colvin's &ldquo;Life of Lord Carson&rdquo; which describes what it calls the Carsonian plan:</P>
    <P>The exclusion of the Six Counties <Col N="1349" /> ...was to be accompanied by a Council of Ireland to be composed of two delegations, consisting on the one hand, of all the Members returned to Westminster from the excluded area, and on the other, of a delegation equal in numbers from the Irish Parliament.</P>
    <P>By a majority of votes in each area, the Council would exercise legislative power affecting both areas, or extend to the Six Counties by agreement any Act of the Irish Parliament, and &ldquo;even agree to the inclusion, under the Home Rule Act, of the whole of Ireland subject to the consent of the majority of the voters in the excluded area&rdquo;.  Carson's idea was to tell the Ulstermen they could stand out, until they should see it was to their advantage to go in &ldquo;and at the same time create a general Council which would bring all Irishmen together for Ireland's good&rdquo;.  This scheme was subsequently incorporated in the Government of Ireland Act, 1920 and carried over into the Treaty, but it was stillborn.It was later revived as part of the Sunningdale arrangements.  The idea of concurrent self-determination contained in the Downing Street Declaration and the structure of the new joint body corresponds closely to his idea of how the Council of Ireland would operate.</P>
    <P>The statue of Sir Edward Carson, arms outstretched, lies before the Stormont Parliament, as the founding father of Northern Ireland.  Can we not all on this island find inspiration in one of the most constructive suggestions to emanate from the fount of 20th-century unionism?</P>
    <P>Was there not always an interest, North as well as South, in maintaining islandwide economic links?  Belfast never again enjoyed after partition its status and reputation as the industrial capital of Ireland, which it enjoyed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The question of North-South economic co-operation will not go away.  Back in 1959 the Minister for Commerce in the North, Lord Glentoran, proposed to his <Col N="1350" /> cabinet colleagues a North-South common market.  Captain O'Neill and Seán Lemass explored the possibilities of co-operation in the 1960s.  It was an important part of Sunningdale in the 1970s.  Since then, such co-operation has been conducted under the auspices of the various Anglo-Irish committees and conferences.  Indeed, the Anglo-Irish Agreement conducts such necessary co-operation, in the absence of a willingness by Unionists to participate in it. Both parts of the small island suffer from the relative lack of institutionalised co-operation and inhibitions about it on both sides.  The Governments, or better still the Dáil and the Assembly, have to give a lead.  Unionists object to the initial bodies being established under Westminster legislation.  Their own policy document <i>A Practical Approach to Problem-Solving in Northern Ireland,</i> from which the Taoiseach has quoted many times, explains why such establishment under Westminster legislation is necessary where strand two North-South institutions are long-fingered and only hinted at vaguely.</P>
    <P>If nationalists are expected to accept and participate fully in Northern Ireland institutions, then there has to be some corresponding commitment on the part of unionists to North-South institutions. Nor could it be the position that all co-operation would have to collapse if institutions in the North collapsed.  That is not the position at present, nor was it the position in 1972, when the Lough Foyle Fisheries Commission established by the Stormont Parliament and the Dáil 20 years previously continued with its work, as it does to the present. Obviously, if co-operation is to be effective, a number of sectoral bodies will need to be set up to deal with specific areas, and this is provided for in the Framework Document.</P>
    <P>Naturally, Fianna Fáil would have preferred a bolder and more definite approach by the two Governments to the subjects to be covered initially by North-South institutions, the scope and extent of which had not been fully settled at the time we left office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1351" /> I attach great importance, as I have said in recent speeches, to the European dimension.  My last action as Minister for Finance was to attend the Council which agreed the European Union support package for the peace process for Northern Ireland and the Border counties.The body will be responsible for the implementation of joint European Union programmes.  I would like to see the development of flexible arrangements for representation of joint interests by the Irish Government in the European Union, with of course the support and understanding of the British Government.  If the Germans and the French have proposals to appoint a person to each other's cabinets, then it is surely no derogation of sovereignty to attach an Irish delegate from the North on occasion to the Irish delegation, and perhaps an Irish delegate from the South on occasion to the British one, to represent specific joint interests.  This requires more discussion and more flexibility, which is very much in the character of the modern European Union.  We value our sovereignty as much as anyone else, but we are not so hung up on it that we would allow it to impede fruitful co-operation.  We have never had other than a positive attitude to the European Union.</P>
    <P>Decisions on the constitutional future of Northern Ireland are vested in the people of Northern Ireland.  But what is being discussed on foot of the Framework Document has as its core an agreement covering relations within Ireland.  It is what the Joint Declaration endorses approvingly as &ldquo;any measure of agreement on future relationships in Ireland which the people living in Ireland may themselves freely so determine without external impediment&rdquo;. The challenge posed by the Joint Declaration, which Ulster unionists in principle accepted, was &ldquo;to see peace, stability and reconciliation established by agreement among all the people who inhabit the island&rdquo;, such agreement to enhance the totality of relationships.</P>
    <P>We recognise that unionist fear of the <Col N="1352" /> nationalist majority on the island as a whole runs deep, the fear that unionists could be coerced into a united Ireland against their will.  The Downing Street Declaration has helped bring about the situation, where attempted violent coercion has ceased and where political coercion is equally repudiated.  Unionists should now accept that for the first time the threat of coercion has been removed, provided that the rights of nationalists are fully respected in future. We need no longer claim that a nationalist majority on the island represented by this State still has or should have an admittedly theoretical claim of right to exercise jurisdiction over the people of Northern Ireland, whether they consent or not.  If we are to reflect that in our Constitution, it can only be as part of what the late John Kelly called &ldquo;a new dispensation&rdquo;, which has the agreement and consent of Northern nationalists.</P>
    <P>Self-determination and consent are linked concepts that balance each other. Consent is a two way process.  The Irish people could not endorse partition in 1920, except <i>de facto</i>.  They could not be reasonably asked to accept the practice of discrimination under majority rule. Nor could the crown colony style of direct rule from Britain over the past 20 years be regarded as something the Irish people could be reasonably asked to legitimise fully.  But in the Joint Declaration, the Taoiseach confirmed that: &ldquo;in the event of an overall settlement, the Irish Government will, as part of a balanced constitutional accommodation, put forward and support proposals for change in the Irish Constitution which would fully reflect the principle of consent in Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  Fianna Fáil is prepared to support the honouring of that commitment, assuming the other conditions are satisfied.  It is our contribution to facilitating the achievement of a new agreement and to overcoming unionist fears.</P>
    <P>Acceptance of the principle of consent is not a new one.  It was implicit at least in the rejection of coercion by most of the leaders of the independence <Col N="1353" /> struggle.  As the Supreme Court pointed out in 1990, consent is consistent with Article 29 of the Constitution with its commitment to the peaceful settlement of international disputes.  The consent principle, contained in the Sunningdale Agreement, was accepted in the communiques of the Anglo-Irish framework in the 1980 summits between Charles Haughey and Margaret Thatcher, which 11 years before the three stranded talks, were built around the totality of relationships.  Consent was formally incorporated in the Anglo-Irish Agreement.As a new development, self-determination and consent were the twin pillars of the Downing Street Declaration.In other words, successive Governments and all parties in the Dáil have long ago renounced the idea that their will, representing the majority on the island, could be imposed on the people of Northern Ireland against their consent.  It is reasonable, as part of an overall settlement, that the understanding should be incorporated in our Constitution.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, the solution to our problems lies in the context of resolving three sets of relationships between our traditions, within Northern Ireland, between North and South, and between Great Britain and Ireland.</P>
    <P>The three stranded process is the agreed method of resolving these difficulties, and the guarantee of both Governments that there will be inclusive talks is adherence to the principle that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.</P>
    <P>It is in that context, and for the purpose of achieving an overall and comprehensive settlement that will underpin the peace process, that Fianna Fáil would be prepared to recommend certain balanced constitutional amendments on the clear understanding of substantive and reciprocal change in British constitutional law.</P>
    <P>The Constitution, as it stands, draws a distinction between the nation and the State.  Other partitioned countries, notably Germany, China and Korea, have adopted, as a means of easing tensions and facilitating co-operation, a <Col N="1354" /> doctrine of one nation, two States or, in our case, two jurisdictions.  The Ostpolitik of Willy Brandt was a constructive and very productive policy.</P>
    <P>Maintaining the integrity of the nation as set out in Article 2 is vital.  We were not prepared to accept a 26 county based definition of the Irish nation which would exclude Northern nationalists.Anyone born on this island or of Irish parentage is entitled to be regarded as a member of the Irish nation, regardless of borders.  Equally, we are committed to the idea of one nation, in Tone's words: &ldquo;a substituting for Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter the common name of Irishman&rdquo;.  That is our ideal, even if not everyone accepts it.</P>
    <P>When we were in Government we proposed that there should be a more pluralist definition of the nation, that explicitly recognised the existence of different identities and traditions.  At the same time, our citizenship laws do not force anyone in the North who does not want it to accept Irish citizenship. Equally, we could not ask any Nationalist, North or South, to accept the proposition that Armagh, Antrim or Down or the other counties are no longer Irish as far as we are concerned.  It is another matter to claim that the whole island is or should be under the jurisdiction of 26 county State institutions.  It is universally accepted now that the people of the North cannot be coerced into a united Ireland.  There is a good argument for saying that our Constitution should not appear to say otherwise.</P>
    <P>Northern republicans refer constantly to the &ldquo;Dublin Government&rdquo;.  Even they do not recognise it as the Irish Government of a 32 county Republic.  In Northern parlance, the Dublin Government is the Government of the Free State, not of the island as a whole.  The basis to which we strongly held in discussions with the British Government was that Article 2 defining the national territory would be maintained, with an addendum making it clear that it &ldquo;is the shared inheritance of all the people of <Col N="1355" /> Ireland in their diverse identities and traditions&rdquo;, in other words that our definition of the nation was a pluralist one.</P>
    <P>We considered it reasonable in the context of an overall settlement and a balanced constitutional accommodation to incorporate the principles of self-determination and consent into our Constitution, and to accept that a united Ireland, which remains a primary legitimate national objective, can only be brought about in a spirit of concord, reconciliation by agreement and consent, achieved concurrently.</P>
    <P>If our Constitution were no longer to contain what is described in the Framework Document as &ldquo;a territorial claim of right by the State to jurisdiction over Northern Ireland contrary to the will of a majority of its people&rdquo;, it was reasonable that we should ask the British to do the same.  Prime Minister John Major suggested at a bilateral meeting in Brussels last year that both countries should give up their territorial claims to sovereignty over Northern Ireland.  It was also agreed that constitutional law on both sides should reflect the up to date agreements and international commitments entered into by both countries.</P>
    <P>Section 75 of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920 which established partition, now reads:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, the supreme authority of the Parliament of the United Kingdom shall remain unaffected and undiminished over all persons, matters and things in Ireland and every part thereof.</P>
    <P>Given that under the 1949 Act this State had ceased to be part of &ldquo;his Majesty's Dominions&rdquo;, the survival on the Statute Book of language of supremacy over all of Ireland may sound strange, but then the Act of Union was not repealed until a few years ago.  The 1973 Northern Ireland Constitution Act, Article 1, which some claim is the more up to date legal position, contains both a territorial claim and a negative consent clause.  It states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" /> It is hereby declared that Northern Ireland remains part of Her Majesty's Dominions and of the United Kingdom, and it is hereby affirmed that in no event will Northern Ireland or any part of it cease to be part of Her Majesty's Dominions and of the United Kingdom without the consent of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland....</P>
    <P>To say that Northern Ireland will not cease to be part of her Majesty's Dominions without the consent of a majority of the people is not quite the same as a clear commitment, that it will so cease with the consent of a majority, which is nearer to the commitment in Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Joint Declaration to legislate for Irish unity, if a majority so wish.  So the 1973 Act also needs to be updated.  We had an understanding with the British negotiators that the 1920 Act would be amended or repealed and that the new legislation would be introduced making it clear that the people of Northern Ireland had the freedom, unhampered by any selfish British strategic or economic interest, to determine Northern Ireland's future constitutional status, whether to continue in the Union or concurrently with the people of the South to become eventually part of a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>In our Constitution, the Irish people, not the State, are sovereign.  Pádraig Pearse wrote a famous pamphlet entitled &ldquo;The Sovereign People&rdquo;.  As a result of balanced constitutional change, ultimate sovereignty on whether to remain in the Union or join a united Ireland will also be vested in the people of the North.  I was very glad to hear the British Prime Minister this morning say that the future of Northern Ireland was irrevocably vested in the wishes of a majority of its people.  Provided that is translated clearly and unambiguously into British constitutional law, following an overall agreement, we will have no complaint.  British territorial sovereignty over Northern Ireland will be gone.  We will have helped to place sovereignty <Col N="1357" /> unequivocally in the hands of the people.  Concurrent self-determination, by the people of Ireland, North and South, or, in other words, simultaneous referenda, will provide popular ratification of any new agreement governing relations in Ireland, establish a new dispensation and, perhaps some time in the future, bring into being a united Ireland by agreement and consent.  The decision to remain under United Kingdom jurisdiction is a matter for the people in the North to decide.</P>
    <P>In indicating or preparedness to take these steps, if they would help consolidate a new dispensation that would have the consent of all sections of the community in the North, Fianna Fáil have shown political vision and courage.  It would resolve any preceived problems created by the Supreme Court judgment in 1990 and do away with the suggestion that there is some Constitutional imperative to absorb the North into our State, albeit by peaceful means.  We wish to retain in our Constitution a strong commitment to the ideal of a united Ireland brought about by agreement and consent but that will not prevent us in the meantime from seeking an agreed Ireland between unionists and nationalists, republicans and loyalists.We will insist on retaining in our Constitution the ideals of a modern, democratic, Irish republicanism that have meaning but which threaten no one.  Irredentist claims will be gone. Fianna Fáil prospered politically down the decades by being principled yet pragmatic.  Our very foundation as a democratic party came about, because we refused to confine ourselves to and continue with a sterile doctrinaire approach that was harmful to our fledgling democracy.</P>
    <P>Constitutional change on either side may or may not be strictly necessary from a legal point of view but we can accept the argument that it is very desirable from a political point of view, as a means of building confidence.  As regards the right of the Irish Government to intervene on behalf of nationalists in the North as enshrined in the <Col N="1358" /> Anglo-Irish agreement, that right under international law derives from the extent of the nation also defined in the Constitution, not from the contested claim to jurisdiction by the State.</P>
    <P>No doubt, there are unionists who would wish us to go further but we are entitled to express our ideals in our Constitution and if it is not legitimate for nationalists to wish to see Ireland reunited or to regard every county in Ireland as Irish, then the nationalist identity itself is illegitimate.  We are prepared to recognise that this island belongs to people of diverse identities and traditions, to unionist as well as nationalist and to place no compulsion on them to live in the same State or under the same jurisdiction without the consent of a majority in the North.</P>
    <P>The Framework Document, as published, is fully consistent with the advanced state of our understanding with the British Government when we left office.  We do not believe the people need or should be asked to go further.  I want to make it absolutely clear to the House today that nobody outside, or anybody participating in the future in this debate will get it wrong &mdash; Fianna Fáil do not intend to ask them to go any further now or in the foreseeable future.</P>

      <P>I regret the failure of the Governments to reach a clear understanding about exactly where they stood.  We are ready to do all that is necessary to facilitate an overall settlement on the basis of the position we set out for the British Government, which the present Government has not altered, now reflected in the Joint Framework Document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Joint Framework Document proposes three elements as the outline of a peace settlement: the restoration of internal, political institutions in the North on a consensus basis, the establishment of North-South links in areas of mutual interest and balanced constitutional change which removes any imposed or perceived threat of coercion. <Col N="1359" /> Whether there will be a united Ireland some time in the future will be primarily for the people of Ireland, North and South, to decide freely and concurrently.The development of inclusive negotiations around these issues would give an enormous boost to confidence in the permanence and durability of the peace process.  This offers a unique opportunity, particularly for the people of Northern Ireland, to break out of the prison of history.  The political history of the point we have now reached is of some substance.  We on this side of the House congratulate the Taoiseach and his Government on that.</P>
    <P>I appeal to all to work for a happier future for our children.  Let us work to render the whole of Ireland one of the most prosperous countries worldwide.  We do not ask the Taoiseach to go one inch further than I have advocated today because, if he were to attempt to do so, the answer would be &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  We have set out our position in considerable detail and have brought it to the stage at which the British Government know exactly what it is. There it must be allowed to rest; in any constitutional proposal or change to move any further I am afraid we would be on opposing sides.  Therefore, I ask the Taoiseach not to place us in that position.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I too welcome the publication of the Joint Framework Document.  Like the Joint Downing Street Declaration and the ceasefires of the Loyalists and the IRA, it is another milestone in the development of the peace process, leading hopefully to the eventual creation of a normal political society in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As others have done, I want to pay tribute to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the entire Government and their predecessors, for the work done in bringing this document to its present stage.  As I watched the press conference this morning I was very much reminded of the <Col N="1360" /> comments of the present Taoiseach before he took up that office.  We are told by some commentators and others that the election of Deputy John Bruton as Taoiseach would put the peace process at risk.  There is very clear evidence that, in the document negotiated by him and his Government, he sought to develop the peace process and produced a fair and balanced document to which any fair-minded person would have to lend their support.  In particular I want to congratulate him because, although I recognise that much of the work was done by the previous Government, in all these things, it is the final document that matters most, the final agreement and, for that in particular, great credit is due to the Taoiseach.  He must see it as a great personal achievement.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute also to the British Prime Minister.  I wonder whether many of us, faced with similar domestic political difficulties, would have had the courage and commitment to do what he did today.  I must pay tribute to him, given that he withstood the pressure following the publication of the leak, a leak that was selective, malicious but nonetheless brought with it a lot of pressure on him internally from within his own party and on the part of those who support his party in Westminster. We should not underestimate the commitment and courage he has shown.  If in 1972 and 1973 the then British Prime Minister had shown the same courage, perhaps we might not have experienced all the difficulties, violence and strife we had in the intervening 23 years.</P>

      <P>I want also to remember the victims of violence, the heart-broken families and relatives of the 3,000 who died.  They suffered so much at the hands of the paramilitaries on both sides, particularly the Provisional IRA.  They are often forgotten; they are lonely, heart-broken people who have paid a horrific price for our failure to find a political settlement over the past <Col N="1361" /> 25 years.  I hope that today's agenda-setting document &mdash; that is what it is, it is not an agreement &mdash; will give them some hope that their sacrifice was not in vain.  Indeed they should always be at the centre of our agenda.  Lately I have observed they are sometimes forgotten; sometimes it appears that those who engaged in the violence are placed higher on the agenda than their victims. If we forget the victims, those who paid the ultimate price, in our dealings with each other, in discussions between parties, we will not find a settlement that will win the support of the community in Northern Ireland or normalise that grief-stricken community that has witnessed so much horror over the past 25 years.</P>
      <P>Lastly, I want to pay tribute to those politicians who have never supported violence, despite the wrongs done them and their communities, despite the fact that they lived in a society that did not recognise their very legitimacy yet they never saw any reason to condone or support violence.  I speak in particular of the SDLP and representatives of the Alliance Party, many of whom within the Alliance Party, come from a nationalist background, having moved away from their tradition, in that tribal sense &mdash; and I do not say that in any offensive way &mdash; but never saw any reason to condone or support violence, nor did the SDLP.  Therefore, we should pay tribute to them because it is their courage that has brought us to our present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said all that, the document is not an agreement, is not a blueprint, as it says itself.  Rather I would see it very much as an agenda-setting document, one that outlines the parameters as far as both Governments are concerned for reaching agreement between the divided peoples in Northern Ireland.  It has taken two years to be brought to this stage.  Therefore, there is a duty on everybody, particularly on elected politicians, to put some thought into that document, to personally reflect on its contents and not engage in the typical knee-jerk reaction we observe so often <Col N="1362" /> when dealing with Northern Ireland.  I and my party over the years have gone out of our way to understand the Unionist community, to ensure that their fears are taken on board, that their legitimacy and aspirations are respected and to see the other person's point of view.  For many years we sought to have contacts with unionist politicians and for that reason, I was very disappointed &mdash; I do not say this lightly &mdash; at the negative, quick, knee-jerk response today which is very depressing and disappointing.</P>
    <P>For example, Dr. Ian Paisley said the Joint Framework Document was a declaration of war on Northern Ireland.  Mr. Ken Magennis, a very reasonable, fair-minded person, well respected North and South, said it did not contain one single, solitary grain of comfort for Unionists; I will deal with that later.  Mr. David Trimble stormed out of a television programme; I think there were responses on the part of other unionist politicians that were equally depressing. I understand the fears and concerns of the unionist community, fear of the unknown, change makes us all fearful, but they have great reassurance in this document.  Their greatest reassurance is their sheer numbers, nothing can happen without their agreement; they are in a majority and should use their power and political clout to set the agenda, to be part of the process, and not stand back from it and simply take a negative approach as, unfortunately, they have done to date.</P>
    <P>In particular I contrast their response with that of Mr. Gary McMichael of the Ulster Democratic Party.  It is extraordinary that those who came from a greater extreme, who condoned and engaged in violence, should be far more positive in their response to the Joint Framework Document than many of the moderates on the unionist side.  Mr. McMichael welcomed the document, saying that he saw it as a basis for dialogue.I agree with him.  I urge other unionist representatives, particularly the unionist people, many of whom are concerned that we should reach an agreement that is workable and fair, many of <Col N="1363" /> whom are frightened and fearful &mdash; and I understand that &mdash; to think again, to come in, be part of the process and not simply keep saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;, because that is not a basis for any settlement on this island.</P>
    <P>I believe the Joint Framework Document is fair and balanced, for a number of reasons, particularly as far as the unionists are concerned, and I want to talk about them first, because many may feel there is a lot more for nationalists in this document than for unionists though that is understandable because nationalists have a lot of catching up to do.</P>
    <P>I want to address what is in it for the unionists.  The Irish Government, on behalf of the Irish people, gives for the first time in explicit terms a commitment to change our Constitution, to take out the claim of jurisdiction over Northern Ireland and replace it with the aspiration to Irish unity which is what most people in the Republic want.  That is something unionists have been offended by for many years.  They have sought that change and now there is a strong commitment to give them that change.  That is welcome.  There is an explicit acceptance that there can be no change in the status of Northern Ireland unless that is the consent of the majority in Northern Ireland and unionists make up the majority there.  There is a commitment that nothing can happen unless separate referenda are put to the people North and South.  That gives great assurance to the unionist community.</P>
    <P>The document is fair and balanced. Paragraph 18 states:</P>
    <P>Both Governments recognise that ...at present a substantial minority of its Northern Ireland's people wish for a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>It also states:</P>
    <P>...they acknowledge that the option of a sovereign united Ireland does not command the consent of the unionist tradition, nor does the existing status of Northern Ireland command the consent of the nationalist <Col N="1364" /> tradition.  Against this background, they [both Governments] acknowledge the need for new arrangements and structures &mdash; to reflect the reality of diverse aspirations, to reconcile as fully as possible the rights of both traditions, and to promote co-operation between them, so as to foster the process of developing agreement and consensus between all the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>For unionists who have feared for their position within the United Kingdom and who have withstood the appalling violence of the IRA against their community for the past 25 years there are significant and fundamental guarantees to build on the current peace process &mdash; guarantees in relation to the constitutional status, to no change without a referendum and to changes in the Republic's Constitution.  I would like the unionists to see those guarantees as positive.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal in this document for the nationalist community, but they have a lot of catching up to do.  There is an explicit statement by the British Government that it recognises the full and equal legitimacy of nationalist and unionist communities within Northern Ireland.  Paragraph 24 of the document reiterates that this will be given recognition through the powerful new North-South institutions.  The agreement to establish North-South bodies is the greatest signal to the Nationalist community that its identity, its aspiration is being recognised and being given legitimacy.They must be seen as parallel bodies to the maintenance of the union. Through the maintenance of the union, flags and emblems, representatives at Westminster and the administration at Stormont unionists have powerful daily reminders of their unionism.  They can see in all of that the legitimacy of their unionism.  Nationalists are entitled to recognition of their nationalism.  I welcome the strong commitments given to the powerful North-South bodies. Nationalists will see that as the first recognition that their nationalism is <Col N="1365" /> being legitimised.  I welcome in particular the duty of service required in the Framework Document and also the fallback position both Governments have, as outlined in paragraph 24 which states:</P>
    <P>Both Governments consider that new institutions should be created to cater adequately for present and future political, social and economic inter-connections on the island....</P>
    <P>Paragraph 25 stated:</P>
    <P>Both Governments agree that these institutions should include a North/South body involving Heads of Departments on both sides and duly established and maintained by legislation in both sovereign Parliaments.</P>
    <P>In the event that devolved institutions in Northern Ireland cease to operate and direct rule from Westminster is reintroduced, the British Government agrees that other arrangements will be made to implement the commitment to promote co-operation at all levels between the people North and South representing both traditions in Ireland, as agreed by the two Governments in the Joint Declaration.  I am delighted that fallback position is in the document because there are fears among the nationalist community that if the majority community wish in any sense to boycott or veto North-South institutions in effect they do not have a fallback position.</P>
    <P>There is a commitment by the British Government to change the Government of Ireland Act or to introduce other legislation to acknowledge its neutrality in respect of whether Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom or opts for a united Ireland, on condition that the greater number of people in Northern Ireland will make that decision.  I welcome that commitment and those in relation to our Constitution.</P>
    <P>Unionists must not see the Framework Document as a sell-out to nationalists, they must see it as for the first time giving Nationalists the opportunity to have what Unionists have had <Col N="1366" /> for so long.  They must see that if Northern Ireland is to survive and prosper they must reconcile the nationalist minority to the state there.  Since the creation of Northern Ireland following partition unionists have treated nationalists as the enemy within.  Was it any wonder that nationalist alienation from the Northern Ireland state grew apace?  No attempt to win them over was made during that time.</P>
    <P>If it appears that Nationalists have got more from the document than Unionists, it is because the Nationalists have so much catching up to do.  The union link has been maintained, there is a British administration in Stormont, there are seats at Westminster in the British Parliament and the emblems of unionism is represented most strongly by the British flag.  Those are powerful emblems and signs of unionism and the legitimacy of the Unionist community. Compared to them Nationalists have had very little and if they see great hope from the publication of this document, they are entitled to see that.  The prize of reaching agreement on this island between the two divided communities is not simply a prize for Nationalists. There can be no agreement unless those two communities resolve their differences.The capacity exists in the Framework Document to bring about an agreement.  We must reconcile extreme unionism across the spectrum with extreme republicianism.  I believe the document provides the capacity to do that if people are willing to allow that to happen.  We need to transform Northern Ireland society, to normalise it and to have in Northern Ireland a society with which everybody can identify.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the Framework Document in one respect.  A commitment to a charter or a covenant is not as strong nor as powerful as a commitment of a bill of rights.  In my view we need a constitution for Northern Ireland that recognises the legitimacy of both traditions, that outlines personal and communal rights and that will be adopted by the people and only changed <Col N="1367" /> by them.  A constitution would give permanency to those rights that cannot be secured in any other way.  I am disappointed that there is not a stronger commitment, even to a bill of rights, in the Framework Document.  That is the one area about which I express great surprise and disappointment.  I assume the reason there is not a stronger commitment is because the British Government does not recognise that in some parts of Britain people do not have those basic rights.  Northern Ireland is no ordinary part of the United Kingdom.  Those rights have been denied and we will only create a normal society if there are structures, a judiciary, a police system and so on with which both can identify and consider as theirs.  I believe a constitution encompassing a bill of rights is a powerful weapon in the process of bringing about that type of society.</P>
    <P>In addition to the political aspects of a North-South body there are obviously enormous economic benefits to be gained from such co-operation.  If we had not had the conflict of the past 25 years and the political difficulties within Northern Ireland, we would have established those bodies long ago.  What other island with a population of five million people on the periphery of Europe would operate as two distinct economic units in terms of tourism and other economic activities?  It does not make sense.</P>
    <P>Last Friday at the forum tourism representatives from the North and the South strongly made the point that promoting the entire country is good for tourism North and South.  Measures such as promoting the entire country, working together in economic areas, harmonising our fiscal policies as well as our economic policies, particularly in the area of taxation, can only benefit people North and South.  The benefits to be gained from the sum of two parts is greater than working separately as two individual units.</P>
    <P>Northern people, and particularly the northern business community, see the <Col N="1368" /> sense in working together on an all-Ireland basis so far as economics are concerned.  I say to the Unionist community that all we are seeking for their fellow citizens are the same rights they have had for so long.  Sometimes we are inclined to take for granted many of the things we have had for a considerable period.  It has to be good for both communities and for the people at large to work in co-operation with each other.  It has to be good if they have their own devolved assembly in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I welcome the publication of the British Government's internal document &mdash; the Strand I document &mdash; for a devolved government in Northern Ireland.  I have only had an opportunity to read it very quickly so that I am making very preliminary remarks.  I would prefer if the three-person collective presidency to complement the assembly was increased to five as, in the context of Northern Ireland, it would be more inclusive.  In terms of devolving powers, I am always suspicious of any representative body of politicians that do not have powers to raise revenue or do not have control over policing matters.  The power to raise revenue and control over the police would be powerful weapons for politicians to give them a sense of identity and commitment to the state in Northern Ireland.  It would be a false assembly &mdash; a little like some of our local authorities &mdash; if it did not have those powers.  I would be surprised if politicians did not want to have those powers.  They cannot continue to look to the United Kingdom to underwrite them in these areas and I hope we can move to a position where those powers will be devolved.</P>
    <P>When we speak about Northern Ireland, the conflict there, the abnormal society, the real political divide where a substantial minority of the people there feel alienated from the State and have felt alienated for some considerable time, many who do not understand the problem think the solution is simple. The problem of Northern Ireland is not just one of identity as represented by unionism or nationalism.  Unionism and <Col N="1369" /> nationalism are legitimate aspirations but they are incompatible.  We need structures that can accommodate both. I believe we can find those structures but it will be extremely difficult because it is not merely two different traditions and identities.  They play different games, sing different songs, live in different areas, go to different schools and worship in different churches.  It is an endemic, difficult problem.  We have the capacity, if we really want to transform Northern Ireland, to create the kind of structures that can accommodate both traditions.  What is required is good will, courage and commitment on the part of Governments and particularly on the part of the British Government.In the past, in the Sunningdale days when we came close a weak British Government backed off and the whole process collapsed.  If it is that fragile, it can collapse again.  I appeal to the representatives of the community in Northern Ireland, of every political hue &mdash; their politics do not matter &mdash; to reach agreement with each other, to help create those structures and ensure they work.  The Governments, no matter how committed or how courageous, will not be able to create a real political normal society in Northern Ireland if the politicians there do not wish it to happen. When James Molyneaux, Ian Paisley, Gerry Adams, John Hume and John Alderdice can agree structures, to work in an assembly together, to share power with each other and to represent their people as we do here then they, and they alone, will provide the most powerful evidence that we are transforming Northern Ireland society.  After 25 years of violence the people there deserve that.</P>
    <P>During my recent visit to Northern Ireland what impressed me most was the progress made among the ordinary community representatives, how forward thinking they were, how determined they were not to return to the dark days of recent times and how committed they were to working with their neighbours in Northern Ireland.  The leadership of the three larger political <Col N="1370" /> parties has been there for so long maybe they have become complacent too.  If they can represent what I detected on the ground, then we will be able to create that kind of society.</P>
    <P>Many expectations have been raised as a result of the publication of the document.  To a large extent, it is not as historic as previous documents, because of the leaks, and we do not have the same sense of occasion as when the Downing Street Declaration was published.That is a pity because it allowed some people to have their responses ready in advance, particularly those who want to knock the process.  The Governments have outlined the parameters which are fair and balanced.  There is an understanding and a depth to them that we have not had before on a joint basis from the two Governments.  The response from most politicians, apart from those on the Unionist side, has been positive and I welcome that.  Some have not yet responded.  That may be a good thing too because care, thought and consideration in politics is always worth while.  The document has the capacity to bring about a lasting agreement that can stabilise Northern Ireland society.  I do not believe it will happen soon or as quickly as some people think. It is now 23 years since the Sunningdale Agreement.  In the meantime, we have had the Anglo-Irish Agreement, including the process in which my own party was involved while in Government &mdash; the last round of talks which did not come to a satisfactory conclusion.  There were many positive aspects to that process, we were happy to be involved and very disappointed that it did not lead to more positive results.</P>
    <P>The process has continued for a long time and it will not end as rapidly as we might think.  It may be two or three years down the road before we get the kind of society most of us would like to see.  The essential elements of that agreement are contained in the document published today &mdash; North-South institutions; a devolved assembly in Northern Ireland, as outlined in the <Col N="1371" /> Strand I document; a bill of rights, hopefully a constitution for Northern Ireland which my party would like to see.  These are among the key elements of any new settlement.  We owe it to the people we represent to work together to bring that about, to seek to build trust between the divided peoples, to get to know and understand each other, to choose our words carefully.  If we do, we can play our part in ensuring peace and reconciliation on this island.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the outcome of political talks, there is no justification for returning to violence.  I do not like to hear people referring to the &ldquo;fragile peace&rdquo; process.  There never was justification for the violence and certainly there would be no justification for a return to it.  Some people have spoken about the inevitability of violence recurring.I do not believe it is inevitable and I certainly hope there will be no return to it.</P>
    <P>If people are committed to the democratic political process there is no reason they should have huge arsenals of weaponry or engage in punishment beatings.Given the act of faith, demonstrated by the two Governments today, in the publication of this document I believe both Governments deserve to have that act of faith vindicated by those who have that weaponry.  It should be surrendered or disposed of and we should see an end to the punishment beatings.  They are not compatible with those who want to engage in the democratic political process.</P>

      <P>Today is a day of opportunity for the people of Northern Ireland, a day of opportunity for the people of this island as a whole and for our two islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are seeking to move beyond the politics of the slogan.  &ldquo;Up the Republic&rdquo; and &ldquo;No Surrender&rdquo; are not an adequate response &mdash; and were never an adequate response &mdash; to the complexities of legitimate but conflicting rights and allegiances which are at the <Col N="1372" /> heart of the problem of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>What is on offer in the Framework Document is a plan and a process &mdash; an agenda for the good governance of Northern Ireland, and an evolving process whereby that condition of good governance can be carried out on the basis of the democratically expressed wishes of all the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is a complex document for a complex problem.  There is no basis in this document for triumphalism on the part of anyone.  There is no victory in it for any one political view and no defeat for anyone.</P>
    <P>At every critical stage of action proposed in the Framework Document the two sovereign Governments are asking the people of Northern Ireland to express their views through their democratically mandated political parties about the nature of society they want in Northern Ireland.  People on all sides will be fearful &mdash; that is inevitable &mdash; but what needs to be emphasised is that the document places the future of the people of Northern Ireland firmly in their own hands and guarantees that there will be no interference in regard to the determination by the people of Northern Ireland of their constitutional arrangements.</P>
    <P>This document is an enabling document, not a straitjacket.  It says to the political parties of Northern Ireland that it is possible to resolve the problems in an exclusively peaceful and democratic way and a way perceived to be fair by all the people of that society, but it addresses itself to those political parties by saying people must participate in this decision-making process.  Not to do so, whether through attachment to an absolutist position which accommodates violence as a means to an end or through an unwillingness, bordering on unreason, to recognise that Northern Ireland is a very singular place often said to be more British than the British, more Irish than the Irish, is a failure of judgement and of nerve and is certainly a failure to show leadership.  What this <Col N="1373" /> document guarantees is that nobody in Northern Ireland will be less British and nobody will be less Irish.</P>
    <P>The document throughout shows a clear and explicit commitment to the principle of parity or equality of esteem. What that means in practice is that each individual, has the right to have their national allegiance, their national identity, respected, that nobody is a second class citizen or disaffected member of society but a respected and respectable member of society with allegiance to a particular culture and heritage.  To be real this respect must be institutionalised at official level and that commitment is set out clearly in the document.</P>
    <P>The way forward mapped out in the Framework Document does not conjure up a perfect solution to the major political problems of Northern Ireland but it does offer a pragmatic approach for the rapid development of a peaceful society in which people of different traditions can coexist and co-operate and in which national identity can become one enriching aspect of people's lives rather than a cause for segregation or sectarianism.</P>
    <P>In its emphasis on equality of esteem the document sets out to enshrine the principle of communal rights in law and in practice.  The principle of communal rights is a complex one, but at heart it seeks to protect identity, not to copper-fasten it.  As a leader of a political party which has sought to structure politics on issues such as the distribution of wealth and power in society, there is no way I would support the pigeonholing of people according to which community they came from, regardless of aspiration or ability.  The provision of communal rights seeks to protect equal opportunities and equal respect for groups of people.  They should be seen and must be guaranteed as complementary rather than antagonistic to individual rights, which of course remain paramount.</P>
    <P>I had some concern that the emphasis throughout the document on both traditions and two communities might be unintentionally insulting to those many people of integrity and principle in <Col N="1374" /> Northern Ireland who do not regard themselves as primarily members of either tradition and who always sought for a basis of communality and common interest among the people of Northern Ireland.  I have in mind particularly people such as those in the trade union movement and the voluntary and community sectors and political parties such as the Alliance Party, the Workers' Party and Democratic Left who set their face against division and sectarianism.  I would like to pay tribute to these men and women.  The framework document endorses that middle ground position because what it says ultimately is that a normal Northern Ireland is a single community of people in which national identity is one among a number of distinguishing characteristics of individual citizens.</P>
    <P>The document very clearly offers a return to, or the beginning of, real politics for the political parties of Northern Ireland in inviting discussions and negotiation with the political parties on both the political structures in Northern Ireland and on North-South institutions. It is precisely this kind of consultation and dialogue resulting in consensus which would need to be the <i>modus operandi</i> of any Northern assembly and its methods of decision making.</P>
    <P>For too long, politicians on both sides of the divide in Northern Ireland have lived in mutually exclusive circles relying, by default or otherwise, on the two sovereign Governments to express their views.  This framework document embodies a definition of self-determination which is both humane and just, at the same time recognising minority rights within the island as a whole and minority rights within Northern Ireland. The principles in question here are those set out in the Downing Street Joint Declaration of 15 December 1993, the principles of agreement and consent.</P>
    <P>Both Governments believe the document sets out a realistic and balanced framework for an agreed Ireland and an agreed Northern Ireland which can be achieved, with flexibility and goodwill <Col N="1375" /> on all sides, in comprehensive negotiations with the political parties in Northern Ireland.  By consent we mean that the consent of the governed is an essential ingredient for stability in any political arrangement.  I welcome the decision that this Government will seek to amend the Constitution of Ireland to reflect both this principle of consent by the people of Northern Ireland and to end the territorial claim of right to jurisdiction over Northern Ireland.  The removal of the claim to jurisdiction should not offend any Irish person. People who are Irish by birthright will always be Irish.  You cannot take that away from them any more than you can force someone to be Irish whose national identity or allegiance tells him or her otherwise.</P>
    <P>In its acceptance of the need for constitutional change in the Republic, the framework document recognises that we have come of age in the Republic and that pluralism, acceptance of difference and pragmatism are positive attributes, they do not pose a threat to the cohesion of society, rather they only pose a threat to a monolithic intolerant society.  At the same time the document sends a powerful political message to both unionists and nationalists.  To unionists, it says; yes you have your right to self-determination, but not to run a winner takes all society.  To nationalists, it says, of course your right to national identity and equality must be protected, but if you want to be part of a united Ireland you must persuade unionists that this course is in their interests.</P>
    <P>There is an onus on both Governments and all political parties to build on the opportunity afforded by the ceasefires in Northern Ireland.  The Framework Document represents political progress, and is paralleled in a triple strategy by the encouragement of economic development and by moves to foster peace and reconciliation.  Already, the European Union has activated a commitment, including participation by both Governments, of £320 million for <Col N="1376" /> balanced economic and social development in Northern Ireland.  The US administration will hold a conference in Washington in May targeting potential American investment.  The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation meanwhile fulfils its worthwhile and complementary role of building trust and understanding between the various traditions on this island.</P>
    <P>The investment in economic development and reconciliation initiatives can help pull political development along but they cannot replace it.  The Framework Document is indicative of the high level of agreement between the two Governments on the approach towards a balanced political settlement in Northern Ireland.  It is not a rigid blueprint, it is more a set of handrails, and at every identifiable opportunity in the process it seeks the input and participation of the democratically mandated parties in Northern Ireland.  For example, there is real scope for these parties to contribute to the design of North-South co-operation.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to all parties concerned, even it their initial reaction is dismissive, to look again.  It rewards careful scrutiny and considered response and in this context I welcome the measured response of the SDLP, Sinn Féin, the Alliance Party and of Garry McMichael of the UDP.  As I said, it is an enabling document, one which offers opportunities and safeguards to each tradition.  It reflects balance and accommodation on all sides. For the people of Northern Ireland, and of all this island, it offers the chance to move from a discourse of antecedents and historic oppression to a discourse on such issues as access to employment, education and health and the distribution of economic and political power in society.  I would like to see the politics of everyday realities displace the politics of identity and allegiance because the latter have become no longer issues of contention but merely personal attributes.</P>
    <P>This document represents the collective political judgment of the two <Col N="1377" /> democratically elected Governments on measures to secure peace and promote further political progress in Northern Ireland.  As such, it can be said to be indicative of the will of the majority of people in both jurisdictions but, as both the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister have said, nobody would claim that this document is the sole repository of wisdom in this area.  Certainly one achievement of the document &mdash; even before it was formally published &mdash; was to focus attention on the problem and promote new debate.  Already this week both the Ulster Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party have published their own proposals, and while these are naturally dominated by the Unionist orientation of the parties concerned they should not be casually dismissed by non-unionists.  Every democratic view has to have an input into the political future of Northern Ireland and, as the political voices of one of the main traditions in Northern Ireland, the input of these two parties is absolutely crucial.</P>
    <P>There are encouraging signs from the two documents that both parties are thinking seriously about the new political structures for Northern Ireland. Clearly both documents fall very much short of the balanced approach advocated in the Framework Document, but at the same time they also include suggestions which may stand in their own right and which could play a constructive part in promoting progress in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The publication of the Framework Document is the third major development with regard to Northern Ireland in the space of a little more than 14 months.  There was the launch in December 1993 of the Downing Street Declaration, followed in the autumn of last year by the ceasefires of the loyalist and nationalist paramilitaries, and now the historic events in Hillborough and Belfast today.  These events have transformed the political and social life of Northern Ireland and, after more than 20 years of despair, have allowed the people there to hope again.  Anybody who has travelled to Northern Ireland <Col N="1378" /> as frequently as I have over the past two decades cannot but be struck by the improvement in the quality of life of the people there.  The endless round of destruction has ceased, the awful sense of fear has gone and the appearance of a society under siege is steadily lifting. We cannot go back to the endless cycle of violence and destruction which has scarred Northern Ireland for so long.</P>
    <P>There is a solemn obligation on us all to build on the progress made to date. All of us, both the political parties and the paramilitary organisation, share in this obligation.  The ceasefire of the nationalist and loyalist paramilitary were a crucial turning point, probably the crucial turning point of the recent past.  The cessation of violence has allowed the two Governments to address a number of the grievances raised by the paramilitary groups and the political parties associated with them, especially the nationalist one.  In the Republic the Ministerial Order under section 31 of the Broadcasting Act was lifted, the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation was established into which Sinn Féin was given a substantial input and a substantial number of those serving sentences for paramilitary offences have been released.  In Northern Ireland there has been a round of talks between Sinn Féin and British officials, exclusion orders against a number of people have been lifted, there is a much lower police and military presence and day time patrolling by the army has been ended in most areas.</P>
    <P>The two Governments are continuing to explore ways in which additional measures can be taken to copperfasten the peace process, but there are also obligations on the paramilitaries to deal with those matters which still cause concern.There are still huge quantities of arms and explosives out there which still offer the potential for terrible death and destruction.  There is also worrying evidence of continued &mdash; indeed increased &mdash; involvement by paramilitary members in savage punishment beatings.It cannot be said too often that, regardless of the level of petty crime in <Col N="1379" /> Northern Ireland and of the problems of public confidence in the police in certain areas, no organisation has the right to act as judge, jury and executioner in such cases and no organisation has the right to inflict such violence on other citizens.</P>
    <P>I have great pleasure in recommending to the House the document launched today which I hope will lead to a more permanent peace.</P>

      <P>The meeting earlier today of the Taoiseach and Prime Minister at which the Joint Framework Document &mdash;<i>A New Framework for Agreement</i>&mdash; was launched is another critical and historic step on the road to consolidating peace on this island.  The publication of the Framework Document is the culmination of work which has been ongoing for nearly two years.</P>
      <P>We have in a period of little more than a year witnessed history in the making.  During the past 14 months we have witnessed the adoption of the Joint Declaration in Downing Street by the then Taoiseach and by the British Prime Minister on 17 December, 1993, the announcements by the provisional IRA and the combined loyalist military command of the cessation of their campaigns in August and October of last year and, most importantly, the hope which those developments have inspired on both sides of the Border.  Those events are all of immense significance in their own right while together they combine to create the most tangible opportunity to secure a lasting peace, based on mutual understanding and respect, for more than a quarter of a century. That is the prize towards which a New Framework For Agreement is directed. It is the culmination of detailed and painstaking work by the two Governments which predates the adoption of the Joint Declaration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am honoured as Minister for Justice to have participated closely in the most recent of those discussions.  Nobody who was present in Hillsborough today <Col N="1380" /> could have failed to have sensed the historical significance of the occasion.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the valuable work of both my predecessor, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, and the Government in which she served in that process.  The Tánaiste, Deputy Dick Spring, was central in the work of preparing the Framework Document in both Governments, and I congratulate him on what he has achieved.  I also thank the officials in my own Department who have been closely involved in the work leading to today's events.</P>
    <P>The Government has now brought the Joint Framework Document to the table for all to see and read, and hopes that its publication will contribute in a positive way to consolidating the peace process.  We expect its publication to give impetus and direction to the process of debate and negotiation which is now needed by providing a basis for structured discussions.  People throughout these islands want their political representatives to take the lead in harnessing the opportunites which the events of the last year have created. They are looking to their political representatives to engage in the process of dialogue.</P>
    <P>We want comprehensive negotiations to get under way as quickly as possible. Discussion and negotiation provide the only means to secure the type of balanced accommodation necessary to end the divisions which have caused violence on this island.  What we want, and expect, is discussion and negotiation. Both Governments have already made clear that &ldquo;A New Framework for Agreement&rdquo; is not a blueprint to be imposed.  Nevertheless it represents the considered view of both Governments as to what might constitute the outcome of future talks.  It also represents our joint assessment of where agreement might be found.  It is to be seen, therefore, as the Government's contribution to the process of debate and discussion.</P>
    <P>Its purpose is to facilitate discussion, not to pre-empt it.  That means that both Governments remain open to proposals <Col N="1381" /> or suggestions from the parties.  We, therefore, welcome the publication by the Ulster Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party of their proposals.They represent an important contribution to the debate and other parties may equally wish to put forward their views.  All proposals and suggestions as to how a balanced accommodation can be achieved will be given careful consideration.  We will seek to build on any area where general agreement can be secured, subject to the requirement that we build the complete edifice and that all that we do is geared towards that result.  There is no profit from taking an <i>á la carte</i> approach, by building a few bricks here and there.  We must agree to build methodically and to include the difficult as well as the easy parts if we are to produce a structure that is sound and will stand the test of time.</P>
    <P>The significance of the Framework Document lies in the fact that it builds on the principles outlined in the Joint Declaration.  The proposals it contains to that end are both balanced and fair. They threaten nobody.  They suggest how the principles in the Joint Declaration might be translated into practice. The Framework Document sets out the type of changes that would achieve this objective both in terms of constitutional change and new structures and arrangements.</P>
    <P>A <i>New Framework for Agreement</i> points to a balanced accommodation of the differing views of the two main traditions on the constitutional issue.  What that will mean is seeking new arrangements capable of accommodating the different viewpoints within both traditions.That equally means seeking to accommodate both traditions at different levels &mdash; on the constitutional issue, as well as in terms of structures and rights.  Those are the principles which inform the <i>New Framework for Agreement</i> and the approach it commends to the parties and the people.</P>
    <P>That will involve change here and on the British side but we, for our part, <Col N="1382" /> should not be shy of change if it can promote reconciliation and underpin a lasting political settlement.  Those changes will include constitutional change here and in the United Kingdom.  What is involved in that respect will be ensuring that the basic law of both jurisdictions adequately reflects the commitments entered into and the reality of the diverse aspirations of the two traditions on this island.</P>
    <P>What is important, as I said, is the balanced nature of the proposed changes.  The British Government, for its part, reaffirms that it has no selfish, strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland and that it will uphold the democratic wish of a greater number of the people of Northern Ireland on the issue of whether they prefer to support the Union or a sovereign united Ireland. It will enshrine in its constitutional legislation the principles embodied in this new framework for agreement by the amendment of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, or by its replacement by appropriate new legislation.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government, for its part, has committed itself to ask the electorate to change the Constitution.  The proposed change will be to remove any jurisdictional or territorial claim of legal right over the territory of Northern Ireland contrary to the will of its people and will provide that the creation of a sovereign united Ireland could, therefore, only occur in circumstances where a majority of the people of Northern Ireland formally chose to be part of a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>New structures which are capable of reflecting a new beginning for relationships within the island of Ireland need to acknowledge that there are many matters of common interest to both parts of Ireland.  That is why the <i>New Framework for Agreement</i> suggests new institutions to cater for future political, social and economic interconnections which would include a North-South body involving heads of Departments on both sides and established and maintained by legislation.</P>
    <P>The functions to be delegated to that <Col N="1383" /> body will be a matter for agreement. Those functions will, in the first instance, be those matters which the Governments designate in agreement with the parties or which the two administrations, North and South, agree to designate.  In addition to that, the <i>New Framework for Agreement</i> proposes that all decisions within the body would be by agreement between the two sides. Moreover, heads of the department would exercise their powers in accordance with the rules for democratic authority and accountability in force in the Oireachtas and in new institutions in Northern Ireland.  The operation of the North-South body's functions would also be subject to regular scrutiny in agreed political institutions in Northern Ireland and the Oireachtas respectively.</P>
    <P>A crucial concept running through all these elements is the concept of agreement.It is the fact that nothing will be imposed, that all that is put in place must be agreed and that nothing is agreed until all is agreed, that gives us the right to say that this document is truly non-threatening.</P>
    <P>The Government believes that a North-South body of the type described in the document has much to commend it.  It can be a powerful agent in promoting understanding between the two traditions and the motor for economic progress throughout the island.  It will, in effect, build on the increasing co-operation that has been developing already between both parts of the island, particularly in economic matters.  Structures within Northern Ireland itself will also need to reflect cross-community agreement.</P>
    <P>Ensuring parity of esteem for both communities and traditions is another important principle underlying the Joint Framework Document.  That needs to be reflected not only in new political arrangements but equally by ensuring the systematic protection of basic rights in both jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>I want to mention one other aspect of the <i>New Framework for Agreement</i> which is of particular interest to me as <Col N="1384" /> Minister for Justice.  That is the issue of law and order which the document recognises is closely linked to the issue of political consensus and which will remain &mdash; for the time being &mdash; a matter for east-west structures.  The document identifies the issue of policing and of enhancing community identification with policing in Northern Ireland as an important issue and an area in which the climate of peace and growth of agreement may offer new possibilities and opportunities.  That is a matter in which I, as Minister for Justice, will be taking a close personal interest and to which I intend to bring my own experience in this jurisdiction and that of my Department to bear.</P>
    <P>I should also make clear that the new climate of peace will not detract in any way from the very high level of co-operation that already exists between the police forces in the two jurisdictions, between the Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable.  What it can mean in both jurisdictions is the freeing of resources to tackle other forms of criminal activity which are a source of concern to ordinary people in both communities throughout this island.  My colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare has outlined some of those areas of concern to ordinary people.</P>
    <P>Although the issue of policing will be reserved to the east-west structures in the first instance.  It is an area in which I would expect both Governments to welcome an input from the people of Northern Ireland through their democratic representatives.</P>
    <P>The Framework Document, is not, as I have already made clear, being put forward by the Government as a blueprint.It provides a framework for the process of debate and negotiation and represents the views of the two Governments as to what might constitute an agreeable and acceptable settlement. The accommodation to which it points is intended to enable the people of this island to work together constructively for their mutual benefit without compromising the essential principles of the long-term aspirations or interests of <Col N="1385" /> either traditions or either community.  I repeat that it does not threaten, and is not intended to threaten, the aspirations or interests of either community or tradition.That is not to say that it is not intended to challenge both traditions.</P>
    <P>The <i>New Framework for Agreement</i> is intended to challenge and I know that it will challenge people on all sides of the debate.  It must do that if the prize of a lasting political settlement which will secure peace is to be achieved.  A lasting political settlement will elude us unless there is movement and compromise on all sides.  All sides need to leave the uncertainties and failures of the past behind.  We all need to approach negotiations in a spirit of generosity.  That is the only approach that will enable us to move forward and create the sort of new relationships which will be capable of securing peace.</P>
    <P>That process will take time.  The Framework Document itself needs &mdash; and deserves &mdash; to be read and considered by all sides before judgement is passed.  I appeal to people, North and South, not to be swayed by those who will selectively quote from the document for their own purposes.  Read and study it in its entirety and make your own judgment on the basis of what the complete document contains.  A reading of the full document will show that the proposals it contains are balanced and fair, and that neither tradition need fear its contents.  Both traditions will, I hope, come to see that it offers a good basis for the discussion and negotiation that can &mdash; and should &mdash; lead to a lasting political settlement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Representing two of the Ulster counties south of the Border, I welcome the Framework Document with my colleagues in the House.  I congratulate all those involved; I congratulate the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and former Taoisigh who were involved.  The document is a logical follow on to years of discussion between the British and Irish Governments.  One could go back to Sunningdale but there was an important development in 1981 when <Col N="1386" /> the then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, recognised for the first time that there should be a settlement which would transcend the boundary of the Six Counties of Northern Ireland, that one could not have a settlement within the Six Counties.  We had the Anglo-Irish Agreement and it was recognised that there should be three strands to the discussions and, obviously, these three strands are important: the relationship between the two communities in the North, the relationship between North and South, and the relationship between Britain and Ireland.</P>
      <P>The last two years have been quite eventful.  We had the Downing Street Declaration which was important and spelled out many important principles: the principle of self determination, the principle of consent which we all recognise and which it is important that the unionists recognise also.  I would criticise politicians who would lead the public and those who may support their parties to feel that consent is not there and that they will not have the right or the opportunity to pass judgment on whatever agreement is reached in the talks which, I hope, will proceed soon.</P>
      <P>The other major welcome development was the cessation of violence by the provisional IRA and by loyalist paramilitaries.  After six months of peace, people on this island, particularly those in the Six Counties, recognise the value of peace.  Young people who grew up not knowing what it was like to live in a peaceful atmosphere now see the benefits of it.  I hope that will be a spur to people to take this Framework Document seriously, to read, study and debate it and make decisions which will bring a lasting peace acceptable to all people on the island no matter what their culture is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been pointed out, when in Government my party was engaged until November 1994 in preparing the document.  The twin pillars of the Downing Street Declaration, to which I already referred, were self-determination and consent.  It is important to <Col N="1387" /> recognise that there can only be a solution to the problem by peaceful means. It is also important to point out that there should be civil rights and rights for both communities in the North and, indeed, for all the people on this island.</P>
    <P>I understand why the Taoiseach, when addressing the House, did not refer to the structures in Strand I, that is, structures which would be put in place in the North which would be accountable to all the people, both unionist and nationalist.  Indeed, the paragraph relating to accountable government in Northern Ireland refers to democratic principles.  I suppose the tragedy of Northern Ireland and why we debate it so often is that there have never been democratic principles there. The type of democracy experienced by other European Union countries has not been evident in Northern Ireland due to the way in which the Six Counties were established &mdash; to create a permanent majority over the souls of a permanent minority.  Ordinary democratic rules under which the majority rules, could never apply in Northern Ireland and that is the cause of the problem.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the structures are established in the North &mdash; the assembly of 90 members and the panel of three who will be elected &mdash; there will be fair play for everybody, particularly for the smaller party.  Obviously, in time there will be a transfer of responsibility from the British Government to the assembly.  As long as there is fair play, the more power that is evolved, the better.The new Intergovernmental Conference will have a major responsibility in ensuring that there is fair play for the smaller community.  There must be power sharing, the structures must be acceptable and unionists and nationalists must have equal rights.</P>
    <P>There are, however, two areas which must be looked at and where change is needed &mdash; the courts and policing.  The only way a civilised society can function effectively is if the overwhelming majority accept the institutions of state. <Col N="1388" /> For good and obvious reasons, nationalists in the past have not accepted the courts in the North or the police as institutions to which they could subscribe. These areas must be addressed urgently. We must consider how the courts can attract the support of nationalists.  Perhaps there could be a link with the European Court to which people who are not happy could appeal in the short term and police recruitment and management must also be looked at.</P>
    <P>In the context of the cessation of violence by the provisional IRA and loyalist paramilitaries, it is important to point out that there have been incidents in which the British Army has lacked sensitivity.Last week, for example, the British Army saturated parts of south Armagh.  I visited Cullyhanna where people were unhappy about the level of activity and about harassment.  Now that there is a cessation of violence, it would be helpful if the British Army stayed in the background, perhaps in their barracks, not only in major towns, but throughout the countryside.</P>
    <P>Fair employment and the cultural identity of the people are important and should be recognised.  I hope the new Intergovernmental Conference, involving the British and Irish Governments, will be a guarantor of rights to the people.  The Taoiseach referred to the functions of the North-South structures. While it will be encouraging to see them established, how they work is more important.  If they do not work effectively they will not produce the benefits we want to see.  There is an obligation on us all, North and South, to ensure that they work effectively.  We can all identify areas where the interests of the people in the North coincide with those in the South, but not in Britain &mdash; none more so than in agriculture.  Over the years the Irish Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry represented the interests of farmers in Northern Ireland better than any British Minister for Agriculture and that is recognised by the farming community.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Health I met my counterpart in Belfast every six <Col N="1389" /> months.  We saw an island of five million people where resources for health services were scarce and should be used to the maximum advantage of those on the island.  I am glad we succeeded in establishing expensive hi-tech services for the whole island.  For example, for the whole island lithotripsy, the crushing of kidney stones was carried out in the Meath Hospital in Dublin, while in return the total body irradiation for children awaiting bone marrow transplants was carried out in Belfast.  This is an indication of the type of practical co-operation which can exist.</P>
    <P>As regards the constitutional issue, maintaining the integrity of the nation set out in Article 2 is fundamental.  I was glad my party leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, referred to that today.  Some 18 months ago I attended a regional meeting of the SDLP covering south Armagh and it recognised the importance of Article 2 of the Constitution and under no circumstances did it want to see us let that go.  While it is fundamental that we hold on to that, there would be no harm writing into the Constitution in Article 3 what we have already done, that is, that we recognise that the reunification of our country can only come with the consent of the majority in Northern Ireland.  That is something which we have recognised in a number of ways.  I would like to see all parties study the document.</P>
    <P>As a result of the cessation of violence and the discussions taking place to develop structures within the North and North-South bodies there are now opportunities to pursue economic development in the Border areas.  The cessation of violence was a major advance.  It is recognised that all frontier regions suffer economically.  Because of this the European Union established funds such as INTERREG and introduced the Delors II package.  The 12 Border counties had the added disadvantage of having to endure 25 years of violence and we now have an opportunity to redress this.  The problems have also been recognised by the contributors to the International Fund for <Col N="1390" /> Ireland and by the United States which has organised the Washington Conference which will be attended by President Clinton.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Government grasps every opportunity to ensure that the Border areas are developed.  It is recognised that most overseas industries locate within 20 miles of Dublin because of the competitive advantages to be gained in terms of the road network, sewerage facilities and land banks.  I understand there are 1,000 acres of land in public ownership within a 20 mile radius of Dublin.  While there are opportunities to develop telemarketing and sales and reservation services it is unfortunate that Telecom Éireann has practically no fibre optic cable network within the Border areas.  I ask the Government and the IDA to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is put in place to attract industry.</P>
    <P>The development of the road network is a major issue.  I would like to see a major road from Dundalk to Sligo as there is no national primary route north of the Dublin-Galway road.</P>
    <P>While there was a reference to the need to establish North-South bodies and to meetings between Ministers and heads of Departments it is important to allow local authorities on both sides of the Border to play a meaningful role in the provision of services.  This matter has been neglected in the past.  There are many examples on the Derry-Donegal border and on the east coast along the Louth-Down border where cross-Border economic committees have been established but these have not received the support of successive Governments, North or South.</P>
    <P>There is a need for tax concessions in the 12 Border counties.  We also need to examine our tax structure, including VAT and PRSI, as we are not able to compete with the six Northern counties.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, that the Framework Document does not pose a threat to anyone, rather it provides an opportunity to the people on this island and the political parties, especially those in <Col N="1391" /> the six Northern counties, to come together to examine it.  The Downing Street Declaration and the Framework Document recognises the principle of consent.  It is annoying that leading unionist politicians are misleading the people by suggesting that a solution will be imposed on them as the Irish and British Government have stated clearly that this is not the case and that there will be a referendum.  Therefore I appeal to all the parties in Northern Ireland to examine the document and to the Government to ensure that all three strands are taken together and we do not neglect strands II and III.</P>
    <P>The Framework Document is another major step on the road towards a permanent cessation of violence on this island and I hope that people will be able to live in peace and harmony in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a time for quiet and deep reflection, not for knee-jerk reactions or for people to say what many will regret later.  It is important for those of us who represent the Nationalist people not to say or do anything which will inflame or enrage the people we want to be reconciled with.  A few days ago the chairman of the Ulster Unionist Council, Mr. Jim Nicholson, made the startling remark, which we should try to ignore that the unionists are now friendless.  There are four million people who are prepared to be their friends.</P>
      <P>The Leader of my party said in his speech that the return to normality means it is safe to go out in the evening, to mix more and to open the door to our neighbours.  I say to Mr. Nicholson that we have often shaken hands to avoid any further violence.  He and his colleagues should consider this document because we do not want to endure a further 25 years of violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that we are inclined to forget the 3,000 victims of the violence.It would have been their wish that there be no retaliation or a further 3,000 victims.  I therefore appeal to unionists <Col N="1392" />&mdash; I was disappointed that there was a knee-jerk reaction &mdash; to rethink their position like most of the other political parties, as we do not want to endure a further 25 years of violence.</P>
    <P>I would like to be associated with the tributes to the Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton.I have been critical of him in the past because on many occasions in the Dáil I felt he was not of a Nationalist way of thinking.  He has every right to feel proud of himself tonight and I congratulate him on what he has achieved in recent months.</P>
    <P>I express similar sentiments also to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, who worked extremely hard with the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, over recent years.  Great credit has been paid to both men over recent months.  We must also include in our tributes the British Prime Minister, John Major, the Northern Secretary, Patrick Mayhew and, indeed, the many unionist politicians who stood back when the ship appeared to rock, took cognisance of the facts being laid before them and acted in a very responsible way.</P>
    <P>I have no disagreement with most parts of the document.  There is a proposal to establish an Assembly and institutional bodies and it is intended to have intergovernmental conferences. One aspect, however, requires further explanation.  In the many interviews I gave today the question of constitutional change arose.  The absence of detail in regard to commitment to constitutional change in the document &mdash; I speak personally although my party favours this also &mdash; will be a thorn in the sides of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste in the coming months.  I hope that will not be the case but judging by the way this aspect was portrayed on television today, it will cause a number of problems due to the blanket way it was announced, which was as follows: &ldquo;The Irish Government will introduce and support proposals for changes in the Irish Constitution, so that no territorial claim of right to jurisdiction over Northern Ireland...&rdquo;.  People will read only <Col N="1393" /> the first part of that sentence and a full explanation will have to be given by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste if we are to allay any fears in this regard.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil reached a certain point with regard to constitutional change before we left office.  We made it quite clear to the British Government, and it was accepted at that time, that we had gone as far as we were prepared to go in that regard and the Leader of our party referred to the important issue of Article 2 this afternoon.  This matter should be resolved as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon, referred to other issues concerning the Border region.  I also give a broad welcome to this document which contains a basis for an ongoing peace settlement for Northern Ireland and we all must work together to persuade representatives on all sides that that basis exists. We will certainly do everything on our side to ensure that.</P>

      <P>Like my party Leader, Deputy Harney, who spoke earlier I heartily welcome the publication today by the British and Irish Governments of the Framework Document.  I am glad to see also the publication by the British Government of its document on the devolution of powers within Northern Ireland but this latter document is somewhat more cautious and more limited than seems to me either necessary or desirable.  For example, a failure to delegate or devolve fiscal powers makes the public administration, and the very policy of Northern Ireland, secondary and subsidiary in an unnecessary way. So far as politicians are concerned, facing up to the disciplines of public <Col N="1394" /> expenditure and of revenue raising to meet it makes men out of boys.</P>
      <P>Perhaps there is no great enthusiasm among many of the parties in Northern Ireland to have the most important internal powers devolved.  Given the sensitivity of policing, the undoubtedly difficult task of exercising control over the police and having ultimate responsibility for them should vest in people who are locally elected within that jurisdiction.Such people have a greater anxiety to get it right.  To control the Northern Ireland police ultimately from London is somehow to put them in the same category as the police of Bermuda, the Cayman Islands or Hong Kong.  It should be remembered in the North that failure to accept responsibility is as culpable as failure to confer it.</P>
      <P>I regret I cannot give any kind of fully considered response to these two documents.I did not see the Framework Document until 9.30 this morning and I did not see the other document until almost lunchtime.  They are carefully drafted and require more study than briefly reading through them once.  I am, however, encouraged and even at times stimulated by what is contained in the Framework Document.  It is not, as has been repeatedly pointed out, a blueprint.Its best description is its own subtitle, &ldquo;a shared understanding between the British and Irish Governments to assist discussion and negotiation involving the Northern Ireland parties&rdquo;.  I commend that subtitle to all the parties in the North and I plead with them to see it as a carefully constructed agenda or a starting point for dialogue and not as anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a long time during the inter-party talks of 1992 at Stormont, the parties sought a steer or a direction from the two Governments.  The Governments undertook that challenge eventually.  It took them a long time because the very process, even between the two Governments, is fraught with difficulty.  They have now produced something that is worthwhile and challenging.  It is fair <Col N="1395" /> and balanced as between the two traditions and as between the different parties.</P>
    <P>I rejoice to read the views and attitudes of the British Government today, as set out in the document, compared to what they were as recently as 23 years ago.  I recall that at the end of January 1972, I was Minister for Justice when the British Army murdered 13 civilians in Derry on Bloody Sunday.  The then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, sent a strongly worded note of protest to the then British Prime Minister, Edward Health. Within hours he received a curt reply expressing no regret for the deaths and stating that anything that happened within Northern Ireland was no business of the Irish Government.  Thank God we have come a long way from that.</P>
    <P>The difficulties of dealing in Government with the British Government at that time were immense and could scarcely be grasped by those who were not involved.  There was an arrogant and frequently culpable ignorance of Irish affairs, both in terms of facts and of feelings.The first ever breakthrough came later in 1972 when Jack Lynch began to persuade and, eventually, to convince Edward Health that the problem was a great deal more complex than successive British Governments had regarded it and that it required a much more open minded approach than had been the case on their part up to then.</P>
    <P>If I can rejoice at the change in attitudes of the British Government over a period of 23 years, I think I can rejoice at a change in attitude in Irish Governments over a much shorter period.  I was involved in the talks at Stormont in the summer and autumn of 1992 when it was impossible to get the Irish Government, of which I was a member, to agree collectively to make certain statements which fell far short of what is contained in the Framework Document on their behalf.  The statements relate to the constitutional position in the Republic and what might happen in that regard.  We had at that time a long and sterile argument for several months on whether in <Col N="1396" /> respect of constitutional change relating to Articles 2 and 3 &ldquo;would&rdquo; should be used rather than &ldquo;could&rdquo; as this would have enabled some progress to have been made.  The Government that changed in November 1992 took a somewhat different view before it in turn fell in November 1994.  It appears the then Government had come around to the point of view expressed in this document today.  There was a great window of opportunity in the summer and autumn of 1992 and it was not availed of.  There were a number of impediments to progress and I regret that one of them at that time was the view of the then Irish Government on certain matters.</P>
    <P>I do not have in front of me exactly what Deputy Bertie Ahern said but I get a slightly chilling tremor from what he said earlier today and which I think Deputy McDaid repeated at the close of his speech that, as far as the constitutional position is concerned, Fianna Fáil had agreed to go this far but it would not go any further.</P>

      <P>I may have minister-preted them and no doubt in this debate they will correct me if I have, as I do not wish to do so but I get the feeling they have gone this far in Opposition because they went that far in Government but that if an attempt is made to go beyond this, Fianna Fáil will not give it its support.  If that is the correct expression of their views, I regard it as regrettable and I ask them to rethink it. One of the strengths of the present situation, both in Ireland and in Britain, in this House and in the House of Commons, is that there is almost universal support for what the two Governments are doing.  I think that has great influence in Northern Ireland, not least on those at both ends of the spectrum who might for their own historical, ideological or other reasons not wish to look very favourably on this Framework Document.</P>

      <P>There is a certain vagueness or uncertainty about the references to the constitutional position of both sides in this document &mdash; paragraphs 14 to 21.  Having read it I think it is probably correctly expressed to have it slightly vague and not to use particular or specific wording on either side because if you do I fear you are committing the debate to a parsing and analysing session rather then trying to grasp the spirit of what is here.</P>
      <P>The spirit of the two Governments is markedly different from 20-25 years ago and in some respects markedly different from as recently as two or three years ago.  I think it is the spirit rather than the letter that will conquer this problem. It is the spirit of the two Governments, the spirit of this House and the House of Commons, if I interpret them correctly which hopefully will encourage everyone in Northern Ireland to take as open and generous a view as possible and to seek to confront the present difficulties without recrimination and without looking back and trying to rehash and refight every year in the late 20th century the battles and disputes of earlier centuries that have no relevance.  At times one thinks that some aspects of Northern Ireland are like a place that is in a time warp, as if it was some kind of lost valley in the Himalayas that had not come to terms yet with the normality of democracy and life in the contemporary world.  It is unfair to accuse everyone of that, and that is not the case, but some aspects of what happens in Northern Ireland, particularly in the month of July give the impression of people who are still caught in a foolish time warp that we would all like to get out of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there are copperfastened guarantees for unionists, they have the <Col N="1398" /> guarantee of the Assembly, the guarantee of the British Government and Parliament, the guarantee of a referendum. I think it was the Taoiseach who described it as a kind of triple lock, any one of which can hold up the process.  It is perhaps not the most promising process, if it can be held up in that way, but how can anyone object to entering the process if they have all those guarantees?That is why I am particularly disappointed, not at what Dr. Paisley had to say, because one would expect that but at what some others had to say, who hopefully on reflection and a closer study of this document, which none of us has had the opportunity to give it so far, might moderate their view and realise there is a huge majority of people in Northern Ireland who, while they may not be agreed on many things are certainly agreed on the fact that they do not want to go back to the way things were more than six months ago.</P>
    <P>The danger of a reversion to pre-August 31 will arise if political progress is not seen to be made and it will be made if all concerned are prepared to enter into the spirit of the agenda set today.  It is no more than the agenda. They can talk out certain parts of the agenda and substitute other items from time to time, different versions of what is set out in this agenda, but at least there should be dialogue and I do not see how any person of rationality and goodwill can in the present context refuse to enter into dialogue.  They would bear a heavy responsibility were they to refuse to do so.  I hope on reflection most of them will enter into dialogue. Deputy Harney remarked earlier it was somewhat strange that people of the unionist tradition who appear to have had a former violent background seem more amenable to progress than those who did not have such a background. Perhaps the explanation is they have less to lose.  I do not know.  The greatest inhibition to progress on both sides of the divide in Northern Ireland is that moderates keep looking over their shoulders.  They should take their courage in their hands and press on.  This <Col N="1399" /> document gives them a good starting point for so doing and they should avail of it.  The like of it may not come again for some time.</P>
    <P>The North-South institutions are dealt with in some detail between paragraphs 24 and 38 of the document and make interesting reading.  Anyone in Northern Ireland, even the most entrenched unionist who does not want to see any kind of united Ireland in the future, who reads those paragraphs with an open mind will be satisfied that it is to his and everyone's benefit in Northern Ireland for some arrangement of this kind to be made.</P>
    <P>If we could leave out the political aspect of North/South institutions which is the one that seems to consume most people and look at the economic and commonsense aspects, there could be no argument about it because it makes so much sense.  I have been Minister for Industry and Commerce on a few occasion and was disheartened that trade between the North and South is incredibly low.  I know of no two contiguous jurisdictions in western Europe where the trade between them is as low as it is between here and the North.  The loss to both of us is incalculable.  Even if we could achieve a normal level of commerce between us the gain that would accrue in terms of employment and the generation of wealth in both parts of this island would be considerable.It seems crazy that for political and historical reasons we should cast that aside.</P>
    <P>The level of our trade with Britain is enormous in spite of perceived traditional antagonisms and that we are not two contiguous jurisdictions but have what is often described as the most expensive sea in the world, per mile, between us.  Britain is by far our largest customer and up to relatively recently, small and all as we are, we were her third largest customer in the world.  We are now her sixth largest customer.  If we can trade to that extent with Britain &mdash; we are still worried about our overdependence on one market &mdash; why can <Col N="1400" /> we not trade even at normal rate with the other part of our own island?  If North-South institutions did nothing else I would like to see them succeed for the purpose of bringing normality to trade and commerce.</P>
    <P>We have a huge number of common interests and they are listed in paragraph 32 under the harmonising level. We have common interests in transport, energy, trade and health where we duplicate facilities unnecessarily on both sides of the Border.  In higher education we duplicate facilities and create serious difficulties and unnecessary expenditure.  It brings me back to the point I made earlier about the need for fiscal power or revenue raising powers in the North.  We will not have a normal political society there or a normal parliamentary society, no matter what assembly is established, unless we force those elected to exercise the normal powers of Government.  There is a kind of cop out if they see themselves as just the recipients of largesse from London and the dolers out of someone else's money.  Sovereignty is deficient if full powers are not exercised.  I am not talking about external powers or external defence, currency and so on but internal powers which all elected representatives in Northern Ireland should be anxious to implement in full.</P>
    <P>The three layers of consultation, harmonisation and executive action envisaged for the North/South institutions is a good division of the type of powers it is appropriate to devolve to such a body. They do not all have to be devolved to the same extent and that difference is recognised by the three categories set out in the document.  As Deputy Harney said, I am surprised, having valued the relevant strength of much of the rest of the document, to see how comparatively weak the section headed &ldquo;Protection of Rights&rdquo; is which is contained in paragraphs 50 to 53.  It is very vague.  There is no question of a bill of rights, less so is there the question of a written Constitution even though it seems that Northern Ireland is clearly a place where it is <Col N="1401" /> appropriate to have a written Constitution which would guarantee personal and communal rights for the benefit of individuals and the two traditions.  What we have is a suggestion by the two Governments that democratic representatives from both jurisdictions might adopt a charter or covenant.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;covenant&rdquo; has overtones in terms of Northern Ireland &mdash; whether that is why it is used, I do not know &mdash; but a charter, covenant or any other declaration that lacks constitutional underpinning is deficient.  When these talks begin, as I hope they soon will, this is one area in which the need for a specific guarantee of constitutional rights will be examined, on the personal and communal level.  A means of vindication of those rights is required.</P>
    <P>Younger people might think that the question of rights is of little importance because people in Northern Ireland have the same rights as those in Britain, but that is not necessarily so.  I recall, more than 25 years ago when I began going to Northern Ireland regularly, meeting people, including my wife's family, some of whom had no vote at all and others who had three, four or five votes depending on how much property they owned.  That position existed and was defended by the then regime in Northern Ireland into the 1970s and at least was implicitly defended by the British Government who were aware of it but did not interfere.</P>
    <P>The British Government has made great progress in the declaration of rights for people in Northern Ireland. Whether they all operate in practice is another matter.  I have in mind in particular the difficulties many Catholics experience in obtaining employment but undoubtedly there is a transformation from the position under Stormont in that nowadays one finds Catholics in senior public positions.  This was almost unknown 30 years ago but there remains a long way to go.  In County Tyrone great amusement was caused, approximately 30 years ago, by the appointment of a particular individual as a surgeon. His name was so English, so apparently <Col N="1402" /> Protestant, that he was appointed by mistake but, having signed his appointment, nothing could be done about it.  It seemed abundantly clear to everyone on both sides of the fence that, had they known the truth about him, he would not have been appointed.  Probably that was true.  Many people in Britain and even here do not realise just what things were like in Northern Ireland, the fact that people there are only slowly coming out of that rather peculiar, one-sided society in which they were forced to live for so long.</P>
    <P>Some great things have happened in more recent years in regard to Northern Ireland.  The Joint Declaration was a great advance, as were the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985 and the ceasefires of August and October last.  These two documents published today, particularly the Joint Framework Document, are in that tradition of fairness, equality and parity of esteem.  While the Joint Framework Document is not a solution in itself it is another very important stepping stone on the long, slow road to a resolution of the problems in Northern Ireland, to ensuring that the conflict endemic there for so long will cease for all time.  For that reason I recommend this document for what it is, a worth-while agenda on which to start a dialogue so badly needed.  I recommend that to the parties in Northern Ireland, to the people there and urgently enjoin them to accept it in the spirit in which the two Governments have offered it and to avail of the opportunity it affords them.</P>

Ní chuireann an córas nua seo brú ar éinne ach amháin, b'fhéidir, brú chun cainte, agus ní dhéanfaidh sin dochar d'éinne. Tá sé i bhfad níos fearr go mbeadh caint agus díospóireacht ar siúl in ionad marú lá i ndiaidh lae.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mar sin tá súil agam go leanfaidh an tsíocháin atá sa tuaisceart faoi láthair, agus go mbeidh dul chun cinn ann <Col N="1403" /> freisin sa chóras polaitíochta de bharr an doiciméid seo.</P>
    <P>This document launched today will help to continue the peace process in Northern Ireland.  It is a sign of our maturity here that all sides have welcomed its publication, that there is no waving of the green flag as happened in the past, that all people are responsible and clearly see the difficulties involved in Northern Ireland if we do not all pull together and make an effort to continue the peace process.</P>
    <P>There are two differing views.  This document has been described in advance of its publication as balanced. Now that it has been produced it is quite clear that its contents make every effort to bring both sides together, that nobody is under pressure to accept its contents totally.  They are entitled to discuss them, sit down with people who may have differing views and reach an agreement.  That is what we all hope will happen.  We cannot have or witness any more the type of life in Northern Ireland that obtained there over the past 25 years.  I had a special interest because my sister has lived there for over 30 years.  I have heard many experts talk about it, some of whom challenged me politically when canvassing, but they were never in Northern Ireland.  One must be there to understand how the people living there feel.  I happened to be there on the eve of the Twelfth of July when preparations and rehearsals were taking place for the parades the following day. I have to admit that they were very colourful and enjoyable, but I knew exactly how the people living there felt about this demonstration, that it was putting them down, reminding them of the past.  While history has been described by some wit as a thing of the past, on many occasions it does not help to go back too far.  Perhaps it is time to forget the Battle of the Boyne.  Perhaps on this side there are things we should forget too, allowing everybody live in the present in peace.</P>
    <P>Today we should be magnanimous <Col N="1404" /> with one another here in the South.  The Taoiseach has been an excellent ambassador for us in the launching of this document in Belfast and has been magnanimous in the House in paying tribute to his predecessor, Deputy Albert Reynolds.  I join other Members in wishing Deputy Reynolds every success in the future and I thank him for what he did in setting about the production of this document.  I know it was tough at times but he can have the satisfaction of knowing that it has at last been published.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment also the Sinn Féin Party who, over the years, led a different type of life from that they are now leading.  It cannot have been easy for many of them to consider the concept of peace, so many having spent almost 25 years as liberators, as they perceived themselves.  Perhaps we perceived them here in a different light.  It is to their credit that they have accepted peace and brought a new kind of life to Northern Ireland which I hope will continue for many years.  I hope that when they sit around the table they will agree to disagree with others holding different views.</P>
    <P>I compliment Mr. John Major.  He is not in a strong position in the House of Commons but he has withstood attacks and threats and the danger of his Government collapsing.  He could have taken the soft option.  Perhaps if he had been in office in the 1970s we might not have had the problems we encountered up until recently.</P>
    <P>This document allows people to discuss the concept of Northern Ireland. People of differing views will find it difficult to talk to people with whom they may have fought in the past &mdash; there were gunmen on both sides &mdash; and people who did not believe in the use of the gun held still different views.  I hope people in the North will be able to have discussions.  I was heartened by the views expressed on television tonight by people interviewed on the street.  When asked how they felt about the document, they all, with the exception of <Col N="1405" /> one, said that it should be discussed. The document is geared towards those people.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Michael McDowell on Tuesday, 14 February 1995:</P>
    <P>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete &ldquo;now&rdquo; and to add at the end of the motion &ldquo;this day nine months&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Section 22 clarifies the law on a statement of opinion.  This is another extremely important provision and this defence is intended to protect expressions of opinion on matters of public interest.  It is crucial that the law should vindicate the freedom to hold and express opinions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes to rename the defence of &ldquo;fair comment&rdquo; and call it &ldquo;comment based on fact&rdquo;.  It sets out in clear language what the defendant must prove to avail of the defence.  In particular, the defendant must show that the comment was on a matter of public interest.  It further relaxes the strict liability that has hitherto prevailed by making it clear that if a defendant has exercised reasonable care to ascertain the facts on which the comment was based, he will not forfeit the defence if he cannot prove the truth subsequently in court.  That will considerably assist responsible journalists to do their job properly, but will not assist journalists and others who have bandied about <Col N="1406" /> false and unfounded allegations in a careless or reckless manner.</P>
    <P>The Bill replaces the defence now known as &ldquo;justification&rdquo; with a new defence, &ldquo;the defence of truth&rdquo;.  It makes clear that where truth is pleaded and the plaintiff proves sufficient facts to extract the sting or substance of the matter complained of, a failure by the defendant to prove the truth of minor and irrelevant details should not be fatal.</P>
    <P>It makes it a defence to a claim for general damages that the publisher took reasonable care to ascertain the truth. That relaxes the position of strict liability that has hitherto prevailed.  Currently where a defamatory statement is published regardless of how innocently or how much care is taken the publisher is liable.  It is important to note that the defence of &ldquo;reasonable care&rdquo; is not available as a defence in applications for a declaratory judgment, nor will it be a defence to a claim for special damages, such as financial loss.</P>
    <P>There is no difference at present in libel law between an honest mistake and a malicious lie.  A person who is accidentally photographed coming out of court may be connected visually with two other people who were being photographed.That can give rise to an accidental libel.  Some distinction should be made between an accidental defamation and a malicious publication which would injure the reputation of the person.</P>
    <P>The Bill also includes provisions for guidance to the court in making awards for damages.  In some cases the manner in which defendants try to defend a statement or alleged libel claim can turn a jury against them.  If in trying to defend themselves they end up slinging more mud at the plaintiff, the jury can turn against them and exacerbate the damages for which they will be liable.  In the case of Jeffrey Archer there was so much mud flying due to the efforts of the defendants to prove their allegations the defence exacerbated the original libel, and he ended up getting £500,000. The Bill clarifies the roles of the judge <Col N="1407" /> and jury and provides a right of action in certain circumstances where a group or class of persons is defamed.</P>
    <P>It is not widely known that one can be sued for libel without having written a word.  Printers and distributors are regularly included in writs.  In 1980 when <i>Magill</i> magazine prepared to publish an account of the arms trial a solicitor's letter threatening a writ was sufficient to frighten the printer.  That part of the magazine had to be printed in England because the solicitor's letter threatened a civil bill although the article was not libellous and nobody sued on foot of it.</P>
    <P>In a separate part the Bill implements the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission on the crime of libel by setting out in statutory form the ingredients of the offence and abolishing the crimes of seditious and obscene libel.</P>
    <P>It deals also with the subject matter of a Bill we published around the time of Ms Susan O'Keeffe's trial and incorporates its provisions which were circulated by my party before Christmas.  It provides limited protection for journalists who refuse to disclose in court the sources of their information.  The judge may only order disclosures where it is necessary in the interests of justice, national security or to prevent disorder or crime and journalists may only be prosecuted for contempt in circumstances where the disclosure was necessary in those interests.  The clearing of Ms Susan O'Keeffe's name was largely due to the fancy and elegant intellectual &ldquo;footwork&rdquo; of her counsel rather than any sense of justice in our present law as it applies.</P>
    <P>I outlined last night how the fear engendered by a civil bill in relation to libel can stop matters of public interest being brought into the public domain and has unnecessarily stifled the freedom of the press.</P>

      <P>I will examine the Bill from the point of view of the current law on defamation and my colleague, Deputy Kemmy, will consider some practical applications of the law as it stands.  Like many other Deputies, I have been consulted on this by the newspaper industry.  I do not consider that the law currently restricts the freedom of the press as much as members of the press would like us to believe it does.</P>
      <P>I am aware of problems and I have had discussions with representatives of the provincial and regional newspapers who indicated they are experiencing particular problems with the current libel legislation.  Many of them indicated they could not afford libel insurance even when it is available because of prohibitive premia.  They have also indicated that about 95 per cent of claims arise from accidental typographical errors or minor defamations, mainly from problems in the area of court reporting.  That is a significant statistic and one the Bill tries to address.  They have indicated also that the right to have a defamation or incorrect report corrected expeditiously cannot always be done speedily because of the methodology applied and insistence on agreement to corrections and apologies. These would be the concerns of regional newspapers.  I have listened carefully to them because I know of three or four who employ about 200 people.  That is a fairly significant group and it is important to disseminators of vital information in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tort of defamation represents the law's considered response to a number of competing interests.  The idea behind defamation law is to strike a balance between two competing interests, namely, the protection of reputation and the protection of freedom of speech.  A defendant who has told the <Col N="1409" /> truth has nothing to fear from the law of defamation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>He should not put himself into such a position.  If a newspaper comes into possession of information about a person and is not sure whether it is true it should not be published. That may sound basic but that is how I would interpret how a newspaper should act.  Up to the time of the publication of this Bill by Deputy McDowell of the Progressive Democrats there was no statutory definition of defamation. Section 6 of the Bill sets out to rectify what I perceive as a major problem in the area of defamation.  We had to rely on the common law.  The <i>Irish Law of Torts</i> by McMahon &amp; Binchy, page 609, states:</P>
      <P>Defamation is committed by the wrongful publication of a false statement about a person, which tends to lower that person in the eyes of rightthinking members of society or tends to hold that person up to hatred, ridicule or contempt, or causes that person to be shunned or avoided by right thinking members of society.</P>
      <P>This definition derives its authority from judicial pronouncements, and unlike a statutory definition which Deputy McDowell proposes, is capable of extension and further extrapolation and is not rigid.  The problem arises as to whether a matter is to be considered defamatory because of what right thinking members of society in fact think or because of what they ought to think.  It involves a consideration of the standards of the community and the position of the plaintiff in that community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear from the judicial decisions that courts must apply community norms rather than apply its value judgment as to how right thinking members of society ought to regard the plaintiff.  Section 6 of the Bill deals with these problems and the statutory definition of defamation serves as a useful starting point.  Publication is obviously <Col N="1410" /> an essential ingredient of the tort, and communication must be to a person other than the plaintiff, as the kernal of the action for defamation is that the false statement tended to lower the plaintiff in the eyes of right thinking members of society.</P>
    <P>Usually the normal communication method of publication is language, i.e by words, spoken or written.  Section 14 (2) of the Defamation Act, 1961, explicitly recognises that there are other forms of communication, and refers to &ldquo;visual images, gestures and other methods of signifying meaning&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The present law draws a distinction between libel and slander, and essentially the position is that if the defamatory statement is made in permanent form it is libel, but if it is made in an impermanent or transient form it is slander.The Bill before the House seeks to abolish the distinction between both but it is an important saving point to which I will refer later.  It should also be noted that a libel may be a crime as well as a tort, and may thus be the subject of criminal proceedings and further from a tort point of view, libel is actionable <i>per se</i>, whereas in general the plaintiff in a slander action, must prove special damages.</P>
    <P>The time frame analysis in relation to the current mores of society and indeed the location of the society in which the plaintiff participates in defamation actions are important, as social values change from time to time, from place to place and from society to society.  In an examination of the current position applicable to defamation law the functions of the judge and jury are worth examining.  It is for the judge to say at the outset whether the words uttered are capable of defamatory meaning in law.  If he so decides, it is for the jury to decide whether the words in fact have a defamatory meaning in the circumstances as presented before the court. Unlike my senior colleague here I have been involved only in a few defamation cases.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the Defamatory Act, 1961, made provision whereby a person <Col N="1411" /> who innocently published defamatory material about another could have an opportunity to make an offer of amends.  Under this section the offer must be expressed to be made for the purposes of the section and must be accompanied by an affidavit of the facts relied upon to show the defendant's innocence.  It was tight and rigid in that respect.  The Bill would attempt to examine that aspect in a wider context.</P>
    <P>There is a number of defences available to a defendant in a defamation action as follows: justification, privilege &mdash; absolute and qualified &mdash; fair comment, consent, apology and offer of amends.  I will deal briefly with a few of the foregoing defences.</P>
    <P>The justification defence obliges the defendant to prove the truth of the alleged defamatory statement.  Deputy McDowell said that was the real problem.Where this defence is available, it is a total defence and cannot be destroyed even by showing malice on the part of the defendant or that the defendant believed that statement to be false when he made it.</P>
    <P>It is for the defendant to plead the truth of the statement and not for the plaintiff to show that the defamation was false.  Once the plaintiff shows the statement to be defamatory the presumption arises that it is false and the onus is on the defendant to justify.  This is where I would have difficulty with section 9 and the thrust of the Bill &mdash; a matter to which I will refer later. Accordingly, if the defendant fails in his defence to justify the statement, and in effect has persisted with what amounts to a lie, he may well have to pay aggravated damages for having done so.  I agree with that and would differ from Deputy McDowell here, as the defence is established by the defendant if he can prove that the defamatory statement is substantially true, even if it is not true in every detail.  The defendant has a reasonable opportunity to establish the veracity of what he is saying and that is as far as it should go.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1412" /> In some circumstances the law considers that the public interest in the freedom of speech can be best served by ensuring uninhibited expression.  Such an occasion is said to be privileged in law.  Privilege is either absolute or qualified.When it is absolute, the defendant is totally protected in respect of any statements made by him.  I note that section 17 abolishes the rule of law that communications between members of the executive are absolutely privileged. I support the inclusion of that section in any forthcoming Bill on defamation.</P>
    <P>Malice destroys qualified privilege but not absolute privilege.  A person who makes a statement on such occasions is protected provided he or she was not motivated by malice in making the statement.  If you make a statement because you have a duty to speak or because you are obliged to protect an interest, those statements are privileged provided no malice is involved.</P>
    <P>It is against the foregoing background that the Law Reform Commission in 1989 was given a wide brief by the then Attorney General to submit proposals for reform of the law of defamation, both civil and criminal, and contempt of court.  The civil law aspects of Deputy McDowell's Bill which we are debating draw heavily upon the Law Reform Commission recommendations, but his Bill also deals with the criminal defamation area and contempt of court.</P>
    <P>The main changes which it proposes in the existing law of civil defamation include the following: (a) the distinction between libel and slander would be abolished; (b) plaintiff would have to prove that the allegedly defamatory material was false, whereas at present, if the material is proved to be defamatory it is for the defendant to show it is true; (c) new remedies are proposed which would aim to shift the focus away from high damages awards and (d) the defences available in defamation actions would be recast with the aim of making them clearer and more comprehensible. That is a laudable provision which should be supported.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1413" /> It should be clear that this is a complex area of law to which much time must be devoted to tease out the various issues which have the potential to be controversial.  There are different interests which need to be reconciled. On the one hand, the media in particular would be anxious to see some liberalisation of defamation law.  It has been said that they find themselves constrained by unduly harsh defamatory laws.  On the other hand, individual citizens are concerned that the law should offer them the appropriate mechanism to vindicate their reputation should they feel that their character has been impugned.</P>
    <P>The complexity that arises in this area involves striking a balance which necessitates a review of constitutional law, statute law and common law. Accordingly, I am in total agreement with the procedure adopted by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform in tabling an amendment to allow the Bill to be read a Second Time in nine months' time.  This will allow an opportunity for debate, critical analysis and evaluation of this complex subject.</P>
    <P>The proposal to abolish the distinction between libel and slander is in accord with the Law Reform Commission report which advocated that there should be a new cause of action in defamation in which proof of special damage is not necessary.  This proposal is worthy of support.  I would not be happy to support the change in the law proposed in section 9 which places the burden of proof on the plaintiff to show that the matter contained in the publication was defamatory which necessitates the establishment of its falsity, and that the defamatory matter concerned the plaintiff.  Currently, as I said, the burden is on the defendant in a defamation action to establish the truth of the statement if the defence of justification is raised.</P>
    <P>I note that the proposal now included in the Bill was the product of a majority decision of the Law Reform Commission who supported the abolition of the presumption of falsity of defamatory <Col N="1414" /> statements.  The current legal position where a defendant must substantiate the defamatory statements which they are alleged to have made should be retained.</P>
    <P>I agree with the thrust of sections 11 and 12 which respectively deal with offer of apologies and lodgement in courts.  The provisions of section 12 allow for the same procedure concerning lodgements which is currently pursued with other civil actions in tort to be adopted in cases of defamation.  It is right and proper that this procedure be standardised in the fashion set out in section 12.</P>
    <P>Currently the main remedy available in defamation actions is damages.  The Bill attempts to address this approach by providing for alternative remedies. In particular it focuses on applications for declaratory judgments in lieu of damages as set out in section 8 and declaratory and corrective order as set out in section 13.  These procedures undoubtedly have the aim of providing a plaintiff with a cheap and speedy mechanism for vindicating their right to a good name.  These proposals should be carefully examined and explored during the course of this debate and in the intervening time proposed by the Minister for evaluation of the matter.</P>
    <P>There is a view abroad that the level of damages is too high.  Section 27 sets out various factors which a court should take cognisance of in making an award of general damages.  This is a useful starting point, but I anticipate that the factors enumerated in section 27 are not exhaustive and would focus on acts and omissions on the part of the defendant in the assessment of damages.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, section 26 effectively deprives a person whose reputation has been damaged of any award of general damages if the defendant newspaper manages to satisfy the court that it tried to get it right, and that it exercised reasonable care before publication of the material.  The problem with this &mdash; I am open to correction &mdash; is that the court might well accept that the plaintiff has suffered substantial <Col N="1415" /> damages, some of which cannot be quantified, which are in effect intan-gible, such as loss of financial opportunities.Perhaps this provision could be considered before the Bill comes back to the House.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that a single publication will only give rise to a single cause of action.  This has the effect of abolishing the rule of law under which each legal innuendo in a single publication gives rise to a separate and distinct cause of action.  This is a sensible streamlining provision and is in accord with recommendation 14.4 of the Law Reform Commission report.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell, and his party, have served a useful purpose in bringing forward this Bill.  I appeal to them to accept the amendment put forward by the Minister to allow a period of time for due consideration and debate of the subject.  I am sure the Minister will consider a number of the worthwhile proposals in the Bill and will note my reservations and those of other Deputies about aspects of it.  I hope he will bring forward a Bill that will meet some of the problems experienced by the newspaper industry.  I do not agree that current defamation laws have restricted freedom of the press in reporting and investigation.</P>

      <P>The press and other sections of the media made a good case in lobbying all Deputies for a Bill such as this.  It certainly created an awareness among politicians, if not among the public, of the need to bring about changes and progressive reform in this field. Deputy McDowell responded to the case made by the media by introducing this Bill.</P>

      <P>I still publish material.  I have been defamed and libelled but I never took an action against any publication.The purpose of the Bill is to clarity the law on defamation.  It proposes a number of reforms which include making a distinction between libel and slander.The plaintiff will have to prove that allegedly defamatory material is false. There is an old saying in the newspaper industry, the greater the truth, the greater the libel.  I think it is Deputy McDowell's intention to make changes in that regard and I agree with that.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes that where the court is satisfied that reasonable care has been taken before publication of material, no damages will be awarded. It also proposes changes in regard to contempt of court.  If the Bill is passed cases such as that involving Susan O'Keeffe may not arise.  Without putting words in his mouth, I think Deputy McDowell might also have had such cases in mind.</P>
      <P>The Bill follows on from the Law Reform Commission reports on defamation and libel.  A balance must be struck between freedom of expression, freedom of the press, fair comment and justice for individuals and associations. As Deputy Penrose said, this is not all one way traffic.  We have heard very little from newspapers about their obligation to look at their own record and put their house in order.  They have been very loud in their campaigns and in lobbying us &mdash; and we have responded to them &mdash; but they must also put their house in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legal profession also needs to put its house in order.  It has been stated by newspapers that some members of the legal profession are constantly on the look out for libel and defamation cases which are normally settled out of court. We have seen many examples of such cases.  One or two Members of this House have become fairly wealthy as a result of settling cases out of court.  During their campaign for a change in the <Col N="1417" /> law, the newspapers said they could not do their duty and were being inhibited and handicapped by the law.  They also said that the threat of being sued inhibited them from publishing certain information and making free comment. I will refer to this point later.</P>
    <P>Local and national newspapers have paid out much money in settling cases which they do not consider were scandalous, libellous or defamatory in nature.  However, there have been disturbing trends in newspapers which have not been alluded to by them.  I am not squeamish about newspapers; I am a robust performer and I can give as good as I get.  However, I am worried about some of the changes in the newspapers, especially the Sunday newspapers.Many editors now favour headlines which will cause hype and sensation and to boost circulation and they push freedom of expression to new limits.  I wonder about these new limits and question whether the use of four letter words and salacious material does anything to help freedom of expression in our society.</P>
    <P>I am not attacking journalists, many of whom are paid a modest wage to do a difficult job which, as we have seen in recent times, has a certain element of danger attached to it.  Rather I am talking about the so-called personality columnists who are paid as much as £500 per week to write an article.  I have been told that one celebrated journalist is paid £1,000 for her article.  I do not begrudge her this money but it seems to be out of line with the salary paid to ordinary journalists who work from nine to five and sometimes work antisocial hours.  Personality columnists use provocative and controversial language and make attacks on individuals.  It is a personalised form of journalism, a new form of journalism in Ireland.  These articles are spattered with abusive language and four letter words.</P>
    <P>I read all the Sunday newspapers and for the past two years the <i>Sunday Independent</i> has had a bias against the Labour Party, including me.  One of these <Col N="1418" /> columnists is a Senator with a stockbroking background.  Even though his party is in Government, he is still intent on attacking the Labour Party.  I hope he will desist from making these attacks.</P>

I am against this kind of invective and scurrilous abuse of innocent people.  I am not against banter but some of the people who engage in this type of tirade are no paragons of virtue.  Their record would not stand up to much scrutiny and their selfrighteousness does not impress me at all.  One would think that butter would not melt in their mouth, but if one checks their background one will find that they have had chequered careers.  I am not talking about typographical errors, banter, innocent mistakes or honest criticism, all of which are healthy for society.  Neither am I referring to a journalist's right to comment freely on issues of the day.  Rather I am referring to innocent people who are wronged by newspapers and who ask for an apology which is often less than fulsome.  These are the people we should be defending.</P>
      <P>This is not a black and white issue.  It is very easy to talk about a free press, but what does it really mean?  More wealthy people and monopolies are taking control of the newspapers.  Does this represent a free press?  This issue needs to be re-examined.  Nothing will be lost by waiting another few months to ensure a proper balance in this area.  I support the Bill by and large.  The Deputy has done a good day's work and if the measures proposed by him in the legislation are carried through by the media then we will have a better and healthier society.</P>

      <P>I am as pure as the driven snow.  I welcome the Bill in principle as a genuine effort to modernise and reform the law on defamation.  Centuries of judge-made law, intertwined with the Defamation Act, 1961, has led to this area of the law being perceived as too complex.  There is a heightened perception in the media that the scales of justice are tilted against them.  I presume that that is what the lobbying was about.</P>
      <P>A former Member of the House used to ask if his name was spelt properly in the newspapers and whether it was in large print &mdash; that was what mattered to him at the end of the day.  Not everybody would agree with that view.  I had the unpleasant experience whereby something which was innocently said in the House was carried in the media and almost led to the extinction of my family, so to speak.  I had a particular belief at that time and I maintained my position and things worked out all right.  I therefore have some understanding of the fears and concerns of ordinary people who find themselves in this position.</P>
      <P>The reports of the Law Reform Commission were both necessary and timely. Deputy McDowell's Bill is mainly based on the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  While the Commission undoubtedly devoted a great deal of time, energy and expertise to this topic and produced an excellent report, we should reflect deeply before enacting all the provisions in the Bill. Many of the provisions are uncontroversial and merit speedy enactment as worth-while reforms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1420" /> It has to be remembered that the basic strategy of the law of defamation is to strike a balance between two important constitutional rights &mdash; the right of the individual to the protection of the law for his or her good name and the right of everyone to freedom of expression.  Reconciling these two rights to the maximum degree possible has to be the goal of the law of defamation and it is against this objective this Bill must be considered and judged.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the old torts of libel and slander and their replacement with the new tort of defamation is good.  The distinction between libel and slander is no longer of sufficient relevance to justify maintaining the two different types of defamation.  Confusion and unnecessary complexity are the only obvious results of maintaining these two old versions of defamation.</P>
    <P>As is apparent from the report of the Law Reform Commission and this debate, the proposed damage and the aspect of the Bill has given rise to greatest concern and controversy is the shifting of the burden of proof of defamation.In this Bill this change arises from the combined effect of the definition of defamation as contained in section 6 together with the burden of proof imposed on a plaintiff by section 9.  The results of the interaction of these sections is that, <i>inter alia</i>, a plaintiff must prove that the publication which is alleged to be defamatory is untrue.</P>
    <P>This would undoubtedly be a radical change in our defamation law.  The burden of proof would be transferred to the plaintiff.  The media very strongly advocated this change arguing that under existing law it is open to a plaintiff who knows a published statement is true to, nonetheless, sue successfully for defamation because the plaintiff knows that the defendant will not be able to bring into court admissible evidence which is of sufficient weight to prove the truth of the statement concerned.  They argue that this present state of the law is an unfair and unjust fetter on them in the discharge of their role.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1421" /> There can be no doubt there is considerable merit in this point of view in light of the experiences of cases over the past 20 years or so.  It must be asked whether the proposed change results in striking a fair balance between the right of an individual to his good name and the right of the media and, indeed, all citizens to freedom of expression.</P>
    <P>To resolve this question a consideration of what is likely to happen in practice if this change is enacted is helpful.  I accept the view that in most cases there would be very little difference in practice.Under existing law, even where the truth of the allegation is not at issue, a plaintiff in his evidence usually deals with the fact that the statement is untrue and how that untruth has affected him. In so doing he will normally present a portrait of himself or herself to the jury or to the judge which illustrates the untruth of the alleged defamatory statement.Under the proposed change, in most cases proving that the alleged defamatory statement is untrue will, in all probability, come down to the same thing, namely, the plaintiff in his own evidence denying the truth of the allegation and asserting his own good name in the context of the alleged defamatory matter.</P>
    <P>If a defendant wishes to pursue his contention that the statement is true he will have to produce admissible evidence of sufficient weight to convince the jury or the judge that the plaintiff's case should not be accepted.  If the defendant is unable to produce such evidence the plaintiff's case will prevail. While this may be so in most cases there will be a small but significant number of cases where the burden placed by this change on a plaintiff might be too heavy and, thus, injustice could result.</P>
    <P>I have in mind cases where the alleged defamatory statement or statements are part of or a result of an extensive investigation conducted by either the print or broadcast media into the affairs of an individual.  In such circumstances it is foreseeable that the individual might lack the resources, skills and experience to deal effectively with the <Col N="1422" /> situation and might, for that reason alone, be unable to protect his or her good name.  Having to prove that the alleged defamatory statements were untrue could be too heavy a burden for a person of modest means to bear against the might of the media.</P>
    <P>Before going ahead with this change careful thought should be given to such a situation which, as we all know, is a familiar and worth-while part of modern media activity.  It is essential to ensure that the proposed change does not simply replace one injustice with another, the latter being perhaps worse than the first.</P>
    <P>Section 11 which provides that making an apology cannot be construed as an admission of liability is welcome.  It should encourage defendants in cases where it would be appropriate to make an apology without the fear of being penalised.  Provisions in section 12 which enable a defendant to lodge money in court on the same basis as in other civil actions will enable defendants to meet cases on a basis which limits their risk or exposure and, as such, is to be welcomed.This section should also have the effect of ensuring that fewer cases go to trial thereby saving costs.</P>
    <P>The reform envisaged by section 8 is an excellent idea.  Under this section a plaintiff can make a speedy application to a court and can obtain a declaration that the statement was false and defamatory.  This is a valuable procedure for someone whose only concern is to clear their name as expeditiously and quickly as possible, and is not interested in recovering damages.  The downside of this procedure from a plaintiff's point of view is that if it is availed of a claim for damages cannot be pursued later.  This in itself may not always be bad.  As the Bill stands, however, it is open to two practices on the part of defendants which could seriously damage the effectiveness of this proposed reform.</P>
    <P>The first is where a plaintiff is pursuing a claim for damages which, in the circumstances, could be meritorious.  He is likely to be attacked for not availing <Col N="1423" /> of the procedure under section 8 and to be accused of being interested only in money and not in the protection of his good name.  In a meritorious claim for damages this kind of attack would be very unfair to the plaintiff.  A suitable amendment is required to prevent defendants during a trial where damages are claimed from mentioning that the plaintiff has not availed of the procedure under section 8.</P>
    <P>The second problem under this procedure is that where a plaintiff decided to opt for it on the basis of clearing his name as fast as possible but foregoing the prospect of claiming damages later, it is open to a defendant under the Bill as it stands to mount a full defence to the plaintiff's application.  This would put the plaintiff in the worst of all worlds &mdash; he would not get his speedy vindication and he would have forfeited the prospect of damages as a means of clearing his name.</P>
    <P>This defect has the potential to ruin the effectiveness of this remedy and, to save the section from this, it would be necessary to amend it to add a provision to the effect that in an application under section 8, where the defendant puts in a defence which raised some or all of the defences available to the defendant, the court should have discretion on the application of the plaintiff to convert the application under section 8 into a full action for defamation, including, if the plaintiff so wishes, a claim for damages.</P>

      <P>Sections 22 and 26 give rise to real concern for the protection of a right of a person to his or her good name.  These sections provide a defendant who has been found by a court to have published a defamatory statement with a defence to general damages where the defendant shows that reasonable care was exercised by the defendant in ascertaining the truth of the defamatory statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1424" /> The problem with this defence is that it will be so difficult for a court to decide what is &ldquo;reasonable care&rdquo;.  Presumably, a reporter takes &ldquo;reasonable care&rdquo; by checking a story with various sources to satisfy himself or herself of the truth of the story.  It is to be anticipated that journalists, being true to their own ethics and replying to section 43 of the Bill, will refuse to reveal the identity of their sources.  If this defence were to be available in these circumstances it would, obviously, be a grotesque failure to vindicate the right of a person to his or her good name.</P>
    <P>As a minimum this defence could not be available to a defendant in a situation in which the defendant was unwilling to reveal the identity, in advance of the trial, of the sources on which he or she relied in putting the story together. Apart from this it is, at the very least, arguable that where a defendant has been found by a court to have published a defamatory statement, that having taken it on themselves to publish, they should be obliged to compensate for the damage that has resulted to a reputation where the initiative in publishing was entirely that of the defendant's.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy with section 27 (5) which permits both plaintiffs and defendants to address a jury on the amount of damages.  It seems to be undesirable in principle.  The purpose of a jury in these cases is that they bring their knowledge of life and, in particular, monetary values to bear on the question of damages unfettered by any overbearing pressure or control by either contending lawyers or the judge in the case.  If the contending lawyers were permitted to mention and argue about particular figures and if the judge had the obligation to give the jury guidance on specific amounts, it would defeat the purpose of a jury in the first place.  This provision might also open up the prospect of an unseemly option before the jury.</P>
    <P>As I said, this Bill is a move in the right direction.  Certain parts require more reflection before they can be comfortably accepted, in particular the <Col N="1425" /> change in the onus of proof.  A number of other provisions can, as I indicated, benefit from some amendment and we will put these forward on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I endorse remarks made by my colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, in regard to defaming the dead.  We, on this side of the House, are firmly of the view that the law should be reformed in this regard and a legal remedy provided to the next-of-kin of a deceased person who has been defamed.  This remedy should be in the form of a declaration by a court and we will table an amendment to achieve this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>We are in favour of a new defamation Act to replace both the common law provisions and the Defamation Act, 1961.  We generally favour the new scheme of defamation law put forward by the Law Reform Commission and in this Bill.  We are concerned about the proposed change in the burden of proof of the untruth of a statement from the defendant to the plaintiff who claims to have been defamed.  We want to see this crucial issue teased out in greater detail on Committee Stage.  We favour a new proposed quick procedure for clearing a person's name in the form of a declaration in lieu of damages.  The present proposal would need at least two important amendments to make it acceptable and effective.</P>
    <P>We are in favour of the new process for an apology without an admission of liability but we are not in favour of a defendant escaping liability on the basis of taking reasonable care, especially where disclosure of sources is refused. In principle it may be unfair to a person who is the victim of a defamatory publication over which they have no control to be deprived of proper compensation on the basis that the publisher may have taken reasonable care, but at the same time published an untrue statement.</P>
    <P>We support the proposal to give the Bill a Second Reading in principle but it needs substantial amendment on Committee Stage.  In addition to remedies in the Bill, there should also be a <Col N="1426" /> remedy in the form of a declaration that a statement concerning a deceased person is false.  I suggest that there should be a media Ombudsperson, funded by the media, to deal with complaints about unfair treatment by the media.  If these steps are taken it would lead to a fair balance between freedom of speech and the protection of the reputation of the individual.  May I share my time with my two colleagues?</P>

      <P>This Bill is like a bag of liquorice all sorts &mdash; one may like some parts, but not others.  That is why it is important that we retain sections which need to be reformed and which must be addressed by the House.  The State goes out of its way in its laws to guarantee, respect and vindicate the personal rights of the individual.  It goes even further to protect the individual from unjust attack, to vindicate their good name and the property rights of each citizen.</P>
      <P>As politicians we should keep that in mind because we are buffeted every day by attacks.  At the same time we must be conscious of our immediate families and protect them from any transgressions which might befall them.  Over and above that we have a duty to those we represent to ensure that any legislation we enact does not diminish their rights should they be wronged, particularly by the media.  The question we must tease out is how can we maintain a balance between the right of the media and the right of the individual? In my view this Bill seeks to change the balance which has existed in favour of the media.  That is something which requires careful scrutiny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes that if a newspaper publishes a column which is seen by an individual to be false, incorrect or, indeed, damaging, the onus is transferred to the individual to prove that he or she has been sinned against.  This is a dramatic transformation and begs the question as to whether the plaintiff and <Col N="1427" /> the defendant should be on a level playing pitch if an action is taken.  I ask that because it was not a level playing pitch when the attack was made on the individual.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission report on which the Bill is based suggests that one right should not necessarily give way to another.  As a layman who is not imbued with an acute legal knowledge, it seems to me that a person is innocent until proven guilty and that if the media makes a charge it is natural justice that we demand that it justifies that claim. A further difficulty arises in the present legislation where an erroneous claim has been made against an individual and retractions are made.  Unfortunately, the retraction often does not get the same prominence as the original claim. Those in political life could argue that when aspersions, false or otherwise, are cast about two thirds will stick to the individual concerned.</P>
    <P>An individual would be entitled to damages if, for example, a journalist said they did their best to get at the truth and that their usual source was extremely reliable and must be protected.Under the Bill no damages would be paid in circumstances where it is deemed that reasonable care has been taken.  The difficulty I have is that reasonable care is not defined in the Bill and this could encourage the emergence of the gutter press.  Many speakers who defended the press said it has been extremely responsible and, indeed, it has.</P>
    <P>Punitive damages are normally high and carry with them the consequences of the gravity of the allegation.  Section 28 places barriers in the way of the plaintiff obtaining punitive damages. Surely this is not natural justice.  Who will determine what is meant by reckless indifference?  Again, why should the plaintiff be asked to establish reckless indifference?  Why should this be so where no thought is given to the falsity of the situation?  Would it not tempt the author to run the risk and let the plaintiff try to prove reckless indifference? <Col N="1428" /> Surely this cannot be seen as natural justice.  In dealing with this Bill a further problem is posed when one considers that 80 per cent of the print media may soon be owned by multinational firms.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Flaherty recently suggested that politicians should not sue.  It is only right for politicians to claim that they are as entitled to their good name as anyone else.  In promoting the Bill those politicians who contribute to the press are conscious of the fact that they could be accused of pandering to the press.  I make no accusations in that regard.</P>
    <P>In two articles in a Sunday newspaper last week allegations were made against a prominent businessman which were subsequently proved to be correct.  As the research for the articles was soundly based the newspaper in question should have stuck by its story knowing that it was in possession of the facts and that the counter claim was inaccurate.  It did not have the courage of its convictions and backed off rather than go to court. The newspapers, like local authorities, are a soft touch and need to be more aggressive in defending stories which they believe are accurate.</P>
    <P>The soft option is to transfer the onus to provide proof, to minimise the opportunity to obtain realistic damages and the newspaper becomes the winner. There is room for a change in the law. Printers and distributors should be excluded from libel actions given that there is no malice, intent or wrong-doing in fulfilling a contract which does not involve scrutinising the contents closely.</P>
    <P>What would the position be in regard to free legal aid?  Is it not the case that people may not avail of free legal aid in defamation cases?</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  It has been clear for some time that the law on defamation is in need of reform.  It is a complex law and there are constitutional issues which would have to be addressed in changing the legislation.  A balance must be struck between the right to freedom of expression and the right to protect one's good name and reputation.In changing the law one would have to seek to protect the newspapers but in so doing one should not condone or reward unacceptable carelessness at the expense of the individual.</P>
      <P>Many of our newspapers are feeling the chill wind of falling circulation.  The provincial newspapers in particular are finding it difficult to survive because of the advent of local radio and the aggressive marketing campaigns of the national newspapers and the English tabloids.  I am not suggesting that the threat of litigation has contributed to the fall in circulation but editors and sub-editors are now acutely aware of the need to be careful in printing stories.</P>
      <P>The provincial newspapers have made a submission to the Minister on the current position in relation to libel legislation and their experience in this regard.  During the past five years their profits have been halved and many of their members cannot afford to take out libel insurance, even when this is available to them, because the costs are prohibitive.Legal costs attached to settlements and judgments are so high that it is now the norm for members of the provincial newspapers association to agree settlements even when there is a strong indication the claim might not succeed in court.  The danger of the remotest risk of court damages and costs, protracted settlement negotiations and the consequent costs and the failure of current legislation to meet changing circumstances in society are seriously affecting the viability of their businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provincial newspapers claim that the national newspapers can carry the cost of several substantial defamation awards and still survive because of their <Col N="1430" /> large circulation and profitability while one substantial defamation payment could put any provincial newspaper out of business.  In recent years 30 members of the provincial newspapers association have paid out over £2 million in defamation settlements and legal costs.  Up to six or seven years ago the bulk of these cases would have led to the publication of a correction or apology without damages being sought.  Nowadays a correction or apology may be used as evidence in court to support a plaintiff's case.  The provincial newspapers claim that this forms part of the new compensation culture but it is not confined to the newspapers.  Evidence can be found in the local authorities and in recent motor accident claims which ended up in court.</P>
    <P>I am informed that there are issues which are crying out for attention and need to be highlighted but the newspapers will not deal with them because of the fear of litigation and claims for defamation.  In their submission to the Law Reform Commission and the Minister the provincial newspapers made a number of recommendations, some of which are worthy of examination.  They suggest that payment to a court should be allowed and this should not be taken as an admission of liability.  They further suggest that the circulation and the extent of the publication of the defamation should be taken into account; that there should be a limitation period of one year in which to institute claims; that juries should determine guilt or otherwise and that judges should measure the damages to be awarded; that the distinction between slander and libel should be abolished; that there should be a definition of &ldquo;defamation&rdquo; and that in measuring damages a distinction should be made between malicious and irresponsible defamation and accidental defamation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation although I am disappointed the Minister has stated that we will have to wait nine months before Committee Stage is taken.  We will be supporting the Bill on Second Stage.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment Deputy McDowell and the Progressive Democrats for drafting it.  I share the Minister's view however that what is at issue is not a national priority. I can see why he ranks it well down his list of priorities, given the material he is trying to deal with in the run-up to the referendum.</P>
      <P>The present law tries to strike a balance between conflicting interests &mdash; the freedom of expression and the right of the individual to protect his good name and privacy.  The Bill has been influenced by the reports of the Law Reform Commission.  We should not overlook the fact that these reports contain recommendations.  We should not be influenced excessively by recommendations even if they are made by distinguished people.  In the last analysis the Houses of the Oireachtas have to have the final say.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about two sections of the Bill in particular, sections 9 and 26. I would find it hard to accept the fundamental changes proposed in section 9.  It would be wrong to impose the burden of proof on an individual who has been libelled.  This radical change would be quite wrong.  We have to bear in mind that it is difficult to prove or disprove many propositions or statements.  If the obligation or onus was shifted to the plaintiff, in many cases false statements would stand as the plaintiff would not be able to prove that they were false.  It is unfair that citizens should be placed in a situation where the burden is on them to prove their innocence when somebody, for whatever reason, takes the initiative to libel them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second part of the Bill about which I am concerned is section 26.  This relates to the concept whereby general damages would not be available in the event of the defendant having exercised reasonable care before publication.  I <Col N="1432" /> agree with Deputy Batt O'Keeffe that there is not any definition of &ldquo;reasonable care&rdquo; in the Bill.  I am not a lawyer and I share some of the views expressed by other Members of the House in relation to lawyers but I presume a definition of what amounts to &ldquo;reasonable care&rdquo; will become available when a variety of future court cases have established its definition.  However, if a person takes what amounts to &ldquo;reasonable care&rdquo;, are they then in a position to libel other people even when they know that what they are doing is false?  If that is the case it represents a fundamental change and it is an area that should be examined.</P>
    <P>There are many commendable aspects to the Bill.  I agree that where an apology is given it should not necessarily be taken as an admission of liability.I can see why the differences between libel and slander can be merged in the one Bill although if one libels a person, there is a little more to it than saying something which is slanderous.On many occasions such comments are made off the top of the head but if one goes to the bother of writing something a little more effort is involved.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Upton for sharing his time with me.  I do not have time to address all the issues in the Bill.  I congratulate Deputy McDowell and his party for the opportunity to debate this matter.  It is long overdue and I hope, in the context of the forthcoming committees, that we will be able to discuss in committee many of the important Law Reform Commission reports.  I doubt if we would be discussing the law of defamation in the context of the Law Reform Commission consultation paper and its final report if it were not for the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the burden of proof, referred to by earlier speakers, the provision in the Bill represent a major change that is far too sweeping in the circumstances.  At present, one must prove a statement is defamatory and <Col N="1433" /> show loss in the form of damage.  Perhaps we are infringing the rights of our citizens by requiring them to prove their good name in a court of law on foot of an allegation of alleged slander.  We should not place such a burden on a person.There should be a presumption that a person's name is good unless the contrary can be shown.  The constitutional protection given to an individual is the type of safeguard we should retain.</P>
    <P>I realise I do not have sufficient time to deal with my other concern.  I look forward to the Minister's legislation in the coming months and I hope we have an opportunity to deal in some detail with the important matters contained in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies from the various parties for the thoughtful contributions they made in the past two weeks to this Bill.  I did not come into this House with this Bill saying that I had a peculiar insight into these issues which is more valuable than that of other Members of this House. The reverse is the case.  Nor do I come into this House as the cat's-paw of the newspapers trying to produce a libel law that suits them because if anyone compared this Bill with what the national newspapers produced by way of their own model Bill, there are significant differences.Nor do I accept without criticism the Law Reform Commission's view on any issue because, as pointed out in the past few minutes, it is not any more qualified, in the last analysis, to come to judgments on matters of public policy than elected public representatives.I take its views seriously however, and I take any arguments it makes on deficiencies in the existing law with a considerable degree of seriousness.  I found, looking at much of the contents of this Bill which is based, admittedly, on what is recommended, that its arguments were persuasive for the kind of changes it proposed.  The majority of Deputies in this debate have said that they would not have any difficulty with most areas of the Bill and that was a positive aspect of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1434" /> There are a number of areas which were controversial and it is to those that I will now address myself.  The question of the onus of proof caused some difficulty to the Law Reform Commission and to many Members of this House.  It is a question on which it is possible to have different and strongly felt view points.  I am persuaded by the majority view of the Law Reform Commission. which it reached having heard a debate which it generated.  The Law Reform Commission was of an opposite point of view.  It wanted to leave the onus of proof as it was and put that out for discussion.The majority of people who commented on its discussion paper said it was wrong to have, in defamation cases as opposed to other cases such as assault, personal injury and other forms of personal civil litigation, a different standard of proof whereby the plaintiff could go into a court and say that something is defamatory, that they rebut it and that it is up to the defendant to prove it is false.</P>
    <P>I will give a simple example.  If a newspaper printed an article about me to the effect that I accepted a bribe for a vote or for a decision I took in my political life, the very least I must do is go into a witness box &mdash; if I want damages from that newspaper &mdash; and say that I did not take a bribe.  If I want damages for a broken leg, false imprisonment or for a variety of other things, the very least I must do is prove that the elements of the wrong committed to me were committed.  In my view it is wrong &mdash; I agree other people have a different view and the minority in the Law Reform Commission had a particularly strong and virulent view that it would be wrong to change the onus of proof&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to go into court and say that it is defamatory of me to say I took a bribe, I am the person named in the article and I want to hear the evidence that I took a bribe.  That is wrong and I know many Deputies in <Col N="1435" /> this House take a strong view to the contrary.  They believe that the person who alleges that should prove it to be true.  One must bear in mind that the person with most peculiar and special knowledge as to whether anything is true or false is the plaintiff in a defamation action.  If I took a bribe it is something which I know to be true or false and it offends my reason that I could go into a witness box, take an oath as a plaintiff in a defamation action, not address that issue as a matter of choice and obtain vast damages without at least committing myself to the proposition that what was said about me was false.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that proposition.  The Law Reform Commission hit the nail on the head when it said that in the vast majority of cases plaintiffs are quite happy to go into the witness box and say that whatever was said about them of a defamatory nature was untrue.  It is very difficult to envisage circumstances where a plaintiff would get by a jury, in particular but perhaps he could easily get past a judge without actually asserting the falsity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the onus should be firmly on the plaintiff to prove falsity of the issue and in most cases a mere denial is quite sufficient. For instance if a newspaper knew that before I made a decision of a particular kind £50,000 has appeared in my bank account the night before, I could go into the witness box and not advert to that fact and not be cross examined on it for whatever reason and still get damages. Even if a newspaper knew that I was the only person who knew where this money had come from, I think I should be in a position of at least saying that money does not represent a bribe. <Col N="1436" /> Others may disagee and I accept that others have a different point of view&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept that but all I ask is that Deputies look at the Law Reform Commission's report on this matter.  It was of one view but changed its view, and for good reason.  If this House in its wisdom comes to Committee Stage on defamation law and takes the opposite view, I will live with it because, frankly, as the Law Reform Commission said, it does not really matter where the onus of proof lies because in the vast majority of cases a jury will look with slit eyes at a plaintiff who does not actually deny the truth of the allegation that was made against him. That is my strong view but I will not go to the stake for it.  If other Members take a different view, so be it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been canvassed that the present libel law is all that is keeping the media in Ireland from becoming the same as the media in England.  The English media operates under the exact same law as Irish newspapers.  Many Deputies share the very strong view that there should be a mechanism to protect privacy.Whether there should be an Act, as the Law Reform Commission has canvassed to protect people's privacy or alternatively a press counsel, which I favour, which would conserve where necessary decent standards in journalism is a separate question.  Defamation and privacy laws are concerned broadly with the same issues but I do not believe <Col N="1437" /> we should make the mistake of believing that it is the defamation law that keeps Irish newspapers from turning themselves into the <i>Sun</i>.  If an Irish newspaper wants to print something about some one they can prove to be true, no matter how intrusive it may be to the person's privacy, for example if they can prove anything about a Deputy's private life, no matter how irrelevant it is to his or her function as a legislator or as a public representative, they can print it if they can prove it.  It is wrong to confuse privacy law, which I believe needs to be addressed in Ireland and England, with the question of defamation, which is taking away someone's character by saying something that is untrue about them.  The two things though related are first cousins and not brothers, or sisters, to be politically correct.They are not the same and we should not confuse them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kemmy thought I would be surprised at how positive he was about the Bill.  I am not surprised that the great majority of Deputies were positive about the general thrust of the Bill because generally speaking it is obviously aimed to achieve changes that most Members consider fair and right.  I do not claim the credit for the Bill itself because it comes, as I have said, largely from the Law Reform Commission report.  The Deputy went on to discuss the issue of the press and suggested by implication that someone like me had a rose tinted view of the media.  I do not. Like most Members of the House I am worried by the increasing concentration of the Irish media in the hands of very few people.  Deputy O'Malley, the former Leader of my party, took a stance against such concentration and believed it was necessary that the media should be spread and should not be in the hands of a few powerful individuals.  I am deeply concerned that the entire media in this country may fall, like the sets on a monopoly board, into the hands of one or two powerful individuals.It would be wrong if such development were to go unchallenged.  Frankly I would prefer to see competition of a <Col N="1438" /> multinational kind, in the shape of Rupert Murdoch, rather than have all our newspapers owned by one Irish man whoever that person might be.</P>
    <P>Under the present scheme and under the proposed Act there will be no provision for legal aid in libel and slander cases or defamation cases, should the law change.  I think that is correct because we should not go down the road of considering all litigation to be good and that everyone should be assisted to bring every case he possibly can.  I do not believe in that proposition or that litigation is a necessary good &mdash; it is good for a few people, especially lawyers, but it is not necessarily good in a society where there is more and more litigation.  I have never heard of anyone who had been seriously defamed being put off commencing proceedings on the basis that no lawyer would act for him on a no foal, no fee basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what the newspapers are complaining about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore I do not think there is any need for legal aid. Two gentlemen who were convicted by the Circuit Court in Dublin of receiving the proceeds of an armed robbery on a lorry carrying cigarettes were convicted and sentenced to prison and from their prison cells they sued the newspapers that inadvertently published suggestion that the pair were charged with the armed robbery which produced the cigarettes they received.  They recovered damages.  We live in a strange world where people who are in a prison cell convicted of an offence of dishonesty can recover damages from a newspaper in circumstances where most people would raise their eyebrows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that many of those who sue for defamation have really been damaged.  A great many sue because a mistake was made about them and they have got into a state about their reputation to an extent that is unreasonable.  I have seen a great many defamation cases and proposed defamation cases in court and instances <Col N="1439" /> where people were encouraged to bring defamation cases where honest errors were made by the media.  We do not want defamation law, reformed or unreformed, to become an easy kill for people who are the victims of genuine error.  We should have a balance on this issue.  It was suggested in the contribution made by the Minister for Justice and the Minister of State that the crime of defamation is committed by a person who is reckless as to the truth or otherwise of a statement he made.  This Bill abolishes the distinction between libel and slander.  It would be a mistake &mdash; I say this after some consideration &mdash; to make every reckless spoken word the <Col N="1440" /> subject of a possible criminal offence merely because the person is reckless as to whether it was true.  The Bill is preferable in this way to the proposal of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.  I do not believe we should wait nine months for further action.  Now is the time for a Second Reading.  If a Committee Stage debate was imminent the Government would address this important issue urgently.  The nine month postponement is likely to be a postponement of action rather than an opportunity in which the Government could genuinely arrive at a view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate your giving me permission to raise this evening, the potentially very important decision of the Dublin Circuit Court last October which means essentially that, in cases affecting the welfare of children, professional witnesses' interviews with those children, or a video recording of those interviews, cannot be introduced in evidence on the basis that they constitute hearsay evidence.</P>
      <P>When I mention professional witnesses I am thinking of people like child care workers, social workers and so on who interview children in relation to certain proceedings that may be taken in court.  If evidence in this way is not admitted, the only alternative would be for the child to go into open court and give evidence if he or she wants his or her side of the story heard.  Almost invariably a child who goes into open court to give evidence will do so in the physical presence of his or her parents. In most cases, certainly in very many, I would envisage vulnerable young children not being prepared to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In custody cases, for example, when a health board is making an application to take a child into care, it is only right and proper &mdash; I think everybody would agree &mdash; that the child's view point must be taken into account, the child is entitled to be heard and should be heard.  If the only mechanism for hearing the child's view point and feelings about his or her relationship with one or other parent, cannot be ascertained by the court, I do not believe justice will be done, particularly from the child's perspective.  The child's rights must be vindicated.  I have studied how the rule against hearsay evolved and I do not believe that rule was meant to apply to that type of situation.  I do not believe it was meant to be used to exclude the child's point of view in cases that might have a fundamental bearing on the <Col N="1443" /> child's future welfare, in cases where the child is entitled to be heard and in cases where the child's rights must be vindicated.I do not know whether this decision is being appealed but the Government will have to change or clarify the law on this matter.  If that requires legislation, and I think it does, so be it.</P>
    <P>There has been much comment recently, particularly from the Government side of the House about vindicating children's rights.  In the budget child benefit was substantially increased at the expense of social welfare recipients who are not entitled to claim that benefit.That provision was part of an alleged plan to give a basic income to children. We have heard a good deal of rhetoric and promises about vindicating and protecting children's rights.  Unless the law on the position to which I referred is clarified, the Government's commitment to vindicating the rights of children in the fullest possible sense must be in serious doubt.  The only way to turn the rhetoric about protecting children and vindicating their rights into reality is to make the law on the matter very clear to enable the point of view of children to be considered by the court in this case and at the very minimum by allowing a video recording of the interview into evidence.  In many cases a child will not be in a fit mental state to give his or her point of view.  The law needs to be changed in this matter and I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject matter raised by the Deputy must, as I understand it, be based on media coverage of a certain case that was before the Dublin Circuit Court in October last.  The case, it appears, concerned a guardianship matter and as such was heard in camera &mdash; and there was no written decision of the Court.  Like the Deputy, I have no information as to whether may be under appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1444" /> So far as is known, counsel for one of the parties in the case objected to the introduction of any hearsay evidence including, in particular, anything that the child who was the subject of the guardianship proceedings may have said to a social worker involved in the case. It seems the objection was upheld but it was also held that any opinion of the social worker which was founded and based on admissible evidence was admissible in the proceedings.</P>
    <P>The issues raised are being examined by my Department in consultation with the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the rule against hearsay effectively precludes a wide variety of statements from being admitted in evidence in cases coming before the court.  The cases may involve adults or children.  The rule is not confined to statements concerning children.  The rule against hearsay is one of the topics which has been examined by the Law Reform Commission with a view to simplifying and improving court procedures.  In its view the approach which would most effectively deal with the inadequacies in the present law is to provide that, in general, hearsay evidence should be admissible but that certain conditions must be met and specific safeguards observed before it is admitted.I am disposed to this view and when other urgent legislative proposals which I have in hand can be disposed of I intend to deal with the matter as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In so far as hearsay evidence in civil proceedings concerning children is concerned I am aware that there have been calls by some commentators to the effect that our law should be changed in line with changes in the law in England. Its law renders admissible hearsay evidence given in connection with the upbringing, maintenance or welfare of a child.  There are no particular conditions or safeguards to guide its courts on the matter.  I think it could reasonably be argued that if legislative proposals on <Col N="1445" /> those lines were introduced in our law without ado the provisions would undoubtedly raise serious legal questions including questions of constitutionality.For these and other reasons there is a need to examine the matter carefully so that practical and workable provisions can be brought forward to deal with the issues.</P>
    <P>I have already provided important new provisions in the Family Law Bill, 1994, for the protection and support of children following the breakdown of the marriage of their parents.  In so far as family law proceedings in general are concerned the Bill puts the social reporting role of social workers in those proceedings on a statutory basis.  I would, of course, be anxious to build even further on this by clarifying, if necessary, the law on evidence in relation to children.  Any proposals I have on the matter will be announced in the normal way as soon as possible.</P>

The schools are Drimina, Banada, Kilmactigue, Castlerock, Killasser and Carramore.  The first four are in the parish of Kilmactigue in Sligo and the last two are in the parish of Killasser, County Mayo.  Three of the schools, Castlerock, Killasser and Carramore are on the side of the Ox Mountains and are, therefore, remote and in a disadvantaged area.  The parish of Kilmactigue is on the border of County Mayo.  Those schools are under the supervision of two Department inspectors, one in Sligo and one in Mayo. However, until recently all six schools were under the supervision of an inspector living in Castlebar in County Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total number of pupils in the six schools is 295 and of those 51 are in <Col N="1446" /> need of remedial teaching, a figure which is much higher than the national average.  In one school ten children are in urgent need of remedial help, two of those children were mute at the age of five.  In another school nine out of a total of 23 children need remedial attention.</P>
    <P>The North Western Health Board is providing assistance for two children of one family by its flexible use of the day fostering facility allowance.  However, that is not adequate to meet the needs of those children and one child requires speech therapy.  The social worker involved in this case informed me that those children are in urgent need of remedial attention and this can only be properly addressed through the skills of a remedial teacher.  Those are the needs of one family, but a total of 51 children need remedial attention and the majority urgently require remedial teaching skills.</P>
    <P>I note from the Official Report of 7 February 1995 that Banada national school is one of those listed as due to lose a teacher in September 1995.  The need for the appointment of a remedial teacher is very great.  I urge the Minister for Defence and for the Marine, Deputy Coveney, to ask the Minister for Education, or her Minister of State, to redeploy this teacher from Banada national school as a remedial teacher. This would not incur any additional spending by the Department.  The previous speaker referred to children's rights.  The children have their rights in this case.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister for Education &mdash; who is doing wonderful work &mdash; will allocate remedial teachers to the six schools in question.  In particular, I ask the Minister to ensure that Banada national school which is losing one teacher to redeploy that teacher, who knows the area, as a remedial teacher.</P>

      <P>As has been indicated to the House in the past, <Col N="1447" /> remedial education at primary level is a matter in the first instance for the ordinary class teachers.  The majority of pupils with remedial needs would, therefore, be helped within the scope of the normal teaching service.  However, it is acknowledged that remedial teachers constitute the main additional resource for addressing the problem of underachievement in primary schools.</P>
      <P>Substantial additional resources have been allocated to this area in recent years.  In 1994, an additional 100 remedial teachers were appointed to primary schools and 350 schools with approximately 34,000 pupils benefited from this allocation.  This brought the total number of remedial teachers in place to 1,133.  Of the 3,209 ordinary national schools throughout the country, approximately 2,061 now have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-time or on a shared basis.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Education, recently announced her intention to appoint an additional 55 remedial teachers in the current year. Decisions in relation to the allocation of these posts will be made shortly following the collection and analysis of information from schools by the Department's primary inspectorate.  The posts will then be allocated on the basis of priority of need, as indicated by the information collected.</P>
      <P>Of the 76 ordinary national schools in County Sligo, 31 now have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-time or shared basis.  This includes eight schools allocated a remedial service in the current school year as part of the recent distribution of posts.  This means that 68 per cent of the pupils attending ordinary national schools in County Sligo currently enjoy a remedial service.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the schools referred to by him will be considered in the context of the allocation of remedial posts in 1995.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leat as ucht deis a thabhairt dom an cheist seo a ardú ar an athló agus freisin be mhaith liom buíochas a ghabhail leis an Aire Cosanta agus Mara as ucht teacht isteach agus éisteacht liom.  Tá súil agam go gcuirfidh sé an méid atá le rá agam in iúl don Aire Oideachais.</P>
      <P>Ceist í seo a d'ardaigh mé cheana anuraidh ar an dara lá d'Fheabhra agus caithfidh mé a rá gur údar díomá dom nach ndearnadh tada faoi ó shin.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming in to listen to the case I wish to make.  I raised this question last year in the House and I am disappointed that nothing has been done about it since.  For a person living in a remote area, in other words more than three miles from a school bus, or on an offshore island that does not have a secondary school, their entitlement to free education is subject to a means test. The means test is pitched at £9,100 per year and there is an allowance of £299 per child.  In the event of one's income being over the limit, one has to pay the maintenance part of the boarding costs which in the case of most children would be £794 per annum.  A case has been made by the Department, in a previous reply to me, that this is reasonable in view of the savings involved in not having to feed a child at home.  That is a rather weak argument.</P>
      <P>My view on this case is simple. Islanders and people living in remote areas already face higher costs of living &mdash; transport costs etc. &mdash; than those living nearer the centre.  With the advent of five day boarding, islanders have to pay expensive charges in aeroplane flights to the Aran Islands to take the children home at weekends.  Between bus fares and flights, costs amount to at least £30 per weekend.  On top of that to ask them to pay the maintenance cost of boarding is unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1449" /> The number of children involved is small.  Last year I was informed that 87 children were boarding, 71 of whom were from the islands and 46 of whom were in receipt of the full grant.  The cost of doing away with the means test, out of a buget of billion of pounds for Education, is £32,554 per annum, based on last year's figures.  I put it to the Minister that the limit is unreasonable and should not be retained.  Not only should it not be retained but its present level is irrational.</P>
    <P>The income limit for a person with six children is £10,595; and the basic social welfare for a person with six children is £9,193 or £1,402 less.  The Minister is saying to that person who is in receipt of less than £1,500 over the minimum social welfare level and who bear extra costs of living, that they can afford a boarding cost per child of £794.</P>
    <P>A case was brought to my attention recently of a parent who was earning less than £60 per week from part-time employment.  The father was in receipt of unemployment assistance.  This was a perfectly legitimate set-up.  All income was declared and the combined social welfare and the wife's small income of less than £3,000 per year, was in excess of the guideline.  Out of that meagre income, based mainly on social welfare, the parents have to pay secondary school boarding costs.</P>
    <P>For too long the islanders, and people living in remote areas, have been forgotten. I hope, following tonight's Adjournment Debate this issue will be taken seriously.  It is a small matter and concerns a small amount of money.  It is one scandal that could be finished forthwith.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The concern of Deputy Ó Cuív in this matter is well known and has been articulated before.  I do not have any immediate good news for him but I will pass on a copy of his contribution to the Minister because, on a personal level, I have an interest in and <Col N="1450" /> sympathy with the problem of people on islands and I know something about them.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, when the free secondary education scheme was introduced in 1967, account was taken of the position of pupils who did not live within easy reach of second level schools or even of transport services to schools.  A special provision was made for the payment of grants for boarding facilities for such pupils.</P>
      <P>To qualify for this grant, an applicant pupil must be resident at least three miles from a second-level school where suitable free post-primary education is available, or from a pick-up point on a bus route to such a school, and be a recognised pupil in a boarding school in which the boarding fee charged to parents does not exceed a set amount, which is £1,700 per pupil per annum at present.</P>
      <P>Where it is not feasible for a pupil who is eligible for a boarding grant to attend a boarding school, the pupil may receive a grant towards the cost of lodgings, within the above limits, while attending a day school.</P>
      <P>In the case of a boarding pupil, the grant is paid directly to the manager of the school.  In the case of a day pupil staying in lodgings, the grant is paid directly to the parents.  All eligible students receive a minimum grant of eight-fifteenths of the total boarding fee charged to parents.  This element is not means tested.</P>
      <P>In the case of needy pupils, an additional allowance of seven-fifteenths of the boarding fee is payable, which brings the boarding grant to 100 per cent.  This additional allowance is conditional on the parental income limit not exceeding £9,100 per annum, with a further £299 for each dependent child after the first child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The income limit, and the maximum boarding fee the schools can charge, has been increased from time to time in step with increases in social welfare benefits <Col N="1451" /> and cost of living increases.  These provisions apply to pupils of secondary and community-comprehensive schools; the arrangements for pupils of vocational schools are decided by individual vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that special provision should exist for needy pupils and that the current income limit of £9,100 per year is reasonable by comparison with income levels generally.</P>
    <P>From time to time, it is suggested that, in addition to boarding grants, an allowance should be given to boarded pupils towards the expenses of returning home at weekends and on other occasions.  The travel distance home, and the cost of a trip, would be greater than normal for boarded pupils, but as only one trip a week is in question, the overall weekly cost of travel should not be excessive in comparison to costs incurred by children who reside at home and travel to school by bus daily.  In addition, I would expect that some savings in the cost of their keep must accrue to parents of boarded children so that it would not seem unreasonable to confine full-cost grants to pupils whose need is greatest, although I understood what the Deputy has said.  Accordingly, no provision has been made for the payment of moneys in respect of travel costs to and from school in such cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The incident that took place at the weekend was very tragic and we would all like to sympathise with the two families involved, the Davies family and the Crowley family.  Two young people died, Ross Davies aged 15 years and Keith Crowley who was 21. This accident should never have happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tragedy I am referring to involved canoeists at Dunmore East last Saturday and it is most regrettable.  It <Col N="1452" /> was very likely that such an incident would occur in view of the dreadful weather conditions at the time.  On a day when the fishing fleet was tied up and continuous gale force and storm force winds were forecast, it is difficult to understand how frail craft carrying relatively inexperienced young people were allowed on the water.  A public inquiry would provoke questions and provide answers which otherwise might not be forthcoming, and in doing so might save lives in the future.  An internal Department investigation, which has been promised, will not provide open debate and will not get at the root cause of the tragedy.  To get answers you must provoke debate &mdash; many internal Department investigations have come to nought.</P>
    <P>We are too complacent when it comes to safety at sea, particularly in terms of yachts, sail boards, canoes, speed boats and other pleasure craft.  Strict regulations should be introduced to prohibit such craft from putting to sea when dangerous weather is forecast.  It is only about two weeks since a windsurfer was lost in Carlingford Lough near Dundalk and not many weeks since three or four men were lost in a pleasure boat in Strangford Lough.  It is debatable whether any of these people should have been at sea.</P>
    <P>Last Saturday at about 3.20 p.m.  I travelled to Dunmore East and saw canoes grouped together 30 or 40 yards from the sea wall in sheltered and relatively calm conditions.  The sea wall in question is near the Strand Hotel and not too far from the Counsellor's Strand.  I imagine the canoes had come from the boat slip in Dunmore East and perhaps the accident occurred when they were on their way back.  I was horrified that any small craft would be on the open sea in such weather conditions. There was not, as has been reported, a stiff breeze &mdash; a full gale was blowing.  I went to the pilot station in Dunmore East to survey the scene in general and there was no fishing boat or craft at sea because the weather was so foul.  We need a rational explanation as to why <Col N="1453" /> these craft put into open water in such conditions.  The parents of the dead children, who are obviously extremely upset, are entitled to answers to their questions.  The public in general wants to know why these people with little experience were allowed go to sea in such weather.</P>
    <P>Are there no laws prohibiting people from going to sea in small pleasure craft in such conditions and, if not, will the Minister please bring in laws that will save lives in future?  Outdoor pursuits such as canoeing and boating in general have become very popular in recent years.  The only saving grace in this case is that all eight of the party involved were not lost.  This is not a once-off occurrence, it will happen again unless remedial action is taken.  I ask the Minister to give some indication of what he intends to do to ensure there is proper supervision of people who may put their lives in danger and, in doing so, also put the lives of people in the rescue services in danger.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Deasy for giving me an opportunity to refer to this tragic event.  His on-the-spot knowledge of the conditions last Saturday in Dunmore East is valuable and I have asked my Department to speak to him about his observations at the time.</P>
      <P>I wish to express my sincere sympathy and support, and that of the Government, to the Crowley and Davies families during this difficult time.  It is important, in the interest of these families and the survivors, that I state quite clearly to the House the course of action I will be pursuing in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was indicated to the media last Sunday on my behalf that I had asked for a review of the circumstances surrounding this tragedy.  It was certainly never the intention to convey the message that a public inquiry of a formal nature was intended.  The statutory basis for casualty investigations carried out by the Department, which is clearly set down <Col N="1454" /> in merchant shipping legislation, does not cover accidents involving canoes. Accordingly, there is no statutory basis for a formal investigation or public inquiry into the Dunmore East accident or for publishing a formal report in the matter.  This should not be taken to mean that I do not want to have this matter thoroughly examined.</P>
    <P>It is clear that I must look very closely at the circumstances of this tragedy to see what lessons can be learned for the future.  This is particularly important in view of the growing participation in Ireland in marine leisure activities, both on inland waters and at sea.  As the Deputy will appreciate, it would be particularly difficult for the State to contemplate undertaking a regulatory safety role in the operation of leisure activities, and even if such regulation were undertaken it would be extremely difficult to monitor and enforce.  As a result, the main role of the State has related to increasing general awareness of the need for basic safety practice, and it is my intention to maximise my Department's efforts in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have asked a member of the Department's Marine Survey Office to review the circumstances of the Dunmore East accident.  The official, who arrived in Dunmore East today, will conduct interviews with the survivors, local gardaí and directors of the adventure centre. The sole objective of the surveyor's review is to establish what happened and the lessons which can be learned from this accident, with a view to minimising or eliminating the possibility of a recurrence of such a terrible tragedy.</P>
    <P>I commend the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre in Dublin, the local coast and cliff rescue services, the RNLI, the Garda and locals for their prompt and heroic response in very severe weather conditions.  Nevertheless, I have asked for an appraisal of the emergency response.</P>
    <P>When I have received and had an opportunity to consider the reports, I <Col N="1455" /> will take whatever reasonable steps are necessary to minimise the possibility of a recurrence of this type of accident.  I have to make it clear, however, particularly as the review of the circumstances of this accident is not statutory, that there can be no question of my Department taking any view of the rights or wrongs in this case or of making any specific observations on the roles of individuals or groups involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1456" /> I have separately arranged for one of the most senior officials of the Department of the Marine, the assistant secretary, to speak directly with the families involved to explain the nature of the review and what it will involve and to convey my deep concern about the matter.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals to make the chief of staff the Accounting Officer for the Defence Vote.

      <P>Substantial progress has been made in implementing the policy of financial delegation.In 1995, the military authorities will administer expenditure of approximately £55 million.

      <P>As the details on the number of Air Corps helicopter missions to both islands is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose to circulate it in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The direct costs i.e. flying crew and fuel, of carrying out the 45 missions detailed in the statement is estimated at £38,000.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces provide assistance to the community in emergency situations as far as possible taking into account operational commitments and available resources.</P>
      <P>Requests for Air Corps assistance to islands are usually of two main types. The first are air ambulance missions, that is flying patients from islands to hospitals for treatment.  Requests of this nature are normally made by designated officers from the regional health boards.</P>
      <P>The second type of assistance are requests for air transport of persons and-or supplies to and from the islands due to inaccessibility caused by weather and-or sea-state conditions.  These type of missions are carried out on an <i>ad-hoc</i> basis at the request of various authorities and individuals.</P>
      <P>Given the high level of demand on Air Corps helicopter resources, I am anxious that flying missions of this type are controlled, co-ordinated and planned in the most effective manner. Accordingly, I am having the procedures for dealing with this type of request examined in my Department in consultation with the military authorities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Marine is not in a position to provide grant-aid in excess of 75 per cent for any fishery harbour development project.  A 25 per cent contribution is required from the relevant local authority, whether that be a county council or harbour commissioners.</P>
      <P>The landing facilities at Crosshaven Pier are part owned by Cork County Council and part owned by Cork Harbour Commissioners.  These bodies are responsible for the repair, maintenance and operation of their respective parts and finance these functions from their own resources including fees charged for the use of the facilities.  Provision of grant aid for any development works at Crosshaven will be subject to the council and the commissioners reaching agreement on future responsibility for and maintenance of any development works undertaken.</P>
      <P>I should mention that the Crosshaven Marine Development Committee has submitted development proposals to the Department of the Marine for consideration.In order to progress this matter I have requested the Departments's Engineering Division to visit Crosshaven to assess the situation and discuss the matter with representatives of the Crosshaven Marine Development Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will also be necessary to secure the agreement of Cork County Council and the Cork Harbour Commissioners to the location and construction of a new road system in Crosshaven before the siting of the new pier can be agreed. <Col N="1265" /> Representatives from my Department will be in contact with both bodies shortly.</P>
    <P>On foot of this exercise and subject to discussion with Cork County Council and Cork Harbour Commissioners, the Department of the Marine will be in a better position to evaluate what development works may be feasible having regard to available funding.  I am hopeful of commencing the construction of this project in 1996.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>Funding committed to Dunmore East Fishery Harbour Centre this year amounts to about £250,000 under contracts already placed.  This money is mainly for the structural renewal of existing berthage, and up to another £750,000 will be needed to complete this work in the future.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the need for development at this harbour to relieve the existing congestion of boats which occurs especially during the herring season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, an emergency aid scheme was introduced last April principally to compensate fishermen and boatowners for loss of earnings arising from prolonged bad weather during the previous winter.  The scheme covered claims in respect of a 20 week period from November 1993 to March 1994.</P>
      <P>A key objective of the scheme was to ensure that crew members who had suffered genuine hardship and who were not eligible for payments under social welfare schemes would be compensated for loss of earnings during the winter period.  Payments to crew members were based broadly on what would have been the appropriate rate of support available under the social welfare unemployment schemes.  These took account of such matters as family dependants, income from fishing and from other sources, and any social welfare payments received.  The maximum payment that an individual crew member could receive was equivalent to what would have been his full entitlement under the social welfare system.</P>
      <P>The total number of applications received from crew members under the scheme was 715, of which 187 were deemed ineligible for payment.  To date a total of £495,000 has been paid in respect of 513 applications.  A further £27,000 is expected to be paid to the remaining 15 applicants when additional information required to finalise their claims has been received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would stress that at the time of the announcement of the scheme it was signalled that payments to crew members were intended to bring incomes up to the level of social welfare unemployment benefits.  In the administration of the scheme and in the consideration of appeals from crew members, the scheme's criteria were interpreted as flexibily as possible to ensure maximum payments within the parameters set down.  I am satisfied, therefore, that the maximum possible level of aid has been <Col N="1268" /> paid to crew members under the scheme as approved.</P>

      <P>The latest statistical data <Col N="1269" /> available relates to 1993.  In 1993 production of farmed salmon amounted to 12,366 tonnes valued at £39.1 million.  It is estimated that at least one-third of this amount was sold on the domestic market to retail and catering outlets and to fish processors for smoking.  The remaining two-thirds was accounted for in export sales particularly to the French market.  Other important markets are Germany and the Benelux countries.</P>
      <P>In 1993 there were 916 people directly engaged in salmon farming generating a further 1154 jobs indirectly.</P>
      <P>The Government is strongly committed to the further sustainable development of the aquaculture sector generally.This has been given concrete expression in the EU Fisheries Operational Programme launched yesterday of which aquaculture is a key element. The investment underway and development projects in the pipeline will be supported in 1995 and over the coming five years with the assistance of Structural Funds and national support through BIM and Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>The projected investment of some £36 million for aquaculture will help to protect existing employment and production, facilitate continued expansion and generate new jobs and economic activity both on farm sites and onshore operations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will no doubt be aware that in the past over-fishing and the catching of juvenile lobster has had a deleterious effect on Irish lobster fisheries.As against this, however, in recent years a new realisation has emerged of the commercial potential of lobster fishing and the consequent need to adopt effective conservation measures.</P>
      <P>In response to that need for conservancy measures a series of Statutory Instruments designed to preserve and enhance lobster stocks around our coasts have been introduced.</P>
      <P>Specifically, the Regulations in question prohibit the sale of lobster under 24 centimetres in length and which measure less than 85 millimetres along the carapace.  A further regulation requires lobster fishermen to return to the sea female lobsters which for conservation and breeding purposes have had V notches cut in their tails.  In addition lobsters mutilated so as to obliterate the V notch must also be returned to the sea.  There is also a bylaw which makes it illegal to skin dive for shellfish.</P>
      <P>In addition to conservation of existing stocks, efforts are being made in a number of areas to restock our waters from Irish hatcheries with post-larval stage lobsters.  The survival rate to marketable size of these lobsters is much higher than that of larvae which are naturally released in the wild.</P>
      <P>The South Wexford Lobster Co-operative is doing trojan work in this field and is also conducting the V notch programme.I am confident that the co-operative's work on lobster stock enhancement will bear fruit inside the next few years.</P>
      <P>The Irish Lobster Fishermen's Association is also engaged in valuable work in organising the fishermen around the coast and deserves full credit for its efforts to heighten general awareness of the commercial potential of lobsters and the need to conserve and enhance stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has an excellent <Col N="1273" /> relationship with both of the aforementioned organisations and will continue to give every possible assistance and ensure that their interests are fully protected.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that, around the country, there are at present approximately 2,000 lobster fishermen.  The incomes of these fishermen will increase considerably if the measures referred to are consistently implemented.</P>

      <P>In late November 1994, the Department of the Marine wrote to all maritime local authorities inviting them to submit details of their top four priority coast protection projects.  The local authorities were advised that any projects submitted must be seen to support rural development, tourism, environmental protection or other activities which will contribute to increasing the economic potential of coastal regions.  In line with this a cost-benefit type appraisal of projects was also requested.  No funding will be available in respect of projects whose capital and maintenance costs over the life of the project are greater than the economic value of the benefits arising.</P>
      <P>At the start of this month Galway County Council submitted its list of priority projects to the Department.  At this stage Galway County Council is one of the few local authorities to have responded to the Department's request for submissions.  I appreciate that it takes time for local authorities to evaluate priority projects and carry out the necessary cost-benefit appraisal, however, I am hopeful that all maritime local authorities will have responded shortly.</P>
      <P>When all the submissions are received they will be examined by the Department.Future projects to be undertaken or grant aided by the Department will be chosen from the submissions received.  That being said, no guarantee can be given that every maritime local authority area will benefit under the programme to be drawn up by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The funding available to the Department for coast protection works over <Col N="1276" /> the period to 1999 is some £5.1 million. Given this limited level of funding it is essential that a &ldquo;best mix&rdquo; of projects be chosen.  I can assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to ensure that only the most beneficial projects are undertaken.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 44 and 118 together.  The effects of escapement of farmed fish on wild stocks continue to be debated and researched at international and national level.</P>
      <P>There is general agreement on the need to minimise the likelihood of escapes through preventive measures in the first instance and appropriate remedial action where escapes occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fish farmers are obliged, under licence conditions, to take all precautions to ensure against escapes. These requirements include compliance with standards of cage design and net specifications, the use of anti predator devices, maintenance of structures and operational procedures.  It is worth noting that escapes result in serious economic loss for fish farmers: it is in the industry's own interests, therefore, to comply with these standards.  In the event of an escape, fish farmers are obliged to report immediately to the Department and the Regional Fisheries Board.  This is an essential requirement, to ensure that necessary monitoring and <Col N="1277" /> remedial action, such as netting or trapping, can be taken quickly in light of all the relevant information.</P>
    <P>Technical advances in cage and netting design and improved predator control (net damage by seals being a common cause of escapes), have contributed to a significant reduction in the numbers of major escapes reported in the last few years.</P>
    <P>The Department, however, keeps the precautionary regime under regular review.  A working party, comprising the department, the Salmon Growers Association, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Central Fisheries Board is currently reviewing existing arrangements with a view to reinforcing these if necessary.</P>

      <P>The regulation referred to by the Deputy lays down common rules for the marketing of fish in the European Union.  In particular it provides for: common marketing standards, i.e. size, presentation, quality; the establishment of producers' organisations, which are organised on the initiative of fishermen; a price support system based on intervention mechanisms or compensation mechanisms; a common trade regime with non-EU countries.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the regime is to provide a common framework within which the marketing of fish can take place and to organise competition on the Community market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the regulation are fully implemented in Ireland.  In particular, three producers' Organisations, the Irish Fish Producers' Organisation (IFPO), the Killybegs Fishermen's <Col N="1278" /> Organisation (KFO) and the Irish South and West Fish Producers' Organisation, have been established on the initiative of the fishing industry.  The common marketing standards provided for have been implemented and a number of fish intervention schemes are in operation.</P>
    <P>The Operational Programme for Fisheries 1994-1999 contains a comprehensive package of measures which will do much to improve the promotion of fishery and aquaculture products.  The Programme provides for expenditure in excess of £2.6 million to develop and strengthen markets for fish and fish products.  In addition, a further sum of over half a million pounds of exchequer funds has been provided for marketing in 1995.</P>
    <P>The objective of the generic promotion initiative is to identify and capitalise on new fish product/market opportunities at home and abroad and to increase export competitiveness through seminars and information briefings; market prospects and inward buyer programmes; promotions programmes; consumer surveys and trade fairs and exhibitions.</P>

      <P>There is at the moment no provision within the EU fisheries framework for an early retirement scheme for fishermen.</P>
      <P>However, I am in favour of and will press for the introduction of such a provision at Community level.  The council and the commission have expressed a willingness to examine the possibility of introducing various measures including a preretirement scheme in the context of restructuring the Community fleet.</P>
      <P>In a recent discussion document the Commission estimated that a fisherman leaving his trade five to ten years before legal retirement age would cost the public purse between IR£40,000 and IR£80,000 in retirement benefits.  The commission now proposes to seek further information from member states in order to estimate the probable total cost of such a scheme throughout the EU.</P>
      <P>While a scheme would be desirable, at present no EU financial provision exists from which such a scheme could be funded.  This means that any scheme would have to be funded from existing FIFG allocations which would, of course, mean less funding for other important areas such as the fleet, fish processing and harbours.</P>
      <P>I will, nevertheless, continue to encourage the commission to explore the possibility of funding being provided from other sources such as the Social Fund.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a joint proposal for research funding under the Commission's Air Programme is being prepared in consultation with marine mammal biologists in Ireland, the UK, Denmark and Sweden.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that a population survey of seals around our coasts will form a critical element of the work planned under the proposal.  In addition the study will examine migratory patterns and assess the level of seal interaction with fisheries and the socio-economic implications of such interactions.  Preparations for field observations on the migratory patterns of seals have already been initiated.</P>
      <P>If the proposal is supported by the commission it is expected that work on the study could begin later this year. The multinational scope of the proposal and the transnational make up of the participants reflects the reality that seal populations are a North Atlantic phenomenon rather than an Irish or UK issue.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will understand therefore until the level of seal population around our coasts have been assessed, it would be very difficult to estimate the effect which the statutory protection of seals under the Wildlife Act might have in terms of fish stocks.</P>

    <P>I should, however, bring to the Deputy's attention the fact that under section 42 of the Wildlife Act, permits may be granted in order to capture, kill or otherwise control protected wild animals which cause damage.

The existing staff scheme provides for benefits, entitlements and conditions similar to those which apply to public servants in general.</P>
      <P>The 1980 Act also provides that the central board may, following consultation and with the approval of the Minister for the Marine given with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, amend the staff scheme.  In this regard I understand that the central board and SIPTU have established a joint working group to examine the question of compensation for and benefits payable in respect of injuries suffered by staff of the fisheries boards in the course of their duties and to make recommendations accordingly.</P>

      <Quest>the reason he has projected a considerable increase in net factor outflows in 1995; if he will give a breakdown of the estimated figure for such outflow; and the method by which the estimates were made.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's forecast of the value of net factor outflows in 1995 is for an increase of 14.25 per cent over the estimated 1994 outturn.  This rate is not significantly above the trend in recent years.  It compares with an increase of 15.5 per cent in 1993 and an estimated annual average rate of increase of about 13.5 per cent over the period 1993-1994.</P>
      <P>Net factor outflows cover all international receipts and payments in the form of interest, profits, dividends and royalties.  On the credit side are receipts into Ireland from abroad: on the debit side are payments from Ireland overseas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Published Balance of Payments statistics break down net factor outflows into five components as follows: Remuneration of employees (credit); Trading and investment income (credit); Profits, dividends, royalties (debit); National debt interest payments (debit); and <Col N="1288" /> Other trading and investment income (debit).</P>
    <P>The rate of growth in profit outflows is projected to remain the same in 1994 and 1995.  Growth in national debt interest payments abroad will slow somewhat in 1995 compared with last year.  The main difference between the year-on-year rates of change in total net factor outflows over the two years arises within the &ldquo;Trading and Investment Income (credit)&rdquo; and &ldquo;Other Trading &amp; Investment Income (debit)&rdquo; items. These items mainly comprise external interest flows of the banking sector. These flows were distorted in 1993 because of factors associated with the currency crisis, leading to a sizeable increase in credit inflows in 1994.  These inflows will not be repeated in 1995.</P>
    <P>Arising from this, the gap between the rates of growth in the volume of GDP and GNP is projected to widen in 1995.  The main reason is that the price deflator used to determine the volume change in net factor income is based on trade prices.  In 1995, reflecting international trade prices generally, the projected rate of increase in this deflator is relatively low.  Accordingly, the derived volume change in net factor income is high resulting in a wider divergence in the rates of change in GDP/GNP volume.In the summary of the projections published in <i>Economic Background to the Budget</i> this gap is further accentuated by the effects of rounding.</P>
    <P>The following table gives the published Central Statistic's Office value for 1993, and my Department's estimate for 1994 and forecast for 1995 in respect of the above items:</P>

    <P>Forecasts of net factor income are based on information available to my Department on current trends in, and prospects for, each of the individual components. Forecasts of national debt interest payments are based on the technical assumption of unchanged interest rates, information on the composition of the national debt and anticipated interest payments provided by the National Treasury Management Agency.  Forecasts of profit outflows are based on current trends in profit outflows as published within the CSO Balance of Payments statement, and on the outlook for output and exports from the foreign-owned high technology manufacturing sector. The Economic and Social Research Institute has identified a relationship between profit outflows and high technology exports in earlier periods &mdash; See O'Malley, E. and S. Scott, 1994.  &ldquo;Profit Outflows Revisited&rdquo;, in <i>Economic Perspectives for the Medium Term,</i> Dublin; The Economic and Social Research Institute, Chapter 9 &mdash; This relationship is taken into account in the preparation of my Department's forecasts.  Forecasts for other trading and investment income are based on information made available to my Department on a confidential basis in relation to Central Bank external income, commercial bank interest flows, intervention agency interest payments and semi-state interest payments.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the Finance Act, 1992, the banks were required to make an annual payment of £36 million by way of the bank levy.  This amount could be fully offset against the banks' corporation tax liability if that liability increased above a certain threshold. Since 1992, the levy has been so offset, because there has been a large increase in the banks' corporation tax liability.</P>
      <P>In my recent budget, I announced that the bank levy is now being phased out from £36 million in 1994 to £24 million in 1995, to £12 million in 1996, and nil in 1997.  The banks have agreed to a compensatory cashflow arrangement whereby they will make an earlier payment of corporation tax in 1995 to fully cover the 1995 reduction in the bank levy.  This earlier payment ensures that there will be no cash-flow loss to the Exchequer this year from the reduction in the bank levy.  This compensatory cash-flow arrangement will be continued in subsequent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> In the first instance the budgetary changes to which the Deputy refers are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  The Deputy will be aware of the changes in the rules applying to the carer's allowance to be introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, which will enable more carers to qualify for a higher allowance.</P>
      <P>With regard to the wider issue of supporting carers of people with Alzheimers disease, which is the responsibility of the health services, the investment by health boards in additional home help, community nursing, day care and respite services has increased the support available to suffers of Alzheimers disease and their carers.  The care of those with dementia is clearly emerging as a priority for many boards, a development which I fully support.  All eight health boards have indicated that they have locations at which residential, day or respite care is available for Alzheimer patients, although not all of these centres are dedicated exclusively to Alzheimer patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding has been made available by my Department this year to health boards to provide additional specialist <Col N="1294" /> services for those with dementia, including Alzheimers disease in south-east Dublin, Limerick and Cork, including the creation of the post of psychogeriatrician.</P>
    <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which commenced on September, 1993, widens the options available to those caring for dependent relatives with dementia.  Under the Act, health boards may pay a subvention towards the cost of care in a nursing home of a person who needs that care and who does not have the resources to pay the cost.  Almost £15 million has been made available this year to fund subventions under the Act.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health I am very conscious of the contribution made by carers to the maintenance of dependent people in their own homes.  I will continue to encourage health boards to develop and extend support services for these informal carers whether by services in the home, by respite care in a hospital or nursing home or long term residential care.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take questions Nos. 66 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of services in the Southern Health Board is a matter for them in the first instance.  Cardiology procedures, including angioplasty procedures, are provided at Cork University Hospital.  I understand that there are currently twenty patients on the waiting list at Cork University Hospital. In recent months Cork University Hospital has experienced some difficulties with regard to cardiology equipment. However, my Department has made funding available to the board for the replacement of this equipment.</P>
      <P>I understand from the hospital authorities that tenders are currently being sought.  In the interim, Cork University Hospital has referred patients to Dublin hospitals for angioplasty procedures. These procedures are available at four hospitals in Dublin including St. James's Hospital.  The current waiting list at St. James's Hospital is approximately 30 and the average waiting time is three months.  However, waiting times vary according to the needs of individual patients and priority is given in accordance with medical criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to know that my Department has made substantial funds available for the development of cardiac services in Cork.  This funding <Col N="1300" /> includes provision for the following: establishment of a dedicated cardiac catheterisation laboratory; appointment of a second consultant cardiologist and the appointment of a second cardio-thoracic surgeon.</P>
    <P>With regard to the cardio-thoracic surgeon, my Department sanctioned this post early in 1992.  Interviews were held in March 1993 but the Local Appointments Commission was unable to recommend a suitable candidate.  I understand from the hospital authorities that further interviews will be held in the coming weeks.  With regard to the appointment of a second consultant cardiologist, my Department sanctioned this post on 1 December 1994.  I understand from the Southern Health Board that it is in the process of preparing a submission to Cómhairle na nOspidéal in relation to this post.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Deputy may be interested to know that development funds of £400,000 were provided to the Western Health Board in 1994 for the expansion of orthopaedic services at Merlin Park Regional Hospital.  As a result, approval has been given to the board to recruit a consultant orthopaedic surgeon and a consultant anaesthetist, together with the necessary support staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1993 Waiting List Initiative, funds were provided to equip and commission two new-clean-air-theatres in Merlin Park Hospital.  In 1994, a total of £850,000 was allocated from the waiting list fund to the Western Health Board for the provision of 1,222 <Col N="1301" /> additional procedures, including 109 orthopaedic procedures.  This has helped to reduce the overall waiting time for patients in the specialities targeted.</P>
    <P>In relation to orthopaedic services in Mayo, a submission has recently been received from the Western Health Board requesting the establishing of an Orthopaedic Unit at Mayo General Hospital as part of Phase II of the Mayo General Hospital development, which proposal is at present being considered in my Department.</P>

      <P>Local authorities are not obliged to accept the lowest or any tender for public sector construction works.  In examining tenders for a project, local authorities consider the lowest tender and are expected to satisfy themselves that the contractor concerned has the <Col N="1307" /> capacity to undertake the project, that the work can be done for overall price quoted and that the details set out in the Bill of Quantities or other relevant information are realistic.</P>
      <P>In regard to housing construction schemes, a local authority may accept a tender without seeking the approval of the Minister where all of the following conditions apply:</P>
      <P>(a)  the lowest valid tender is being accepted;</P>
      <P>(b)  any conditions specified in the approval of the budget cost have been complied with;</P>
      <P>(c)  the tender is not more than 10 per cent greater than the tender element of the approved budget cost; and</P>
      <P>(d)  there has been no significant alteration in the content or scope of the work for which the budget cost was approved.</P>
      <P>Where any of the above conditions are not met, the approval of the Minister must be obtained before a tender is accepted.</P>

      <P>The statutory provisions applying to the operation of the local Improvements Scheme are contained in the Local Government (Roads and Drainage) Act, 1968.  The administration of the scheme is devolved to county councils, subject to the provisions of the 1968 Act and to general guidelines issued annually by my Department.  The latter urge councils to ensure, as far as practicable, that priority is given to those projects most requiring attention in the county as a <Col N="1308" /> whole.  In addition, they deal with the amount of landholders' contributions to be paid towards the cost of works, and include guidance on the procedure which might be adopted when making offers to carry out projects and on other matters of a general administrative nature.In making offers, county councils are required to limit commitments so as to stay within their annual grant allocations.</P>
      <P>Under the Act, a project qualifying for a grant is carried out on the basis of an agreement between the applicant(s) and the council concerned.  It is a matter for these parties to determine the precise terms of that agreement.</P>

      <P>Examination entry fees cover only part of the cost of running the certificate examinations.  It is expected that about £6 million in fees will be collected in respect of the 1995 examinations but the cost of running the examinations will come to about £13 million.</P>
      <P>My Department currently operates a number of measures in order to alleviate hardship arising from the payment of examination entry fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of necessitous pupils, the ordinary fee payable may be reduced at the discretion of the school principal and subject to a maximum notified to each school or vocational education committee by my Department.  My Department has made £400,000 available to school and vocational education committees for this purpose in connection with the 1995 examinations.  This amount is greater than the amount allocated in 1994 by 1.5 per cent, the estimated increase in candidature.  There <Col N="1309" /> has been no increase in the rates of examination entry fees since 1994.</P>
    <P>The amount allocated to each school or committee in respect of 1995 fees has been based on the results of a questionnaire on hardship issued to schools in 1994.  Allocations have been increased or reduced, taking into account the particular circumstances in each school.</P>
    <P>In addition, in the case of a candidate who remains at school to repeat the leaving certificate examination and whose parent or guardian is the holder of a current medical card the course fee of £100 is waived and the examination entry fee is reduced from £120 to a maximum of £44, (the ordinary leaving certificate fee payable for first-time candidates).</P>
    <P>Finally candidates who are not attending school may enter personally for the leaving certificate examination under the provisions for admission of external candidates.  The ordinary fees payable by external candidates are reduced, where the candidate is the holder of a current medical card or is dependent on a parent or guardian who is the holder of a current medical card, as follows: £44 to £18, for one subject; £88 to £33, for two subjects; £132 to £44, for three or more subjects.</P>
    <P>The above package of measures which is geared to prevent hardship arising from the payment of examination entry fees is kept under continuous review by my Department.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities inform me that 45 post primary schools in the Tipperary Division were visited by members of the Garda in 1994.  Raising the awareness of young people to the dangers of drug abuse formed an important part of these visits.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that they have drawn up a comprehensive community based drugs awareness programme and arrangements are well advanced towards its implementation throughout the country.

This programme will include the use of video and audio displays.Extra training will be provided for those gardaí involved in the programme.</P>

      <P>I am not convinced that the benefits of having a mounted police unit in the Garda Síochana are such that they justify the establishment of such a unit. The arrangements for traffic and crowd control are kept under continuing review by the Garda authorities.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have asked the former Chief Justice Thomas Finlay to carry out a thorough investigation of the appalling incidents which occured at Lansdowne Road on 15 February 1995 and to report personally to me.  The Deputy may also be aware that the Garda Commissioner has appointed an Assistant Commissioner to inquire into all aspects of the Garda planning and deployment of resources for the match.  I am anxious that these inquiries be completed as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I should mention the fact that policing arrangements for Dublin city centre will shortly be enhanced by the introduction of closed circuit television.  Installation of closed circuit television is already under way in the Temple Bar area and plans are well advanced to set up a similar scheme in O'Connell Street.  This will assist the gardaí in identifying criminals at work in the streets and they will be in a position to respond immediately. It will also assist the gardaí in traffic and crowd control.  While mounted police may have a use in special circumstances, I am advised that the needs of the gardaí and the public would be better served by putting available financial resources into the use of closed circuit television.</P>

      <P>The intention signalled in the Government's policy agreement <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to designate the Garda Commissioner as accounting officer for the Garda Vote is concerned with the fundamental question and who should be responsible to the Oireachtas &mdash; through the Public Accounts Committee &mdash; for the economic, efficient and effective use of the very considerable financial resources which are provided to the Garda Síochána each year.

      <P>At present the Secretary of the Department of Justice is the accounting officer for five votes under my Department's control, including the Garda Vote.

      <P>Sections 40 and 41 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, relate to age cards for the prevention of under-age drinking. The more important provision is section 40 which empowers the Minister for Justice to provide by way of regulations for the issue of age cards on a voluntary basis to persons of or over 18 years of age.  I have no proposals at present to make such regulations.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the most acceptable and effective way of complementing the comprehensive set of provisions in the 1988 Act aimed at curbing under-age drinking is through the continued development of voluntary local age card schemes.  Such schemes, backed by vigorous community involvement and with continual monitoring are, I believe, capable of making a greater contribution to tackling under-age drinking than a single nationwide scheme.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that more than 100 local schemes are in operation throughout the country and that plans are under way to establish new schemes in other centres.  I am also informed that, overall, the schemes are considered to be reasonably successful and beneficial and that they have assisted in reducing the level of alcohol use by persons under the age of 18 years.</P>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme all health boards may make a single payment to meet an exceptional need, including assistance with the cost of clothing, to persons in receipt of social welfare or health board payments.  Health boards recognise that confirmation and communion times involve families in additional expense and all boards assist with such costs.  Health boards decide each application on its merits having regard to the income and circumstances of the applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The back to school clothing and footwear scheme which was introduced in 1990 and runs from the beginning of <Col N="1320" /> June to the end of September every year, enables people on low incomes, including those on family income supplement, to qualify for assistance towards the cost of children's clothes. This scheme is administered by the health boards on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare and expenditure was in the region of £10.9 million in 1994.  In 1994 some 114,000 families were assisted in respect of 270,000 children.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance &mdash; SWA &mdash; scheme is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department.  Under the legislation governing the scheme, the determination of entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance is a matter for the chief executive officer of the board.  Under the SWA scheme, health boards may pay a weekly supplement towards rent or mortgage interest payments to people whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  In determining whether assistance with rent and mortgate payments should be given in any case, the health boards have reference to regulations and guidelines issued by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons under 25 years are not precluded from receipt of rent supplements.However, the Department's guidelines indicate that young single people seeking a rent supplement from <Col N="1321" /> a health board must demonstrate a valid reason for leaving home.</P>
    <P>Such reasons would include moving to seek employment or the existence of serious social problems within the family home which make it necessary for the young person to leave home.  Where there are serious domestic problems the guidelines specify that independent verification should be sought by the health board from social workers or others familiar with the family situation.</P>

      <P>The establishment of a rapeseed oil processing facility in Ireland is a matter for private enterprise, and would be dependent on an assessment of its commercial viability.  Such an enterprise did exist in Drogheda up to the mid 1980s.  A feasibility study, supported by my Department, was carried out in 1986 on behalf of a potential investor on the possibilities of establishing an oilseed rape processing plant.  The investment did not, however, materialise.</P>
      <P>In view of the changes which have taken place in the support arrangements for oilseeds production under CAP reform and the limits placed on oilseed production at EU and member state level under GATT, it would be necessary for any prospective investor to carry out new feasibility studies which would have to include the matter of the future availability of raw materials.</P>
      <P>Oilseeds constitute one of a range of crops that can also be grown on set-aside ground under the EU regulation for non-food purposes such as in the production of biofuels.  In this regard I wish to refer to a reply I gave to Parliamentary Question No. 185 of 31 January 1985 tabled by the Deputy on this subject in which I stated that I have a keen interest in seeing set-aside land being brought into more gainful use.</P>

      <P>At present the Land Commission is awaiting the final result of an appeal to the High Court against a decision of the lay commissioners confirming a scheme to divide a commonage in County Mayo using compulsory procedures.  In 1992 the court directed that certain matters in the Mayo case, including the question of compliance with planning legislation, should be clarified before the case was returned to the court.  The matter was referred to An Board Pleanála, and the decision of An Bord Pleanála, which was delivered in 1993, was appealed to the High Court.  This second appeal should be heard shortly and must be concluded before the original appeal is resolved.  This is the first time that the legislation used in the compulsory division of commonages has been referred to the High Court and I propose to reassess the policy and procedures used in these cases in the light of the judgment of the High Court.</P>

      <P>The position is that the Department has acquired ten acres of reclaimed foreshore at Ringaskiddy, County Cork. The land is situated a short distance from the Naval base.  The question of the provision of new training facilities for the Naval Service on the site is under active consideration in the Department. A preliminary examination of the site has been carried out by Forbairt and a decision will be taken in due course.</P>

      <P>Under European Union fleet policy the capacities of members states' fishing fleets are constrained by decisions taken in the context of fleet multi annual guidance programmes, MAGPS.  In Ireland's case capacity targets set for the end of 1996 require that the fleet be reduced by over 3,000 tonnes.</P>
      <P>Against this background, sea-fishing boat licensing policy is designed to maintain strict control on all proposed new entrants into the Irish fleet. Licences can only be approved where the applicants undertake to remove capacity from the sea fishing boat register that is at least equal to the capacity of proposed new boats.</P>
      <P>Other licensing policy requirements include the submission by applicants of documentary evidence demonstrating that proposed new entrants into the fleet are safe and seaworthy and that no decommissioning grants have been paid in respect of the boats in any other member states.</P>
      <P>I am aware of certain concerns in the fishing industry about the present system of issuing sea fishing vessel licences. I am anxious to ensure that the licensing system should have the full confidence of the fishing industry, and am examining the matter in detail to see what could reasonably be done to make the system more open and transparent with a view to ensuring that the system will have the confidence of the fishing sector.</P>

      <P>While the owners and crews of the vessels to which the Deputy refers have benefited under the emergency aid scheme it would be incorrect to assume that as a result other fishermen have received less by way of assistance than would otherwise have been the case.  The total funding made available for the scheme was more than sufficient to provide assistance to all those whose income was affected by the severe weather conditions and who met the terms of the scheme.</P>
      <P>I should also explain that while the vessels to which the Deputy refers have rightly been described as &ldquo;all weather&rdquo; boats, in extreme weather conditions of the sort which commonly occurred during the winter of 1993-94, any vessel attempting to fish would run a high risk and would have been likely to have lost nets and gear.  In such conditions it would not have made commercial sense for these vessels to have gone to sea.</P>
