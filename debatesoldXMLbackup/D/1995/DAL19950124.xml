      <P>Before calling on the Taoiseach to reply to the questions tabled I wish to remind Members that under Standing Orders the time allowed for Taoiseach's questions may not exceed 30 minutes on Tuesdays, after which time I will be required to call the first question nominated for priority.  I also want to draw Members' attention to the fact that Question No. 1 on today's Order Paper was also inadvertently reproduced as Question No. 9. The correct version of Question No. 9 appears on the Supplementary Order Paper circulated to Members earlier today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1267" /> I had a very good meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, on 20 December last.  The holding of the meeting so soon after my appointment as Taoiseach underlined the determination of our two Governments to consolidate and advance the peace process.</P>
    <P>In the course of our meeting, we reviewed developments in the formulation of the Joint Framework Document. Good progress has been made since then.  Notwithstanding the complexities and sensitivities involved, I hope all remaining issues will be resolved in the near future.  The timing of my next meeting with the British Prime Minister will be determined in that context.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to reassure both Nationalists and Unionists that the Irish and British Governments are not, in any way, planning to impose a political settlement in the absence of political agreement and popular consent.  The Joint Framework Document, when completed, will represent the understanding of the two Governments on the parameters of a fair and equitable settlement.  It will form the basis for a process of detailed negotiations involving the two Governments and the political parties in Northern Ireland.  The final outcome of those negotiations will be put to referenda North and South.  Our undertakings in that regard should provide both the Nationalist and Unionist people on this island with the necessary reassurance regarding their political future.</P>
    <P>The British Prime Minister and I discussed at our meeting a number of other important issues relating to the consolidation of peace, including the decommissioning of arms and explosives held by paramilitaries on both sides.  It is accepted by all that the weapons issue will have to be addressed if full normality is to be restored.  The Government's position, and indeed that of the British Government as stated last week by the Minister of State Mr. Ancram, is that the decommissioning of weapons is not a precondition to participation by <Col N="1268" /> Sinn Féin in all-party talks.  The positions of some other parties, however, would suggest that progress on that issue is required in advance of such all-party talks.  I welcome the progress made to date in exploratory talks with the British Government.  The question of arms is a real problem, and one that must be worked at steadily and with patience.</P>
    <P>The nature of the peace process requires that progress be made in many other areas as well.  As part of our efforts, the Government is committed to lifting the State of Emergency which has existed since 1 September 1976.  I hope shortly to place a motion before both Houses of the Oireachtas to give effect to this.</P>
    <P>On the question of meetings with political parties, I had a preliminary meeting with the Sinn Féin leader on 21 December last.  We dealt in a general way with a number of issues and reaffirmed our commitment to do all that is necessary to maximise the potential of this new era.  I look forward to holding full meetings soon with representatives of the SDLP, Sinn Féin and Alliance parties.  I have had numerous informal contacts with all these parties at the Forum.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the development of dialogue with representatives of the Unionist community.  I have not made any formal requests for meetings with Unionist leaders, but I will do so when I judge the time to be most appropriate.  My door is always open to them or to any other party in Northern Ireland, who might wish to discuss any matter with me.  This was the case with the previous Government and I regard it as the wisest policy in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have received a number of communications from prominent members of the Unionist community, and I am, therefore, well aware of their concerns, as well as those of the Nationalist community.  After completion of the Joint Framework Document, I hope the opportunity will arise for a full process of negotiation, so that <Col N="1269" /> the Northern Ireland parties and the two Governments can work together towards a deep and lasting accommodation.</P>
    <P>Regarding participation by the UPP and DUP in the important work of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, Deputies will be aware of the various outreach efforts being made to accommodate Unionist viewpoints.  The Government fully supports those efforts.  While the matter is one essentially for the Forum, I will do anything I can to encourage participation by representatives of the Unionist community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach took nine questions together.  I remind him that on 24 March last year he objected to the then Government taking six questions together.  He had many strong things to say then so perhaps he should check the record.</P>
      <P>Will there be two documents?  Will there be a separate document from the British Government in addition to the Joint Framework Document and, if so, what is the function of each document?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The British Government has already indicated its intention of publishing at the same time a document in regard to internal structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>To allay fears in Northern Ireland and to stop scaremongering, will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government is not seeking joint authority but North-South institutions with Executive powers?  Will the Taoiseach spell out what he understands to be the difference between joint authority and North-South institutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions in the framework document involve cross-Border institutions which, in some instances, will have Executive powers. <Col N="1270" /> The detail concerning them will be set out in the framework document when it is published.  I would not wish to prejudge or pre-empt the agreement between the two Governments on that document by making any further elaborations at this stage.  A number of interpretations are being placed on various words like &ldquo;joint authority&rdquo;, &ldquo;Executive authority&rdquo; and so forth and I believe it would be best for me not to become involved in trying to provide dictionary definitions at this stage because it would not be particularly helpful.  The Governments are putting together a framework document which will then be a framework within which all the parties in Northern Ireland &mdash; and the Governments &mdash; will enter into discussion with a view to reaching agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that any such Executive bodies will only get part of their power in relation to the Northern side from a devolved Government in Northern Ireland, that there would not be any imposed powers with such bodies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The bodies will be accountable to a Northern Ireland assembly and to Dáil Éireann.  The arrangements for the establishment of the bodies will be set out in the framework document.  These arrangements will then be discussed with all the parties and nothing will happen until we have gone through that process of discussion fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his lengthy reply.  I wish to ask him some questions on two or three aspects of it.  When the Government effectively broke up on 16 December it was estimated it would take approximately one month to complete the framework document.  From November through to December I know that very little was achieved in this regard.  Will the Taoiseach accept that nerves are becoming frayed and while it is important now to hasten the completion of the document <Col N="1271" />&mdash; provided a satisfactory agreement can be reached &mdash; will he be a little clearer on the progress that has taken place over the past five weeks?  Also, does the Taoiseach accept that a satisfactory and balanced constitutional accommodation is critical to maintaining a national consensus, particularly bearing in mind the extreme sensitivity of this issue for nationalists?  I believe nationalists have at all times made it clear that they value, above all else, their birthright and I would like the Taoiseach's views on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree we should publish this document as quickly as possible and that is the objective of the Government.  It is true that a number of statements of concern have been made in recent days about the contents of the document.  These statements have been largely inaccurate.  I believe the fears engendered by them have been substantially allayed by statements by the Tánaiste and the British Prime Minister and I reiterate what the Tánaiste said in that regard.  I agree it is important that the framework document is balanced and recognises the birthright of both communities in Northern Ireland.  I assure the House it is the objective of this Government, as I have no doubt it was of the previous Government, to achieve just such a balanced framework document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome what the Taoiseach said today on the decommissioning of arms and the fact that this will not be considered a precondition. However, will he agree it was wrong for the British Minister for Agriculture to say that fisheries would be excluded from the bodies to be proposed by the joint framework document and that he was pre-empting its contents without any proper authority or consultation? Will the Taoiseach assure the House that this is not the negotiating position of the Government?  We have noted in recent days that both Northern Ireland fishermen and John Taylor <Col N="1272" /> would not be against &mdash; and probably would be in favour of &mdash; closer co-operation on fisheries and that the Lough Foyle Fisheries Commission, set up in 1952, was a model of the kind of which Mr. Waldegrave was not aware.  I ask the Taoiseach for his assurances that these tactics are not in line with the Government's negotiating position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get involved in cross-channel argumentation on a matter of this kind when so much good work is being done.  The two Governments are converging, rapidly I believe, on an agreement around a framework document.  It would not be accurate to say, however, that any subject is excluded from the possible subject matter of a cross-Border institution but it is important to point out that, in so far as the framework document is concerned, it is simply setting out a framework within which agreement can subsequently be reached, not just on the precise modalities of such cross-Border bodies but also on the subjects to be covered by them.  That is the situation and nothing, fisheries included, is excluded from the possible remit of a cross-Border body.  I strongly agree with Deputy Ahern's remarks about the valuable and unsung work being done in the fisheries area by the Lough Foyle Fisheries Commission, which is a good model of practical co-operation and which I believe was suggested originally by a Stormont Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's confirmation that it is the intention to bring a motion before the Houses shortly to remove the state of emergency and I believe this has important symbolism.  Will the Taoiseach also agree that it would be symbolic if the British Government withdrew its troops to barracks in the North which would help consolidate the peace process which has now been in place for almost five months?  It is important that the Taoiseach encourages the British Government to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1273" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to accept the Deputy's welcome for my intention to remove the state of emergency.  I welcome the decisions taken recently by the British authorities to eliminate daytime patrolling by their military personnel in major urban areas in Northern Ireland. I hope that as peace is further consolidated, other subsequent steps to reduce the visible military presence can be taken but I respect the need to do this in a balanced and prudent way.  Any representations that I believe need to be made on that subject will be made and any relevant views from community interests in Northern Ireland in regard to that matter will be most welcome and will be acted upon by me, in so far as possible, as promptly as I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In his meeting with Mr. Adams, did the Taoiseach ask him to take a strong stance against punishment beatings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has given a clear answer as to his views about preconditions and the decommissioning of arms, but will he confirm that it is the Government's view that Sinn Féin must be admitted on the same basis as anybody else to whatever talks take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we are working towards.  However, it is fair to say a number of other parties in Northern Ireland are not happy to sit down on the same basis with Sinn Féin as they would with other parties until such time as the arms issue is dealt with.  It is only realistic to take account of the stated position of other parties on this matter &mdash; I refer particularly to Unionist parties whose views have a legitimacy and are entirely comprehensible from their standpoint.  If we are to have meaningful talks all the relevant parties must be happy about the basis on which they are taking place.  It is not just a matter of the Irish and British Governments <Col N="1274" /> ordaining the basis on which such talks will take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Irish Government being consulted about the second document which relates to the internal administration of Northern Ireland?  Is it being consulted to an equal extent about the consultation process afforded in respect of the main framework document?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not being consulted on that matter &mdash; that is a matter for the British Government.  However, we are involved in the framework document which sets out a framework within which any such institutions mentioned in the second paper would operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Accepting what the Taoiseach stated about parties other than the British Government, would he accept that much more constructive progress would be likely on the arms issue if it is not turned into an excuse for keeping Sinn Féin from the negotiating table?  Will the Taoiseach outline to the British Government and others to whom he will speak that the role of Sinn Féin at the Forum has been constructive, that it has created no difficulties but has made it clear that its participation in talks is something to which it is fully committed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly accept that. My discussions with Sinn Féin both at the Forum and elsewhere confirm my view that its firm intention is to support the peace process in every way; but it is only fair that we in this House should understand the perspective of the Unionist community.  They and their representatives have been at the receiving end of violence over the last 25 years.  They are not the only ones, but they have been at the receiving end of much more violence than we have been used to in this part of Ireland.  It is understandable that after a period of only five months Unionists and their representatives still have huge concerns about the existence of substantial stores <Col N="1275" /> of arms, many of which can only be used for offensive purposes and which are not capable of being used for defence.  I recognise that Sinn Féin and the IRA do not intend to use them, but it will take some time to convince the Unionist community and their representatives of that and we must be realistic about it. We must endeavour to put pressure on all of the parties to bring their positions closer in this long-standing disagreement. We must not simply say that we intend to apply pressure to only one group or party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach accept that there is now clear evidence that a voting pact has been agreed between the British Government and the Official Unionists?  Does he see that as having any effect on the commitment of the British Government to finding a political solution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is no.  I have no reason to doubt the commitment of the British Government to bring the process forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>No pact?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe, from my meeting with the British Prime Minister, that he is determined to bring the present phase of our discussions to a <Col N="1276" /> successful conclusion, and he is deeply committed to an overall settlement. Naturally enough, the British Government must make arrangements to have its programme passed in its parliament, and we can all understand that.  There is no evidence of any pact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that a complete and permanent cessation of violence is the key issue in the discussions and that it would be dangerous if others try to treat either Sinn Féin or the Nationalists as second class citizens?  The Taoiseach should at all times, indicate that a permanent cessation of violence is the key issue and should not allow people to try to find ways of keeping Sinn Féin or their representatives out of the talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody is trying to do that.  The concerns expressed by Unionist representatives about the decommissioning of arms are genuine.  I do not think they are designed for any artificial stalling purpose and I accept them on that basis.  However, I disagree with them because I believe we could make more progress towards our common objectives if that were not an issue being used by anybody as a &ldquo;blocking mechanism&rdquo; at this stage.  The object of the Joint Framework Document, as in the case of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Sunningdale Agreement, was to establish the principle of equality of citizenship, that each community's aspirations in Northern Ireland are of equal value and deserve equal respect.  That is the underlying principle in all we are trying to do and it was the underlying principle in what the previous Government tried to do.  It is also a view shared by the British Government and, in different ways, by all the parties in Northern Ireland.  It is simply a question of finding a common way of expressing that shared belief.</P>

      <P>As little has been written about the internal document, does the Taoiseach not agree that the vote of the British House of Commons has now <Col N="1277" /> become somewhat clearer and that it is an appeasement to Unionists in Northern Ireland to the facilitate them in accepting the Joint Framework Document?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not take that view.  The statement made by the British Prime Minister about his intentions to publish a document in parallel with the publication of the Joint Framework Document was made many months ago long in advance of any of the difficulties last week to which the Deputy has referred.  There is no necessary connection between the two.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach accept that the Nationalist community in the North of Ireland is as worried about loyalist paramilitaries having large stores of arms as are the Unionist population about republican paramilitaries having stores of arms?  Has the Taoiseach expressed a view to the British Government on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly agree with Deputy O'Donoghue that the Nationalist community are just as worried, perhaps more worried, about arms in the hands of loyalist paramilitaries as are the Unionist community about arms in <Col N="1278" /> the hands of the IRA.  The Deputy is absolutely right in saying that and I urge on all concerned the rapid decommissioning of arms as it would give a great sense of security to everyone on both sides of the divide in Northern Ireland.  Many of these arms are kept out of a misplaced sense that they provide some protection, but as long as similar arms are held by another community they do not.  The sooner we can get all illegally held arms out of commission the better.</P>

Given the situation that pertains in the House of Commons and that the Government does not have a say in the internal operation of the framework document does he share the fears of many that this could in fact be an appeasement document?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the phrase, I think, used by Deputy McDaid but I do not agree with it.  It is normal that the British Government would want to consult all communities in Northern Ireland and &mdash; as far as possible &mdash; meet their concerns.  The fact that it wants to meet the concerns of the Unionists should not be described as appeasement any more than efforts on their or our part to meet the concerns of Nationalists. That does not deserve to be described as appeasement in the pejorative sense the term was used in the period leading up to the Second World War.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the primary objectives of my Department is, in co-operation with other Departments and State agencies, to use diplomatic missions to greatest effect to support Irish economic and business interests abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have embassies in all the member states of the European Union, including in the three new member states where an embassy in Finland was opened in June 1993.  We also have diplomatic links with those countries who are actively pursuing European Union membership.  All these missions, with the Permanent Representation in Brussels, are active, on an ongoing basis, in <Col N="1280" /> supporting the public and private sectors in pursuing further trade and investment opportunities both in the European Union and the applicant states.</P>
    <P>In particular our representatives abroad are active in supporting Irish State bodies and firms in pursuing opportunities within the European Union pre-accession programme for the applicant states of Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>My Department is a member of the Foreign Earnings Committee, which was re-established and upgraded by the Government in 1993.  This committee, under the chairmanship of the Minister for Tourism and Trade, brings together representatives of Government Departments and State bodies involved in the promotion of trade, tourism and investment. Its remit is &ldquo;to achieve the necessary single-minded pursuit of Ireland's economic and commercial interest abroad by all our Agencies and programmes including the diplomatic service&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My officials co-operate closely with the work of the committee in Dublin. Embassies are fully involved with State agencies in co-ordinating official support to the Irish trade and investment effort overseas.  This includes the markets of Central and Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean countries which have also applied for membership.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the work being done by our diplomatic service throughout the world in assisting the promotion of trade, tourism and inward investment.  In the light of the expansion of the European Union to include three new member states with whom we have a trade balance, it is very important to look at future trading links with these three new member countries as well as existing member states, not only trading links with the capitals of these countries but with the economic heartland.  Has the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs proposals to review the consular service in European Union countries to try to assist even further the efforts not <Col N="1281" /> only of State agencies but of private companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Deputy's remarks on the role played by the diplomatic service on behalf of the Irish people and the public and private sectors. In all my discussions with our diplomatic staff around the world one of the things I bring to bear is the importance of our export trade and developing opportunities for both the public and private sectors.  I would like to think that all State agencies and private sector companies that have had experience of dealing with the deplomatic staff abroad would have been pleased with their experience.  I see the Deputy nodding in agreement.  I think that is the general experience and many letters cross my desk complimenting the efforts of our missions abroad for what they have done for business, public and private.</P>
      <P>Given the opportunities that will arise in Eastern European countries which have agreements with the European Union and which in the long term will obviously wish to be part of an enlarged European Union, it is important to look at the opportunities that will exist for Ireland in that situation.  I constantly look at the prospect of extending our consular services.  We have a limited number of missions, which is constantly under review and I would like to expand our missions abroad either as full diplomatic missions or as consular services. Given the export orientation of the State, we will need all the assistance we can get abroad and a professional staff to assist both public and private sectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 29, 37, 38 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>The Joint Framework Document is the subject of intensive and ongoing negotiations between the Irish and British Governments.  Both Governments wish to see the document concluded and published at the earliest opportunity and we are working actively towards that end.</P>
      <P>However, while considerable progress towards finalising the text has been made, a number of outstanding issues require further attention and consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall be meeting the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland for discussions later this week which I hope will bring us closer to agreement on a final text.  If sufficient progress can be <Col N="1283" /> achieved, I would then envisage a summit meeting in the fairly near future when the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister would agree and publish the document.</P>
    <P>The framework document will represent the shared understanding of the two Governments in relation to the key issues which must be addressed in future talks.  These include a balanced constitutional accommodation as well as new North-South structures and new eastwest arrangements.  It will not be a blueprint to be imposed.  It is a framework which we will commend to the parties for their consideration and for ultimate negotiation, so that the fears expressed by some Unionists, arising from their experience at the time of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, are unfounded.</P>
    <P>The British Government has already indicated that, parallel to the publication of the framework document, it will publish a separate paper setting out its views on the Strand One aspects of future talks.  The details of possible Strand One institutions are best worked out by the participants in that strand.  It follows, accordingly, that the framework document will not enter into any detailed proposals for internal arrangements in Northern Ireland, though the two Governments obviously have a shared interest in the basic principles which will govern such institutions and their overall parameters.  Our interest in this area is indeed formally recognised in the Anglo-Irish agreement.</P>
    <P>As the current discussions between the two Governments on the framework document are necessarily confidential, I cannot provide any further details of its content at this stage or indicate those areas in which full agreement has yet to be reached.</P>
    <P>The framework document is intended to give impetus and direction to renewed political talks to be held at the earliest possible date.  The question of which parties will participate is a matter for agreement between the two Governments and the relevant political parties in Northern Ireland.  The timing of <Col N="1284" /> future talks will also be a matter for discussion and agreement among the participants. The Government would, of course, hope that the participation and agenda for such talks would be as comprehensive as possible.</P>
    <P>As regards the role of the Opposition, the Government as a whole and I wish to see our Northern policy conducted with the widest possible support from all parties in this House and we envisage close consultation with them.</P>
    <P>The framework document will provide a focus for wide debate and discussion following its publication.  Apart from the discussion which can be expected to take place in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, the Taoiseach and I will be glad to enter into dialogue about it with the Opposition parties in Dáil Éireann and to afford members of the Oireachtas every opportunity to convey their views on its contents.</P>
    <P>With the achievement of peace there is now a unique opportunity to progress towards the agreement of new and lasting political arrangements on this island. The framework document will be a vital stage on the road towards that goal.  The Government will do all in its power to ensure that the historic opportunity for an agreed resolution of this problem is seized by all concerned and that, following publication of the framework document, comprehensive political negotiations get under way at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Why has the Irish Government not been consulted about the Strand One document in view of the Tánaiste's statement that it has a deep interest in this matter?  When the discussions on the framework document commenced was it envisaged that there would be a second document on which the Irish Government would not be consulted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy recalls the origin of and preparation for the last session of round table talks that took place, I understand there was an understanding that the internal governance of <Col N="1285" /> Northern Ireland was a matter for Strand One.  The Irish Government was not involved in Strand One and in that context I do not think we can have any objection to what is proposed by the British Government and what Mr. Major repeated many months ago.  The basic framework remains the same in that nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed, as the Deputy will remember from his participation in the talks.  What is important at this stage is that we complete the work on the framework document &mdash; the British Government said it would publish its document at the same time &mdash; and try to bring about the talks in which everyone now wants to participate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the discussions the British Government had and its continuing discussions with the various parties in Northern Ireland, the parties are free to put forward their views on how they see the future of Northern Ireland.  I am not party to those discussions and cannot say what is being discussed but obviously the parties which have had regular meetings with the British Government, for example, the SDLP, the Official Unionist Party and the Democratic Union-Party, if so disposed, have an opportunity to put forward what they want to see in that document regarding the government of Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Col N="1286" />
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>From the Government's point of view we have attempted to respect a degree of confidentiality in the negotiations.  It is well known that the major key issues which remain to be settled relate to three areas, first North/South institutions; second, the constitutional question and third the European Union dimension.  It was always understood that these areas would be dealt with at the latter end of negotiations.  I hope we can make progress on these this week through early publication of the document.</P>

      <Quest>the appointments he has made or intends to make in his private offices, including special advisers, programme managers and press staff; the name, task, salary and conditions of employment of these appointees; and the reasoning behind the appointment of an official to the rank of Second Secretary in his Department.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made no new appointments to my private office.  The staff sanctioned by the previous Minister for Finance have been re-appointed and their tasks, salaries and conditions of appointment remain unchanged.</P>
      <P>As regards the appointment of an official to the rank of Second Secretary in the Department of Foreign Affairs, I would point out that Anglo-Irish and North-South relations are a key priority both for the Government and the country generally and never more so than at present when we face the challenge of consolidating peace and launching a process of negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The official in question has been centrally involved in negotiations on the Joint Declaration and the Joint Framework Document.  His work requires him to deal with key officials at the very top level of the British system on very complex issues.  The burden of work and responsibility in this area is already comparable to that of a Departmental <Col N="1287" /> Secretary and it will increase further as the resources of the Department are strengthened to meet new tasks, for example, the economic follow-up to the peace process and preparations for the launch and conduct of comprehensive negotiations.</P>
    <P>The official in question will be required to manage the Anglo-Irish Division, provide services for the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Northern Ireland, co-ordinate all policy execution in relation to Northern Ireland and Anglo-Irish matters and maintain and develop international support for the process.</P>
    <P>It is right that the rank and experience of the official who carries out these duties should be commensurate with the importance of the work in question and that he should also remain in a position to concentrate exclusively on Anglo-Irish matters without the competing pressures of other Departmental tasks. This appointment meets that need in both respects.</P>

He is an excellent civil servant.  I appreciate the remarks.  They will be conveyed to the Second Secretary in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the Government <Col N="1289" /> operates as a team in relation to Northern Ireland.  It is extremely important, given the opportunity obtaining, and which will continue in ensuing months, that we operate as a team.  The day-to-day responsibility for policy on Northern Ireland rests with the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Obviously, as with other matters such as the European Council, I will conduct the business of the General Affairs Council but ultimate responsibility rests with the Taoiseach on behalf of the Government. That is the position.  I consider it extremely important that we avail of the opportunity obtaining, in a spirit of teamwork, on behalf of this House and the electorate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 24, 40, 45 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>The situation in Chechnya is a tragic and complex conflict.  Since the fighting began thousands of civilians have been killed or wounded, nearly 500,000 people have been displaced from their homes and Grozny's infrastructure has been virtually destroyed.  Fighting is continuing in the suburbs of Grozny and heavy artillery and indiscriminate air power continue to be used on access routes to the city and surrounding villages.</P>
      <P>The Government is gravely concerned at the tragic course of events which have unfolded in Chechnya.  In response to these we have acted in five ways which I will outline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, we have unreservedly comdemned the grave abuse of human rights and high level of civilian casualties and have urged an end to the fighting and a negotiated solution.  These concerns were set out clearly in our statements beginning on 24 December. Following a review of the crisis by the Government, I issued a further statement on 12 January in which I made it clear that the Government was appalled at the indiscriminate use of force by the Russian authorities and the continuing <Col N="1291" /> bombardment of the civilian population, I also called on the Russian authorities to heed the appeals of the European Union and the wider international community for an end to the fighting and for a negotiated solution.  In particular I called for full compliance by Russia with its international obligations as a member of the OSCE and full co-operation by Russia with the efforts of the OSCE to find a peaceful solution to the conflict.</P>
    <P>Second, we have made our views known directly to the Russian authorities both in Dublin and Moscow.  On 21 December our Ambassador in Moscow conveyed our concerns directly to the Russian authorities when he and his European Union Colleagues met with the Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev.  On 4 January we repeated our concerns to the Russian Embassy in Dublin.  The next day Minister of State Deputy Gay Mitchell raised the tragedy in Chechnya directly with the Russian Ambassador. He emphasised in particular that the Government could not understand or condone the indiscriminate use of military force, the air raids against civilian populations, and the accompanying abuse of human rights and that the Government wished to see a negotiated solution to the crisis within the framework of international law.  He also urged the Russian authorities to facilitate the immediate delivery of humanitarian aid. On 18 January, on my instructions, our Ambassador conveyed our views directly to the Russian authorities in Moscow.</P>
    <P>Third, we responded promptly to the needs of the victims of the war and are willing to give further humanitarian assistance.  In advance of any formal request for funds the Government donated £50,000 to the ICRC for emergency relief for prisoners and victims of the conflict.  Last week, in Geneva, Minister of State, Deputy Burton discussed the humanitarian assistance requirements with the President of ICRC and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.  In the light of Minister of <Col N="1292" /> State Burton's subsequent recommendations to me and the detailed assessment of needs contained in the ICRC's appeal for funding, I have decided to make a further grant of £100,000 from the emergency humanitarian assistance fund.  The UNHCR is completing its assessment of the needs of Chechen refugees in Ingushetia and Daghestan.  I can assure the House that we will sympathetically consider the UNHCR's appeal once it is finalised.  At the EU level the Commission has donated 310,000 ECU to the ICRC and further assistance to the aid effort is planned.</P>
    <P>Fourth, we have acted collectively with our EU partners to try to bring an end to the fighting and the opening of negotiations towards a peaceful solution. The European Union has been in constant contact with the Russian authorities since the beginning of the crisis. Following the meeting of EU Ambassadors with Foreign Minister Kozyrev on 21 December the European Union has expressed its concern to Russia in a series of <i>démarches</i> and discussions on 29 and 30 December and on 5, 19 and 14 January.</P>
    <P>The EUs position was set out clearly in the declaration adopted by the General Affairs Council yesterday.  This deplored the serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law which are still occurring in Chechnya; called for an immediate cessation of the fighting and for the opening of negotiations to allow a political solution to the conflict to be found; and demanded that freedom of access to Chechnya and the proper convoying of humanitarian aid to the population be guaranteed.  The EU placed its action in the framework of the implementation of the principles and provisions of the OSCE.  The agreement given by Russia to the sending of an OSCE delegation, including a representative of the EU presidency, to the region was noted. However, we called for the delegation to be given all appropriate means of carrying out its mission and to be enabled to travel to Chechnya as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1293" /> Fifth, we have promoted the use of the OSCE to bring an end to the conflict both in our bilateral contacts with Russia and through EU <i>démarches</i>.  From the outset the Government considered that the OSCE might be able to play a helpful role in the search for a peaceful settlement, since it has developed mechanisms for conflict prevention and resolution and for the promotion of human rights and the protection of minorities.</P>
    <P>Overall the thrust of our bilateral and EU action has been to make it unequivocally clear to Russia that its handling of the conflict in Chechnya is unacceptable and to promote a negotiated solution through the involvement of the OSCE.  At the General Affairs Council yesterday Ministers reviewed the situation and agreed to maintain this course of action but reserved the right to consider other options.  With regard to possible deferral of signature of the interim agreement, this agreement, which is designed to give effect to the trade provisions of the partnership and co-operation agreement signed at Corfu in June 1993, is not expected to be ready for signature until mid-February for technical reasons.  Ministers agreed yesterday to decide on further stages in their action on Chechnya in the light of the outcome of the OSCE mission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that it is virtually impossible to deliver any humanitarian aid into Chechnya, that only those citizens of that Republic who have left it can receive any assistance; that there are hundreds of thousands of people deprived of food of whom quite a proportion are even deprived of commodities as basic as water?  Would he agree that the original cause of this conflict, and the inability to help these people, is due to the actions of the Russians?  Is he aware that always there is the possibility that some other of the autonomous Republics within the Russian Federation may want to remove themselves from that Federation?  If that should happen, will we have a recurrence of the <Col N="1294" /> position in Chechnya in respect of some other Republics?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There are about four aspects to that supplementary with which I will endeavour to deal one by one.  The main area where the conflict has impacted has been in Grozny, where there has been huge displacement &mdash; involving in excess of 400,000 people &mdash; and where the humanitarian situation is quite appalling.  Bilaterally, and through the European Union we have made our view very clear, that the actions of the Russian Government are totally unacceptable.  We want to see a negotiated solution.  I am aware of the prospects in this region, in relation to other autonomous regions who may well decide on similar courses of action in the future, but at present what is important is that the European Union maintains pressure on the Russian authorities to ensure that they seek a negotiated settlement.  It will be extremely difficult, given what has happened in recent weeks, but from the Irish Government's point of view we will maintain that pressure both bilaterally and through the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the allocation of the additional £100,000 of aid, which is very important.  In his long reply the Minister made the point that our Ambassador in Moscow has protested as part of a European Union delegation, to the Russian Foreign Minister and that the Minister of State, Deputies Gay Mitchell and Joan Burton, have made similar protests.  I did not hear the Minister refer to his own role.  My question was addressed specifically to the Minister and concerned his role in communicating the revulsion felt by the Irish people at these actions.  Those actions necessitated calling in the Russian Ambassador and expressing our strong, humanitarian view and our abhorrence of the abuse of civil and human rights that has been taking place there.  Bearing in mind our business with Aeroflot, through Aer Rianta, we are in <Col N="1295" /> a strong position to speak to our Russian colleagues who could be seen as citizens of a friendly nation.  Would the Minister agree that we should be using our influence, as we do not have any baggage in the colonial sense, to speak to the Russians?  I recommend that the Minister invite the Russian Ambassador, not in any aggressive manner, to make known to the Russians the strongly held views of the Irish people, their sense of revulsion at what they are watching on television screens, that is children and elderly women being murdered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is certainly correct when he says there is a sense of revulsion felt here at what is taking place in Chechnya.  I am aware of that feeling.  The Minister of State summoned the Russian Ambassador when I was on vacation.  When I returned the first thing I did was have a discussion with the Irish Ambassador in Moscow with a view to his going to the authorities in Moscow and that was done. Yesterday the European General Affairs Council had an opportunity to discuss the position.  Obviously far more impact can be brought to bear on the Russian Administration by the European Union through the European Presidency.  We had an opportunity yesterday too, of hearing firsthand reports from Ministers who met various personnel in the Russian Administration.  It is important that we maintain pressure and reiterate to the Russians that what happened in Chechnya is unacceptable and they will have to try to work out a negotiated settlement.  In early February the General Affairs Council will again discuss the crisis in Chechnya.  We will have an opportunity to see what happened in the meantime and I will certainly consider having discussions with the Russian Ambassador prior to that meeting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 53 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>The main specific funding for the development of the six southern Border counties is provided at present through the INTERREG Initiative, which is administered by the Department of Finance in this jurisdiction and through the International Fund for Ireland.  Reciprocal membership on the respective advisory and monitoring committees which bring togethe representatives of a number of Government Departments, facilitates close and structured co-ordination between the two instruments in deploying funding within the Border counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The co-ordination arrangements between INTERREG and the IFI are working well and contributing in a tangible way to the economic and social welfare of the Border region.  The Government is always ready to consider ways in which existing mechanisms can <Col N="1297" /> be strengthened and built upon.  This aspect is very relevant to consideration of new structures for North-South co-operation arising from work on the Joint Framework Document and in any future negotiations.</P>
    <P>The INTERREG Initiative for the years 1994 to 1999 has allocated IR£72 million to projects in six southern Border counties and £48 million Sterling in the North.  The International Sterling Fund for Ireland will spend £50 million in 1995, of which nearly £13 million will be allocated to projects in the south.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that major initiatives have been launched in recent months by the European Union and the US Administration respectively to provide financial and other forms of support to Northern Ireland and the southern Border counties in the context of the developing peace process.</P>
    <P>On 21 September 1994, President Delors announced that the European Union would, as a first step, increase its contribution to the International Fund for Ireland from 15 mecu to 20 mecu per annum.</P>
    <P>Following on from contacts I initiated with Foreign Minister Kinkel, of the German Presidency, the European Council in Essen on 9 and 10 December agreed on a multiannual programme of assistance for Northern Ireland and the southern Border counties which would provide support in the areas of urban and rural regeneration, employment, cross-Border development, social inclusion and investment promotion. The programme is to run for five years. Funding of 300 mecu, or approx £240 million, has been agreed for the first three years.  Funding for a further two year period will be decided upon following a review at the end of the initial three years.</P>
    <P>This new funding is aimed at overcoming the legacy of damage left by violence and availing of new opportunities offered by peace.</P>
    <P>While it is accepted that the greater share of the funding will go to Northern Ireland, final decisions remain to be taken on the precise allocations to <Col N="1298" /> North and South under the various headings of the initiative.  The necessary steps are being ttaken to bring initiative formally into existence and there is contact between the two Governments and the Commission in this context.</P>
    <P>On 1 November 1994, President Clinton announced on behalf of the US Administration a package of measures to assist in the consolidation of the peace process.  The package will include, in addition to a planned contribution of $20 million dollars to the International Fund for Ireland in 1995, a commitment to seek Congressional approval for an additional $10 million dollars in respect of both 1996 and 1997 which would mean a total US contribution of $30 million dollars to the IFI for each of those years.</P>
    <P>The President also announced that he would host a White House Conference for Trade and Investment in Ireland. This conference will take place in Washington in May of this year.</P>
    <P>The direct American financial assistance will be channelled through the International Fund for Ireland, and will be disbursed, as with all IFI expenditure, on a 75:25 basis between North and South which is the ratio agreed by the donors to the fund in the agreement which established it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Deputy Leoanrd Deputy Leoanrd">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Leoanrd</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Tánaiste will agree that the funding indicated is substantial compared with the funding allocated in previous years. It is important that proper structures are set up and there is appropriate co-operation between and co-ordination between Departments to ensure there is an even spread of funds.  Along with the peace initiative, great efforts are being made by community groups north and south of the Border.  They have set up some very worth-while projects.  They have suggested the appointment of development officers and administrative officers within the region and such appointments would greatly facilitate their work.  That request was raised at the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body.  On this occasion I hope funds will <Col N="1299" /> be more evenly spread across the six counties south of the Border than they were heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the increased allocation is to be welcomed.  In the past we saw the benefit of that funding.  I saw it in the six Border counties and in Northern Ireland on my visits there.  I welcome the renewed commitment from the US Administration and I hope the conference in Washington on trade and investment will be successful.  I believe it will be successful and should stimulate new interest in US trade and investment in Ireland.  During recent Government discussions concern was expressed about the operation of the INTERREG Initiative and the need to ensure that the local communities had access to the funds and their efforts, as described by the Deputy who is familiar with them from his experience on the ground, are reflected in what is happening.  I hope we will have bottom up development in the INTERREG programme which is being passed to the European Commission. I hope it will be successful and we can build on the success of the last one.  Obviously the local communities have a major role to play and I hope we can assist them.  With that in mind I am willing to meet Deputies from the six Border counties to discuss how we can make further progress in this area.</P>

      <P>I am happy with the Tánaiste's response and we must be very grateful to all the organisations which contributed to the funding.  I am glad the Minister mentioned the specific amounts of money received as a result of the peace initiative.  In a monetary sense, it supports maintaining the peace process and the benefits that can be derived from it.  I am not sure whether the Tánaiste's reply included Question No. 43, but he appears to have answered <Col N="1300" /> it.  The Tánaiste must understand that the bombings in Northern Ireland over the past 25 years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the form of a question.  As the Tánaiste is aware, in the past 25 years there has been a great resolve among the British Government and people not to let the bomb devastate them and their pride saw them through the past 25 years, but people living in the six Border counties suffered in silence.  As a result of the peace process, will the Tánaiste reconsider the 75:25 percentage basis of funding, as the Border counties have suffered equally and in silence during the past 25 years? Will the Tánaiste consider using his influence to see if funding can be allocated on a more equitable basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware that was the basis of the ratio of division when the International Fund for Ireland was set up and obviously it is a matter for the donor countries.  There would be many complexities involved in changing that decision.  I accept what the Deputy said about the impact of the violence on the six southern Border counties and that is something of which we are very aware.  I hope recent decisions and the development of the peace process will provide on opportunity to redevelop the six southern counties as well as the Northern Ireland counties.  The primary purpose of the International Fund for Ireland and the European Aid Package is to bring about reconciliation.  One must accept that the problems in Northern Ireland are more acute.  The southern Border counties only make up 20 per cent of the combined population of the area.  The IFI spending, on a <i>per capita</i> basis, is greater in the South of Ireland than in the North of Ireland.  I will work with the Deputies in that regard, but it is important to see the results of the <Col N="1301" /> INTERREG programme and the IFI spending which, as the Deputy is aware, have contributed enormously to major projects.  It is also important to ensure they are successful in tackling the consequences of the violence of the past 25 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Tánaiste satisfied with the 25:75 per cent proportion? As this has been used as a yardstick in the context of international funding, is it not now a <i>fait accompli</i> that this will be the yardstick used in the context of European Union funding or, indeed, additional funding allocated to the Border regions?  Will he comment on the fact that while the six Southern Border counties may have a smaller population than the six Northern counties, the six Southern counties have not been allocated similar resources to those in the North because of greater funding from the British Exchequer?  In that context, is it not the case that the six Southern Border counties deserve a much higher proportion of funding, not only from the international fund, but from all the other funds including the Delors package?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the European Union allocation for the INTERREG II programme is higher for the Southern Border counties than for those in the North.  I hope we can work with the communities, as described by Deputy Leonard, in the Southern Border counties.  As part of the peace dividend there are opportunities now which did not exist in the past.  The reopening of cross Border roads &mdash; a matter of concern to many Deputies &mdash; should give an impetus to trade North and South and will be of substantial benefit to Southern counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the framework document, will the Tánaiste support setting up a regional body in Border areas to oversee the spending of, not only international fund moneys, but also moneys allocated through the INTERREG programme?  Will he also <Col N="1302" /> support setting up an INTERREG secretariat in Border areas to oversee such matters rather than allow such funds to be disbursed from Dublin and London?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree to the Deputy's request today, but I will examine the matter in the context of the co-ordination of the spending funds.  We must take cognisance of the agencies already working in that area.  I am prepared to meet Deputies of the region to consider what needs to be done in terms of structures for spending money with the objective of ensuring that local people are involved.  There have been complaints in the past that this matter was handled without an input from local community development organisations and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Tánaiste aware that the greatest problem facing local authority community groups and so on is backing funding?  That does not pose a similar problem in Northern Ireland because of Department of the Environment and other funding for the North.

      <P>The statue of the Council of Europe provides that every member &ldquo;must accept the principles of the rule of law and of the enjoyment by all persons within its jurisdiction of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and collaborate sincerely and effectively in <Col N="1303" /> the realisation of the aim of the Council.&rdquo; This is defined as being &ldquo;to achieve a greater unity between its members for the purpose of safeguarding and realising the ideals and principles which are their common heritage and facilitating their economic and social progress&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Any European State which is deemed to be able and willing to fulil these provisions may be invited to become a member of the Council of Europe.  The criteria apply to all applicants for Council of Europe membership including Russia.</P>
      <P>The Government strongly believes that Russian membership of the Council of Europe would be an important contribution to stability on the Continent and strengthen the cause of reform in Russia.  We, therefore, welcomed Russia's application for membership in 1992.  We expect, however, that Russia, like other new member states, should meet the standards for membership and that these standards will not be compromised by the process of enlargement.</P>
      <P>The situation in Chechnya has given rise to serious concern over the extent to which Russia embraces Council of Europe values.  The committees charged with examining the Russian application for membership have suspended their examination and requested an urgent debate by the Parliamentary Assembly at its session beginning 30 January.  The opinion of the Parliamentary Assembly on membership applications is an important guiding factor in decisions taken by the Committee of Ministers on such issues.  Ireland will, therefore, give due weight to the recommendation of the Parliamentary Assembly, following its debate, as to what action might now appropriately be taken with regard to the Russian membership application.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome Russia's application for membership of the Council of Europe.  Has the Committee of Ministers discussed criteria which will apply to Council of Europe membership for Russia, particularly having regard to <Col N="1304" /> the position in Chechnya and Russia's involvement in Moldova where the 14th army is in occupation of the South East? When does the Tánaiste consider Russia might be able to join the Council of Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome Russia's application, which is undergoing a process of analysis within the Council of Europe.  It is clear that Russia's size and level of development present difficulties for Council of Europe membership and following its application a joint programme of action was instigated in 1993 aimed at preparing Russia for membership. Conferences, seminars, exchanges of view and training activities took place on a wide range of issues including constitutional reform, human rights, media, local government, legal co-operation and civil society.  Obviously, what has happened in Chechnya in the last number of weeks has been seriously considered by the Council of Europe.  The Parliamentary Assembly discussions on 30 January will have a significant bearing on how quickly the application will be processed and we should await their outcome, when we will be in a better position to make commitments in relation to timing.</P>

      <P>The Government is very conscious of the needs of Irish emigrants and we are providing support in a number of practical ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1984, funding is being provided to immigrant assistance groups in Britain through the DÍON committee, which is chaired by an offical of the Embassy in London and which reports to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  Grants totalling £500,000 <Col N="1305" /> were received by 36 groups in 1994.  I understand that total funding is expected to be at a similar level this year.</P>
    <P>The Government also helps to fund Irish immigrant advice and welfare organisations in the United States. Grants totalling about £150,000 were given in 1994 to 11 organisations based in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco.  I envisage that a similar amount of funding will be provided in the Foreign Affairs Vote in 1995.</P>
    <P>Through its Euroadviser network, FÁS has greatly strengthened its links with State employment services of other European Union countries.  The Irish and British authorities also operate a Transfrontier Committee, under European Union auspices, which helps to resolve problems experienced by workers moving between the Irish and British labour markets.</P>
    <P>The Government is generally satisfied that, bearing in mind the many other claims on public money, the level of support provided to emigrant organisations abroad is adequate; however, we will continue to monitor closely the needs of these organisations.</P>

      <P>A number of cases of theft of Irish trucks in Italy has come to the attention of my Department over the past few years; some of those cases have involved attacks on the drivers of the trucks.</P>
      <P>The most recent incident of which we are aware was the theft, on 29 November 1994, near Milan, of a truck and goods with a combined value of over £120,000.  There was no violence involved on this occasion.  Our Embassy in Rome, as soon as it became aware of the incident, immediately contacted the local police to ensure the matter was fully investigated.  Embassy officials are continuing to provide all possible assistance to the haualge firm to whom the truck belongs; we understand that police inquiries into the theft are continuing.</P>
      <P>I should make it clear that the problem of attacks on trucks in Italy is a general one and that there is no question of Irish drivers in particular being singled out.  When our Embassy formally approached the Italian authorities about thees incidents some time ago, they indicated that the Italian Department of Public Safety had established an interagency task force to combat such attacks.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that I shaee his concern about these incidents. Our Embassy in Rome will continue to monitor the situation closely and will maintain contact on the matter with the Italian authorities.</P>

I am not aware of the submission on export credit insurance.  That is a matter for the Minister for Tourism, and Trade and as I am not aware of it I have not formed a view on it.  As it involves export credit insurance it would have to be examined very carefully. We will continue to impress upon the Italian authorities our concerns in relation to Irish drivers.  Given the nature of our economy and the necessity for exports and access to the European markets and to Eastern European markets, long distance haulage will be a feature of Irish life for the forseeable future.

      <P>The Programme for a Government of Renewal affirms the Government's intention to publish a White Paper on Foreign Policy.  It is my intention that this White Paper should be published in the second quarter of this year.</P>
      <P>The White Paper will cover all aspects of Ireland's foreign policy and the full range of international issues which affect our national interests.  This includes the questions of defence and security that arise for this country in the post-cold war Europe, which I intend should be fully examined in the White Paper.</P>
      <P>The Programme for a Government of Renwal clearly indicates that the White Paper &ldquo;will spell out the principles that underpin Ireland's commitment toa peace, security, and co-operation&rdquo;.  The programme also sets out the following as one of the guiding principles of the Government's foreign policy:</P>
      <P>We will play a full part in the debate on Common Foreign and Security Policy, which will culminate during Ireland's Presidency of the EU in 1996.  The White Paper will inform and encourage debate on all the issues involved.</P>

Already we have received in writing more than 30 serious submissions on the White Paper.  Seminars were held and the next seminar will take place in Limerick on Saturday morning at which I hope to see the Deputy. Attendance at the seminars has been very good.  As the Deputy will appreciate the situation in Europe is evolving and has done so at a more rapid since the post-cold war era than previously. There will be further changes in terms of our thinking on security and defence questions.  I intend to bring the White Paper before the House at the earliest possible date.  There are many varying views in the 30 submissions on what position Ireland should take on future issues when they come before the European Union.  Ultimately, any agreement that the intergovernmental confernce will arrive at wil have to have the consent of all European Union members.  I hope there wil be a wide-ranging debate both inside and outside this country on issues which I consider to be very serious.</P>

From discussions I had with him and from his experience in this area, which is considerable, I think Deputy Kitt is well aware of the complexities of the issue.  I think he is also aware that great changes are taking place in the context of European security and defence.  What is important is that we try to put forward, on behalf of the Irish people, a policy that reflects <Col N="1312" /> the concerns of the Irish people in this area and I hope that will be reflected in the White Paper.  Thereafter there will be an opportunity for a more detailed discussion in this House.  I hope the discussions and conclusions reached in our contribution to the Intergovernmental Conference will reflect fully the views of the Irish people.  I think the Deputy is aware, as is everybody else, that there are conflicting views among individuals in this House and outside on Ireland's future role in the European Union, whether in terms of a common defence policy or security.  What is important, as it was with the last Government, is if there are to be changes in Ireland's traditional stance it will be a matter for the Irish people and will be done only by referendum.</P>

It should be put to the people in a referendum for them to decide the way forward.  We should not tie ourselves on the conference during our Presidency.  This matter should be carefully considered in the House and there should be the widest possible debate on it.  The people should pass judgment on it because it is fundamental to us as people.</P>

I will certainly endeavour, in co-operation with Deputy Burke and Deputy O'Mally as spokespersons for their parties on foreign affairs, and eyerybody else in this House, to have the fullest and widest possible debate in this House and outside on proposed changes.

I am sure the Deputy &mdash; and Deputy O'Malley &mdash; will have comments on that matter. The United Nations has come under enormous pressure and criticism in recent years as the demands have far outgrown the resources of the United Nations.  It is very important to continue to bolster the United Nations because it has a very important role.</P>

      <P>On 14 January in my address to the White Paper Seminar on Human Rights, which has held in University College, Galway, I confirmed my intention to establish a properly resourced Human Rights Unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>Human rights issues are, of course, constantly dealt with across the range of the Department's existing activities. However, there has been a significant expansion in the range of human rights-related activity in recent years and I believe that it is necessary to reflect this fact in the structure of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1314" /> The role that I envisage for the Human Rights Unit is as follows: to provide to me, and through me to the Government, advice on Ireland's position on international human rights issues; to ensure that human rights are taken fully into account in all aspects of our foreign relations, including in our contribution to the development of the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union; through a joint standing committee, whose establishment I have also announced, the unit will liaise with the growing number of non-governmental organisations in this area so that the views and special perspective of the NGO community can be taken into account in the development of policy; the new unit will play a key role in ensuring that reports on implementation of our obligations under international human rights instruments are submitted in a timely and comprehensive manner; the unit will co-ordinate human rights activities, not only within the Department of Foreign Affairs but will also liaise, as appropriate, with other Government Departments in relation to the State's international human rights obligations.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a Human Rights Unit will bring us into line with the practive of many of our European partners and enable us to promote human rights issues more effectively during our Presidency of the European Union in 1996.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister decided to set up this unit.  Whereas our record on human rights and recognition of the abuse of human rights in the past has been good, investigation into the abuse of human rights is a specialist skill.  I hope this unit, when established, will be proactive.  From time to time people whose human rights are abused are ignored or dismissed.  I hope this unit will investigate complaiants of abuse of human rights and determine the action to be taken.  Ireland has an unique part to play in the prevention of abuse of human rights worldwide. <Col N="1315" /> There appears, whether because of better communications or better reporting, to be a greater number of abuses of human rights than ever before.  Ireland is perfectly positioned to take action in this regard because, as the Minister rightly said in answer to a previous question, people like myself who have an inherent belief in the protection of human rights for all people have lost faith in the UN in the recent past.  There needs to be new thinking in that area. As Ireland is a small, neutral country with a unique record within the UN it has a special role to play.  I hope we will lead the UN rather than follow in regard to human rights because there has been much of an example to follow in the recent past.</P>

      <P>I take on board what the Deputy said.  Whereas all divisions in the Department of Foreign Affairs are involved to some extent in human rights related issues, my proposal to establish a human rights unit reflects current thinking on an international scale in terms of human rights and the necessity, as the Deputy rightly said, to be in a position to investigate human rights abuses.  The political division in the Department in particular follows human rights developments in the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe.  Human rights concerns are also a particular focus of the work of the Anglo-Irish Development Co-operation and legal divisions.  A human rights division properly resourced as I expect it will be, will ensure a more co-ordinated and focused approach to human rights issues and will contribute to the further development of our policy in this area, which overdue.</P>

      <P>President Santer, the new EU Commission President, has indicated it will be the policy of the Union to play an active and leading role in development, co-operation and humanitarian aid.  Will the Minister ensure in that context that the human <Col N="1316" /> rights record of the countries being assisted will be taken into account in decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the statement by President Santer.  On examination one wil see the record of the European Union in terms of humanitarian aid and assistance across the board which has probably been more substantial than that of any other nation in recent years. That is in part due to the focus by each member state of the Union.  That will certainly continue and wil perhaps become more important with the admission to the European Union of the two Nordic countries and Austria who have good records in this area.  Obviously in the examination of any situation where the European Union provides humanitarian aid, all aspects will be taken into consideration.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 50 and 60 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two Ministers of State have been appointed at my Department.  Deputy Joan Burton, who is also Minister of State at the Department of Justice, has special responsibility at the Department <Col N="1317" /> of Foreign Affairs for Development Co-operation, while Deputy Gay Mitchell, who is also Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, has special responsibility at the Department of Foreign Affairs for European Affairs generally and preparation for the intergovernmental conference in 1996.</P>
    <P>Both Ministers of State have been provided with office accommodation in Iveagh House, together with the necessary staffing, equipment an budgetary resouces to enable them to carry out their responsibilities.  Minister of State Burton has a total of seven civil servants between her private office and her constituency office in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  She has also made three personal appointments to her office in the Department.  Minister of State Mitchell has four civil servants at his private office in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  His constituency office is located at the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>In the context of his special responsibility for European Affairs, Minister of State Mitchell will work with me in the planning and conduct of the Irish Presidency, including the Intergovernmental Conference which is likely to be convened before or during our Presidency.</P>
    <P>All the relevent staff of my Department will, of course, be available to assist both Ministers of State in discharging their responsibilities.  The staff of the political and economic divisions of the Department will be particularly closely involved in preparations for the Presidency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that this practice of dividing the responsibilities of Ministers of State between two Departments leads to a dilution of their efforts and gives very little return to taxpayers.  The Minister of State at the Department of Justice also has special responsibility at the Department of Foreign Affairs for development co-operation.  Development co-operation is a separate matter <Col N="1318" /> and requires the concentration of a separate Minister of State.  The other Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs is also a Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach. This has been the trend in the 15 appointments, and it is proposed to make two further appointments.  This practice is a nonsense and should be re-examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputie's point.  With regard to the appointments to the Department of Justice, in common with the practice heretofore, the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell, has responsibilities at the Departments of Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach.  This has ben the practice in terms of the co-ordination of European Union affairs.  In that respect, much work will have to be done in preparation for Ireland's Presidecy of the EU.  Given the number of very important items on the agenda up until 1996 and afterwards, our Presidency will be very important and obviously there will have to be close co-ordination between the Departments of Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Minister of State who has responsibility both at the Department of Justice and the Department of Foreign Affairs, as the Deputy correctly said, overseas development aid is an expanding brief.  In recent years we have made a large impact in that regard &mdash; I compliment the former Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Tom Kitt, in that context &mdash; and this work will be continued.  The linkage between the Department of Justice and the Department of Foreign Affairs in the case of the Minister f State, Deputy Burton, has a particular relevance in terms of human rights.  As the Deputy will know from his experience in the Department of Justice, there is an overlap on human rights issues between the Departments, and I believe both my Ministers of State will work effectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The US embargo on all political, economic and commercial relations between the United States and Cuba has been in place since 1962.  I am very conscious of the difficulties which the embargo causes for the people of Cuba and I regret the continuing poor relations between the United States and Cuba and the circumstances which underlie that situation.  I have said on many occasions before that it is my hope that the changes which have occured in international relations in recent years will create the conditions for an end to cold war animosities everywhere.  Indeed I have been encouraged recently by the talks which continue to take place between the Cuban and US Governments.</P>
      <P>At the 49th General Assembly of the United Nations in New York Ireland abstained in the vote on the draft resolution concerning &ldquo;the necessity of ending the commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba&rdquo;.  Our Permanent Representative to the United Nations explained in a speech to the General Assembly that this abstention did not mean that Ireland supported a continuation of the embargo.  On the contrary the Government agreed with the call in the Resolution to all states to refrain from promulgating and applying laws and measures of the kind adopted by the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government wants to encourage the process of dialogue between the US and Cuba and allow it time to develop. The Resolution which was passed at the General Assembly envisages a review of the issue at this year's session of the General Assembly.  I sincerely hope that before then the embargo will be lifted and that the conditions can be created <Col N="1320" /> which will enable relations between the United States and Cuba to be normalised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs decided unanimously that the embargo should be lifted.  What status does the Minister think the committee has given that Ireland abstained in the vote on the draft resolution at the UN? Does he believe that the decision of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs should have had a bearing on our position at the UN?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As someone who called for its establishment, I certainly believe that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs has a very important role to play.  It has played a very significant role in the development of our foreign policy. While Ireland abstained in the vote on the draft resolution on Cuba at the General Assembly last year, we availed of the opportunity to explain that our abstention did not mean Ireland supported the continuation of the embargo. The Government agrees with the call on all states to refrain from promulgating and applying lawa and measures of the kind referred to in the resolution.  As stated in the explanation on the vote at the General Assembly, Ireland also believes that states which apply such laws and measures should urgently consider their repeal.  I hope that the situation prior to this year's General Assembly in September will have changed sufficiently as a result of the dialogue taking place between Cuba and the United States to allow the United States to lift the embargo, thus removing one of the last vestiges of the cold war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sagent Mr. Sagent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sagent</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister undertake to clearly inform our representatives at the UN that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs reached a unanimous decision on this matter? Does he accept that people who are not <Col N="1321" /> deeply involved in politics find the argument that abstention really means support for the removal of the embargo very difficult to understand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained the situation to the individuals and groups I have met.  In effect, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs made a recommendation, which is not binding on the Government.  I was mindful of that and hopefully we and the United States will be in a position at the next General Assembly to agree to the removal of the embargo.  That is what we are all aiming to achieve and we should work in that direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain why, if the Government is against this trade embargo &mdash; a view with which I fully concur &mdash; we abstained in the vote at the United Nations?  Why did we not vote for its removal?  If countries like Ireland vote for its removal in sufficient numbers obviously it will be removed more quickly.  There is no justification for a continuation of this embargo at this stage, 33 years after it was first imposed, against a country which is now extremely weak and in need of aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy O'Malley's views on Cuba, views which I have not heard before.  However, I would point out that in deciding Ireland's position on this vote consideration was given to all the facts of the situation.  Having weighed up all the elements, it was considered by the Government that, on balance, Ireland could best encourage positive development in the US-Cuba situation by abstaining in the vote at the General Assembly and making our position very well known.</P>

I agree with Deputy O'Malley that &ldquo;abstaining and explaining&rdquo; is a very weak way of dealing with this issue &mdash; one is either for or against the embargo.  There will be serious implications for our foreign policy position if we do not have the courage to speak out.  Perhaps the Minister will consult his colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, on this issue.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to express sympathy on behalf of the Government to the families of three former Members of the House who died during the Christmas recess.  The late Phil Burton, a former Fine Gael TD for the old constituencies of Cork North East and Mid-Cork, was a Member of the House from 1961 until 1973 and of the Seanad from 1973 until 1977 when he retired from public life.  He joined Cumann na nGael in 1932 and addressed his first public meeting in Tyllylease in the company of the late Dan Vaughan TD.  In 1942 he was elected a member of Cork County Council and served as chairman of that body on five separate occasions.  He served his community with honour, dedication and ability.  From my recollection he was a man who only spoke in this House or elsewhere when he had something to say.  He was a man of deep personal conviction which was often hidden by a somewhat gruff exterior.  His loss will be felt deeply by his wife and family, his friends and his native county of Cork. On behalf of the Government and the Fine Gael Party, I wish to convey to his wife Eileen, his sons and daughters and to his brother Dan our sincere sympathy on their loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Former Deputy Stevie Coughlan was a colourful and, at times, controversial Member of this House.  He was sometimes described as the stormy petrel of Irish politics.  He joined the newly formed Clann na Pobhlachta in 1947 and was an unsuccessful candidate in the general elections of 1954 and 1957.  He joined the Labour Party in 1960 and served as a Member of the Dáil from 1961 until 1977.  He served twice as Mayor of Limerick, first in 1950 and again in 1969, and he served on the city council there for 30 years.  He was also well known in private business as a bookmaker and he was, for a time, the owner of a licensed premises.  Anybody who had the pleasure of seeing, as I did <Col N="1492" /> on both occasions that it was shown, the television documentary on Stevie Coughlan's life will have a sense of what a great character he was.  What struck me most forcibly &mdash; and it was something that struck me also during his time in this House when he was a backbencher in a Government of which I was a member &mdash; was that for him, neither party, Government nor popularity came before his commitment to the city of Limerick.  He stood for whatever he believed was in the interests of his city and its citizens.  On behalf of the Government and my party I wish to offer to his wife Peggy, his sons, daughters and his sisters our sincere sympathy.</P>
    <P>Finally, it falls to me to say some words about another Member of this House who has passed away, a man whom I counted among my close friends in political life, although he served on a different side of the House from me, the former Deputy, Phil Brady, who served in this House for 26 years.  Indeed, he was elected at an age that many might consider to be an appropriate age for retiring from this House.  Notwithstanding that he continued to serve for a full and productive 26 year term as a Member of this House up to the year 1977. He was a former Lord Mayor of the City of Dublin.  As Members know, he qualified as a pharmacist in 1917 and his business premises at Kelly's Corner on the South Circular Road is a landmark in Dublin.  I suppose that is why he chose that particular location and why his business was so successful.  He had a very good sense of positioning in politics and a sense of being in the right place at the right time.  He lived a remarkably long life, a life that was very fulfilled and all those who attended his funeral will have a sense not just of the sadness but also of the pleasure that many could draw from recalling such a full life. Indeed, in a recent interview, he referred to his earliest recollections of political matters and it is interesting that the first political event he was able to <Col N="1493" /> recall in his life was the controversy surrounding the Boer War, and that is a while ago.  What struck me most forcibly about him was his outstanding courtesy, a courtesy which he passed on to all his sons and daughters and, in particular, to his son Gerard who served as a Deputy and a Minister in this House.  On behalf of my party and the House I extend sympathy to the Brady family and indeed to the Fianna Fáil Party on its loss as well as to the Labour Party on the loss of Stevie Coughlan.  We have lost three good friends of this House and of parliamentary democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always a matter of great sadness when former Members of the House pass away.  Today, as the Taoiseach stated, we mourn the passing of three former Members, Philip Brady, Philip Burton and Stephen Coughlan. Phil Brady lived to the ripe old age of 102.  As the Taoiseach outlined, that allowed him to play an active part in his career both as a successful businessman in this city and his great involvement in the medical and pharmaceutical industry. In 1993, his friends and colleagues celebrated his 100th birthday and those who were present on that occasion will remember that he gave a strong speech on how we should all perform in politics and business for the next 100 years.</P>
      <P>Phil Brady was a Deputy for Dublin South East for 26 years, from 1951 to 1977, when he was succeeded by his son, Gerard, with whom Members will be familiar.  The late Mr. Brady also carried on that great business which is notorious throughout the city.  He was well known in his professional life throughout the country.  We will be eternally grateful for the significant role he played as a public representative and as a member of the party of which I am now leader. He had a special interest in the health service and was committed to its development throughout this city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult when somebody has reached the age of 102 to put his life in perspective at various junctures.  By way of trying to put Philip Brady's life in <Col N="1494" /> sequence, we recall that, for example, he was Lord Mayor of Dublin in 1959-60 and played a prominent role at that time.  Deputy Brian Lenihan, a good colleague and longstanding member of this party, recounted recently that when he entered the Seanad 38 years ago there was a tradition in the party that an older Member took the newly elected Member around the premises and that, in his case, Philip Brady, at the age of 65, was the one to show him the ropes.  I extend our sympathy to the family of the late Deputy Brady.</P>
    <P>Philip Burton, a farmer by profession, was a founder member of Fine Gael, Chairman of Cork County Council, Member of the Seanad and Deputy for Cork for 12 years from 1961 to 1973. Again we wish to extend out sympathy to his wife, Eileen, and his family.</P>
    <P>Although I did not know Stephen Coughlan, I knew a good deal about him from documents, programmes and debates.  Born in 1910, he was twice Mayor of Limerick and was also a Deputy from 1961 to 1973.  He was colourful and controversial to say the least and someone who, if one had an interest in politics, one would want to read about to know what made him tick. To his wife Peggy and his family we extend our sympathy.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the memory of all three of our former colleagues.  They sought to represent their constituents to the best of their ability and worked for the national welfare according to their lights.  May they rest in peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Parliamentary Labour Party I rise to pay our respect and tributes to the three late Deputies, Philip Brady, Philip Burton and Stephen Coughlan.  I happen to have known all three Deputies to varying degrees.  In regard to Philip Brady what one will always remember is his outstanding courtesy irrespective of what was happening in the House.  He was a frequent visitor to this House in his retirement and he always had time <Col N="1495" /> to stop for a conversation.  He was a gentleman of outstanding qualities and made a remarkable contribution to this House and to the Fianna Fáil Party.  I extend my sympathy to the Fianna Fáil Party and to the Brady family, many of whom I know well.</P>
      <P>Deputy Philip Burton was a farmer from Cork who represented his constituency very effectively in both Dáil and Seanad.  He was of a quiet disposition but he worked assiduously and fought to protect the interests of his constituents, whatever the issue.</P>
      <P>I had the opportunity of knowing Deputy Coughlan better than I knew Deputies Brady or Burton.  As has been said, he was a colourful character, controversial both within and without the Labour Party.  Indeed, it is fair to say that on occasion there was not exactly a coincidence of interest between the priorities of Deputy Coughlan and those of the Labour Party.  Deputy Coughlan's priorities were well understood by my own predecessor in Kerry North.  Indeed there were many occasions when they formed alliances within the party.  I suspect the Ceann Comhairle is smiling because he has a good memory of such things.</P>
      <P>As the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Ahern, has said, all three former Members made outstanding contributions to this House and to their respective constituencies.  In Deputy Coughlan's case Limerick came first and last.  Our sympathy goes to the Brady, Burton and Coughlan families.  We will miss the former Members and will not forget the contribution they made to Irish political life.</P>

      <P>I, too, would like to join with the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Leader of Fianna Fáil in extending my sympathy and that of the Progressive Democrats to the families of the three late Deputies.  The only one of them I knew was the late Deputy Brady and I concur with everything that has been said about him.  He was a courteous <Col N="1496" /> man, always in good humour, always very friendly.  Only four or five months ago I saw him in Leinster House.  He was a frequent visitor here, always enjoying his visit and meeting some of his former colleagues.  I attended his funeral at which representatives from every party in this House were present in large numbers, and that was the greatest tribute that could be paid to a former colleague.  Mr. Brady was fortunate to enjoy such a long and healthy life.</P>
      <P>I extend my sympathy to his family and, in particular, to his son Gerard who is also a former colleague of ours.  By any standards 26 years of service is an outstanding record.</P>
      <P>I did not know Deputy Stephen Coughlan but as one who used visit this House as a student between 1973 and 1977, I got to know a good deal about him.  I enjoyed very much the television documentary of his life.  It was a fitting tribute to a man of great character who went about his task with a sense of mission but also with a sense of fun and determination.  To his wife Peggy, to his family and to the Labour Party I should like to extend my sympathy.</P>
      <P>Neither did I know Deputy Burton who served in the Dáil for 12 years and in the Seanad for four years &mdash; again, a very long record.  To his party, Fine Gael, to his wife, Eileen, and his children I extend my sympathy and that of the Progressive Democrats.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Democratic Left I would like to convey the sympathy of my party to the relatives, friends and party colleagues of the three former Deputies who have died.  I did not know any of the three personally but it is clear from what has been said about them that they made a considerable contribution to Irish public life. Like other Deputies, I knew some of them by repute and it is clear that, though having different perspectives and being on different sides of the political fence, all three served in politics <Col N="1497" /> out of conviction and for what they believed would be right for the people. I offer my sympathy to the families and friends of the three former Members.</P>

Naturally the House has to agree quickly to set up new committees, we are anxious to facilitate the Government in doing that and we agree to the standing down of committees.  This morning I received a document on Dáil reform, of which I had no notice.  Will the Taoiseach give a commitment that that document which has fundamental changes, some with which I agree but others with which I totally disagree, will be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges so that we can discuss it fully, otherwise things will be very difficult?  There are four committees I have never heard of, and I do not <Col N="1501" /> know what they will do; neither do I know whether their four chairpersons will be paid&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would like to have these matters discussed, there are also time changes, the length of the sitting day and the number of days we are sitting.  Will the Taoiseach give an assurance that these matters will be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges where they will be debated and we will not be found wanting in trying to find a resolution to the problems?</P>

The issue of time changes and new committees are far broader than a matter just for the Whips, they are fundamental to the order of the House and how we do our business.  Most of the Fianna Fáil proposals are contained in the Programme for a Partnership Government and the programme A Government of Renewal but the document presented today is different: committees never mentioned in any report or document are proposed.

      <P>The sub-committee has made progress on the matters referred to it and has agreed the following interim report.  Dáil Éireann ordered on 15 December 1994 that a sub-committee of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security consisting of the chairman and 12 other Members of that committee be appointed to consider the matters referred to that committee by order of Dáil Éireann on 6 December 1994 and to report thereon directly to Dáil Éireann not later than 24 January 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The select committee met on 15 December 1994 and appointed a sub-committee in accordance with the orders of Dáil Éireann of 15 December 1994 and section 4 (1) and (2) of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security of Dáil Éireann (Privilege and Immunity) Act, 1994.  The following members were nominated to the sub-committee: Deputies Ivor Callely, Dermot Ahern, John O'Donoghue, Willie O'Dea and Dan Wallace, chairman, for the Fianna Fáil Party; Deputies John Browne, Jim O'Keeffe and Donal Carey for Fine Gael; Deputies Derek McDowell and Eamon Walsh for the Labour Party; Deputy Des O'Malley for the Progressive Democrat Party; Deputy Eamon Gilmore for the Democratic Left Party and Deputy Tony Gregory for the Independent group.  On the nomination of the Clerk of Dáil Éireann, Mr. Niall Fennelly, Senior Counsel, was appointed legal adviser to the sub-committee on 20 December 1994 in accordance with the orders of Dáil Éireann of 15 December 1994.  Mr. Fennelly subsequently decided to step down as legal adviser when it became apparent that the evidence-taking would continue beyond 11 January 1995 and that he would, therefore, not be in <Col N="1506" /> a position to complete the task.  Mr. Gerard Durkan, Senior Counsel, was appointed legal adviser to the sub-committee on 4 January 1995.</P>
    <P>Following its appointment the sub-committee met on Thursday, 15 December 1994 and has since met on the following occasions in public session and questioned the following witnesses: Tuesday, 20 December 1994, Mr. Eoghan Fitzsimons, Senior Counsel and Mr. Harry Whelehan, Senior Counsel; Wednesday, 21 December 1994, Mr. Harry Whelehan, Senior Counsel and Mr. Matt Russell, Office of the Attorney General; Thursday, 22 December 1994.  Mr. Matt Russell, Office of the Attorney General; Wednesday, 4 January 1995, Mr. James Hamilton, Office of the Attorney General and Mr. Richard Barrett, Office of the Attorney General; Thursday, 5 January 1995, Deputy Albert Reynolds; Tuesday, 10 January 1995, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn; Wednesday, 11 January 1995, Deputies Bertie Ahern and Michael Woods; Thursday, 12 January 1995, Deputy Noel Dempsey and Dr. Martin Mansergh; Tuesday, 17 January 1995, the Tánaiste, Dick Spring and Deputy Rúairí Quinn, Minister for Finance; Wednesday, 18 January 1995, Deputy Brendan Howlin, Minister for the Environment, Mr. Fergus Finlay and Mr. John Rogers, Senior Counsel. There were also 17 private sessions of the subcommittees.  The sub-committees also met in private session on Thursday, 19 January 1995 for the purposes of deciding an interim report to Dáil Éireann and on the strategy for completing the work.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee requested written statements from the following: Deputies Joe Walsh, Charlie McCreevy, Brian Cowen, David Andrews, Michael Smith, Mervyn Taylor, Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Mr. Tim Dalton, Secretary of the Department of Justice, Mr. Declan Ingoldsby, higher executive officer, Department of the <Col N="1507" /> Taoiseach and Mr. Partick Teahon, Secretary of the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>In the case of Deputy Rabbitte and Mr. Dalton the sub-committee had requested them to attend for the purposes of answering questions but subsequently decided to request written statements from them instead.  The sub-committee may wish to question these persons on foot of the statements which are received.  It may also, if requested, have to provide an opportunity for witnesses who may wish to appear before the sub-committee again.  It is likely that limited further evidence will be taken in this regard in the week commencing 23 January 1995.  In any event, it is intended that the taking of evidence by the sub-committee will be concluded within the next week following which the report of the sub-committee can be prepared.  Therefore, in spite of the extremely heavy workload in which the sub-committee has been engaged since its appointment it was found that it will not be in a position to complete the functions assigned to it on 24 January as originally ordered.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee considers that a period of four weeks from the conclusion of the taking of evidence will be required to finalise a report and thus recommends that the date by which the subcommittee is required to report to Dáil Éireann be extended to Friday, 24 February 1995.</P>

      <P>May I seek clarification from you, a Cheann Comhairle, for my own sake. My impression was that the Order of Business is taken before the business but in the last few minutes we have gone through a number of items of business. My understanding is that we discuss the order in which business is being taken before taking the business and that we do not discuss the order after we have taken a good part of the business, which we have already done here.

      <P>On the other point Deputy Bertie Ahern made in regard to the contribution to Europe by the former President of the Commission, Monsieur Jacques Delors, it is fair to say that Monsieur Delors has been a visionary in European terms, a man who has created a concept of how Europe might work in the next century.  It is important that we should pay tribute to him and I am doing so now.  Yesterday at the General Affairs Council, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, on behalf of the Government, paid extensive tributes to Monsieur Delors.  Furthermore, it is fair to say that Monsieur Delors, as President of the Commission, at all times was concerned to protect the rights of smaller countries, one of the important marks he made in the course of his tenure. He, in his role, expressed the importance of the Commission, in general, as a protection and bulwark for smaller member states.</P>

      <P>Is it the Government's intention to table an amendment to the Road Traffic Act, 1994?  Is it significant that, in the legislative programme circulated earlier, there is no mention of the information on abortion legislation?

      <P>This Bill is required to give effect to the decision by the Government to increase the number of Ministers of State from 15 to 17.  At present, section 1 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1977, as amended by section 2 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1980, restricts the maximum number of Ministers of State to 15.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional positions of Ministers of State envisaged by this Bill will be assigned to Deputies Avril Doyle and <Col N="1520" /> Donal Carey.  I should like to say something about the portfolios which it is intended to assign to these two Deputies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey will be Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  He will be given special responsibility for co-ordinating the Government's commitment to western development and rural renewal.</P>
    <P>The west has been beset by a self-perpetuating economic malaise.  With the declining population, services have been reduced and economic activity has declined, leading in turn to further depopulation.  This population haemorrhage must be stopped.  Our hope and expectation is that the population of the west will have stabilised by the end of the decade.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey's remit will include responsibility for the activities of the Western Development Partnership Board and for co-ordinating support for the implementation of the action plan which the board is preparing.  The board will produce its action plan by the autumn. The remit of the board will be extended to include County Clare.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey will also be given responsibility for overseeing the implementation of a pilot programme for the development of a more integrated approach to the delivery of public services in remote rural areas.  We see this pilot programme &mdash; which will be first developed in the west &mdash; as an important step in the development of an innovative response to the need to reconcile efficiency and equity in ensuring access to services in rural areas generally.</P>
    <P>In addition, he will have a special brief in relation to the improvement in living conditions of residents on our islands.  In this connection, Deputy Carey will chair an inter-departmental committee to examine the various problems facing island communities and the ways in which these difficulties could be overcome.</P>
    <P>In view of the fundamental significance of the Gaeltacht for the future <Col N="1521" /> development of the west, Deputy Carey will also have specific responsibility for the Gaeltacht at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>There have been many, genuine, expressions of concern over the years from different quarters about the development needs of rural Ireland and of the west in particular.  We are conscious of the initiatives of non-governmental groups &mdash; such as the Crusade for Survival launched by the Western Bishops &mdash; in trying to seek solutions to the particular problems of the less economically advantaged regions.  The appointment of Deputy Carey to this particular brief represents, in a very tangible way, the Government's firm commitment to supporting and enhancing these efforts by positive political action. It is only through co-operation between dynamic and forward looking local communities who have a positive vision of their future and a Government firmly committed to western devleopment that real progress can be made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Avril Doyle will be appointed Minister of State at three Departments: The Taoiseach's, Transport, Energy and Communications and my own Department &mdash; Finance.  Her remit will encompass special responsibility for a number of initiatives under the general public service reform umbrella.  This is an area in which I have a particular personal interest and, as Minister for Finance, a special responsibility.</P>
    <P>Among the specific tasks to be assigned to Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, is the development of the strategic management initiative &mdash; or SMI as it has become known &mdash; in the public service.</P>
    <P>This important initiative, which is currently under way across all Departments and offices, was set in train by the previous Taoiseach and is being continued by this Government.  The first phase of the initiative, which was completed in the latter part of 1994, concentrated on developing the mission and strategic high-level objectives of each Department and the identification of the optimum business strategy over the next <Col N="1522" /> several years.  The initiative also embraces wider public service issues which transcend the immediate concerns of any one Department.</P>
    <P>The primary objective of the SMI is to put in place, in each Department and public service agency, a management process focused on ensuring continuous improvements in the performance of the civil and wider public service in relation to the following items: the contribution that they can make to national development; the provision of services to the public; and the efficient and effective use of resources.</P>
    <P>The establishment, or consolidation, of this type of management process requires that each Department and agency should (1) establish clear, focused objectives aimed at achieving Government policy; (2) devise appropriate strategies for the pursuit of these objectives; (3) set ambitious, reliable output targets at all levels within the organisation; (4) monitor progress with a view to ensuring that targets are being achieved; and (5) continuously roll over plans and strategies to ensure ongoing improvements in efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
    <P>Another aim of the SMI initiative is to ensure greater co-operation and interaction between Departments in areas of mutual interest and between Departments and their agencies.  There will also be a greater focus on improving the delivery of services with a view to making them more customer orientated.</P>
    <P>Following the completion of the first phase of the SMI, Departments are now commencing the process of concentrating their aims and strategies into specific objectives to inform the day-to-day work of their staff.  This will require each Department to establish relevant measures of performance so that progress at all levels can be monitored and evaluated.</P>
    <P>The size of the public service, the volume of resources which it manages, and the prominent contributions which it makes to the national economy require that it functions with optimum efficiency and that its many activities <Col N="1523" /> are designed for maximum effectiveness. The pace of change &mdash; social, economic and even political &mdash; and the growing impact of international factors demand that our public service management structures and systems be flexible and responsive and capable of delivering value for money.</P>
    <P>The SMI will embrace a critical assessment of existing practices along with the many assumptions and rigidities which have, inevitably, grown up in areas of the public service over the years.  It will facilitate the carrying through of the necessary reforms to ensure that the public service is able to meet the challenges of the coming decades effectively and with confidence.</P>
    <P>Another important area of reform in which I expect Deputy Doyle will play a major role is in ensuring that the interests of the consumer are paramount in all dealings with the public services, including State companies.  The Government's programme of work includes an undertaking to publish an administrative procedures Bill.  The objective of this Bill will be to ensure that the citizen, in all his or her dealings with the institutions of Government, receives the level of service which he or she has every right to expect.  The Bill will vest in the Office of the Ombudsman monitoring and regulatory functions and will incorporate requirements on such issues as response time for handling cases, the level of guidance to be given to the public, and the form in which decisions are communicated which will set out the basis for the decision, the right of appeal, the right of access to relevant information on the case and the right of the individual to confer with the officials who have taken the decision.</P>
    <P>I also intend that Deputy Doyle will be closely involved in the following other key public service reform items. First, the review of the provisions of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, which underpins our Civil Service system. This will involve consideration of, <Col N="1524" /> among other things, the extent and limitations of ministerial and Civil Service accountability and responsibility. Second, the strengthening of our Oireachtas committee system through the introduction of legislation which will empower committees to call for persons and papers and to confer privilege on witnesses.  A major effect of this change will be to extend and deepen public accountability.  Third, a review of the remit of the Ombudsman with a view to a major extension of that office's powers. That office has been in place for more than ten years and has served the country well.  However, there have been significant developments in our system of public administration since then and in public expectations of that system and the legislative basis for the Ombudsman's activities to be extended to reflect such change.  Fourth, the devolution of responsibility and accountability, communication and managerial cohesion within the public service and, fifth, the development, generally, of the principles of openness and transparency.</P>
    <P>I look forward to working closely with Deputy Doyle on these and other issues. I am only too painfully aware that the history of reform of the Irish public service has been somewhat problematic. Our progress in this sphere has been very poor compared with that of many other Western democracies.</P>
    <P>The problem has been nothing less than a failure to give our citizens the top quality and efficient services which they deserve because in a very real sense they are the ultimate owners of these services and are paying for them through taxation.</P>
    <P>Our inability to maintain a sustained approach to public service reform has not been an intellectual one.  We can compare with the best in so far as the critical analysis of our problems and the development of original ideas for their resolution is concerned.  One has only to recall the report of the Public Services Organisation Review Group &mdash; or the Devlin report as it is more commonly called; the White Paper on Serving the <Col N="1525" /> Country Better, and the excellent contributions made by public servants, academics and political figures over the years in the pages of such journals as <i>Administration</i>, published by the IPA and <i>Seirbhis Phoibli</i>, published by my Department, to realise that our difficulties lie outside the realms of rigorous thought and imaginative response. Indeed, I am aware that some of the public service reform concepts which were developed here, but never implemented, have been adopted and applied in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>In trying to get behind this failure, I have come to the conclusion that two fundamental, yet related, flaws dogged previous reform initiatives: first, there was a lack of real political support &mdash; which resulted from both the slow rate of progress and the perceived need to move on to what were regarded as more pressing items.  Second, there was a somewhat hesitant enthusiasm for change at administrative level, brought about largely by the fact that the public service management did not own the decisions involved in the reform process.</P>
    <P>I am, however, convinced that prevailing administrative and political circumstance is more conducive than ever to meaningful change.  The key reform issue, and the one on which our public service reform measures in all other areas are predicated &mdash; the strategic management initiative &mdash; is being developed within Departments and the emphasis is clearly placed on departmental ownership of, and, more importantly, responsibility for, the initiative.  The bottom-up approach is a much more certain road to success.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service which will be required to carry through change is progressive-minded and a far cry from the obstructive &ldquo;Yes Minister&rdquo; ethos which some still associate with our modern public administration.  Our top Civil Service is now entirely peopled with officials who attained office through the rigorous competitive system of the Top Level Appointments Committee.  These officials from all Departments and <Col N="1526" /> offices regularly get together in networks to discuss, analyse and plan resolutions of the varying strategic issues which confront our public service.</P>
    <P>The new role envisaged for Ministers of State with responsibility in several Departments should complement this process.  In recent years it has been recognised that there is a need to carry out specific tasks which cut across traditional departmental lines.  There are many tasks which have remained difficult to accomplish successfully because they fall between Departments or because a truly co-ordinated approach has not been achieved due to the differences in outlook or priority of the many Departments involved.  Examples include the care of children which involves the Departments of Education, Justice and Health &mdash; Deputy Currie has now been assigned responsibility for this specific area &mdash; and the identification and elimination of anomalies that have grown up between the social welfare system and the tax system &mdash; Deputy Durkan has been assigned to accomplish this task.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out the two additional Ministers of State proposed will in each case have functions involving the co-ordination of the work of a number of Departments to achieve the completion of specific projects.  I believe that this cross-departmental approach will work and could well prove to be a useful mechanism for future Governments to adopt.  Clearly it will be a matter for each new Government to decide whether and to what extent the additional posts now being created will be used.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I believe that, rather than lamenting the political failures of the past &mdash; which is a futile exercise at any time &mdash; we should resolve not to repeat the same mistakes.  I can only speak with direct authority on the commitment to change at Government level; that commitment is real and is expressed in unambiguous terms in our Programme for Government.  We are quite prepared to be judged on the integrity of our efforts to effect change.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1527" /> The Government has an ambitious programme of work.  We are determined to see it through.  We must maximise our resources to ensure success and increasing the number of Ministers of State will play an important part in this process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not begrudge Deputies Doyle and Carey their appointments as I know they will make fine Ministers of State.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, my former colleague, and still my very good friend, I hope, made a good case for reform in the public service but no case that we need two extra Ministers of State to carry it out.</P>
      <P>This is the kind of proposal and debate which confirms cynicism in the mind of the general public about all politicians.  It is comforting to know that the high moral ground has been abandoned long enough to fix up some jobs for the boys and girls.  At the outset of this debate, I give this commitment on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, we will repeal this legislation when we return to office after the next general election.</P>
      <P>I wish to dispel any notion that might be abroad that this Bill was part of some trade-off between my party and the Government in order to allow Deputy Joe Jacob to retain the office of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  It was never part of any negotiations leading to the retention of Deputy Jacob in that position.</P>
      <P>We are all familiar with Parkinson's Law, that &ldquo;work expands to fill the time available for its completion&rdquo;.  Now we have a new law &mdash; the Rainbow Law, &ldquo;work expands to fill the number of Ministers of State available for its completion.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When our Constitution was drafted it was laid down that Government was to be carried on by a Government of no fewer than seven members and not more than 15.  That Ministers might require assistance, particularly in the running of the larger Departments of State, was recognised even then by the creation of the post of Parliamentary <Col N="1528" /> Secretary.  Usually there were seven such Parliamentary Secretaries.</P>
    <P>The only reason we should appoint Ministers of State is to do certain work to which, because of their busy schedules, Ministers cannot devote sufficient time.  Has the amount of work increased so dramatically in the past two months that we need two extra Ministers of State?  Shortly after returning to office in 1977, Fianna Fáil introduced legislation whereby Parliamentary Secretaries were replaced by Ministers of State, the number of which was fixed at ten.</P>
    <P>The change of title was justified among other reasons, by reference to our membership of the EEC and the difficulty involved in communicating to those less fortunate Europeans unfamiliar with British Parliamentary titles that Parliamentary Secretaries were not in fact rather aged clerical assistants. Obviously, the change of title need not have meant much to the taxpayer, but the increase in the number of available jobs to ten did have a significant cost implication.</P>
    <P>The Government of 1977 has never been noted, certainly not by myself, as a Government of frugality or financial self restraint.  Three years later, the number of Ministers of State was increased to 15 and since then, regardless of whether Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or the Progressive Democrats were in Government, we have been singularly &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; by having as many Ministers of State as members of the Government.</P>
    <P>Having 15 Ministers of State has always had as much to do with political patronage as with any real necessity for so many of these appointments.  Certainly, there were always good reasons for the appointment of Ministers of State to large Departments.  Equally, in 1987 the appointment of Ministers of State was used to add focus to specific areas of developmental interest; food and horticulture are good examples. Nevertheless, it has to be said that the main reason for having 15 Ministers of <Col N="1529" /> State has always been political expediency. In 1980, it suited the new leadership of Fianna Fáil to have more appointments available in the context of Fianna Fáil's unprecedented number of backbenchers at that time.</P>
    <P>Between 1982 and 1987, it suited Fine Gael and Labour to retain 15 Ministers of State so as to tie as many backbenchers as possible into an administration which was not universally popular in those parties and especially the Labour Party.  The same rationale applied to the recent administrations involving Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and the Labour Party.  Many of the Ministers of State are virtually titular appointments involving little or any real power or administrative benefit.  There is a good case to be made for reducing the number of such appointments.  There is no case to be made for increasing that number. Any person who was a member of a Government in the recent past will agree with that.  Nobody is really suggesting that there are any administrative reasons for the proposal contained in this Bill to create two further Ministers of State.</P>
    <P>The necessity for these appointments derives solely and blatantly from the inability of Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left to agree on how to share out the existing 15 Cabinet and 15 Ministers of State posts.  It is no coincidence that the last, and some would say, the only, issue to be resolved during the negotiations which preceded the setting up of this Government was the jobs issue.  After all, the Labour Party was half way through an agreed Programme for Government negotiated with Fianna Fáil and had virtually completed renegotiating the second half of that programme.  Fine Gael and Democratic Left had consistently and often bitterly opposed the thrust and content of the Fianna Fáil-Labour programme.</P>
    <P>Within days, however, it was clear that either Labour was abandoning the policies it had just signed up to implement with Fianna Fáil, or that Fine Gael and Democratic Left were happily signing up to implement Fianna <Col N="1530" /> Fáil-Labour policies.  The only item which caused any real difficulty was the unfortunate implications of the fact that 32 does not go into 30.</P>
    <P>The financial ills of this country in the 1970s and 1980s entirely reflected the inability of Governments to cut their cloth to suit their measure.  Wishing to implement, for example, 32 projects but only having the funds in hand for 30, the Government's answer was not to cut back on the number of projects undertaken but rather to spend beyond our national means.</P>
    <P>It bodes ill for this administration, and for the country, that the Government's solution to the problem of 32 ambitions being irreconcilable with only 30 appointments is to increase the number of appointments.  It is worth reflecting on why the number of Ministers of State is to be increased to 17 as opposed to 16 or 18?  Initially, as Labour refused to accept fewer Cabinet positions than they held with Fianna Fáil, six, as Fine Gael refused to accept fewer than a majority of the Cabinet posts, eight, and as Democratic Left insisted on the O'Malley minimum number of posts for Government participation, two, the problem was that 16 jobs cannot be filled from 15 vacancies.</P>
    <P>Quite obviously if the Constitution did not limit the number of appointments to Government then the solution would have been simply to increase the size of the Cabinet.  Fortunately, for the taxpayer but unfortunately for Deputy Rabbitte, his ambitions have not been deemed sufficiently serious to justify a constitutional referendum.  Instead of two Cabinet posts, the Democratic Left was asked to take one place at the Cabinet table for two Ministers of State as consolation prizes.  This leaves Deputy Rabbitte in an odd position; able to attend Cabinet meetings but not to participate in any useful way.  He will be seen and not heard; a political role equivalent to that of a eunuch in a harem.</P>
    <P>The cost of this exercise in political futility, the cost of Deputy Rabbitte's <Col N="1531" /> ministerial salary, ministerial car, ministerial advisers and ministerial staff will be borne by the unfortunate taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Why only one new post?  Not only did the negotiations leading to the formation of this Government involve the giving out of a job which did not exist, they also involved the giving away of a job which was not vacant, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's position.  Unwilling to bear the opprobrium of removing Deputy Jacob, the solution found to assuage Deputy Carey's ambition was to create yet a further post of Minister of State.</P>
    <P>Has the west of Ireland suddenly been discovered?  Was it not there last December?  I can find no mention in the Government programme of setting up a new ministry for the west.  One can only say that when the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste said that jobs would be a top priority for this Government, they certainly meant it.  We should be grateful that we only got three quarters of the rainbow.  If the Progressive Democrats were in Government also, presumably there would have had to be so many more Ministers of State that even Deputy Shatter might have been included.  The reason the Progressive Democrats were not included is now fairly clear.</P>
    <P>At the time it was suggested that policy differences might have arisen.  Given that the Blueshirt and Stalinist traditions of Irish politics only really had to haggle over the division of the spoils and sorted out their differences with the only job creation the Government has achieved to date, it is pretty clear that it was the size of the trough and not the pedigree of the diners which decided how many were asked to the table.</P>
    <P>Not alone is a new Government insulting the intelligence of the electorate by creating two new expensive Minister of State posts, but we are being told that the House is to get at least four additional committees.  Whereas there may be reasons for having special additional committees, the only reason the Government is giving at this stage is <Col N="1532" /> the creation of new posts for its backbenchers.</P>
    <P>Each of the committees will carry remuneration for the chairperson and the convenor.  Virtually the only argument put forward to support these appointments is that new structures are necessary in a three party Coalition, but where does this argument end?  Why should we not have two Tánaistes?  I wonder how the electorate would vote if a constitutional amendment to that effect was proposed?  If only my Fianna Fáil colleagues and I could have stumbled on this type of brainwave in the second half of 1994, it would have been very simple to deal with the post of President of the High Court.  Mathematicians among you will have worked out that the answer was to have two Presidents of the High Court.</P>
    <P>Although written more than 100 years ago, William Gilbert's observations on the body politic of late Victorian England are all too often still acutely relevant today.  In &ldquo;the Gondoliers&rdquo; the throne of the imaginary kingdom of Batavia is temporarily occupied by two Venetian Republicans who decide to remould the monarchy on republican lines.  This they seek to achieve by pronouncing that all Departments are to rank equally and that everybody is to be at the head of his Department.  This policy they put into effect with chaotic results while they, as republican monarchs, sing of their new found role in terms that seem singularly appropriate to today's debate.  Rather than sing it, I will quote it:</P>
    <P>O philosophers may sing of the worries of a king, but the pleasures they are many and the privileges great, and the greatest single pleasure that we treasure beyond measure is to run on little errands for the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>Eventually, however, the flaws in this experiment are pointed out in another verse which concludes:</P>
    <P>In short whoever you may be, to this conclusion you'll agree <Col N="1533" /> When everyone is somebodee then no-one's anybody.</P>
    <P>The trouble with this Bill is that, at a time when we should debate a reduction in the number of Ministers of State and restore some public confidence in the Government and public administration we make a farce of the whole concept and role of Ministers of State.</P>
    <P>At a time when the workers in Packard Electric are asked to accept redundancies to keep the overall operation viable &mdash; being asked by no-one other than Deputy Rabbitte &mdash; it is ironic that unnecessary additional jobs are being created by this House &mdash; one of them for Deputy Rabbitte &mdash; simply as very expensive political consolation prizes.</P>
    <P>The public should be aware that the cost of these appointments and the creation of these extra quangos, to be known as special committees, does not just include the extra salaries of the nominees.  The total cost will include the cost of staffing their private offices, employing additional drivers, and extra travel and subsistence.</P>
    <P>I offer a word of advice to the Government backbenchers.  Why stop at two new Ministers of State?  Remember that this Government has a slim majority.  Pick a topical subject and start a crusade on it.  Hint that you might just vote against the Government and persuade one or two others to do likewise. You never know &mdash; you might just get lucky too.  I ask the House to reject this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, it is a pleasure to see you still in the Chair.  I know you are not allowed to comment on that, but the circumstances in which you remain in the Chair have much more to do with the fact that we are having this debate today than the reasons given by Deputy Quinn in justification for what is an outrageous new low point in political cynicism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Necessity has been described as the mother of invention.  In recent weeks we saw that political necessity can be a very <Col N="1534" /> fertile mother.  Rarely has the proposition that necessity is the mother of invention been more clearly demonstrated than in the circumstances that surrounded the genesis of this Bill.  As Deputy McCreevy said, Parkinson's Law, which we all heard about from Professor C. Northcote Parkinson, laid down the principle that work expands to fill the time available for its completion. This Bill is effectively amending legislation to Parkinson's Law in that the work of Government will expand to fill the political need to appoint more officer holders.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy McCreevy that the humble sounding position &ldquo;Parliamentary Secretary&rdquo; was translated into &ldquo;Minister of State&rdquo; for reasons connected with the European Community almost two decades ago.  Nobody begrudges the holders of those offices the extra dignity and status conferred on them by being described as Ministers, even if they are not full members of the Government under the Constitution. Under this Bill it is proposed to increase the total number of ministerial office holders on the Government benches to 32.  As Deputy McCreevy pointed out, that is only a harbinger of what is to come.  In the near future we will have a plethora of new committees with new chairmen and convenors.  The reality is that at the end of this whole procedure there will be almost 50 members on the Government benches drawing salaries arising from parliamentary office in addition to their Deputies' salaries.  It is difficult to imagine a more loyalty-cementing element in a multi-faceted Government.  It will clearly bind together people who have very strong political reasons to flee from each other.</P>
    <P>There is something suspect about a Government the majority of whose parliamentary supporters occupy positions of reward within the Parliament.  It comes almost to the points of Gay Byrne language where there is now one office for every couple in the audience.  We are nearly at the point where there is a job for everybody in the audience as far as the Government is concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1535" /> As a person who has a profession as well as a seat in the Dáil, I do not begrudge any Member of this House carrying out important functions adequate remuneration for them, but I query whether the workload of Government has suddenly expanded so as to require two further office holders or whether on the contrary we are witnessing a feeding frenzy by people who face starvation rations while on the Opposition benches.  As Deputy McCreevy pointed out, there must always be an element of musical chairs in politics.  Sometimes there are not enough positions to satisfy all disappointed supporters.  How would the game of musical chairs work &mdash; it would lose its entire meaning &mdash; if the number of chairs is always increased to accommodate dissatisfied players?  Sixteen into 15 will not go; 32 into 30 will not go &mdash; when I was at school that phenomenon was described as a vulgar fraction.  This legislation issued to camouflage the vulgar fraction of Irish political reality that there are simply too many boys and girls to fill too few jobs.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Donal Carey on his elevation to the rank of Minister of State with special responsibility for the west.  Few Deputies have taken such a consistent interest in the affairs of this House, sitting through long debates and contributing generously of his time to the proceedings of this House and its committees.  Deputy Carey certainly deserves promotion, but he should have got it in December, not belatedly now. He deserved promotion at a time when he was promised it.  With the greatest of respect, what has happened since has been no service to him.  There was to be no ministry for the west when the Government was formed in December. There was however a fixed determination on the part of the Government to appoint Deputy Carey as Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  On 15 and 20 December when announcements were made concerning ministerial appointments no mention was made of western affairs. Such brief was only proposed for the <Col N="1536" /> first time by the Government when the appointment of Deputy Carey as Leas-Cheann Comhairle fell through.  There was no mention of the west in the Programme for Government.  If one searches that programme from beginning to end one will not find the words &ldquo;western development&rdquo; or any similar phrase anywhere in it.  In the confluence of verbiage described as &ldquo;A Government for Renewal&rdquo; there is not one single word about western development.</P>
    <P>At that time there was talk about the need for an extra ministry and a single storey lean-to extension was proposed to the overcrowded house of the Government to accommodate Deputy Avril Doyle; that was the only extension in respect of which planning permission was then sought.  We now have a two storey extension to accommodate Deputy Carey as well.  How has this concern for the west suddenly become a priority for the Government?  As I said earlier, the reality is that it is a simple case of necessity being the mother of invention; the necessity of finding an extra role for somebody to play in Government being the mother of invention, which on this occasion is a new found interest in the west.</P>
    <P>Some people must have been laughing up their sleeves when, in their search for a fig leaf to cover the embarrassment of their retreat on the unsuccessful assault on the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle, it was realised that the consolation prize which would be offered to Deputy Carey would carry with it the windfall of an unexpected episcopal endorsement.  To be fair, the Bishops have shown a consistent sense of purpose in relation to the west, unlike the Government, in its short lifetime, which only remembered the west as a very belated afterthought.  The spin doctors have thought that no one would hit a politician with a Bishop in his arms. That is a phenomenon we are seeing here today.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey has been correctly described as Minister for the West. Deputy Doyle has been properly <Col N="1537" /> described as the Minister for everywhere and everything else.  One has in all decency to extend congratulations to her for her endless patience in becoming the latest occupant of the lean-to-ministry attached to the house of Government. What function will Deputy Doyle fulfil in the Government?  She will be Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Minister of State at the Department of Finance and Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  Is this all the humble Deputy is seeking for herself? No.  We also learn that she is to be given responsibility for the strategic management initiative in the entire public service.  However, this is not all.  We are told that she will be specially charged with the entirely new function of ensuring that the interests of the consumer are paramount in all dealings with the public services.</P>
    <P>That is not the end of it either, her interests go further than that.  She will also reform the Ombudsman's office and, when finished with that, she has responsibility for the relations of customers with all state companies.  Lastly, when she has accomplished all those tasks, this all-powerful Minister of State is expected to take responsibility for consumer guarantee programmes in the wider public service.  That is a handful. I am very glad that someone will take up all those tasks.  What would have happened if this Bill had not been drafted?  What would the other 15 Minister of State have managed to do with their time if Deputy Doyle had not come to their assistance and made sense of all the nonsense to which Deputy Quinn referred earlier?</P>
    <P>One of the things which struck me about Deputy Quinn's analysis of what Deputy Doyle will be doing was his frank admission that there had been plenty of reports and thinking about the inadequacies of our public service. However, the curious thing is that when it came to implementing those reports there was, as Deputy Quinn said, a remarkable lack of political will.  He <Col N="1538" /> attributes this to a lack of political support, which I suppose is the responsibility of politicians, and a lack of public service support, which is the responsibility of the public service.</P>
    <P>He tends to believe &mdash; in this he is naive &mdash; that because this new formula for reform of the public service will come from the ground upwards and will be endorsed by the entire public service it will succeed where others have failed. Do we in this House not remember that at one time we had a Minister for the Public Service, a man charged with responsibility for all these things and with a full Department to accomplish them?  He did not bestride three Departments, like the colossus which is now to be Deputy Doyle.  How is it that a man given an entire Department for himself to accomplish all these things, for example, the Devlin report, etc. &mdash; the former Deputy John Boland was a great occupier of that office &mdash; failed completely to deliver on the agenda which Deputy Quinn now says is being implemented in other countries using our theoretical models as patterns?  The reality is that there has been paralysis through analysis in relation to reform of the public service and a Minister of State who has her feet in at least three Departments from time to time will not make greater progress in this task than a specially commissioned Minister for the Public Service did in the past.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Doyle, the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, has been given huge and wide-ranging responsibilities. When he is not performing as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs he is in charge of local development.  What falls outside those two remits?  When he is finished worrying about European affairs on behalf of the country he spends the other 12 hours of his day worrying about local development.  He also has to take on board responsibility for the International Financial Services Centre.  Why somebody who is responsible for European affairs and local development should be responsible for the International Financial Services Centre <Col N="1539" /> escapes me.  When he is finished all those tasks he is charged by the Government with responsibility for preparing our position for the intergovernmental conference in 1996.  To do all these things he is attached to two Departments, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>One could take two views on these issues.  First, one could say that these broad and formidable ranges of special responsibilities show that we are dealing with a new breed of politician, super men and super women.  Is it a bird, is it a plane?  No, it is Deputy Mitchell or Deputy Doyle.  Are we to believe that ordinary poor mortals who grind their way to the top in politics can only handle a Department but that this new generation of purpose-bred politicians can achieve tasks which span entire Departments and the continent of Europe and at the same time concentrate on local developments?</P>
    <P>The alternative view is that junior Ministers are, as Deputy McCreevy said, people who substitute for Ministers when they are not available and who can give on the record briefings to the press in their areas of competence. This is a huge advantage because there has been much controversy about off the record briefings which apparently are reserved for the higher ranking category of programme managers in the new system of Government.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Harney it is unfortunate that in the rash of ministerial appointments at junior level they have somehow scrapped the only junior ministry which made any impression on the public, the Minister with responsibility for environmental protection.  I sympathise with Deputy Harney's sense of anger and disappointment that that office which achieved real things and which the average person understood in terms of its breadth, purpose and potential has been swept away and been replaced by a number of highly artificial glomerations of special responsibilities. none of which means anything to anybody.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1540" /> I ask any member of this Government to go down O'Connell Street, around St. Stephen's Green.  Moore Street or Henry Street and ask the people they meet the responsibilities of any of the junior Ministers.  The only job identified will be that of Deputy Carey because nobody will ever remember the list of gobbledygook appointments and responsibilities that have been held out as the special responsibility of other Ministers, including Deputy Doyle.</P>
    <P>I note the Members of the Labour Party have left the House because this is an embarrassing moment and it is all Fine Gael's fault.  I note also the Members of Democratic Left are not here either and that is the best thing to do, keep one's head down and do not get into trouble.  It is noteworthy that Democratic Left has received greater largesse in terms of Minister of State appointments than it had anticipated.  I have to agree with Deputy McCreevy, however, that that probably arises from its disappointment at not getting another full Cabinet position.  Of course, this difficulty of the Democratic Left Party arose from the intransigence of its senior partners, neither of whom was willing to yield right of way to Deputy Rabbitte and accord him a proper place at the Cabinet table.  So he has to be content with what I would describe as a ministerial high chair drawn up at the edge of the Cabinet table, alongside the Whip, Deputy Barrett, and now, in addition to a Whip at the Cabinet table, we have a Minister of State brandishing a rattle, or perhaps a soother, for Democratic Left.</P>
    <P>Programme managers and unelected advisers have recently come in for a bit of stick and I want to comment in the context of the Bill, on those categories of people.  There is nothing wrong in the appointment of Cabinet type assistance to assist in the formulation and implementation of ministerial policy.  There is a great need for Ministers to have trusted political advisers available on a full time basis to counterbalance purely departmental advice.  Accordingly, I <Col N="1541" /> have not joined in the chorus of complaint about the appointment of programme managers but it is important that those who are, for the time being, programme managers should not discredit the system under which they were appointed.  Especially in a Coalition, there can be need for ministerial cohesion.  As one who was constantly upbraided, while chairman of my party but not a Member of this House, for being an unelected voice offstage, I can afford the wry reflection that my subsequent re-election to this House, did not seem to lend any new weight or authority to anything I ever had to say and my critics did not seem to accord me or my ideas any special new status by virtue of the fact that I had, in the meantime, been elected.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that politics is about the implementation of policy and the political parties are the vehicles by which those policies are endorsed by the electorate and brought forward for implementation in Government. Political parties are not the booster stage of a rocket which falls away, burns up in the atmosphere and puts the most prominent members of the party in question into orbit as Ministers.  There is a great need for a mechanism to keep elected politicians in touch with their policy agenda, just as there is a need to keep elected politicians in touch with the grassroots of their political parties. If we want to keep elected Ministers in charge of Departments in touch with their political agenda, we must have something akin to a Cabinet.  There must be a counterbalance to the force and the dynamic of departmental advice and the departmental agenda to which every Minister is necessarily subject. The recent controversy, therefore, about ministerial appointments, advisers and programme managers seems, in large measure, to have avoided what I consider is a worthwhile feature of those offices, that it is essential that a political party does not regard obtaining office as an end in itself but is always loyal and faithful to the policy mandate which put it into Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1542" /> I sincerely wish Deputies Doyle and Carey well as the intended beneficiaries of this most ill-conceived and unnecessary addition to the power of Government to appoint Ministers of State.  Both of them are equally deserving of the status of Minister of State, if any of their colleagues are.  I genuinely mean that, but it is an appalling departure from common sense in politics that a Government should, because of parties elbowing each other off the ball at a particular point in the formation of the Government, force itself into the position where it has to effectively make the case in public that the business of Government requires 32 people to hold ministerial office.  What has happened in the past four, five or six weeks that requires more Ministers and why has there not been any detailed evaluation of the responsibilities conferred in December on the other Ministers of State to see whether the functions which are being talked about today could have been carried out by them?  Why were two Members of this House, Deputies Carey and Doyle, forced to wait for promotion while others do not have to face the glare of publicity or the questionable status of being &ldquo;add ons&rdquo; to the roll of Ministers, while their jobs were not sufficiently evaluated or justified in the past?</P>
    <P>The average person has come to the clear conclusion that we do not need 32 Ministers and they will seriously resent it if, in addition to that, a clatter of Members of this House are offered jobs as committee chairmen and convenors. In those circumstances, there will be well justified cynicism and despair that, in the last analysis, the first legislation that should come before the House in the lifetime of a new Government should be cynical, self-serving legislation designed to make easy the relationship between the political parties rather than facilitate the Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>Throughout this economy there is waste and any Government which intends to control public expenditure must show a desire to cut back on public <Col N="1543" /> expenditure where it can be done and to minimise its increases where increases are forced upon us.  By the same token, if the members of a Government &mdash; particularly the Labour Party members &mdash; go through the charade of renouncing ministerial increases in salary, even though they voted for them on a division in this House some weeks, before, and then effectively set at nought that gesture by creating two new ministries with two new sets of civil servants, two sets of drivers and so on, and at the same time ask to be taken credibly when they say they are trying to control public spending, credulity is stretched too far.</P>
    <P>This is a needless, self-inflicted wound in the foot of this Government on the first day of its first session in this House.  It is a mistake which ought not to have been made.  I say that entirely without prejudice to my genuine message of congratulation to the two prospective appointees.  Each of them has a daunting task ahead.  While I may have made fun of Deputy Doyle's agenda in that it is vague and open ended, both of them have a job to do but that job did not require the appointment of two additional people.  In making these two appointments, the wrong message has been sent out to the people and this Government has chosen, on the first day of its first session in this House, to blow its foot away with an unnecessary gesture of contempt for the judgment of the people.  If there had been a frank concession that this was simply in order to moderate the party political interests of the parties in Government, if there had been an admission that concern for the west of Ireland was an afterthought that only occurred to them because they could not have another more exalted job, if there had been an admission that Deputy Doyle's tasks could have been carried out by her as one of the 15 original appointees as Minister of State, I would be tempted to show some sympathy for the Government.  However, I do not think I am required to show sympathy for what is, in essence, an exercise <Col N="1544" /> in cynicism, a betrayal of common sense.</P>
    <P>On his first day as Taoiseach Deputy Bruton said in this House that in gaelic Ireland the Taoiseach was one who led by example rather than exhortation. Where is the example in these two unnecessary jobs?  He said that the Taoiseach led by the character rather than coercion and exercised such authority as he had as a service to the people.  He went on: &ldquo;In the same way that I seek simplicity in the Office of Taoiseach, I seek simplicity in Government and national politics.  Good Government is a public service and should be kept simple. This is a Republic.&rdquo;  The following words are most important: &ldquo;Public office is a privilege that must be paid for in hard work and long hours&rdquo;.  While the two Deputies I mentioned earned their particular promotions, the public should not be asked to pay for the creation of two extra posts to accommodate them. The public should be repaid by this House rejecting what are unnecessary additions to the number of office-holders. This House should reject this measure and tell the Government that the proposed functions of Deputies Doyle and Carey should go to two of the 15 Ministers of State.  These tasks should be carried out by the existing Ministers of State and the Government should not increase that number simply to accommodate every demand and in the interests of political expediency.</P>

      <P>I have enjoyed the last two contributions.  The core message was predictable and, if necessary, any of us could have written the scripts.  They were humorous, well put together, articulate and entertaining.  There were, however, a few inaccuracies.  When Deputy McDowell went to such lengths to get my job description on the record, I am amazed that it was incomplete.  He could add to the list my role as chairman of the Government's Famine Commemoration Committee and the 1798 Commemoration Committee.  On the question of hard work and long hours, <Col N="1545" /> neither Deputy Carey nor I have ever been found wanting.</P>

      <P>It will be difficult also for the Deputy in his arduous position.  I am delighted to have been appointed by the Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, to the position of Minister of State at the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance and Transport, Energy and Communications, underlining the role of the introduction of the strategic management initiative in the public service.  I can assure the last speakers that it is far from a titular appointment.  My appointment is a strong public statement of the Taoiseach's and the Government's commitment to making the public service more efficient and better focused on the needs of its customers.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> places very considerable emphasis on the change in the public service to make it more responsible, transparent and accountable. I would draw the attention of the last two speakers to page 6 of that programme. The agenda for change is a demanding and complex one which affects all public service bodies across the range of State services.  Because of this, a high degree of co-ordinated action in many different policy areas is required.  Hence my post.</P>
      <P>It is not always readily appreciated how large the public service is &mdash; it employs in excess of 180,000 people and the current pay bill exceeds £4 billion annually.  Neither is it readily understood that our system of governance rests primarily on a single Act, the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  Ensuring that the public service and the resources, financial and human, at its disposal are well managed requires dedicated political direction.  My task is to provide that direction, with special responsibility to introduce needed change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to achieve change of the magnitude required, an agenda for <Col N="1546" /> action must be set.  Of necessity, it must be far-reaching, focused, and designed to achieve results.  It must be based on a coherent programme of action where the various elements will make a real difference to the quality of service to the public and will improve confidence in our public institutions.  For this purpose, I have been assigned to three Departments &mdash; those of the Taoiseach, Finance, and Transport, Energy and Communications &mdash; which, in the light of my remit are the three key Departments.</P>
    <P>My assignment to these three Departments will enable me to co-ordinate the planning and implementation of the change process across the widest possible spectrum and in the shortest period. My appointment to the Department of the Taoiseach demonstrates political commitment at the highest level to public service reform.  As a Minister of State in the Department of the Taoiseach with particular responsibility for the strategic management initiative &mdash; to which I will return shortly &mdash; I will be able to play a key role in bringing forward change which, by its nature, affects not just one or two Departments but all Departments of State.</P>
    <P>Complementing this will be my role in the Department of Finance, which will also be essential to the overall success of the process, given that Department's function in relation to public service management and development. Legislative changes arising from the strategic management initiative, such as amendment of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, and the proposed administrative procedures Bill, will be implemented by the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>My appointment to the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, with its wide variety of State bodies providing services to the public, is intended to give extra focus to the urgent necessity to improve the delivery of services in order to make them more customer oriented and customer friendly.</P>
    <P>There are, therefore, a number of key <Col N="1547" /> areas on which I, as Minister of State, will focus in the immediate future. These are: (a) the deepening and strengthening of the Strategic Management Initiative within the public service; (b) developing, in conjunction with all the interested parties, a concerted programme of reform aimed at making public organisations more transparent and accountable, more efficient and effective, and more responsive to the needs of the public and (c) working closely with public sector organisations to produce standards of customer service which will set down the service to which the public is entitled and provide specific redress for customers who do not receive service to the specified standard.</P>
    <P>In all these areas, I will be working closely with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and my colleague, Deputy Lowry, Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, as well as the coordinating group of Secretaries set up to facilitate and support the SMI process and attendant reform programme.</P>
    <P>Public service reform is not a new idea.  We are all aware of attempts made in the past, with varying degrees of success, to improve the efficiency and operation of the public service.  We are also aware of attempts in other countries to make progress in this area.</P>
    <P>Why is reform important?  It is easy to forget just how large the public service actually is or the very significant role which it plays in the national economy. The non-industrial Civil Service itself employs almost 29,000 people, while the wider public service &mdash; excluding the commercial State sector &mdash; employs around 182,000.  To give some idea of the scale of services, there are more than 60,000 people providing health services alone.  The public service pay bill runs to more than £4 billion a year &mdash; a colossal sum no matter how one looks at it.  Simply as taxpayers, we should be concerned to ensure that this massive level of expenditure yields real value for money and that this vast manpower is <Col N="1548" /> deployed in the most effective manner possible.</P>
    <P>A very small increase in the efficiency of the public service, when translated into cash and manpower terms, can mean a sizeable saving in taxation, the freeing up of scarce resources, financial and human, for redeployment to areas of universal concern &mdash; reducing unemployment, the creation of new business opportunities, the alleviation of social problems &mdash; the list is endless.  However, the size and diversity of the public service mean that improvements in efficiency and effectiveness will not come about of themselves.  Indeed, experience here and in other countries would indicate that great discipline by the Government is required to ensure that the public service does not expand beyond the capacity of the economy to sustain it.</P>
    <P>This Government believes that only ongoing dedicated political commitment to public service reform will bring about the kind of changes we would all like to see.  My appointment attests to this.  We have a public service we can be proud of; generally it has served us well down the years but, of course, there are many areas in need of improvement.  I have no doubt that most senior public servants would not disagree with me on this point.</P>
    <P>The key to achieving the needed reform is the strategic management-initiative &mdash; or SMI &mdash; which was introduced last year and which has already led to the production by all Government Departments and offices of a strategic statement on what they ought to be doing in the future, rather than merely a static review of what they have been doing up to now.  The purpose of the SMI is to relate the planning process to needed organisational change so that each Department and public body is enabled to focus clearly on its main business objectives and how it should best achieve these.  Very importantly, it requires also the identification and pursuit of those objectives which span two or more Departments or bodies.  The Government's commitment to tackling <Col N="1549" /> such problems is exemplified by the appointment of my colleague, Deputy Currie, to as Minister of State at the Departments of Health, Education and Justice, to ensure proper co-ordination of services for child care.  The aim, ultimately, of the SMI is to secure, from within existing resources, continuous tangible improvements in the overall level of performance across the public service in all areas of its activities.</P>
    <P>Some Departments have been more successful to date than others in formulating their objectives and strategies, but there can be no doubt that the type of critical self-scrutiny which SMI requires is leading to a very worthwhile and fundamental examination of the Civil Service as a whole.  As SMI matures, as we begin to understand the concept more clearly and it becomes accepted and better understood by management across Departments, we can expect to see a more cohesive, co-ordinated and accountable group of organisations emerging.  It will be my task to ensure that this happens, that the various plans, and strategies are implemented and progress monitored so that the required results are achieved.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy is right &mdash; because of busy schedules line Ministers cannot devote sufficient time to major tasks, such as the one I have been charged with and hence my specific job remit.</P>
    <P>What needs to be reformed?  This is a more difficult question than it sounds. The business of Government today is highly complex, spanning a vast array of activities and services, and touching the lives of every citizen in the State.  No other organisation, or group of organisations, comes remotely close to the public service in this respect.  It is reasonable, therefore, to expect that the factors which affect its smooth and effective operation are themselves diverse and complex.  We need to be better informed about, and take a greater interest in, the many factors involved if we are to address the full range of issues and make the correct decisions.  To this end, I would welcome a constructive debate on the many <Col N="1550" /> issues in question.  Indeed, one of my first objectives is to initiate such a debate.  To help this process, I would now like to mention some of the issues which need to be considered to bring about meaningful reform.</P>
    <P>I have already said that our whole system of governance rests primarily on the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, which provides the statutory basis for all Government Departments and their Ministers.  It is worth bearing in mind that it was drafted 70 years ago and reflects a view of the public service which has long been overtaken by events.  The Civil Service at that time was far smaller and embraced a much more limited set of activities.  The concept of the Minister as a &ldquo;corporation sole&rdquo;, as it appears in that Act, has far-reaching implications for us today as we envisage ways of increasing the degree of delegation across the public service.</P>
    <P>Responsible and efficient management implies clearly defined duties and the authority to carry them out.  Excessive centralisation can frustrate attempts to uphold this principle.  Only through effective delegation can we be sure that the right people are always doing their right job, and that no more resources are deployed than are required to do the job.  This sounds very simple and sensible but it has frequently proven problematic in practice.  I will be urging the introduction of more effective ways of achieving greater delegation, of ensuring that decisions are being taken at the right level and being carried through by those best able to address the real needs of the situation.</P>
    <P>In this context, I believe that the conventional interpretation of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, merits reassessment. I am, therefore, asking my officials to look afresh at the Act with a view to determing whether amending legislation is needed to ensure a more thoroughgoing delegation of ministerial responsibility than is commonly thought possible at present.  I am doing the work but am not the payroll &mdash; I can read Deputy McCreevy's mind and I will say it for him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1551" /> It is possible that in practice we have adopted a somewhat narrow and restrictive interpretation of the 1924 Act which may unintentionally have acted to constrain the degree to which the delegation or devolution of responsibility is practised in the public service.</P>
    <P>Delegation in turn implies accountability. There is no point in managing a large organisation if one does not have a reliable means of assessing its performance. Those entrusted with the provision of services in the public interest and for the common good should be required at all times to provide evidence that they are doing so effectively, in accordance with the wishes of the Government, and in a manner which ensures the best value for money.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that accountability within the public service has not always been given the attention it deserves, an understatement, I suggest.  Granted, individual civil servants are accountable to their superiors and, in turn, to their Minister but the mechanisms underpinning this accountability are often poorly defined, rendering a rigorous assessment of performance a problematic, if not impossible, tasks.  Any programme of reform worth its salt must address the question of accountability, and the extent to which individual public servants can be held fully answerable for their actions, with the minimum fuss and delay.  Experience has shown that such an ideal, in any form of employment, whether in the public or private sector, can be difficult to achieve in practice.  I hope, during my term of office, to tackle this issue and help to bring about a system of public service management which makes it easier to assess performance, at the level of both the individual public servant and his or her organisation as a whole.</P>
    <P>A robust system of accountability and effective delegation in turn depends upon transparency across all layers of management.  Of all institutions, the Civil Service is probably uppermost in the minds of most people as an example <Col N="1552" /> of an organisation imbued with secretiveness, of limited disclosure, and of vagueness in relation to the ways in which decisions are made and communicated. True accountability and transparency in any bureaucracy cannot be assured without effective legislative support. I am anxious to see to what extent existing mechanisms need to be strengthened and how those being called to account can have confidence in the process.  To this end, I will be looking at what legislation is needed in relation to the compellability and privilege of those appearing before Dáil Committees and the like, particularly in the light of our present experiences arising from the proceedings of the Committee on Legislation and Security.</P>
    <P>This Government is also committed to the introduction of freedom of information legislation.  I regard this as central to any administrative reform of the public service and, when enacted, I will be responsible for implementing its provisions and ensuring that it makes the desired contribution to greater openness and transparency.  In this regard, the Government has also indicated its intention to review the Official Secrets Act and the Data Protection Act.</P>
    <P>Ideally, we want an administrative framework which is more liberal in its approach to the sharing and exchange of information.  We want to know where responsibility lies for particular decisions and the basis on which they were made.  This has not always been possible to date.  I am sure we are all familiar with cases of citizens having been frustrated in their attempts to secure information to which they consider themselves entitled.  I want a situation which not only guarantees greater equity and transparency in this area but one in which all necessary information is supplied with the minimum formality and delay.  In my experience, the majority of public servants are highly committed people, dedicated to ensureing the highest level of service and fair treatment.  However, without the necessary legislative support, such as a freedom of information Act, there are real <Col N="1553" /> practical limitations on the extent to which any administrative structure can embody the kinds of safeguards we all expect in a modern, open and democratic society.</P>
    <P>Interestingly, having chided the Labour Party and Democratic Left for not being present for the debate I see the Progressive Democrats have such little interest in the job remit of the two Ministers of State concerned that they have left the House, a point worth noting.</P>
    <P>I adverted several times to the quality of service received by the public.  A variety of Departments and other public bodies deliver a vast range of services, such as health, social welfare, tax administration, transport, post and telecommunications and energy, to name but a few.  When the previous Taoiseach introduced the strategic management initiative early last year, he correctly identified service to the public as one of the cornerstones of any programme of reform.  It is all too easy to become preoccupied with details and to forget that the overriding consideration, every time, is the customer, the citizen, the taxpayer.  Unless this underlies all strategic considerations, the overall direction pursued by the organisation is flawed.</P>
    <P>We should learn the lesson of industry, or private business.  Few commercial concerns would survive today unless they focused clearly on the needs of the customer and continued to adapt over time in a fast changing environment.  I believe we should expect no less of the public service.  While an exact translation of commercial principles and attitudes would not be appropriate, there is no doubt that the public service would benefit from the kind of vigorous introspection which has helped modern successful industries and service sector enterprises to focus on their customers.</P>
    <P>It is only right that I should acknowledge the important advances which have already been made in the area of services to the public by many of our Departments and public bodies.  The SMI is designed to further these changes, to instil the disciplines which <Col N="1554" /> will result in a progressively more responsive, adaptable and resilient public service, where the norm is one of excellence in the provision of services to the public and the recognition that the public, as customer and taxpayer, deserves no less.  To reinforce this approach, I expect each Department and public body, particularly those that have extensive dealings with the public, to take every reasonable step to make their customers fully aware of the services they provide and of the standard of service to which each individual is entitled.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to extend the powers of the Ombudsman through the introduction of an administrative procedures Act which has the aim of securing maximum compliance with the tenets of good public administration, including service to the public.  This will give a further means of redress to consumers of public services.  I have no doubt, however, that it will help to break down the walls of formality between the citizen, on one hand, and public service officials on the other.  This and similar measures will help to generate an ethos in which quality, responsiveness and equity in the provision of services will be a major factor in shaping public service management decisions at all levels.</P>
    <P>None of this can be achieved overnight. The strategic management initiative, however, is a significant step towards ensuring that we have a public service in which realistic and workable measures of performance allow us to monitor its activities and gauge its success in achieving the objectives set by Government.  We must recognise that the attendant programme of reform will extend beyond the lifetime of the present Dáil.  Experience in other countries has shown that successful and lasting reform of large and complex organisations takes many years to bring about.  Fiat and edict are not enough. Without ongoing political commitment, extending over several years, even the most detailed programme for change <Col N="1555" /> will gradually run out of steam and constitute little more than a cosmetic exercise. This is not what I want.  Lasting changes can only be realised by touching and transforming the cultural factors which underpin all human behaviour. We are talking about a major change of mind set.  Any cultural change is not easy to achieve, nor is it easy to measure.  For this reason I will seek to ensure that the SMI process includes careful consideration of the intangible, cultural factors which give all organisations, including Government Departments, their characteristic ethos and identity.  The SMI is not intended to impose an ideal structure from above but to facilitate a progressive process of change from within each Department and public body, having regard to the needs and opinions of all concerned.  I propose to work with staff interests in developing a better, more efficient, flexible and forward-looking public service for the consumer, one adapted to the needs of the next century, the next millennium.</P>
    <P>These are some of the issues and challenges which we must consider and address in bringing about meaningful reform of the public service.  I believe the prospects for reform are excellent. Many beneficial changes have been achieved in recent years.  For example, information technology is beginning to take root in the operations of practically all Departments and offices but more progress is needed there.  The Civil Service has adapted also to the system of three year administrative budgets.  The extension of the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General to include value-for-money audits is another significant step towards better management of resources.  The attitude to information as a resource has gained general acceptance and management as a science is now held in higher regard than ever before.  Most Departments have a healthy respect for organisational change and the need to review their operations on a regular basis.  Using the SMI, I intend to build on this promising <Col N="1556" /> base to produce a programme of reform which enjoys widespread acceptance both within the public service and from the public at large for whom the services are provided.</P>
    <P>I have set out here what, by any standards, is a very formidable remit for any Minister of State.  I have indicated the scale of the task and outlined its complexity. It is with great facility that I can totally support the decision of the Taoiseach to assign such a significant task to a Minister of State primarily dedicated to its achievement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to comment on the change in Fine Gael policy. On the last two occasions the number of Ministers of State was expanded, Fine Gael complained bitterly that the Minister for Finance and the Public Service &mdash; not the Taoiseach &mdash; introduced the Bill.  They felt that on an issue of such fundamental importance it should be the Taoiseach.  As reported at column 130 of the Official Report of 2 November 1977, volume 301, Deputy Barry stated:</P>
      <P>I know that technically the Bill is under the control of the Minister for the Public Service.  But that would not dispense the Government from the courtesy to the House and the country of the Taoiseach introducing the Bill in the House and explaining to us exactly why it is necessary at this point to extend the officeholders to ten....</P>
      <P>Deputy Garret FitzGerald made the same point as Deputy Barry in 1990. Referring to the extension of the number of Ministers at that stage he said it did the House, the Government, democracy or politics no good to extend the number in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If ever there was a case for a Taoiseach to come into the House and explain what is happening, this is it.  I have no difficulty with the tasks assigned to the two Ministers.  I wish Deputy Doyle well in her post but I doubt if it is possible for any human to carry out all the tasks assigned to her in <Col N="1557" /> the remit she read out and, indeed, in the one read by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish her well with those tasks.  The Minister for Finance stated that the west has been beset by a self-perpetuating economic malaise.  He stated:</P>
      <P>With the declining population, services have been reduced and economic activity has declined, leading in turn to further depopulation.  This population haemorrhage must be stopped.  Our hope and expectation is that the population of the west will have stabilised by the end of the decade.</P>
      <P>He then read Deputy Carey's remit which is right and appropriate and with which we all agree.  Why has the Minister of State with responsibility for the West been appointed only because he was not appointed to the post of Leas-Cheann Comhairle?  That appointment creates a major credibility problem for the Government since the Taoiseach had announced he intended appointing Deputy Carey as Leas-Cheann Comhairle, which appointment did not succeed for reasons already outlined in the House.  The Taoiseach decided, as an afterthought, that he would appoint a Minister of State with responsibility for the West.  While we fully approve of that appointment in fairness to the people of the West, it should be made clear that, had the Taoiseach succeeded in appointing Deputy Carey as Leas-Cheann Comhairle, there would not have been a Minister with responsibility for the West.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>We would not have had another Minister with responsibility for the West.  While speaking about the West, perhaps that portfolio should include the whole of Connacht-Ulster <Col N="1558" /> and examine the number of Ministers and Ministers of State representing those eight counties.  There is one Fine Gael Minister, Deputy Enda Kenny, Minister for Tourism and Trade and there is a Labour Minister in Galway city, very far removed from Border areas.  If one examines what the Minister for Finance had to say about the West, one could just as easily use the same arguments about the Border counties and region generally.  Not only is that recognised by everybody here, with the apparent exception of the Government, it is recognised by the European Union which has provided special funding for internal frontiers in member states.  Of course, Border counties have benefited from INTERREG I and will again under INTERREG II.  Indeed if one takes account of the problems on this side of the Border resulting from the troubles in the northern part of the island over the past 25 years, one realises there is a special case for at least having a Minister or Minister of State located in one of the Border counties. Yet the counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth have been totally ignored by this Government. Perhaps in many ways that is not surprising because, in the last Coalition Government led by Deputy Dr. Fitzgerald, the Border counties were ignored except in so far as under his leadership, as Taoiseach and that of his Minister for Finance, the new Taoiseach, the economy of the Border counties was almost wrecked, at which time people crossed in their hundreds and thousands to the North to buy goods. Only when former Deputy Ray MacSharry became Minister for Finance was that problem corrected.</P>
      <P>In dealing with what the Minister for Finance had to say about the appointment of Deputy Avril Doyle as Minister of State, among whose tasks will be the development of the strategic management initiative, I pay tribute to our public service.  We are particularly fortunate in having public servants of the calibre we do in every Department.  They serve our people extremely well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1559" /> The Minister for Finance said:</P>
    <P>The primary objective of the SMI is to put in place, in each Department and public service agency, a management process that is focused on ensuring continuous improvements in the performance of the civil and wider public service in relation to the contribution that they can make to national development; the provision of services to the public and the efficient and effective use of resources.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind what will constitute a small portion only of the duties of Deputy Avril Doyle as Minister of State, it would appear that she has an almost impossible task.  Why has she been appointed to three Departments only, seeing that the Minister for Finance said her duties would extend into every Department?  They might as well have appointed her Minister of State at every Department because a number of Ministers of State in this Government have already been assigned to a whole range of Departments.  What sort of service will be provided for them?  What sort of service will be provided for the Minister of State with responsibility for child care, Deputy Currie?  Will he have an office assigned to him in three Departments?  Will he have back-up staff in each of those Departments?  We are entitled to know, particularly in terms of the openness and transparency about which we hear so much.</P>
    <P>What will be the relationship of Deputy Avril Doyle as Minister of State with the relevant Ministers since the tasks assigned her are properly those of the Ministers in charge of the relevant Departments?  From the point of view of the rainbow Coalition, I suppose there is certain merit in having the Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, and Deputy Doyle as Minister of State located in the Department of Finance to keep an eye on the Minister for Finance on behalf of Fine Gael.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance went on to say:</P>
      <P>Another important area of reform in which I expect Deputy Doyle will play a major role is in ensuring that the interests of the consumer are paramount in all dealings with the public services including State companies.</P>
      <P>While we will agree with that sentiment why should it be necessary to augment the number of Ministers of State by two?  In the interests of consumers, surely we should ensure they get value for money, that we do not expend money on Ministers of State since we already had 15 to any one of whom these tasks could have been assigned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying they should be shared out; I am saying that one of the 15 already appointed could have been assigned those tasks.  In terms of value for money, in the interests of consumers, at a conservative estimate the cost of the two additional Ministers of State will be at least £250,000 each. Of course, the Ministers of State will not receive that but, when one includes the cost of providing them with offices, back-up staff, secretarial staff, perhaps providing advisers from outside, programme managers, cars and drivers, that £250,000 each is a conservative estimate. My former esteemed colleague from my constituency and member of the Fine Gael party, Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick on <Col N="1561" /> the last occasion it was proposed to extend the number of Ministers objected and suggested what the relevant £100,000 would do for the local improvement scheme nationwide.</P>

      <P>The reform of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 is important.  Indeed I should have thought that augmenting the number of Ministers of State would have been addressed in that context, at which stage the Taoiseach might have made a case for it.</P>
      <P>On the specific tasks assigned to Deputy Doyle as Minister of State, one interesting comment she made was about the commitment of the Government to the introduction of a Bill on Freedom of Information and she said how central she regarded that reform to the public service.  Today the Taoiseach provided the House with a list of legislation to be introduced in the House between now and July next.  That Bill we had all expected would be included, was not, apparently it was not regarded as top priority by the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the matter of protecting consumers' interests, examining State Departments and the Strategic Management Initiative, perhaps at this juncture in our history, all Departments and agencies of the State should ascertain how they can help to create jobs, the <Col N="1562" /> major economic and social issue we must address.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle, in her capacity as a Minister of State, can play a role in that regard.  For example, the inordinate delay in the processing of planning applications by local authorities is totally unacceptable.  If they were processed with greater speed, that would be an opportunity for job creation. Another area that could be addressed is the disabled person's reconstruction grant.  The number of officials involved in the processing of such a grant should be reduced to ensure value for money and that the process is speeded up in the interests of the public, whom we all want to serve.  Every Department of State should consider how it can play a role in that regard.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Health I discussed that matter many times with Department officials.  Irish healthcare personnel are recognised around the world as being among the best available. For example, Irish nurses, regardless of the competition, can get jobs anywhere in the world.  There are great opportunities for Departments, such as the Department of Health, to sell services abroad such as those provided by the Blood Transfusion Service Board and the National Drugs Advisory Board. The Gulf countries and China have been calling for quality control in the drugs they purchase and there are great opportunities in that area.  Provisions should be included in new legislation to ensure that we get the maximum benefit from the high standing of our healthcare personnel around the world, thus improving our economy and creating jobs.</P>
    <P>On the multiplicity of advisers and programme managers, in 1993 the present Minister for Health referred to how unethical it was to have so many advisers and to use State resources to pay programme managers.  Having regard to the views expressed by some members of this Government in the past, it is interesting to note the many advisers and programme managers being appointed.  Whatever about the <Col N="1563" /> need for programme managers.  I believe they should be recruited from the public service.  It is wrong to appoint party political activists as programme managers.  I am glad that the Fianna Fáil party in the last Government, appointed, with one exception, civil servants as programme managers.  That is the way it should be as civil servants have the experience, have come up through the service and have total allegiance to successive Governments. That is one of the great features of our public service.  It should be mandatory that programme managers be recruited from the public service and that they not be party political activists.</P>

      <P>I would like to confine my remarks to the topic we are discussing. I am somewhat confused about the manner in which the Opposition has approached this debate.  I was confused by Deputy McDowell.  He appeared to congratulate the proposed Ministers, he wished them well, assured them they had plenty of work and said they were well fit to do it.  I thought he found it hard to make up his mind whether the appointments were good or bad and I though he was 50:50 in the end.  He wished them success in their onerous task.  Once he put that on the record I was happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon appeared to be 60:40 against the proposed ministerial appointments.  He favoured the appointment of many Deputies from the west to ministerial posts.  We have appointed a Minister with responsibility for the west and I hope he is happy about that; he appeared to indicate he was.  He acknowledged also the capabilities and <Col N="1564" /> qualifications of the Deputies proposed, Deputies Carey and Doyle.</P>
    <P>This Debate is about the appointment of the two Ministers of State to the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, Transport, Energy and Communications and Arts.  Culture and the Gaeltacht with special responsibility for co-ordinating the Government's commitment to western development and rural renewal.</P>
    <P>I am sure all Members will agree that, particularly in recent years, the duties and responsibilities of Ministers and Ministers of State have become very demanding.  It will be agreed also that ministerial responsibilities which were combined in one ministerial post a few years ago are now being subdivided.  For example, a few years ago there was one Minister responsible for Health and Social Welfare, now two Ministers are responsible for those busy Departments. Many other examples could be given of the increased workload of Ministers, whose responsibilities have made it necessary for their ministerial positions to be subdivided.  Nobody in this House, nor I am sure outside it, will disagree that Ministers and Ministers of State do carry a very heavy responsibility and workload.</P>

This is the first time I have been a Member my party has been in Government.  I am delighted about that and the developments that brought my party into Government.  I am delighted at the experience of being a parliamentary party member when my party in Government.  That has greatly changed my workload as a politician.  I give this as an example to indicate the workload of a Minister or Minister of State.  This change has increased my workload fourfold and improved my insight into Government.  It has increased the workload and pressure on the new Ministers and Ministers of State, and has opened avenues for me to advance the needs of the constituents I represent.  It has strengthened my desire to bring about changes that will benefit the public.  It will mean I will have greater access to Ministers and Ministers of State in my attempts to make this country a better place for future generations.  If that is the extent of change for a backbencher one can imagine the change in the workload of a Minister or Minister of State and what he or she can achieve.</P>
      <P>I will outline examples of the experiences of Ministers of State in former Governments.</P>
      <P>Deputies Harney and Michael McDowell were critical of the proposed appointments.  Deputy Harney was a Minister of State in the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government of 1989-92, I do not know the considerations that resulted in her achieving that important position, but because of her vision and drive she was able to deliver as a Minister.  Despite the perceived lack of co-operation from her senior Minister at that time, Padraig Flynn, she succeeded in making this country, or at least Dublin, a better and cleaner place in which to live.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I note from the Minister's amendment that she, apparently, welcomes the Government's decision to publish the advisory committee's report on third level student support.  I am disturbed that she decided to circulate this <Col N="1567" /> report to the media prior to circulating it to Members of the House.  It shows a fundamental disregard for the Members of the House, in particular the three Members who put down the motion.  It is shabby behaviour, sharp practice and a grave discourtesy to the House.</P>
      <P>I propose the motion in the hope that this debate can mark the beginning of more open, comprehensive and informed debate on the question of third level fees and grants.  In the interests of social justice and equity, Fianna Fáil has always been committed to widening access for all students to third level education.  We acknowledge that putting this principle into action will require a substantial reform package. There are still too many barriers in the way of participation.  Financial considerations still prevent many of our people attending third level education. We believe that no student should be deprived of access to third level education because of his or her financial circumstances.</P>
      <P>In putting down the motion we are motivated by a desire to bring far greater equity into the third level grants system in the context of the forthcoming budget.  The Government should increase substantially the level of the maintenance grant and the means test thresholds so that students currently attending third level institutions benefit immediately.  For a number of years we have had a sporadic debate on the issue of eliminating third level fees.  Such a debate, however, has not been accompanied by any meaningful improvement in the present position, particularly for students currently attending third level.  Our motion aims to bring about such an immediate improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present third level grants system is inequitable and discriminates in an appalling manner against the PAYE sector.  Many Deputies have been inundated with calls and complaints from PAYE workers who have received no financial support because of the harsh and arbitrary nature of the present <Col N="1568" /> schemes.  The income limits in this scheme are simply too low.  Larger families, in particular, suffer.  In addition, the scheme is too rigid and people marginally over the income limits suffer unduly as a result.  No marginal relief provision exists and study after study confirms that other sectors of the economy benefit far more proportionately than the PAYE sector.  This needs to be redressed urgently and our motion aims to do that.</P>
    <P>For families who do not live close to a university the real cost involves the maintenance of the student.  The present level of the maintenance grant bears no relation to the cost of maintaining a student away from home at college.  The USI estimated the average cost of putting a student through college in 1993-94 at £5,500.  Those calculations are modest and very realistic.  In addition, it is worth nothing that while average fees between 1983 and 1993 increased by 172 per cent, the maintenance grant for the same period decreased in real terms by 20 per cent.  Consequently, many students have to work part-time to finance themselves and this has a negative impact on their studies.  The average maintenance grant is approximately £1,486 which, divided by the average 36 week academic year, works out at roughly £40 per week which might not even pay the rent for a student living in rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>In the words of Barry Kehoe, director of student services in Dublin City University, the Government should establish the cost for a student going to college, note from where it will come and how the gap will be made up.  Having spoken to many of my colleagues in the House, particularly those from rural constituencies, it is clear that the level of maintenance grant is a critical issue and needs to be substantially increased.</P>
    <P>In proposing the motion I am conscious that the Minister will make other significant demands on the resources at her disposal.  I also put forward this motion in the context of the ongoing <Col N="1569" /> debate about the Minister's announcement last July that she intends to abolish third level fees over a specific time-frame. At that time I welcomed the announcement.  Coming from an urban constituency I was particularly concerned at the level of discrimination within the existing scheme against the PAYE sector given the low income limits and felt that by abolishing fees one would eliminate the inequity once and for all.  However, one cannot consider the fees issue in isolation.  We must take on board other demands on scarce resources within the education system and we must question whether we have the necessary resources to achieve the ideal of abolishing third level fees.  I said last week that I wanted action sooner rather than later.  Our motion will improve immediately and significantly the lot of students currently attending third level.  Judging from the hints so far the Minister's proposals may take a number of years to be fully implemented, with students currently going through the system not benefiting.</P>
    <P>It is important that we have a more open and informed debate on this matter. In essence, all cards must be put on the table.  In tandem with the Minister's announcement we had selective leaks about the de Buitléir report on the system of State grants for third level courses.  Such selective and obviously authorised leaks of an allegedly confidential report must be deplored.  They show a complete disregard for this House and indeed its Members who should have access to such reports as soon as they are completed.  Indeed, such leaking of information seems to be part and parcel of the Minister's <i>modus operandi</i>.  I call on the Minister to give a clear commitment to this House that in future all such reports are published upon completion, to facilitate open and informed debate and that Members receive a copy of them in advance of the media, unlike what happened this evening.</P>
    <P>In relation to the abolition of third level fees, it is time for the Minister to put the full facts before the people, to <Col N="1570" /> outline her proposals clearly and succinctly, and to clarify many questions which have remained unanswered.  Will maintenance grants be advanced to PLC students?  How much will the abolition of educational tax covenants raise, and over what time scale?  Existing covenants must obviously be allowed to run their full course and any changes can apply only to new covenants.  We have had various estimates in relation to the costing involved, some suggesting that the net cost could vary between £40 million and £50 million.  The proposal is to be primarily financed by the abolition of the covenants.  It is still unclear how much would actually be raised by the abolition of covenants.  Furthermore, as the economist Seán Barrett has pointed out, it does not follow that the abolition of covenants will yield immediate returns to the Exchequer.  Those deprived of tax convenanting for children could, and will in all probability, avail of other tax havens and shelters within the system.  We clearly need more information and deeper analysis. It is my understanding that the Revenue Commissioners are not able to say exactly how many covenants are strictly for educational purposes.  Obviously a significant proportion are, but we need to know the exact figures to assess the situation properly.</P>
    <P>The abolition of third level fees cannot be treated in isolation, but must be considered in the context of other demands for resources throughout the educational system.  Dr. Tom Mitchell, Provost of Trinity College and Chairman of the Conference of Irish University Heads, has argued cogently for extra funds to provide for the increasing demand for university places.  As he pointed out, dramatic progress has been made during the past 12 years.  Numbers attending university increased dramatically from about 27,000 in 1982 to 58,000 in 1994.  The numbers applying continue to rise.  In 1994 over 60,000 applied through the CAO, almost 38,000 of those sought entry to university. At present the universities can admit only 12,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1571" /> While recognising that many were subsequently accommodated in other third level institutions it must be acknowledged that demand for extra university places will continue to rise and must be provided for.  In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> Education and Living Supplement, on 13 September the Minister was dismissive of the case made by the universities.  As Dr. Mitchell pointed out, the Department of Education's own projections indicate that an additional 48,000 students will have to be accommodated in the third level system by the year 2005 and a high proportion of these will be seeking entry to university and capable of achieving a university degree.  Participation rates in all forms of third level education will continue to rise well into the next century.</P>
    <P>Decline in numbers leaving secondary school will be more than compensated for by increases in the numbers of mature students and in the ongoing need and demand for continuing education. Dr. Mitchell argues that the university sector cannot possibly cope with these numbers without large scale capital investment.  He estimates that during the high period of expansion in the 1980s, capital grants per additional student declined in real terms from £11,000 in 1982 to £1,950 in 1993.  Such expansion created 15,000 square metres of temporary accommodation which must be replaced.  Future expansion in places will inevitably lead to further capital expenditure and submissions to the Department involving £120 million on third level capital projects over the next six years have already been made.</P>
    <P>The regional technical colleges will also require significant capital funding over the next decade.  They already suffer gross overcrowding and lack of necessary facilities and equipment. Given the fact that the numbers participating at third level over the next decade will increase dramatically, surely the provision of extra and better resourced career guidance counsellors at second level is an imperative.  Career guidance will be a very important instrument in <Col N="1572" /> ensuring that students make the right choices and attend courses that suit their aptitude and orientation.</P>
    <P>In the debate so far, little serious consideration has been given to the case of the thousands of post leaving certificate students throughout the country.  A revolution has taken place over recent years in the creation of a new tier of education.  Credit must be given to the vocational education committees whose inherent flexibility allowed the development of the PLC colleges and courses with innovation, local curriculum and market orientation being their hallmark. Such a development was recognised by the expert working party on the VPT2 programme when its report to the NCVA in June 1992 stated that &ldquo;an unofficial further education sector has in effect developed&rdquo;.  It is absurd that the Department still effectively considers such colleges to be post primary schools.</P>
    <P>As pointed out by Liam McAllister of Dún Laoghaire vocational education committee, students attending PLC colleges do not receive maintenance grants while students attending other institutions leading to similar qualification, receive these grants.  Such discrimination will have to be eliminated.  Post leaving certificate students should be provided with maintenance grants, and a start should be made in the forthcoming budget in this regard.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that the abolition of third level fees will change the profile of those attending college and accelerate the participation of the less well off in third level education.  We must be brutally honest with ourselves in this regard.  The abolition of fees will have only a modest impact in the short term on increasing participation from low income families in third level.  The participation of lower income families in third level education is far too low and special, targeted measures must be introduced to deal with this issue.  Families in the lowest income groups do not benefit from the current third level grants system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1573" /> Fundamentally, we can only increase the numbers entering third level from the lower income groups and disadvantaged if we invest far more than we have up to now in the pre-school and primary sectors.  Pre-schooling is perhaps the most effective way of ensuring the proper educational and personal development of children from disadvantaged backgrounds and ultimately enabling them to enter third level education and achieve academic success.</P>
    <P>Despite the very comprehensive recommendations from the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women regarding pre-schooling and child care in general, the response of the Minister and the Department has been very slow and ineffective.  In the same interview with <i>The Irish Times</i> the Minister, while acknowledging that the pilot pre-school scheme &ldquo;has been slow in getting off the ground&rdquo;, put forward the excuse that &ldquo;we need more research, parent and community involvement and training for teachers&rdquo; and that we should &ldquo;make haste slowly&rdquo;.  The Minister conveniently ignores the fact that we already have plenty of recognised, qualified Montessori pre-school teachers in this country who have been effectively debarred from participating in the `Early Start Programme', whose expertise she refuses to draw upon and whose association, the AMI, she refuses even to meet.  Effectively what we are getting here is a token response to the needs of a sector which, if properly resourced, could have a far reaching impact on educational and social inequality.  Investment in primary education is also essential to deal with disadvantage at an early age.  The home-school liaison programme requires further expansion.  We need more remedial teachers and extra teachers in disadvantaged areas.  Above all, a continued reduction in the PTR is desirable and seems to have been put on the back burner by the Minister.</P>
    <P>If we really want to increase the level of participation at third level from those in the lower income groups and the disadvantaged we have to do so through <Col N="1574" /> the pre-school and primary sectors.  This cannot be done by any quick fix method of simply abolishing third level fees straight away and hoping for a miracle response.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also aware of an ongoing campaign to extend the existing third level grant system to Irish students studying in Britain or other EU countries. In 1991-92 5,554 Irish undergraduates and postgraduates were studying overseas.  These students receive no funding from this State in the pursuit of their studies.  In the Dail last year the Minister rejected demands for the extension of the scheme for these students on the grounds that it would prove very expensive arguing that she did not have the resources.</P>
    <P>Postgraduates in our third level colleges are very angry at the reduction in their resources and the complete under-provision for their research.  Such a potentially valuable sector to the economy has been virtually ignored in the debate so far.  The report on the National Convention, and particularly the section dealing with resourcing the changes we can expect in the aftermath of the White Paper and in anticipation of some of the recommendations of the Green Paper, emphasise the need to target resources to the disadvantaged and to special areas.  That section of the report does not appear to have been taken on board in the context of the debate on third level fees.</P>
    <P>I have focused specifically on the following areas: the need for extra places and facilities to be provided at third level; the need to fund PLC students; the urgent need to invest significantly in pre-school and primary education; the need for adequately resourced career guidance counselling at second level; the plight of our students studying abroad and the lack of funding for postgraduate research to illustrate the need for a comprehensive and integrated package of reforms to be brought forward, rather than simply concentrating on the abolition of third level fees alone. By highlighting these issues I am underlying the need for a more profound and <Col N="1575" /> inclusive debate on this subject than we have had up to now.  Proper analysis of the costings must be initiated, consultation with the various interests involved must take place, and we in Fianna Fáil are prepared to play a constructive and a helpful role in that debate and in that process.</P>
    <P>To assist and inform that debate, it was our view that it was necessary that the de Buitléir report on the Irish system of third level State grants be published. I welcome the fact that the Minister has taken that decision as a result of this motion.</P>

      <P>I regret that, unfortunately, the Minister did not make it available to Members prior to circulating it to the media.  That is very shabby behaviour.</P>
      <P>My understanding is that the report's analysis of the inequities of the present grant system is sound and highlights the degree to which there is discrimination against the PAYE sector.  According to various leaks and statements it proposes the creation of one unified student support scheme to replace the existing three.  As announced already, it proposes the transfer of the administration of the means test from local authorities and vocational education committees to the Revenue Commissioners.  Perhaps the most controversial proposal leaked involves the introduction of a capital test in addition to the existing income test to qualify for a third level grant. Many newspaper headlines last July signalled an &ldquo;Education grant clamp on farmers and the self-employed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such proposals need to be discussed in the public arena.  The interests involved have a right to make submissions and to have an input into these proposals.  I am sure they would be anxious to examine this report and to respond to it.  This would be the democratic approach to take.  I have no desire to engage in a witch hunt for those who <Col N="1576" /> currently qualify for grants; rather I am specifically interested in broadening the scope of the existing schemes to embrace students and families from the PAYE sector who up to now have been excluded.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting also that the selective leaking of this report coincided with the Minister's announcement in July to abolish third level fees.  However it is my understanding that the report makes no reference to or recommendations on the abolition of third level fees.  Its entire thrust is aimed at streamlining the existing system, simplifying its administration and ensuring greater equity in the operation of the grants system for third level courses.  Those who can afford to pay shall receive a smaller grant and those not in a position to pay should receive a higher level of grant.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly therefore, before any fundamental decisions are made this report should be considered in its entirety and should form the basis for an open, accountable and inclusive debate embracing all the interests involved.  In the first instance the report should be considered and debated in this House.  The expertise and experience of Members from all parties should be brought into play and their comments arising from constituents' views upon publication of the report should be taken on board.</P>
    <P>At the time of its formation this Government spoke much about the need to involve this House and about having respect for the dignity of the House, but the manner in which this report has been circulated to the media in advance does not augur well for the intentions and aspirations of the Government, and this is a matter we intend to take up with the Taoiseach. This report is of such fundamental importance that in the first instance it should be debated by this House.</P>
    <P>Having spoken to many people involved in education and reflected on the position, it is my view that the total abolition of third level fees cannot take place in the immediate short term without resulting in serious lack of provision <Col N="1577" /> for the other sectors of education outlined in my speech, particularly the pre-school and primary sectors where properly resourced early intervention can be most effective in eliminating disadvantage and inequality.  My motivation all along in regard to third level fees and grants issue has been to end the discrimination against the PAYE sector. Our motion would make an immediate difference to many students from families on PAYE attending third level education. In addition, if adopted by the Government, it would mean a substantial increase in the level of maintenance grant, bringing it up to a more realistic rate.  Our motion is socially progressive and represents an equitable use of existing resources, and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">

      <P>Is cúis áthais dom a bheith páirteach sa díospóireacht seo faoi chúrsaí oideachais sa tríú leibhéal, rud atá an-tábhachtach ní amháin domsa ach do gach aon duine sa Teach seo.</P>
      <P>Education is an important and very emotive issue as is demonstrated by the media attenton it has been getting in recent weeks.  I agree to a large extent with much of what academia have had to say on the issue of fees and maintenance grants.  The loss to third level colleges of in excess of £50 million in revenue must cause some degree of consternation in campuses around the country.  In last Sunday's <i>Sunday Tribune</i> the provost of Trinity College, which is regarded as an establishment of some standing stated: &ldquo;abolishing fees will not create one additional place, abolishing fees will not help one person from low income backgrounds to get to University because they are already exempt from fees&rdquo;.  Comments such as this must be regarded as helpful and constructive criticism.  I sincerely hope the Minister will take on board these concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is much more important in the context of this debate that the sum of £50 million for fees which the Minister proposes to abolish would be better spent <Col N="1578" /> supplementing a capital investment programme in all third level institutions in order to create additional places.  I recently visited UCD where a new library was provided, but unfortunately if students are not there by 9 a.m. there is no place to study.  It is imperative that we deal with overcrowding and the absolute necessity for additional places.</P>
    <P>In this House we indulge in pious platitudes, in encouraging young people to attend third level institutions, but there are not enough places and as a consequence there is a rat race to attain higher points every year.  The social and psychological effect of this pressure on young people is frightening.  It is true that only a small percentage of lower socio-economic groups attend third level but the reason is not that they have to pay college fees because they are exempt from such fees.  The money would be better spent addressing problems from pre-school stage onwards as many students do not even complete second level education and other leave after primary education.  The immediate problem is to cater for the children of the PAYE worker.  It is the parents of these children who come to me in my constituency office in Donegal &mdash; I am sure the same applies throughout the country.  These parents motivate their children to work towards a third level qualification but despite the sacrifices they are prepared to make for their children, they find themselves under severe financial strain.</P>
    <P>Issues such as the means test threshold and the improvement in maintenance grants are contentious and require input from all concerned.  As regards maintenance grants in particular, the supercilious notion that by definition a maintenance grant of £1,486 per year would, in 1995, maintain a student living away from home is ridiculous if not insulting.  A student, even in a rural setting, will allocate about £20 per week for rent, £20 for food, fuel and electricity and at least £10 for travel.  This leaves nothing for books, equipment and personal maintenance, In general most, if not all students rely on the <Col N="1579" /> goodwill of parents, brothers and sisters to supplement their grants in order to survive.</P>
    <P>It is not very long since I left university and I know many people who had to take on second jobs and part time jobs, if they were lucky to get them, because they found themselves under severe financial stress and strain.  Many students rely on people at home for financial support, but sadly families do not always have the additional income necessary.  An increase in the basic maintenance grant would go some way towards alleviating the hardship endured by parents and families who send their children to college.</P>
    <P>Another major grievance often voiced in this House is that those currently in receipt of grant aid must constantly endure long delays.  It is often Christmas before the first instalment of the grant is paid and, in the meantime, students have to rely on their families or take out a very expensive bridging loan to tide them over.</P>
    <P>The reflex action by the Minister to improve the services for students was to establish a central agency to process applications and payments.  This is a very fine and laudable idea for those students who live beside the agency but what happens to someone living in Glencolumbkille, for example, one of the remotest parts of the country, who needs help with their application?  The proposals to streamline the service look very efficient on paper but they are highly impractical.  The establishment of one locally based agency would be preferable as it would allow for easy access and ensure sensitivity in any dealings with the students and parents in each county or region.</P>
    <P>Many students who cannot obtain a place on a suitable course in the Republic travel to Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  At present approximately 8,000 student cannot be accommodated here.  Grant aid is available for some of the students who travel to Northern Ireland but all the students who travel to the United Kingdom are denied grant <Col N="1580" /> assistance.  This is totally unfair.  We should be prepared to maintain those students who travel to the United Kingdom until such time as we can accommodate all our students.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's position on this issue is very clear and my colleague, Deputy Martin, has done much to assist the Minister in this regard.  I hope the Minister will consider his advice.  As even her Labour colleagues will appreciate, the Minister is in a very difficult position. On the one hand there are those who would advise her to adopt a very cautious approach in giving away £50 million while, on the other hand, there are those who cannot wait to get rid of this money.  In order to achieve the best for all concerned &mdash; in essence, that means our youth &mdash; there must be a fully informed public debate on this issue as soon as possible.  Such a debate is essential if decisions affecting so many are to be taken.</P>
    <P>At present approximately 90,000 students attend third level colleges or institutions of one kind or another and 45,000 of these rely on grants to get through college.  Playing politics with parents and children, which I believe the Labour Party is doing by proposing the abolition of fees alone, begs the question: does the right hand of this Coalition Government know exactly what the left hand is doing?  Education is much too serious an issue to be pulling it in three directions.  If the Minister is serious, as we in Fianna Fáil are, about the provision of wider and fairer access to third level education, the need for essential reform and the allocation of greater resources to achieve this, an open and frank debate on third level education is imperative.  It is a pity that it has taken this motion to have the de Buitléir report made available&mdash;&mdash;</P>

People are asking us if they have to pay fees and whether they will get maintenance grants &mdash; they need to know now.  It is almost too late at this stage for those who are attending third level institutions.

      <P>The Minister must consider all the options so that she does not make a decision which is any way regressive for our education system.  We have an excellent education system, but it can be improved.  If we are serious about ensuring that everyone is given an opportunity to attend third level education there must be an immediate debate on this issue.  This should not be a political debate; rather it should deal with all aspects of education.  This is a serious issue and young people should not be held to ransom for political gain.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;endorses the Government's commitment to support mechanisms to increase participation by third level students from low income backgrounds, including the abolition of third level fees, to comprehensive reform of the higher education grants scheme, the introduction of support for students on post-leaving certificate courses, an increase in the number of third level places, and welcomes the decision by the Government to publish the Report of <Col N="1583" /> the Advisory Committee on Third Level Student Support.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The effect of increased participation on a national level is shown in surveys commissioned from time to time by the Higher Education Authority.  A survey in 1980 revealed that 20 per cent of the 17-19 age cohort in the country went on to third level education.  This had increased to 25 per cent by 1986 and the figure for 1992 is estimated to be approximately 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>The numbers of students who go on to third level education are directly related to the numbers of students who complete their second level education and sit the leaving certificate examination. At present, approximately 52 per cent of students who sit the leaving certificate progress to third level which is a reasonable transfer rate by international standards.</P>
    <P>Direct Exchequer support for students has also grown in importance. During the 1981-82 academic year 14,000 students received grant aid equivalent to 32 per cent of the total enrolment of 44,000.  By 1993-94, this had grown to 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>In 1993, the total support for fees and maintenance by the Exchequer was in the order of £85 million.  Total public expenditure on education in 1993 amounted to £1.8 billion representing approximately 19 per cent of Government expenditure compared with 1965 when the corresponding proportion was 13.2 per cent.</P>
    <P>There are three student grant schemes &mdash; the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committee scholarship scheme and the European Social Fund training grant scheme.  Under these schemes nearly 53,000 students received grant aid in the 1993-94 academic year.</P>
    <P>Since I became Minister for Education I have continued and intensified the process of increasing participation in third level.  In 1993 I continued the process of improving and reforming the third level student support system: <Col N="1584" /> income limits were increased by 3.4 per cent in line with the average increase in industrial wages; the maximum tuition fee grant limit for courses covered under the higher education grants scheme and vocational education committee scholarships scheme was increased by 10 per cent to £2,200 for the 1993-94 academic year.  This ensured that the fees for a number of courses which were not fully covered in 1992 were, in fact, fully covered under the 1993 schemes; the awarding bodies were given discretion, for the first time, in 1993 to renew grants and scholarships for repeat years, in exceptional circumstances, in cases of certified serious illness. This was in direct response to a need which I identified as causing serious distress and financial difficulties for some students; in previous years schemes students who had obtained a national certificate or national diploma were required to have obtained one year or two year exemptions respectively when progressing on to a degree course in a university or other third level institution before grant aid would be payable.  Unfortunately many such students did not receive the necessary exemptions and were required to fund one or two years of the degree course from their own resources.  The 1993 schemes were modified and improved so that students progressing from ESF aided courses were no longer required to have obtained exemptions and were deemed eligible for grant assistance from whatever year they commenced their degree course provided they were otherwise eligible in accordance with the terms of the scheme.</P>
    <P>In the general administration of the schemes I have taken the following initiatives: a thorough review of all the relevant scheme documentation has been carried out; the schemes were redrafted and simplified and the application forms and explanatory notes were redesigned and standardised. Complaints in relation to the difficult nature of the text of previous years' schemes awere taken on board; and the 1993 application form was redesigned &mdash;<Col N="1585" /> a single, fully completed application form from a candidate was used for all three schemes.</P>
    <P>As I previously stated in this House, the need for simpler and more efficient organisational arrangements for the delivery of student support has been a constant theme in representations, and I am well aware of the difficulties and the frustration being experienced by students and parents.</P>
    <P>In 1994, I implemented further improvements in the student support schemes on the basis of recommendations made in the report of the advisory committee which I had established. These improvements included the following: up to 1994, students were required to have obtained a minimum of two grade Cs in the higher level papers in the leaving certificate in order to satisfy the academic requirements of the scheme.  With effect from 1994, the academic requirements of the scheme were deemed to be met by students who secured a college place; I introduced new rules for second chance cases.  This is to ensure that students who did not complete studies at a particular level will be eligible to apply for grants to study again at the same level after an interval of five years; I provided a discretionary budget in 1994 to set up a hardship fund with the third level institutions and I ensured the earlier issue of the student support schemes to the local authorities/VECs at the end of April 1994.  In 1993, the schemes issued in mid-August.</P>
    <P>I also propose to implement the following further improvements: the processing of grant applications and payments by a central office associated with the CAO; transfer of the means test function to the Revenue Commissioners and transfer of the appeals function from the Minister for Education to the Appeal Commissioners appointed under tax law.  These measures will improve the service to students.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the issue of access.  I am firmly committed to free access to education at first, second and third level.  I am actively working on <Col N="1586" /> detailed proposals to improve access to third level at present.  I hope in this way to help many people on modest incomes who are outside the income eligibility limits for higher education grants and who are experiencing growing financial hardship in providing a third level education for their children.</P>
    <P>We have to see the abolition of third level fees as part of the overall funding of higher education.  At present the Government pays almost £300 million to third level colleges through a block grant.  In addition, more than half of all students already obtain fee grants.  Thus, the Government provides three-quarters of all university funding and more than 90 per cent of funding of regional colleges.  Most courses in the regional colleges are funded by the European Social Fund and no fees are charged on those courses.</P>
    <P>Most of the costs of ensuring access to third level education are borne by the Exchequer.  However the present system is confusing and complex and arguably leads to serious distortions, inefficiencies and inequities.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer subvention to the current costs of third level education can be broken down between the block grants to the universities, to the Dublin Institute of Technology, the regional technical colleges and the other third level colleges &mdash; £291 million in 1994 &mdash; grants for undergraduate and postgraduate fees &mdash; £51 million in 1994 &mdash; and income tax covenant relief &mdash; £25 million in revenue foregone for the education sector in the 1994-95 tax year.</P>
    <P>When we look at the total picture which I have just spelt out, we can see that abolishing undergraduate tuition fees would not incur a significant new cost for the Exchequer.  The Exchequer is already meeting the brunt of the costs of participation at third level but in an inefficient, inequitable and regressive way.</P>
    <P>Although more than half of all students get fee grants, there is a real problem of lack of public confidence in the higher education grant schemes. <Col N="1587" /> This stems from a perception that certain groups, particularly PAYE taxpayers, fare worse in the means testing than the non-PAYE sector.  Every Deputy can cite specific examples of where there seem to be serious inequities in the schemes.</P>
    <P>The weakness of the grant schemes may explain why students from disadvantaged backgrounds have been shown to be more likely to take European funded courses than courses where fees are payable &mdash; even though they would be eligible to receive fee grants.  The commitment in the Government of Renewal Policy Agreement to free third level education means that we are pledged to introduce a fairer system of third level funding for all students.</P>
    <P>Reinforcing my commitment to the abolition of fees at undergraduate level are data emerging from work carried out for the Steering Committee on the Future Development of the Higher Education Sector which indicates that in the period 1986-92 participation rates for lower professional and salaried employees declined despite the fact that overall participation rates were increasing. This group includes teachers, nurses, social workers and clerical/executive civil servants.  This research also indicates that 77 per cent of all new entrants to third level in 1992 from a farming background received means tested student support.  Furthermore, the research also shows that 42 per cent of entrants from families with over 200 acres and 65 per cent from families with between 100-199 acres received such support.  This compares with a corresponding percentage of 70 per cent - 80 per cent for the manual worker socio-economic group, 43 per cent for salaried employees and 30 per cent for lower professionals.</P>
    <P>There will be approximately 17,500 places provided on post-leaving certificate &mdash; PLC &mdash; courses in 1994-95.  The courses provided range from hairdressing, engineering, secretarial, business studies to pre-nursing etc.</P>
    <P>Registration and examination fees &mdash;<Col N="1588" /> which vary according to the course and vocational education committee &mdash; are payable by participants.  Total abolition of these fees would cost approximately £2 million annually to the Exchequer. With the abolition of third level undergraduate fees retention of PLC fees would create an anomaly in the Irish education system.  There would be no fees at primary, second and third level yet fees would be payable for PLC courses.  It would also further disadvantage those participants from the lower socio-economic groups.  Finally, the abolition of fees for PLC courses is essential to relieve the pressure on places in the universities and other third level institutions.</P>
    <P>A good deal of concern has been expressed in this debate, both inside and outside the House, about the level of maintenance grants.  It has also been suggested that instead of abolishing tuition fees the interests of students, particularly the students from disadvantaged backgrounds, would be much better served by increasing the value of maintenance grants and raising income eligibility thresholds.  These suggestions seem very reasonable and, indeed, I have looked at them carefully in the course of formulating my policy on tuition fees.  Unfortunately, however, this strategy would not solve the fundamental problem in the system which is the inequity of the present grants system and the fact that as a result many students cannot afford to go to university.</P>
    <P>I can explain why.  If we were to spend £25 million extra on the grants schemes this would enable me to raise the income eligibility thresholds for minimum grant assistance to £25,200 from the present level of £20,700.  This would certainly help an additional number of students but it would leave me having to address other problems.  Where would I get the additional money?  The data on participation rates illustrate one of the problems.  As I have already indicated recent research data produced for the higher education needs study have shown that the participation rate of <Col N="1589" /> students from the middle income group is declining.</P>
    <P>I share much of the concern about the level of the maintenance grants.  I agree that there is a very strong case for improving the support mechanisms so as to increase participation by third level students from low income backgrounds, including the abolition of third level fees, comprehensive reform of the higher education grants scheme and the introduction of support for students on post-leaving certificate courses.</P>
    <P>Access to third level education for pupils in disadvantaged areas is encouraged through the establishment of links between post-primary schools in disadvantaged areas and third level institutions. Such links which have been established to date involve Dublin City University, University of Limerick, Trinity College and Tallaght regional technical college with second level schools in disadvantaged areas.  The linkages incorporate supervised study facilities, extra tuition for pupils, information and advice for pupils and parents, including seminars, mentoring, support teaching in key subject areas, such as mathematics and science, parenting courses and visits to industries and businesses.</P>
    <P>A discretionary budget of £200,000 was introduced in 1994 out of which £120,000 was distributed to the third level institutions to assist students who were experiencing short term financial difficulties.  It was envisaged that these moneys would complement the existing third level student support.  The remaining £80,000 was set aside to assist physically challenged students.</P>
    <P>Ensuring greater participation by disadvantaged socio-economic groups in third level education is not primarily related to financial considerations.  An essential prerequisite to fuller participation in third level is ensuring retention of students in full-time education up to the age of 18.  To achieve this I have taken a range of initiatives.  These include targeting of resources on disadvantaged areas; the provision of educational support services for students, <Col N="1590" /> e.g. psychological and guidance services, career guidance, remedial teachers, etc; the continuing development of the home-school liaison service; a major restructuring of the senior cycle curricula to adapt them to the needs of the wider spread of ability levels and backgrounds proceeding to senior cycle; and the introduction of alternative pathways for students to progress to post-second level education and training.</P>
    <P>The importance for students of completion of second level education is emphasised in a finding of the recent ESRI report that the risk of poverty is about five times as high for someone with no qualifications as it is for someone with the leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the increase in student numbers which took place since the early 1980s.  However, even over the past four years there has been a dramatic increase from 68,000 in 1990-91 to 88,000 in 1993-94.  Over such a short period, therefore, an extra 20,000 students succeeded in securing places in third level institutions.  This was due mainly to a series of initiatives and strategies undertaken by my Department involving amalgamations of institutions, linkages between institutions and the undergraduate student expansion programme.</P>
    <P>This programme was the result of an agreement between my Department and the universities to the effect that the universities would take in a minimum of 1,200 extra students per annum over and above normal growth for a three to four year period.  It was also agreed that the Department would pay £1,000 per annum for each student under the programme and that the universities would retain the fee income.  Numbers have grown to such an extent that for the 1993-94 academic year there were approximately 7,500 students in the universities under the programme.</P>

      <P>We have seen that students from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to take courses where no fees are payable, even though they are eligible for fee grants.  We have seen that participation rates for lower professional and salaried employees have declined in recent years.  We have seen that the present system of funding of third level education is perceived as inefficient, inequitable and regressive. The Government of Renewal commitments will address these problems. Some students simply do no aspire to third level or further education.</P>
      <P>The pledge to abolish third level fees has enormous psychological significance for these students.  It shows that fees will no longer be a barrier to entry to higher education.  Just as free second level education opened the doors to many students, the abolition of third level and PLC fees will encourage these students to raise their aspirations.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that the Government of Renewal commitment will transform the landscape of higher education and enhance the life chances of all our young people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very carefully to what Deputies Martin and Coughlan had to say to see whether I could perceive a scamper to the right or a dart to the left and the best I can come up with is a sincere effort to mark time. While I agree with a great deal of what Deputy Martin says about students overseas, pre-school education, the <Col N="1592" /> need to target disadvantaged areas and so on.  I sense there is a reluctance to tackle the serious political choices that have to be made in the current circumstances, a reluctance, for example, to deal with the issue of covenants and the inequities that currently exist in the grants system.  Calling for further debate may do for the moment but sooner or later we have to make serious political choices and unfortunately in the education system as elsewhere, but particularly in the education system, we have seen far too many examples of debate being used as a way of obscuring, postponing or, for that matter, preventing decisions being taken.</P>
      <P>The ESRI report to which the Minister has referred confirmed what I think we already know, that education and the achievement of social justice are intrinsically linked.  Regardless of our society's ability to create jobs over the next decade or so &mdash; thankfully current indicators are fairly good &mdash; the ability of individual citizens to compete for them will depend on their educational qualifications.  For that reason, and indeed for many others, I support the Minister's amendment.  In it she recognises the critical role to be played by third level education, in the same way the previous Government recognised the significance and relevance of training as social investment, something for which we had to argue when the National Development Plan was drawn up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to examine in a comprehensive way the support system for third level education. The reasons for the participation or non-participation of certain social groups in third level education are complex and extend, as all Deputies have said, beyond the simple question of money.  While we hope and indeed must insist on improvements in the level of maintenance payments to students from less well off backgrounds, as indicated in the Fianna Fáil motion, I think it would be foolish to suggest that this represents anything but the tip of the iceberg in relation to the problem as a <Col N="1593" /> whole.  As an urban Deputy I am particularly aware of the cynicism with which many people view the grant system.  The widespread perception among the PAYE sector is that certain social groups, particularly farmers and the self-employed, have been able to avail of the grants system at their expense. The Minister has pointed out that this has led to a relative decline in the participation rate at third level among, in particular, the lower middle classes.  The elimination of fees in conjunction with an overall reform package &mdash; it must be stressed that it will be in conjunction with other measures &mdash; will go a long way to level the playing field.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the contention of, among others, Deputy Barrett that this proposal essentially transfers resources from the less well off to the better off. The establishment of the principle that every young adult is entitled to free education is no longer just a pious aspiration, as it may have been when I was involved in student politics in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  Economic growth is now such as justifies and, in fact, demands that we invest in education at all levels, in effect, that we invest in our children and their future.  Whether a child has a middle, lower middle or working class background their educational achievements will be central to their life prospects.  We have to be aware too of families where more than one child wishes to go on to third level education.  I know nobody in this House who would wish to cut off the opportunity for the second or third child in lower middle or middle income families attending college simply because their older brother and sister had done so.</P>
    <P>The present system is far from ideal. Many children from less well off backgrounds are hugely underrepresented in third level education.  This perpetuates inequality and social injustice.  It means, in effect, that many children of ability do not achieve their full potential.  I do not want to overplay this point but I think it is central that the psychological impact on such children of the very fact that fees have to be paid is crucially <Col N="1594" /> important.  There are many children who simply do not think of going on to third level education.  While it is by no means the only reason, the fact that money has to be handed over is unquestionably part of their thinking.  The elimination of fees will obviously have to be accompanied by other measures, including an increase in the maintenance threshold, but I believe it should also be accompanied by a reform of the covenant system.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that the covenant system, well intentioned as it may have been, is hugely abused.  There is plenty of hard as well as anecdotal evidence that much of the money does not go where it is intended but because of the relationship of the individuals involved it is next to impossible for the Revenue Commissioners to establish this.  The covenant system is a tax shelter within the tax system which cannot be justified and I believe it warrants urgent reform.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the time available but I will make one further point.  The Minister has laid great emphasis in her first two years in office on the principle of tackling disadvantage.  We all accept that disadvantage at third level cannot be tackled in isolation and that disadvantage at first and second levels must be tackled at the same time.  The Minister has rightly pointed out in her contribution that she has taken many measures in that regard during the past two years and I hope she will continue to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennealy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion which basically is about the use of the scarce resources which are available.  If the Minister is in a position to abolish fees, that means there is money available to her to develop third level education. What has to be done is to decide on how best to spend the available <Col N="1595" /> money.  In the long term I do not think anybody on this side of the House has a problem with the abolition of fees but is it the right thing to do now?  Is it the intention to help the children of lower paid workers gain access to third level education?  If it is, it will not work; it is more likely to help those who are in a position to help themselves than those in the lower socio-economic classes.  The only way we can help people in the lower classes is by improving the maintenance grants.  The maximum grant is approximately £1,500 and if some significant progress could be made to increase it, and if there was a knock-on effect down the line that would be far more beneficial.</P>
      <P>We have to use our resources to help the long term unemployed, some of whom are discriminated against, and I can give an example.  I put down a Parliamentary Question on 26 January 1994 asking the Minister for Education:</P>
      <P>the plans, if any, she has to do away with the discrimination which currently exists for unemployed people who do not live in close proximity to a university, which consequently forces them to follow a part-time degree course, thereby precluding them from a higher education grant scheme.</P>
      <P>Her reply was:</P>
      <P>There is no discrimination against unemployed persons in the provisions of the higher education grants scheme.  Each person, regardless of employment status, who satisfies the income requirements and other conditions of the scheme is eligible to be awarded a student grant in respect of full-time attendance at a degree or other approved course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Students pursuing part-time courses or evening lectures are not eligible for grant-aid under the higher education grants scheme.  It is not considered possible to make an exception as regards this condition in respect of persons who are unemployed. I will be happy to have fully <Col N="1596" /> clarified any individual cases which the Deputy cares to bring to the attention of my Department.</P>
    <P>I put down the question because I had brought a particular case to the attention of the Department, for all the good it did me.  On the lottery it came out as Question No. 110 so I did not have an opportunity to quiz the Minister on it in the House.  That scheme is for those who are on long term unemployment assistance and aged over 23 years; their social welfare is not affected as a result.</P>
    <P>A long term unemployed person living in County Waterford was doing a degree course in Cork.  Another person living in Cork was doing the same course in Cork.  The latter could do the course during the day and avail of the grants from the Department of Education but the person from County Waterford could not stay in Cork overnight and do the course by day because he is unemployed.  He could not afford to drive to and from Cork every day.  He managed to do the course at night, getting lifts from people living in various parts of County Waterford.  He did not receive one penny from the Department. How can anyone say he was not discriminated against?  A person living in a university town or city has a great advantage.  I do not know if that is included in the report which I was going to say has been suppressed but to our amazement, we heard at the last minute it is going to be published, although it is not yet in the Library.</P>
    <P>Another real problem is the lack of university places.  Perhaps the money should be used in that area.  The number of points required is going through the roof and there is great pressure on students.  Places should be allocated in areas outside universities.  At page 28 of the document, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, it states:</P>
    <P>We are committed to a high quality education system .... to which each person has equal access ....</P>
    <P>The south-east does not have equal <Col N="1597" /> access to education.  I regret the Minister has left the Chamber.  In the debate up to now three areas were mentioned, Waterford, Thurles and Castlebar.  The document states on page 29:</P>
    <P>In the lifetime of this Government we will develop an urban college on the existing campus in Dún Laoghaire.  we will establish the Tipperary Rural Business Development Institute.  We will consolidate and develop the educational programme in Castlebar.</P>
    <P>I presume the Tipperary Rural Business Development Institute refers to Thurles but there is no mention of Waterford. Surprise, surprise, Dún Laoghaire is mentioned but then it is in the Minister's constituency.</P>
    <P>There are five county boroughs in Ireland, four have universities but one, Waterford, does not.  When Deputy Spring was in Waterford during the general election campaign in 1992 he promised that if he was back in Government he would redress that.  I regret the Minister for Education is not present but I hope she will reply to that at some stage.  A transcript of what the Tánaiste said is available if required.</P>
    <P>In 1993 the regional technical college in Waterford took in 276 first time entrants and at the same time there was an outflow from the south-eastern region of 1,400 students doing degree courses in other parts of the country. About 1,000 of them could easily be accommodated within the region if the courses were put in place.  The south-east is the second most populous region outside of Dublin.  The Minister is not present to be reminded of what her colleague, Deputy Quinn, said.  He said Shannon was a model which the rest of the country could develop &mdash; there is a university in Limerick.  If that was the case in other areas we could go forward on the basis of the model in Shannon and help other areas to develop.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister is not present.  Her speech reminded me of <i>To School Through The</i><Col N="1598" /><i>Fields</i> or a romp through the grass.  She seemed to have a late and welcome enlightenment in that she changed the terms of the motion, obviously forced to do so by the strong arguments put forward in many quarters.  They clearly show that, in her original thinking, the Minister did not get it right and she has now seen the error of her ways.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlines her aspirations but did not indicate how they would be achieved.  She did not cost the proposals. Is she proposing something which, at the end of the day, she will not be able to achieve when she puts it before Cabinet, as happened in the past when she put an errant proposal before her colleagues and found it was not in the best interests of education and would not achieve what we all want?</P>
      <P>One could call the Minister's speech a flight of fancy.  It is big on aspiration but low on facts.  I suggest that she go back to the Department and her Cabinet colleagues and come here and tell the House truthfully, honestly and openly what exactly she can achieve.  To date in her ministry all we have heard are aspirations but no hard facts regarding what she hopes to achieve during the term of the Government.</P>
      <P>What are the problems in Irish education that need immediate attention and where do the Minister's proposals set about addressing them?  Inequality is a fundamental factor.  There is lack of access for young people to third level education.  Many figures have been put forward.  It is accepted by Ministers and educators that if a child comes from a low income family, whether they are working or receiving State support, that child's chance of receiving third level education is practically zero.  This is a loss not only to the child and his family but to the community.  In many cases it is the loss of an excellent talent that could be nurtured in the best interests of the country.  How does the Minister's proposal to abolish fees address that problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second issue is maintenance.  It relates to keeping students who, under the present grant system, go to third <Col N="1599" /> level but cannot afford to stay there or if they do manage to stay there, they must work whatever free hours they have in order to survive.  Any educationalist will admit that this is bound to affect their results and their ability to stay the course.  Third level education is extremely competitive.  Students who must work during their free time in order to maintain themselves at college are not on an equal footing with those who need not do so.  How does the Minister propose to deal with that problem? Certainly she advanced no specific comment in her remarks this evening on how she proposed doing so.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the inequality of the present system.  Only today I was examining the position in my county, Cork, in which I discovered that the farming community receive 25 per cent of all grants, employers receive 10 per cent, yet social welfare recipients receive a total of 27.5 per cent.  Therefore, when we speak of additional places in third level we shall have to examine the cost-effectiveness of their provision. Within the term of office of the previous administration I asked the Minister for Education whether she had examined the cost-effectiveness of providing places in universities and regional technical colleges.  The figures to hand suggest that the universities cost a pupil in the region of £4,500 whereas the regional technical colleges cost in the region of £2,500.</P>
    <P>For instance, the Minister has not dealt with the problem of the present major overcrowding in our universities, whose theatres are overflowing with 300 and 400 students, packed to the walls, attending lectures.  This clearly demonstrates that universities are under-funded, yet the Minister is unwilling not only to provide funds but even to ascertain whether they are giving good value for money.</P>
    <P>Our regional technical colleges and institutes of technology are the real success story of education but, unfortunately, under the auspices of this Minister they have been deprived.  For <Col N="1600" /> example, within a short 25 year period they have catered for in excess of 52 per cent of all third level students, providing businesses and industry with graduates with which to drive this economy forward, emanating from the greatest diversity of courses provided anywhere in Europe.  What will the Ministers proposals do to help these colleges provide the education their students deserve? The Minister's proposals solve one problem, they will get rid of fees to the tune of £50 million but who will pay?  To date, taxpayers and private individuals funded our universities and colleges while it has to be admitted that the growing sector is research and development.</P>
    <P>The Minister's original proposal, to eliminate fees altogether, effectively means she will look after those who are highly paid and will not have regard to the fact that some of them earn £100,000 per annum.  I see no espousal of the recognition that there should be a major increase effected in the present income thresholds relating to the PAYE sector, people earning, say, between £15,000 and £20,000, some of whom have two or three children attending university.  That inequity must be dealt with in the short term in the forthcoming budget.  I urge the Minister to forget the fancy footwork and get down to ensuring that much greater numbers of people within the PAYE sector are given a fair deal, access to third level education, bearing in mind those in the lower income sector who have not been catered for to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to make a short contribution to this important debate.  It is timely that it should take place in the run-up to the budget, when the Minister for Education clearly will be considering the priorities within her Department.  It goes without saying that the overall third level sector is most important.  This debate also provides us with an opportunity to consider and examine the anomalies and inequities in the provisions of the various grant schemes <Col N="1601" /> under their three separate headings, the higher education grant scheme, the vocational education committee scholarship scheme and the ESF grant scheme.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the best starting point is to examine income thresholds in respect of full maintenance and full fees.  For example, the annual income threshold of a person with three dependent children is £16,348.  Compared to the income threshold for four to seven dependent children of £17,982, one sees the serious anomaly/inequity in that sector &mdash; seven children <i>versus</i> three children, the gap in the income threshold is very narrow indeed.  The Minister needs to address that anomaly when proposing amendments.  Where there are eight or more children in family the income threshold is £19,617.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall confine myself to giving a number of examples, some real, others representing possible circumstances that might arise.  I came across a particular case in the past 12 months.  I am sorry to note that Deputy Derek McDowell is no longer present having regard to some of his remarks.  A farmer with a medium-sized farm on the basis of accounts submitted to the local Revenue office was deemed to be eligible for receipt of grants under the scheme. The farmer concerned was fortunate, or perhaps unfortunate, that an elderly uncle who died at the ripe old age of 90 bequeathed a farm of 36 acres to him. That farm happened to have an encumbrance of something in the region of £12,000 to £15,000 arising from a public liability claim fought successfully against the holding when in the possession of his uncle.  The farm was in a particularly run-down state, the estimate for reclamation work was in the region of £12,000 and, when carried out, would enhance the asset value of the holding which, for the purposes of processing his application, amounted to £45,000.  After the various adjustments had been made the final position was that that farmer's application for grant <Col N="1602" /> aid was disallowed, hence his intellectually well-endowed son had to attend college being funded by the farmer raising a loan for the purpose.  I understand that a conservative estimated annual cost of maintaining a student in college at present is in the region of £5,000 to £6,000.  In addition, I understand there is no provision in the grants scheme for tax relief on interest paid on moneys borrowed to maintain a student in college.</P>
    <P>Clearly there is a serious anomaly in the grants scheme in that somebody fortunate enough to have inherited a farm found that, as a result, he was deemed to be ineligible.  I might add that I am talking about a farm whose productive capacity was nil because it was in a very run-down state and would have necessitated considerable expenditure on getting it into shape.  Needless to say, the reclamation work on that farm had to be postponed.</P>
    <P>Therefore, one wonders about the priorities within the theories of economic development when examining details of such cases.  I hope the Minister is listening to the monitor.  The case was unsuccessfully appealed to her Department. I am prepared to provide her with all the details of the case were it to be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>The other case I have in mind is that of an estranged couple, with three children. The wife works, the husband also works but, unfortunately, he has an addiction that lends him to fritter a considerable proportion of his weekly salary, making no contribution to the upkeep of the home.  The couple part; the son and daughter then become eligible for higher education grants.  The husband returns, then the son and daughter become ineligible for grant aid because the combined incomes of the spouses puts them above the income threshold, yet the husband is not making any contribution to the young people's education or to the upkeep of the home.  There is a need for flexibility in the grants scheme to ensure that <Col N="1603" /> regulations do not preclude intellectually well-endowed students from attending college in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers have rightly focused on the plight of the PAYE sector. Many people who are in receipt of an income which is marginally above the poverty threshold are unable to afford to put their sons and daughters through college.  That must be addressed in the scheme.  It is a net loss to the long term economic well-being of the country that people with the necessary intellectual ability are precluded from going to college because their parents do not have the financial resources to support them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter.  The Minister will be aware of the feasibility study commissioned by IBEC and the CBI on the development of an economic corridor between Dublin and Belfast.  The study came down very much in favour of the corridor.  In the process it clearly identifies the infrastructural deficiencies which need to be addressed.  I represent a constituency where the momentum of development has been blighted because of its location.  The economic corridor concept had its origin in the work of a French regional economist in the 1950s. There is a number of good and practical international examples of economic corridors in North America, the UK, Europe and Japan.</P>
      <P>The study found there was widespread private sector support for the development of such a corridor.  At this critical time of the peace process a Government commitment to actively pursue this project would be a major boost to the peace momentum.  The combined population of the two urban areas is almost two million people, more than one-third of our total island population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1604" /> If a task force were established it would find tremendous support for the project.  In the context of integrated economic development in a corridor project, the possibilities would be of immense benefit to the east coast of Ireland.  It would be of immense benefit also in driving ahead the momentum of the peace initiative in the North.  It is important that we identify viable worthwhile cross-Border projects that will copperfasten the peace initiative and show people North and South and in Border areas, like County Louth, that there is a tangible benefit to be gained from peace on this island.</P>
    <P>We have suffered tremendously over the past 25 years because of the Northern troubles.  My county, because of its close proximity and its economic and cultural identity with the Six Counties has been at the coalface of the problem on this side of the Border.  I can refer only briefly to the economic corridor now, but I would like to have more time to develop the debate on the concept at a later date.  That will be worthwhile and I sincerely hope the Minister of State will bring us tidings of good news in relation to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kirk for raising this matter.  The recent developments in Northern Ireland hold out the prospect of substantial economic development, beneficial to both parts of this island and to all who live on it.  It is this Government's wish to harness to the fullest extent possible the opportunities offered by these developments, to the betterment of all, North and South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, I think, agreement on all sides of this House on the end purpose underlying the subject matter of our discussion tonight.  There will, of course, be differing views on the best means to the end sought &mdash; a strengthened capacity for economic and employment growth throughout this island through what is, implicitly, a form of mutual co-operation &mdash; the creation of a Dublin-Belfast economic corridor. <Col N="1605" /> While there are, of course, conflicting and deeply entrenched views held on the political way forward on this island, there are few, whatever their political persuasion, who would argue against economic co-operation between the North and the South.  It is history, rather than any law of geography or economics, that has divided us.  There is already a consensus within business, North and South, on making the island a microcosm of Europe, on creating our own single market.  This consensus has no political agenda &mdash; rather, an economic objective underlies it, born out of the belief that such a development would be beneficial to all in economic terms.</P>
    <P>The economic corridor concept is attractive, in that it would seem to be one approach to bringing about the greater integration of what are, as of now, two somewhat separate economies; and, to the extent that such integration could assist the more successful development of both economies, it would thereby bring better living standards throughout the island.</P>
    <P>The question of the feasibility of establishing such a corridor has already been the subject of a major study to which Deputy Kirk referred.  The findings were presented in &ldquo;A Corridor of Opportunity&rdquo;, prepared for the joint IBEC-CBI Northern Ireland Council by a leading group of economic consultants. The study concluded that a Dublin-Belfast economic corridor should be developed.  Very importantly, however, it pointed out that the development of such a corridor would not be a panacea for the lack of competitiveness and other difficulties facing firms in the region; should not be pursued at the expense of other parts of the island; should be undertaken by building on existing strengths in the area concerned; and should not result in any reduction in existing cross-Border initiatives.</P>
    <P>The report included a range of recommendations about how such an economic corridor might be developed.  They included initiatives considered necessary on infrastructure and on the <Col N="1606" /> development of business and other linkages, specific development initiatives and steps to improve the prestige and image of the corridor.  In this context I might mention that the present development strategy for national primary roads focuses on four key corridors, one of which is that linking Dublin and Belfast.  I might also remind the House that a major upgrading of the Dublin-Belfast railway line is currently underway, and I am sure that the Louth constituency will benefit from both those developments.</P>
    <P>These recommendations will be taken into account in the Government's future consideration of this initiative.</P>
    <P>The Government, like its predecessors, is fully committed to the expansion and the development of North-South economic co-operation in all areas.  That co-operation has greatly increased in recent years.  There has been a series of extremely valuable contacts within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>Both North and South, and in particular the Border areas, have benefited from the European INTERREG programme. The INTERREG II programme will shortly be implemented, and I am sure the Border areas will benefit substantially from that programme on this occasion also.  The new European aid package will also be of assistance to developments in the Border area.  As is already well known, the Government is anxious that any lasting settlement on this island will include a strong North-South economic dimension.</P>
    <P>The House will understand, therefore, that I am in full agreement with the concept which prompts Deputy Kirk &mdash; to promote developments which can work to the significant economic and employment benefit of both the North and the South.  As to the particular proposal mentioned by the Deputy I understand that a task force has already been established by IBEC and the CBI to pursue the feasability of the recommendations in the study to which I have <Col N="1607" /> referred.  I look forward with interest to the outcome of its deliberations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for selecting this topic for debate this evening.  In this short debate I want to draw attention specifically to the funding crisis being experienced by the Cork Rape Crisis Centre.  That centre which was established in 1983 now employs one part-time co-ordinator, two administration assistants and two trained counsellors.</P>
      <P>I will give a brief summary of the workload of the centre.</P>
      <P>In the first nine months of 1994 the centre received 431 telephone calls, all from victims of rape, child abuse or those speaking on behalf of people abused in one way or another.  Their misery would be multiplied 100 times over were it not for the comprehensive service provided by the Cork Rape Crisis Centre.  Of the 431 callers, some were given ongoing counselling within the centre, after initial counselling more were referred to other agencies or professions, but all were helped in some way.  It is interesting to note that, as might sometimes be assumed, not all of those assisted by the centre were women; there were approximately 30 calls from men in that period.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Cork centre holds workshops, particularly for second level students; 60 such workshops were organised in Cork last year.  The centre sees those workshops as an important element in alerting young people to the best ways of protecting themselves against or dealing with, assaults.  This will help to minimise the number of assaults on young people &mdash; to be forewarned is often to be forearmed.  Those workshops are a valuable part of the work provided by the centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the value, scope and nature of the service, in the last financial year the centre was allocated only £24,500. Not only was that vastly less than that <Col N="1608" /> required to maintain and run the services but it was considerably less than the amount granted to other rape crisis centres in smaller cities.  For example, it was £1,500 less than the amount allocated to Galway &mdash; a centre with a smaller workload because of a smaller population &mdash; it was £1,500 less than that allocated to Limerick and it was even less than that allocated to Tralee and that raises other questions.  The Minister of State should note the injustice of the amount of funding allocated to the Cork centre.</P>
    <P>I appeal to him to ensure that adequate funding is provided for the centre in the forthcoming budget and that the comprehensive submission made by the Cork Rape Crisis Centre to the Department of Health is thoroughly studied by his Department and fully responded to.  The centre estimates that it will need a minimum of £72,000 in 1995 to enable it to maintain and carry on its work.  I urge the Minister of State to ensure that figure is voted through for the purpose I outlined and that there will be no delay in making the payment available.  The voluntary input to the centre is fundamental.  If the State had to carry out the workload of the centre on its own, the bill would be much higher than £72,000.  I appeal to the Minister of State for a positive reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my colleague, Deputy Noonan, Minister for Health, I thank Deputy Quill for raising this matter and for providing an opportunity to clarify issues on the funding of Cork Rape Crisis Centre.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1991, funding for rape crisis centres came from a number of sources with funding being uncertain from year to year.  The unsatisfactory nature of these arrangements was recognised and following a Government decision in July 1991, funding for the centres was channelled through the health boards from the Department's national lottery allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Second Commission on the <Col N="1609" /> Status of Women in its report published in 1993 recommended that the existing rape crisis centres be given secure multiannual funding on a contractual basis such as health boards already provided to voluntary bodies for some community and family planning functions; where a regional rape crisis centre does not exist, the health boards in question should establish one, staffed by persons with appropriate expertise; and all rape crisis centres and health boards should maintain regular close liaison with a view to implementing the most appropriate and sympathetic policies for the victims of sexual assault; it is also important that rape crisis centres should network with each other.</P>
    <P>In 1994, funding to the rape crisis centres and counselling centres directly from the Department of Health, largely from the Department's national lottery allocation, was £458,500 which represented an increase of 77 per cent on the figure of £258,500 for 1993.  In addition to this lottery funding, the health boards provided £198,570 to the centres in 1994 from within their revenue allocations.  In 1994 the Cork Rape Crisis Centre received more than £28,000 from these sources.</P>
    <P>On the basis of submissions received in 1994 and in recognition of the increased level of work undertaken, funding was increased to some of the counselling centres including Limerick, Galway and Tralee.  As no submissions were received from the Cork Rape Crisis Centre in 1994, its level of funding was maintained at the 1993 level and was assumed to be adequate for the service which the centre provided.  At no stage after the allocation of funding in 1994 did the Cork Rape Crisis Centre indicate to the Southern Health Board or to my Department that it had financial problems.  During the recent Cork by-election, there were press reports that the centre was underfunded.  In response, my Department advised the centre that if it considered itself underfunded, it should make a submission to the Southern Health Board <Col N="1610" /> and the Minister for Health, making a case for additional funding in 1995.</P>
    <P>I am happy to report that the Cork centre submitted a report to the Minister late last week.  It will be considered in the light of the recommendations of the commission and in the context of service provision and resource availability in consultation with the Southern Health Board, in whose functional area the Cork Rape Crisis Centre lies.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the Minister and I are committed to the implementation of the recommendations of the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan will examine the future funding of all rape crisis centres in the light of the resources available in 1995 and the commission's recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me an opportunity to highlight this matter.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate him on his reappointment.</P>
      <P>It was brought to my attention that over the past week approximately 45 people had elective surgery postponed at Cork University Hospital.  Many people summoned to the hospital were told at the drop of a hat, &ldquo;sorry, these arrangements have to be cancelled&rdquo; and were given no definite rescheduling date.  I am sure the Minister of State understands the arrangements that have to be made by parents to leave their children cared for and to take time off work.  Such arrangements are very difficult to make.  Moreover, I wish to point out to the Minister the stress and trauma felt by people about to undergo elective surgery and they will now have to go through that trauma again.  Should they have to do that?  Could it not be avoided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to draw to your attention that over the weekend we had in Cork University Hospital the spectacle of many patients being catered for on trolleys in <Col N="1611" /> corridors and wards.  The Minister will agree that this leaves much to be desired in this day and age.  Irrespective of the emergency services provided and the remedial action taken by the hospital staff, whom I commend for looking after their patients in a caring manner, this situation could have been anticipated. This level of overcrowding occurred in last October-November.  If the Minister reviews the records for previous years he will find that overcrowding occurs in the winter.  It is fair to suggest that the Department should have anticipated the problem and put in place emergency procedures to redress a recurring problem.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that public patients in this instance were inconvenienced and, as on many other occasions, private patients were not affected.  That leaves a sour taste.  It is something you and I wish would not happen.  How can we address this?  How will the Minister ensure that additional resources are made available so that a similar crisis will not recur.  This would alleviate stress not only for patients but for the staff who have to deal with the crisis on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Michael Noonan, I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for raising this matter and for presenting an opportunity to clarify the situation in relation to the rescheduling of elective admissions at Cork Regional Hospital. In doing so, I am sure the Deputy will be aware that the provision of services at Cork University Hospital is a matter for the Southern Health Board in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The workload of many hospitals has increased since Christmas owing to an increase in the number of people, many of them elderly, requiring admission to hospital because of respiratory and other seasonal complaints.  Such an increase in activity is consistent with the general pattern for this time of year.  As a result of this additional workload there has been pressure on medical <Col N="1612" /> wards in particular and some delays in accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board informed the Minister that there has been considerable pressure on beds at Cork University Hospital during the past number of days due to an influx of emergency admissions, mostly in the medical area.</P>
    <P>As a result, the hospital authorities were obliged to temporarily convert a five-day ward to a seven-day ward in order to cater for this increased demand for beds.  Consequently, ten elective admissions planned for today and 12 admissions for tomorrow have been rescheduled.  Therefore, ten patients have been affected today and not 45, as the Deputy suggests.  The Minister has been informed by the authorities at Cork University Hospital that this decision has been made on the basis of clinical advice.  It is understood that these were not urgent cases and in general had not been on the waiting list for a significant period.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that all urgent and emergency cases at Cork University Hospital continue to be treated.  Furthermore, every effort is being made to ensure that the patients affected receive new admission dates as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will wish to know that the position in relation to elective admissions is being reviewed on an hourly basis by the hospital authorities who are confident that the delivery of service at the hospital will revert to normal in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to raise this important matter on an appropriate day.  I also congratulate the new Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Bernard Allen, on his appointment.  I am glad his hard work and ability is being so rewarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am totally against drunken driving as, I am sure, are other Members of the House, including the former Minister for the Environment who introduced <Col N="1613" /> the legislation.  In raising this issue I am not jumping on a bandwagon because 4,000 publicans have come to town. What I will say on the legislation and its effect on rural life is exactly what I said when the Bill was being considered: previously, it was by way of forecast, on this occasion it is stark reality so far as social life in rural areas is concerned.</P>
    <P>There can be no disputing the effect fear of the new laws is having on rural public houses.  Everywhere one hears the word &ldquo;devastated&rdquo;.  A 40 per cent loss of business seems to be the average. Irish pubs are unique.  Pubs on the continent with which we seem to want to get in line are not pubs as we know them. Our pubs are meeting places in which to talk and argue.  They are places of philosophy, craic and social intercourse, with drinking often being secondary. Irish pubs are a major tourist attraction and are sold abroad as such by Bord Fáilte.  The rural pub is a nice warm meeting place where farmers come for a pint or two after a day's work.  This is one of the few remaining social outlets for the rural population, all of which I regret are under threat.  There is no point is saying, as many have said in the past, that car pools can be organised by the neighbours.  This is not practical as the population is much too dispersed.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, there was a substantial reduction in road accidents during the Christmas period, but I should point out, with the exception of 1993, there has been a gradual reduction each year since 1972.  Who can say with any certainty that the reduction in road accidents this year was caused by the blood alcohol level being reduced from 100 milligram to 80 milligram?  Who can say we would not have achieved the same or even a better result under the previous legislation had the Garda been given the necessary resources to have it vigorously enforced.  So far I have not heard any convincing argument to indicate that the 100 milligram level, properly enforced with the same publicity, would not be as effective as the 80 milligram limit.</P>
    <P>The most serious flaw in the drink <Col N="1614" /> driving legislation is the draconian mandatory sentence where a person who is slightly over the 80 milligram limit and not involved in an accident is criminalised, loses his or her driving licence and, perhaps as a result, his or her job.  Is it any wonder the Garda representative body felt compelled to voice the objection of the Garda whose job it is to enforce the law?</P>
    <P>Was this legislation discussed in a meaningful way by the entire Cabinet and, if so, I fear it was another day featuring those headless chickens, even with the leavening presence of our new colleagues in the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>I call on the new Minister and new Minister of State to appraise the drink driving laws, especially the introduction of graded, graduated and discretionary penalties.  At present, one can be tried and found guilty, in effect, by a garda on the side of the road and criminalised for marginal offences.</P>
    <P>It is an outrageous and ridiculous excuse to advance as did the previous Minister, that graduated penalties would not work. Of course they would work and we must try harder in this respect. This is crude legislation.  To amend it would not give the wrong message to drinkers.  What we are talking about is not just a threat to the livelihood of the publicans and employment in public houses, even though that is very important; we are talking about something that has done enormous damage to the social life in rural Ireland.  We need a change in the law and we need it quickly.  We need above all proper enforcement of a fair law.  That would bring about a much better result on the roads than an unfair law sporadically applied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Nealon for his kind comments which are much appreciated.  The issue raised by the Deputy has been the subject of considerable debate in the national and local media.  That debate has given rise to much speculation and <Col N="1615" /> I am pleased to take this opportunity to clarify some issues and to indicate to the House the action taken in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>Prior to 2 December 1994, legislation governing drinking and driving was set out in the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act, 1978.  Under that Act, the maximum permissible blood alcohol level for drivers of vehicles was 100 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.  A person found of exceeding the blood alcohol limit of 100 milligrammes was liable to the following penalties: mandatory disqualification from driving for a minimum of one year; a fine of up to a maximum of £1,000 and imprisonment up to a maximum of six months.</P>
      <P>New road traffic legislation governing drinking and driving came into force on 2 December 1994.  The amendments were introduced by the previous administration as a road safety measure and were part of a much wider road safety campaign which has been on-going since 1991.  The new provisions reduced the blood alcohol limit from 100 milligrammes to 80 milligrammes; increased the mandatory disqualification period to two years; and introduced a new requirement to pass a driving test before the licence is returned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1994 Act does, however, give some discretion to the court in this area. The court may apply a one year disqualification and may decide not to apply the driving test requirement where the court is satisfied that there are special reasons to justify such a <Col N="1616" /> course.  The other penalties remain unchanged.  The maximum fine is still £1,000 and the maximum term of imprisonment is still six months.  Subject to those maxima, the level of any such penalty is entirely at the discretion of the court &mdash; I stress the word &ldquo;discretion&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There has been a very significant reaction to the new measures and to the intensified Garda enforcement associated with the traditional Christmas road safety campaign.  The reaction included vigorous demand for change, as we witnessed to day outside this House but there is an equally strong campaign seeking to ensure that the stringent measures are kept in place.</P>
    <P>It is important to say clearly at this stage that the Government agrees with the essential thrust of the new measures; in particular the new blood alcohol level of 80 milligrammes.  However, the Minister for the Environment has also made clear, since his appointment that he intended to monitor the impact of the new measures and that he wanted to hear at first hand the views of all interested parties.  The Minister has now received written and oral submissions from a variety of groups representing a wide cross section of opinion.  He intends to carefully consider all those submissions and will make an announcement about the matter generally as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the most tragic aspect of the disaster at Chernobyl is the appalling long-term effects which it had, and continues to have, on the lives of people in the region.  I have the deepest sympathy for those who <Col N="1323" /> have suffered as a result of the accident, many of them from cancer and other major illnesses.</P>
      <P>The Irish voluntary workers who have arranged medical assistance for victims of the Chernobyl disaster in this country deserve the highest praise.

The EU is funding the work of the International Red Cross, Red Crescent and other agencies which are providing medical assistance to the victims. In addition, the European Communities Humanitarian Office has provided substantial funding towards medical help for children affected by radiation.</P>

      <P>The European Community Monitoring Mission is an unarmed mission, which is civilian in character.  It is composed of some 300 diplomatic and military personnel seconded by the EU member states, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Of these, approximately 170 are monitors and the balance headquarters staff, analysts and support personnel. The overall direction of the ECMM rests with the Council of Ministers of the European Union.  On its behalf, the <Col N="1324" /> Presidency of the day is responsible for the overall running of the mission and its smooth functioning.</P>
      <P>The mission was established on the basis of a Memorandum of Understanding signed by the Yugoslav parties in July 1991.  This derived from the Brioni Agreements between the Yugoslav parties which were negotiated by the Presidency of the European Community.  The scope of the mission's activities were subsequently extended to include monitoring activities in Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</P>
      <P>In addition to monitoring local ceasefires, implementation of agreements on the ground, promoting confidence-building measures, the ECMM plays a significant role in humanitarian activities in conjunction with the international aid agencies.  The ECMM also maintains a small presence in the neighbouring countries, at their request.  This is a valuable instrument of preventive diplomacy.</P>
      <P>Should the ECMM continue to be deployed in the region in the latter half of 1996, Ireland, which will then have the Presidency of the European Union, will be responsible for the management of the mission.  This will involve making available to the mission personnel to fill key posts and also a considerable number of the mission's support staff.</P>
      <P>The role of the ECMM is likely to continue to evolve before Ireland assumes the Presidency of the European Union and will have to be tailored to take account of the situation on the ground in the latter half of 1996.  Bearing in mind the evolving situation, both my Department and the Department of Defence have already begun planning for our Presidency obligations in relation to the ECMM.  This includes close liasion with the previous, current and incoming EU Presidencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ECMM has and continues to make an important contribution at the local level to peace and reconciliation in former Yugoslavia and is a visible demonstration of the European Union's <Col N="1325" /> commitment in this regard.  In our planning, we wish to ensure that, during Ireland's Presidency, the ECMM's high standards and effectiveness are maintained and, if possible, developed further.</P>

      <P>There have been a number of security incidents in recent months in the camps for Rwandan refugees in Zaire.  There is evidence that the defeated Hutu army and militia are training in the camps and are attempting to destabilise the Government of Rwanda by incursions across the border. There is a general consensus in the international community that something must be done about the security situation in the camps, but there is considerable debate about how the problem should be tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some 50 Irish personnel working with Irish non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Zaire as well as other expatriates and a large number of local employees.  They are continuing their efforts to bring assistance to the refugees in very difficult circumstances. Their safety is a matter of concern for the Government.  My Department is maintaining close contact with all the Irish non-governmental organisations which are working in Zaire, Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania.  We had discussions with the United Nations in early December, during which we drew attention to the substantial number of humanitarian relief workers with Irish NGOs in the field and the importance that the Government attaches to their safety and their inclusion in UN safety <Col N="1326" /> plans.  Following a serious incident involving an armed robbery in GOAL's premises in Bukavu at the end of December, we again conveyed our concerns to UN headquarters in New York and to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva as the UNHCR is the lead agency in the camps in Zaire.</P>
    <P>Last week at the Round Table donors' meeting on Rwanda I met the Prime Minister of Rwanda and members of his Government, the President of the International Red Cross, Mr. Sommaruga, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mrs. Ogata, and the heads of other UN agencies. Our concern was shared by all the people to whom I spoke and it was felt that the question of security in the camps will not be easily resolved.  There are a number of proposals for policing arrangements currently under consideration by the UN Security Council.</P>
    <P>There will be a major conference in Bujumbura in Burundi in mid-February on the refugee problems of the region. The question of security in the camps will be a major topic.  Ireland will be represented at the conference and I hope that a solution to this problem will be reached.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to pay tribute to the work of Irish NGOs in Zaire and the other countries affected by the conflict. I have seen what they are doing and have been greatly impressed by their professionalism and dedication.</P>

      <P>In his address to the European Parliament on 17 January, Commission President Jacques Santer said that the European Union would continue to play its major role in development co-operation and humanitarian aid so as to contribute to peace and security in the world.  He went on to mention the new chapter on development co-operation in the Maastricht Treaty on European Union.</P>
      <P>It is my strong hope that the entry into force of the Treaty on European Union will lead to a more effective and coherent approach to development co-operation on the part of the European Union.  The EU is one of the largest aid donors in the world and it is imperative that the effectiveness of its actions be maximised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1328" /> The Council has adopted comprehensive Resolutions on issues such as poverty, health, education and training in developing countries.  These are matters which are important not only for the EU but for bilateral aid programmes. Another priority area at present being addressed in the context of preparations for the Beijing Conference on Women is gender and the particular needs and rights of women in developing countries.</P>
    <P>The policy framework is largely in place; what is required is that the policies be fully implemented.  I regard it as an important objective that Ireland should seek to ensure that the European Union plays a leading role in development co-operation and humanitarian aid.  I shall be directing Irish input with a view to achieving this objective.  In particular, duplication in the field of development between the Commission and the member states must be avoided. Our multilateral and bilateral efforts must be mutually reinforcing for the benefit of the developing world.  We must also ensure that there is consistency between the Union's development policy and those other policies, especially in the areas of access to markets, which might affect developing countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland has played a constructive role, along with our partners, in formulating EU development policies.  We do so through discussion at ministerial level and, at official level, in the various EU working groups.  We will continue to play our part fully.</P>

      <P>The Estimates for 1995 have not been published yet but I <Col N="1329" /> am confident that the amount of money allocated to official development assistance in 1995 will show a sustantial increase.</P>
      <P>Over the last two years there have been major increases in ODA funding; a total of £54.6 million was spent on ODA in 1993 compared with £40 million in 1992.  Last year's expenditure is likely to amount to around £70 million. This means that the level of Government spending on ODA has increased by £30 million in the two years since 1992 and, as I have already said, a further large increase is planned for this year.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Renewal has reaffirmed the commitment to increase Ireland's official development assistance significantly so as to make steady progress towards achieving the UN goal of 0.7 per cent of GNP.  By 1997 we should be spending around 0.4 per cent of GNP on development aid which will put us on a par with most of our EU partners. Like other Members of the House, I would wish to proceed thereafter as rapidly as possible towards achieving the UN goal of 0.7 per cent of GNP.</P>

      <P>The International Fund for Ireland was established by an international agreement signed by the Irish and British Governments on 18 September, 1986.  The purpose of the fund was to act as a vehicle of international support for the promotion of economic and social development in those areas of both parts of Ireland which had suffered most severely from the violence of recent years.</P>
      <P>Article 3 of that agreement stated, <i>inter alia,</i> that:</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Ireland is an observer in the Western European Union (WEU).  The decision to take up observer status in the Western European Union resulted from the new relationship between the European Union and the Western European Union provided for in the Maastricht Treaty (Article J.4.2).  On the basis of our experience as an observer in the Western European Union to date, we are satisfied that observer status meets our current requirements with regard to the relationship between the EU and the Western European Union established by the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking ahead, it can be anticipated that the relationship between the EU <Col N="1331" /> and the Western European Union will feature in the review of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) provisions of the Maastricht Treaty in the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference. In particular, the scope and content of a future common defence policy and possibly, the question of a common defence, will feature in those negotiations.</P>
    <P>While it is difficult to predict what specific options may be under consideration when the Intergovernmental Conference meets in 1996, it is already clear that a number of our EU partners will expect the Western European Union to play an increased role in European security and defence issues.  To that end, it is likely that some of our partners will be in favour of the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference negotiations resulting in a much closer linkage between the EU and the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>Our approach to the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations will be based on the commitments in the &ldquo;Programme for Renewal&rdquo;: namely, that we will play our full part in the European Union and that our foreign policy will continue to be underpinned by our commitment to peace, security and co-operation.</P>
    <P>We intend the White Paper on Foreign Policy to inform and encourage debate on all the issues involved.  The programme A Government of Renewal also makes it clear that we will put the outcome of any future negotiations that would involve Ireland's participation in a common defence policy to the people in a referendum, thus ensuring that Ireland's policy of military neutrality will remain unchanged unless the people decide otherwise in a referendum.</P>

Aid convoys are now moving freely in central Bosnia, where the situation on the ground has been gradually improving.</P>
      <P>The European Union's Administration of the city of Mostar is contributing in a practical way to reconciliation between Bosnia's Croat and Muslim communities.  It is helping to overcome mutual hatred and mistrust and to bring together two deeply divided communities.  Mostar, I hope, can be a model for the development of Croat/Muslim relations elsewhere in the Federation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding these developments, <Col N="1335" /> it is clear that a lasting peace will not be established until two key issues are resolved &mdash; territorial delimitation between the Federation and the Bosnian Serb territories, and constitutional arrangements for the government and administration of Bosnia.</P>
    <P>The Contact Group &mdash; France, Germany and the UK on behalf of the EU, Russia and the United States &mdash; continues to play a leading role in the search for a settlement.  Its proposal for territorial delimitation involves the preservation of Bosnia as a single union within its internationally recognised borders, the territorial division agreed earlier by all three parties &mdash; 51 per cent for the Croat and Muslim communities and 49 per cent for the Bosnian Serbs, the continuation of Bosnia's international legal personality and the right of refugees and displaced persons to return freely to their homes of origin.</P>
    <P>The contact group's plan has the full support of the UN Security Council.  It has been accepted by three of the four key participants in the conflict the Bosnian Government, Bosnia's Croats, and the authorities in Belgrade who represent the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The plan has not however been accepted by the Serbs in Bosnia itself and a key objective of the international effort is now directed at obtaining Bosnian Serb agreement.</P>
    <P>To this end, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has ended its support for the Bosnian Serb leadership and has closed the border between the Federal Republic and the Bosnian Serb territories. A Mission of the International Conference, to which Ireland is contributing four personnel, is monitoring the closure.</P>
    <P>Following the visit by former US President Carter to the region, a Cessation of Hostilities Agreement came into effect at the beginning of January. This contains important provisions on the separation of forces, withdrawal of heavy weapons and on full freedom of movement for UNPROFOR and humanitarian agencies.  UNPROFOR is <Col N="1336" /> working with the parties to ensure that these provisions are implemented on the ground.  While the Bosnian Serbs have continued to obstruct the access to Sarajevo for aid convoys, the UN considers that the parties are generally discharging their obligations, other than in the Bihac area.</P>
    <P>At the General Affairs Council yesterday, European Union Foreign Ministers reviewed the situation in Bosnia. We agreed that it is vital now to exploit the window of opportunity created by the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement to relaunch the negotiating process it is essential that all parties honour their commitments under the agreement and that negotiations should recommence without delay on the basis of acceptance by all parties of the contact group plan.</P>
    <P>Should agreement on the territorial issues be secured, the constitutional questions can then be addressed with, I believe, a reasonable prospect of success. A settlement in Bosnia will greatly enhance the prospects for a more global settlement for the Yugoslav region.</P>

      <P>Planning for the Irish Presidency of the European Union, which will take place during the second half of 1996, is already well underway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main obligation on any presidency is to ensure an efficient and effective approach to the discharge of the Union's business.  Ireland has a good record in this respect in the conduct of past presidencies.  Our next presidency will face a number of new challenges which will have to be taken into account in the planning process.  These include those changes arising out of the Treaty on European Union, in particular the need to take account of the enhanced <Col N="1337" /> role of the European Parliament, and the increase in membership of the Union with the accession of Austria. Finland and Sweden.</P>
    <P>The responsibilities of the presidency will include, on the practical side, chairing the European Council and the Council of Minister meetings, and acting as host to a number of informal councils, which will be held in Ireland.  The presidency will also have the responsibility of reporting to the European Parliament, as well as appearing at hearings of parliamentary committees and taking part in debates.  In addition, Ministers or Ministers of State, will be called upon to co-chair meetings of the Conciliation Committees of the Parliament (convened when disagreements on legislative proposals arise between the Council and Parliament).  We will also be required to chair the Intergovernmental Conference, which is likely to be convened before our Presidency.  During the six months period Ireland will also act as spokesman and co-ordinate the position of the European Union in international fora such as the United Nations and its agencies, the World Trade Organisations, the OECD, etc.</P>
    <P>While it is too early to predict the issues that will dominate our Presidency in 1996, the issues facing the European Union, and likely to provide at least part of the framework for our Presidency, can be broadly identified.  These are; the Intergovernmental Conference due to start in 1996 and likely to be in place for the duration of our Presidency. This will deal with revision to the Treaty where provided for, including the provisions relating to the Common Foreign and Security Policy and relations with the European Parliament.  Once the Intergovernmental Conference is convened other items can be added to the agenda; intensified multilateral surveillance and the decision on the move to the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union which must be taken no later than 31 December, 1996; immigration, organised crime, and drug and fissionable material smuggling seem likely to remain dominant issues on the justice <Col N="1338" /> and home affairs agenda; the further development of relations with the Union neighbours in Cental and Eastern and Southern Europe and in the Mediterranean region with a view to accession.</P>
    <P>An Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee for the Presidency, under the aegis of the European Co-ordination Committee, commenced work in July 1994.  This committee is identifying the responsibilities to be assumed, the issues likely to form the agenda and the practical and organisational matters which need to be addressed in order to carry out the tasks which have to be undertaken during the six-month period. The committee will provide regular progress reports to the Government.</P>

      <P>When I spoke to the Social Study Conference in Kilkenny last August and to the White Paper Seminar on Human Rights in Galway earlier this month, I made clear my determination that these two key United Nations human rights instruments should be ratified before the end of 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has, in fact, ratified four of the six major UN conventions in the field of human rights.  We have signed the Convention against Torture and the Convention on Racial Discrimination which is, of course, in itself a demonstration of our firm intention to ratify them.  Completing our ratification of the main human rights instruments this year will be an appropriate way of marking the UN's fiftieth anniversary and the fortieth anniversary of our own membership in the organisation.  It will also <Col N="1339" /> be a fitting response to the call by the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993 for all states to ratify each of the UN human rights instruments.</P>
    <P>Work on the measures necessary for the ratification of these two instruments is being given priority in my Department and in the other concerned Departments.</P>
    <P>Once ratification is assured it will be important that we be seen to be fully implementing the provisions of the Conventions against Torture and Racial Discrimination.</P>

      <P>Ireland welcomes the deepening of relations with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and fully supports the conclusions of the European Council meetings in Copenhagen, Corfu and Essen that the associated states can become members of the European Union if they so desire and as soon as they are able to fulfil the necessary conditions.  We recognise however that the issues raised by enlargement to the East are significantly different to those raised by previous enlargements both because of the nature of the challenge facing the associated States and the changes which the Union itself will have to undergo in order to maintain the process of European integration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be important to ensure that future enlargement does not compromise the essential interests and effectiveness of the Union or in any way <Col N="1340" /> dilute or threaten its achievements over so many policy areas of vital importance to its member states.  We are committed to maintaining the character of the Union as enlargement proceeds and to economic and social cohesion within the EU.</P>
    <P>Because of the importance of these issues for Ireland we have had in place for some time an interdepartmental committee chaired by my Department which is mandated, <i>inter alia,</i> to monitor on an on-going basis the position in regard to EU relations with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and to analyse relevant papers and positions advanced by the EC institutions and other bodies, from the standpoint of their implications for Ireland.  In this context, I might mention the particular value of the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on EU enlargement, published last Autumn. The interdepartmental committee is also charged with quantifying the impact of Ireland, notably as regards the EU budget, the Structural Funds and the CAP, of enlargement to include the associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>The work of this interdepartmental committee contributed to Ireland's active participation in the negotiation and drafting of the pre-accession strategy agreed at the European Council in Essen last December.  It will also be a useful forum for in-depth consideration of future studies by the Commission, as requested in Essen, on the effects of enlargement on the Union's current policies and their future development.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, consideration is on-going regarding the impact of future enlargement of the Structural Funds and other Union policies.  As the Deputy is aware, the Edinburgh European Council adopted the budgetary framework for the Union's finances up to 1999 and the amounts earmarked for structural funds are fully committed for that period.  Analysis of the situation after 1999 can have at this stage an indicative character only, given the many uncertainties associated with this <Col N="1341" /> process.  These include: the rate of development and potential of the economies concerned, the length of time before their accession and the impossibility of forecasting at this remove the level of funding likely to be available for Structural Funds after 1999.</P>
    <P>The policy implications of Eastern enlargement are, of course, also being assessed in the context of preparation for the Government White Paper on foreign policy and our preparations for the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.</P>

      <P>The Irish Sailors' and Soldiers' Land Trust was established in 1922-23 to provide houses for Irish exservicemen who fought in the First World War.  The trust is made up of five members, one of whom is appointed by the Taoiseach.  The others are appointed by the British Government.  Lord Killanin has been the Taoiseach's nominee since 1955.</P>
      <P>The number of beneficiaries both in the State and in Northern Ireland has been declining.  The Irish and British Governments agreed in 1986 to proposals from the trust for the repayment of funds, in proportions based on the original contributions of the two Governments.  Legislation in Ireland and in Britain gave effect to the agreement reached.</P>
      <P>The main provision of the Irish Sailors' and Soldiers' Land Trust Act, 1988, allows for the acceptance and disposal of any money payable to the Irish Government by the trust.  The Act stipulates that such money shall be disposed of &ldquo;for the purposes of such projects or undertakings (including the Royal National Lifeboat Institution) involving co-operation between the State and Northern Ireland or the State and Great Britain or relating to the island of Ireland as a whole as the Taoiseach may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, determine&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A total of £2.650 million has been received from the trust &mdash; £2.354 million in 1988 and £295,000 in mid-November, 1992.  All but £50 of this has been allocated and spent.</P>
      <P>It cannot be stated at this point when the trust will be winding up.  There are legal issues being considered by the trust with regard to indemnification on dissolution.  If the trust is wound up, a further allocation of money will be made to the Irish Exchequer.  The amount that would be available is not yet known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applications for funding, including that from the John F. Kennedy Trust, will be considered on the basis that they qualify under the criteria laid down in <Col N="1343" /> the Sailors' and Soldiers' Trust legislation.</P>

      <P>A charge to probate tax arises where the taxable value of an estate exceeds £10,000 (index-linked).  The tax is charged at the rate of 2 per cent.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that in the case in question, the deceased bequeathed her house to her son subject to a right of residence in favour of his brother and sister.  As the son did not qualify as either a dependent child or a dependent relative, the relief provided for these categories was not available.  However, if the taxpayer wishes to contact the Revenue Commissioners with full details of his financial circumstances, the case will be reviewed in the light of the hardship provisions which are contained in the probate tax legislation.</P>

      <P>Confined competitions are held by the Civil Service Commissioners from time to time for the appointment of those in unestablished positions in certain grades to established positions.  Such competitions are in addition to the various open competitions held for recruitment to the Civil Service in an established capacity.  The most recent confined establishment competition announced in 1994 admitted services officers, formerly messengers, and a number of other grades some of whom were not previously covered by such a competition. The candidates were required to have two years continuous service in <Col N="1350" /> one or more of the grades and three years continuous service in the Civil Service.  At the preceding confined competition announced in 1990 and limited to messengers candidates required two years service in the grade in order to be eligible to compete although they required three years service before being eligible for appointment in an established capacity.  In line with standard practice the unions representing the staff concerned were consulted and agreed with the arrangements for these competitions, including the eligibility requirements.  In respect of the grades eligible at the most recent confined competition the latest figures available show that at 30 September 1994 there were a total of 175 officers serving in established positions and 577 officers serving in unestablished positions.  It is envisaged that all candidates qualified in all relevant respects by the Civil Service Commissioners for establishment from the most recent competition will be offered established appointments.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the competitive disadvantage which greyhound food manufacturers suffer in this country due to the 21 per cent VAT rate here as compared to zero per cent VAT in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom; if his attention has further been drawn to the threat to employment in the industry; and if he will review the matter in the context of the forthcoming budget.</Quest>

      <P>I can confirm that I have received representations from greyhound food manufacturers here regarding their concerns at a recent reinterpretation of a long-standing, specific provision in the UK VAT code which has resulted in the zero rating of greyhound food in that jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Current Irish VAT law is not open to interpretation in a way which would allow for a similar rating of greyhound <Col N="1351" /> food in this country.  Any action to change our law in that regard could be open to challenge in the European Court of Justice on the grounds that it would be in breach of EU VAT law which prohibits the introduction of new zero rates.</P>
    <P>The allegations about competitive distortions should be viewed in context. Since the normal rules for controlling intra-Community trade apply in this instance, the scope for distortion should be limited.  In the first place, UK-manufactured greyhound food sold here continues to be liable to the standard rate of VAT.  If UK-based manufacturers sell to customers here directly from the UK, they will be required to register for VAT in the State if their sales to unregistered persons exceed £27,000 in any 12 month period.  While unregistered greyhound breeders are free to travel to Northern Ireland to buy feeding stuffs there for their own animals, it is difficult to see how this would be a viable option for many breeders.</P>
    <P>Finally, as VAT-registered greyhound breeders are entitled to recover their VAT inputs in full, there should be no incentive for them to change their supplies of food to UK manufacturers.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I am mindful of the particular concerns expressed by the industry and, in that context, the Revenue Commissioners have been asked to ensure that the various administrative and legislative procedures outlined above are operating satisfactorily in relation to greyhound feeds.</P>

      <P>The basis for valuation is the net annual value (NAV) i.e. the rental value of a property.  Rental values are a function of market forces and reflect changes in the market.  The Valuation Acts envisaged that there would be revaluations at 14 year intervals to maintain uniformity and equity, and to ensure that the valuation base would conform with market realities. However, such regular revaluations were not carried out, and the last revaluation of Dublin city was completed in 1915.  Over time the effects of inflation, the property dynamics of a developing city and changing rental <Col N="1353" /> values made it impossible to apply the NAV as required by the Acts.  Consequently, the rateable valuation base lost its relationship with market rental values.  However, the 1986 Valuation Act reaffirmed the NAV basis for assessing rateable valuations.  This return to rental values would clearly have the effect of a significant redistribution of the rateable valuation base within and between different property categories.  Broadly speaking this redistribution reflected the relative decline in office rentals in the city area, and the growth and development of the retail sector in the suburbs largely outside the city.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, factors other than the valuation process, can have an effect on the effective valuation base.  These include the development and decline of parts of the city, outflows of development to adjoining areas in Dublin County, and the rates remission incentive in the urban renewal areas.  The latter has been very successful in Dublin City, and most commercial developments in the city have concentrated in these areas.  However, such developments are exempt from paying rates for ten years.</P>
      <P>The valuation base is inherently affected by the dynamics of the property market and the other factors referred to.  This basic principle applies to all local authorities, and not just to Dublin Corporation.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the United States domestic legislation non-resident aliens are now liable to tax on social security payments at a rate of 30 per cent on 85 per cent of the social security payments, i.e. 25.5 per cent overall.  Prior to 1 January, 1995 the rate was 30 per cent on one-half of the payment, i.e. 15 per cent overall.  The increase is a result of changes in the United States Internal Revenue law.</P>
      <P>The existing double taxation convention between Ireland and the United States, which is in existence for over 40 years, does not contain any specific provisions relating to the taxation of social security payments.  Italy, Germany and the UK are the only EU countries which have double taxation conventions with the US which include a provision exempting US social security payments from tax in the US.  The effect of the provision is to transfer the taxing rights over these payments to the country of residence of the recipient. The conventions do not exempt the payments from tax in these countries.  Tax would be payable at the normal rates in the countries in question.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on a new convention between Ireland and the United States which had been ongoing during the 1980s were suspended in 1990.

      <P>It is assumed that, in addition to farm machinery imported from non-EU countries, the Deputy would also wish to know the position relating to machinery purchased from other EU member states.</P>
      <P>No special arrangements exist for the importation from outside the EU of new and second-hand farm machinery.  The normal customs procedures apply, with customs duty of between 2.8 per cent and 6.8 per cent, depending on the type of farm machinery involved, and VAT at 21 per cent being chargeable at point of entry.</P>
      <P>When farm machinery is sourced in other member states, the issue of EU customs duty does not, of course, arise. In the case of purchases of farm machinery by VAT-registered persons in the State from VAT-registered persons in other EU member states, the purchaser is required to account for VAT in the State at 21 per cent under the postponed accounting system for intra-Community acquisitions.  VAT is not chargeable in the member state of origin of the goods.</P>
      <P>Where unregistered persons in the State purchase farm machinery from VAT-registered persons in other member states, VAT is chargeable in the member state of purchase at the appropriate rate.  However, it should be noted that unregistered farmers who acquire farm machinery or other goods from other EU countries in excess of £32,000 per annum are obliged to register and account for Irish VAT at 21 per cent in respect of these acquisitions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The VAT rules outlined above apply generally to purchases made in other member states of farm machinery whether new or second-hand.  However, <Col N="1357" /> in the case of second-hand machinery, transactions between member states may occasionally, for example, depending on the VAT status of the vendor, result in a different tax arrangement. For this reason, it is advisable that persons intending to purchase second-hand machinery in another member state should first check the position with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>I have no proposals at this time to introduce any changes to the controls which currently exist in relation to the sale of paracetamol.</P>
      <P>The current situation is that paracetamol tablets may be sold through non-pharmacy outlets in packs containing not more than 25 tablets or through pharmacies in packs not exceeding 50 tablets.  Quantities in excess of this may only be supplied if prescribed by the registered medical practitioner.</P>
      <P>In the light of recent concerns relating to the consequences arising from overdoses of paracetamol, the National Drugs Advisory Board has been requested to re-examine the availability of paracetamol and whether any changes to the existing controls are considered necessary.</P>

    <P>Should the board recommend any changes in the existing control, it would <Col N="1359" /> obviously be necessary in implementing any such changes to balance the requirement of ensuring public health and safety with the need to avoid the creation of unnecessary or undue hardship.</P>

        <i>Limerick-East</i>
        <b>):</b> While neither I nor my predecessor have met formally with representatives of St. Michael's House, officials from my Department meet on a regular basis with St. Michael's House and other service providers to discuss issues relating to the provision of services for persons with a mental handicap, including the need for the further development of day services.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware substantial additional funding has been made available in recent years for the development of mental handicap services.  In allocating these resources, particular attention was paid to the provision of additional day care places.</P>
      <P>In 1993 an additional £0.300 million was provided for day care services in the Eastern Health Board region.  Of the additional 65 places which were provided 16 were allocated to St. Michael's House at an annual cost of £70,000.</P>
      <P>In 1994 an additional £1.15 million was provided for day care services in the region.  Of the 230 additional places provided, 52 were allocated to St. Michael's House at an annual cost of £260,000.  In both years the number of day places allocated to St. Michael's House was the highest number allocated to any agency in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1360" /> In recent months following representations from the parents of a number of former St. Michael's House trainees, the Eastern Health Board have, at the request of my Department, been actively working to place some, if not all, of those young adults within existing day services.</P>
    <P>As was the case in recent years, any additional funding which may be made available in 1995 for the further development of services for persons with mental handicap will be allocated by me to the various regions.  The precise services to be provided in each region will then be agreed by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating/central planning committees, within the guidelines issued by my Department and subject to approval by me.</P>
    <P>Consequently the provision of additional services and the people to benefit from those services are a matter, in the first instance, for the Eastern Health Board's Mental Handicap Central Planning Committee on which St. Michael's House is represented.  The committee's proposals will take account of the identified priority needs for the region.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>
        <b>):</b> The long-term illness scheme entitles persons who suffer from certain specified illnesses to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of these particular illnesses. The original aim of the scheme was to ensure that persons with a long <Col N="1366" /> term disabilty or disease which is treatable by drug therapy would not have to suffer expense in order to obtain their required drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>The needs of people with significant or ongoing medical expenses are now being met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of on-going expenditure on medical expenses (general practitioner fees, prescribed drugs etc.) due to a long term medical condition such as renal failure, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  In some cases a medical card may issue to a family member on a personal basis. Eligibility for a medical care is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
      <P>Persons who suffer from an on-going medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for people who do not have a medical card or long term illness book and are certified as having a long term medical condition with a regular and on-going requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of an amount per month, currently £32.  Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
      <P>Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of drug schemes to those with medical expenses arising from conditions such as renal failure.  Accordingly, I have no plans to extend the number or range of illnesses currently covered by the long-term illness scheme.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>
        <b>):</b> Ministerial appointments to the Medical Council are made under section 9 (1) of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978.  This provides for one person to be appointed by the Minister after consultation with body/bodies representing psychiatry, one person to be appointed by the Minister after consultation with body/bodies representing general medical practice, and four persons to be appointed by the Minister, at least three of whom shall not be registered general practitioners and shall represent the general public.</P>
      <P>The Second Schedule of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, provides that in the event of a casual vacancy arising from among the members, other than those appointed by election, the appointing authority is to fill the vacancy. The appointment to which the Deputy refers was made on foot of a casual vacancy arising from among the ministerial appointees to the Council. The filling of this vacancy on 14 November was, therefore, at the discretion of the Minister.  I am satisfied that this appointment complied fully with the procedures set out in the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978.</P>

      <P>Since 15 December 1994 two un-established civil servants have been appointed to my Department as follows: Mr. Richard Humphreys, special adviser and Ms Margaret Dowling, personal assistant.</P>
      <P>The special adviser advises the Minister on specialised legal research on the law reform and equality legislation programme of the Department and in connection with the progression of legislative work within the Department, and generally.  He also maintains contact with special advisers in other Ministers' offices with a view to maintaining a co-ordinated approach to Government policy, as well as liaising, on an ongoing basis, between the Minister and officials of the Department.  The salary of the special adviser is £34,564 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The personal assistant provides secretarial assistance to the Minister in relation to his personal correspondence/constituency matters such as queries originating at his clinics or otherwise, and representations on <Col N="1371" /> behalf of constituents.  The salary of the personal assistant is £18,583 per annum.</P>
    <P>Both the special adviser and the personal assistant are employed under exclusion order, in accordance with the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956. Their appointments will end on the date on which the Minister for Equality and Law Reform ceases to hold office.</P>
    <P>I propose to appoint Ms Anne Kinsella as partnership programme manager with effect from 1 February 1995. The contract, setting out the salary and other conditions of employment attaching to the appointment, are being settled with the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>The Maternity Protection Act, 1994, imposes no obligation on employers to provide paid maternity leave.  Payment arrangements in relation to maternity leave, in line with obligations arising from the Pregnant Workers Directive, are provided through the maternity benefit scheme <Col N="1372" /> which is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare. There is no legal provision for paid paternity leave.  The special leave arrangements for fathers provided for in the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, is targeted at fathers where the newly born child's mother dies within 14 weeks of the birth.</P>
      <P>My Department is producing an explanatory booklet on leave entitlements and other employment rights aspects of maternity protection legislation which will be available free of charge to the general public including employees and their representatives and employers.  Given its existing services to employers and employees, I am considering a role for the Employment Equality Agency to provide an information service on the legislation.  This function is currently undertaken in my Department.</P>

    <P>A total of 7,365 gun-days were allocated to shoot promoters for the 1993-94 season.  This includes all types of hunting, i.e. summer pigeon (over grain/crops etc.) estate driven shoots of mainly pen-reared birds (pheasant and duck) and rough shooting (other game species).</P>
    <P>Maps are requested to assist in identifying lands to enable the gun-day carrying capacity of the lands to be assessed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS).  However, in most cases such lands are well known and established or are covered by Coillte leases which are usually sufficient also to identify lands.  I will look further into this matter when I have had time to consider the issues more fully.</P>
    <P>Based on the controls operated and bag checks conducted by the NPWS Rangers.  I am satisfied that current levels of commercial shooting do not adversely impact on the conservation status of huntable species.</P>

      <P>I understand that an area of 21.18 hectares of sand dune was purchased in May 1994, being part of the lands on Inish and Ballyteigue Slob and Cull, County Wexford. For understandable commercial reasons it is not the practice to divulge financial details relating to individual contracts.</P>
      <P>The purchase was undertaken to conserve the sand dune which is of ecological importance and was under threat from intensive farming.  Sand dunes are a priority habitat under the EC Habitats Directive which obliges us to protect such habitats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention to maintain the site <Col N="1376" /> as a grazed grassland.  There are no grazing rights registered against the property.  The previous owner was the only person entitled to graze the lands and an agreement is being entered into with him which will allow grazing at a desirable level.  I understand that no right of access was conveyed to the State with the lands, as access is possible from adjoining State owned lands.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any discontent on the part of local farmers regarding access to these lands.  There has, however, been a dispute with a local racehorse trainer who breached an agreement regarding access to the extended nature reserve area for the purposes of galloping horses.  The Circuit Court granted an order restraining his activities in this regard.  Two other horse trainers have been refused access for the purpose of galloping horses on this ecologically sensitive site.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the dangers to pedestrians and motorists using Shaw Bridge.  As this bridge is located on a regional road, responsibility for its maintenance and improvement is a matter for Kildare County Council using its own resources, supplemented by the annual discretionary grant allocated to the council.  I will notify the council of its 1995 grant allocation as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>It was open to the council to apply for funding for Shaw Bridge in 1995 under the EU co-financed scheme of specific improvement grants for non-national roads, having regard to the conditions governing the scheme and the level of commitment arising in respect of council projects approved in 1994.  In the event, no such application was submitted to my Department.</P>
      <P>In view of the estimated cost of widening the bridge, £800,000 and the other demands on the resources available to the county council for roads, my Department asked the council in November 1994 to consider the feasibility of providing a pedestrian bridge, at an estimated cost of £100,000-£150,000, as an alternative means of overcoming the hazards for pedestrians and motorists at this location.  I understand that the council is investigating this option.</P>

    <P>Further grants totalling respectively £10.222 million, £7.985 million, £8.068 million, £6.661 million and £10.56 million in respect of the year 1990-'94 were paid to urban authorities for non-national roads in their areas.  It was a matter for those authorities to determine the manner in which grants were expended; the bulk of the funds would, however, have been expended on urban roads, with more limited amounts applied to regional roads.</P>

      <P>This appeal relates to an issue which was raised in March 1991 by the union representing the officer concerned with the local authority and agreement was reached between the parties and implemented by the local authority to the satisfaction of the union.  Subsequently, in August 1993; an appeal which relates to an aspect of the issue which was not pursued by the union was received.  While this has not been formally determined, the issues involved have been the subject of ongoing correspondence between the local authority, the Department and the appellant.  A copy of the most recent observations on the case received by the Department from the local authority has been sent to the appellant for any further comments he may wish to make before a final decision is taken on the appeal.</P>

      <P>The legislative measures which have been adopted to give effect to the Battery Directive in Ireland are (a) the European Communities (Dangerous Substances and Preparations) (Marketing and Use) Regulations, 1994, made by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment on 6 April 1994: these prohibit the marketing of certain alkaline manganese batteries which contain mercury above specified levels; and (b) the European Communities (Batteries and Accumulators) Regulations, 1994, made by the Minister for the Environment on 17 August 1994: these require manufacturers to ensure that batteries and accumulators can be easily removed from appliances other than certain exempted appliances; they also require the marking of batteries and accumulators (and where appropriate the appliances into which they are incorporated) with indications as to heavy metal content, recyclability and separate collection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The waste Bill, which I will introduce as soon as possible, will provide a basis for such measures, for example deposit <Col N="1388" /> and refund systems, which may be desirable to support implementation of the Directive.</P>
    <P>My Department is at present in discussion with the Irish battery industry with a view to finalising at an early date a programme for separate collection of batteries for recycling or disposal.  The batteries which require separate collection under the Directive are mainly lead acid batteries, of the type generally used in mechanically propelled vehicles, and rechargeable sealed nickel cadmium batteries generally used in domestic appliances.  The information available indicates that the vast majority of spent lead acid batteries, approximately 5,000 tonnes per annum, are already separately collected.  The quantities of sealed nickel cadmium batteries, rechargeables, arising are much smaller, estimated at 400 tonnes per annum.</P>

      <P>Information, based on returns made by the local authorities, on the number of their houses without bathroom facilities at 31 December 1994, is set out in the following table.  I understand that, in the case of about 700 of the dwellings involved, the tenants have indicated that they do not wish at this stage to have a bathroom/shower installed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The management, maintenance and <Col N="1390" /> improvement of their rented dwellings, including the provision of bathroom facilities, are the responsibility of local authorities.  To assist authorities in providing bathrooms/showers in their dwellings which lack them, funding is provided under the bathrooms sub-programme operated by my Department. In addition, bathrooms can be provided as part of refurbishment projects under my Department's remedial works scheme.  The allocations already made under these schemes total over £128 million of which £10.5 million was provided solely for bathrooms.  The allocations for the current year will be made to local authorities as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have a legal obligation to provide bathroom facilities in their rented dwellings by 1 January 1998.  I am satisfied that, with the financial assistance available from my Department, authorities should be capable of complying with this deadline.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>It is my understanding that the concerns expressed by the boy's parents arose initially during November last year, when the school project in question had to be closed as a result of serious damage caused by a fire at the premises.</P>
      <P>I understand that further difficulties subsequently arose when the child's class teacher was absent on sick leave and the project encountered difficulty in securing the services of a substitute teacher.</P>
      <P>I readily appreciate the concerns of the boy's parents at his absence from school during the periods in question. However, it will be appreciated that the circumstances surrounding these events were outside the control of the project.</P>
      <P>I understand that the difficulties which the project encountered over the period in question have now been explained to the boy's parents and the boy has resumed his place at the project with effect from 18 January 1995.</P>

      <P>The current position is that a design submission for the proposed extension was furnished to my Department last month.  This material is currently under examination with the technical staff in the Building Unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On completion, my Department will <Col N="1395" /> contact the school to arrange a discussion meeting in this regard before proceeding to the next stage.</P>
    <P>The De La Salle College is one of seven post-primary schools in Dundalk. The school has a current enrolment of 713 pupils.  I am aware that in the short term the demand for places in the De La Salle may exceed the number of places available there.</P>
    <P>My Department's main responsibility however in the matter of the provision of school accommodation is to ensure that in any multi-school centre there are sufficient places, overall, to meet the demand.</P>
    <P>My Department is satisfied that with the provision of the current approved accommodation for De La Salle College and other post-primary schools in Dundalk, the centre will have sufficient accommodation to meet the future needs.  The situation will be kept under review by my Department and any application for temporary accommodation to meet short term requirments will be given careful and sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <P>My Department has received the submission in question.  As a result of a preliminary investigation of the matter, there are grounds for believing that there may be a breach of the terms of Circular M51/93 on the part of the second level college.  In accordance with the provisions of the circular, the monitoring committee for the sector considered the case with a view to resolving the difficulty following consultation, where necessary, with the school trustees.

    <P>In 1990 a grant of £100,000 was allocated to the IABA for major development works at the National Boxing Stadium in Dublin under the major facilities scheme operated by my Department.  A further grant of £150,000 was allocated in June, 1994, towards the cost of refurbishing the gymnasium.  A total of £28,386.68 from the grant of £150,000 was paid in December, 1994 in respect of certified construction work and professional fees.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply of 13 October 1994.  The White Paper will elaborate in detail on the powers, functions and responsibilities of proposed statutory intermediate structures. My intention, subject to final decisions at Government level, is that the structures will have substantial co-ordination and support service functions, broadly along the lines proposed in the position paper on RECs, but informed by the subsequent roundtable discussions.</P>
      <P>In the position paper on RECs, it was recognised that specific arrangements would be necessary in relation to the ownership-trusteeship of Vocational Education Committee (VEC) schools. Following the discussions between the partners in education and generally perceived concern for the complexity of the transition process as it affected the vocational education committees, I have come to the view that Vocational Education Committees would continue to function as statutorily-based providers of education within the framework established nationally by the Minister for Education and regionally by the new intermediate structures.  Vocational education committees would have the same relationship with the RECs as the other providers of education, within their remit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this framework, the vocational education committees would continue to own their schools and employ the staff in their schools.  The intention <Col N="1400" /> would be that all vocational education committee schools will have boards of management and the vocational education committees will appoint these boards, having regard to the criteria applying to all other schools.</P>
    <P>I also envisage that the vocational education committees would continue with their role in the provision of vocational education and training and adult and continuing education in their schools.  Other providers will also be free to have a role in the provision of these activities.  The new structures would act as the co-ordinating bodies in regard to these areas through their role as the channel for the delivery of Exchequer funding.</P>
    <P>The role I envisage for vocational education committees would also ensure a smooth transition into the new system.  The White Paper will set out in detail the transitional arrangements to the new structures.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the implementation of the provisions of the School Attendance Act rests with the gardaí and is therefore a matter for the Minister for Justice.  The Minister of State at the Departments of Education, Health and Justice has been given special responsibility for truancy and a task force has been set up to co-ordinate action in this area, including the enactment of legislation, if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following receipt of a request from the school my Department approved of the provision of static guard security at the school during school hours on a <Col N="1401" /> temporary basis.  More recently, officials met with the secretary of the board of management who expressed satisfaction with the new security arrangements. Because of its location in a disadvantaged area, the school in question has been allocated two additional teacher posts in addition to its normal teacher allocation.  In September, 1994 my Department invited this school to participate in the home school liaison scheme 1994-95, and for this purpose additional teacher resources were also sanctioned.  The 1995 budget for this school is being formulated at present and its allocation will be finalised having regard to the special needs of the school and the amount of available resources.</P>

      <P>In 1993, my Department purchased land at Beech Park, Dublin 15, as a site for a new second level school.  It was decided in 1985 to allow St. Brigid's GAA Club to use the site on a temporary basis pending construction of the school.  This was never intended to be a long term arrangement and the position was again made clear to the GAA Club in 1988 when they <Col N="1404" /> sought a ten year lease which was refused.</P>
      <P>The Beech Park land is now considered inadequate and an unsatisfactory location for the new school.  The vocational education committee has therefore, identified an alternative location for the new school in the Diswellstown area which, following careful consideration of all circumstances, they have been authorised to acquire.  The terms negotiated with the owner include the exchange of the Beech Park land for the new site.</P>
      <P>The vocational education committee are currently in the process of completing the arrangements for the exchange and the new school is expected to commence shortly.  In the circumstances, therefore, I am not in a position at this stage to alter the decision to dispose of the Beech Park site.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 and 172 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the concerns regarding security which have been expressed by the authorities of the schools in question. A pilot security project was introduced by my Department in the 1993-94 <Col N="1405" /> school year and recently extended further to the 1994-95 school year, in an attempt to combat an exceptionally high level of vandalism of certain schools in the east Finglas area.</P>
    <P>The question of introducing similar projects in other areas must await the outcome of an evaluation of the east Finglas project on its completion at the end of the current school year.  The schools to which the Deputy refers are included in the disadvantaged areas scheme and as such have been allocated additional teaching posts and supplementary capitation funding at a rate of £17 per pupil.  The schools are also included in the home-school-community liaison scheme and share the services of a co-ordinator attached to the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I initiated the early start pre-school programme in eight locations in 1994.  The areas in question were selected because of their high levels of disadvantage.  I intend to extend the pre-school programme in the current year through the development of a further 25 pre-schools and the needs of the schools mentioned by the Deputy will be fully considered in the context of this development.</P>

      <P>The guidelines for waiting times are agreed between my Department and Bus Éireann, which manages and operates the school transport scheme as the agent of the Department. Bus Éireann makes the detailed operational arrangements on the ground, and plans routes in such a way as to ensure that most primary school children will have no more than one and a half hours' waiting and travelling time daily.  In the case of post-primary services, routes are planned, in conjunction with the transport liaison officer, so as to ensure as far as possible that no pupil will have more than three hours' travelling and waiting time daily.</P>

    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the general maximum class size guidelines for ordinary schools were improved by two units for the 1994-95 school year.  The current maximum class size guidelines are: Single Grade Class Group, 37; Class Group with two Consecutive Grades, 35; Multi-grade Class Group, 33.  A maximum class size of 29 now applies for all schools classified as disadvantaged.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 179 and 180 together.</P>
      <P>Scoil Phaipín Naofa was established with provisional recognition from my Department in September 1993.  Shortly after the beginning of the current school year a serious dispute arose, which culminated in the majority of the pupils in the school being withdrawn by their parents. The Patron also withdrew his patronage of the school.  This was followed in October 1994 by an application for a new Gaelscoil in Ballymun to cater for those pupils who had been withdrawn from Scoil Phaipín Naofa.  It became clear at this stage that under no circumstances would the pupils in question return to Scoil Phaipín.</P>
      <P>Following a detailed consideration of this unique situation, and in the interests of continuity of education for the children involved, temporary recognition was granted to Gaelscoil Bhaile Munna on 16 November 1994.  The school commenced with an enrolment of 26 pupils and met the requirements with regard to patronage and the provision of temporary accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1418" /> As enrolment at Scoil Phaipín Naofa had fallen to only eight pupils, the question of the continuance of grants to the school had to be considered particularly in the light of the availability of other all-Irish Schools in the general area. Following full consideration of all the circumstances, it was decided to withdraw grants from the school with effect from 31 August 1995.  The school will continue to receive grant-aid from the Department up to that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department operates a number of measures in order to alleviate hardship arising from the payment of examination entry fees.  Possession by a parent or guardian of a medical card is not in itself a guarantee of alleviation except where candidates remain at school to repeat the Leaving Certificate examination.  In such circumstances, the course fee of £100 is waived and the examination entry fee is reduced from £120 to a maximum of £44, (the ordinary Leaving Certificate fee payable by first-time candidates).</P>
      <P>In the case of necessitous pupils, the ordinary fee payable may also be reduced at the discretion of the school principal and subject to a maximum notified to each school or Vocational Education Committee by my Department. My Department has made £400,000 available to schools and Vocational Education Committees for this purpose in connection with the 1995 examinations.  This amount is greater than the amount allocated in 1994 by 1.5 per cent, the estimated increase in candidature.  There has been no increase in the rates of examination entry fees since 1994.</P>
      <P>The amount allocated to each school or committee in respect of 1995 fees has been based on the results of a questionnaire on hardship issued to schools in 1994.  Allocations have been increased or reduced, taking into account the particular circumstances in each school.</P>
      <P>School authorities are advised that, for the purposes of fee alleviation, a necessitous pupil may be defined as a child from a home where genuine hardship exists because of: unemployment; prolonged illness of parent; large family with inadequate means; single parent; more than one child from the same family doing the certificate examinations and other circumstances that would connote a similar degree of domestic financial hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add that examination entry <Col N="1421" /> fees cover only part of the cost of running the certificate examinations.  It is expected that about £6 million in fees will be collected in respect of the 1995 examinations but the cost of running the examinations will come to about £13 million.</P>

Grants towards the general running costs of schools were increased in 1994. In addition, schools which are officially designated as disadvantaged were, for the first time, given extra grants.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals for the introduction of additional materials grants for disadvantaged schools.</P>

      <P>Second level pupils with specific learning difficulties are normally integrated into ordinary classes. In such situations they may receive additional tutorial support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teachers.  Depending on the <Col N="1422" /> degree of the condition, they may also be eligible for special arrangements in the certificate examinations.</P>
      <P>Special arrangements in the certificate examinations will be approved where my Department is satisfied that:</P>

      <P>(b)  the candidate has a specific difficulty in reading, writing or spelling which is of such a degree that the candidate would be impaired in reading the questions or in writing the answers or is such that a regular examiner would have difficulty in deciphering the candidate's handwriting.</P>

    <P>Subsequently, Bus Éireann reported that the childrens' home is in fact 9 miles from the school to which they are seeking free transport.  It is stated that <Col N="1426" /> the children were being driven to the house of their aunt to join the service to that school.</P>
    <P>One of the children involved is eligible for free transport to the nearest national school, which is 2.4 miles from their own home.  The second child reached 10 years of age on 5 April, 1994, and may be given a concessionary fare-paying facility.  Service to this school passes the family home and there is accommodation available on it.</P>
    <P>The parent was advised of the situation and the tickets to the more distant school were withdrawn.</P>

      <P>The annual statutory financial statement of the vocational education committee (V15) submitted by Westmeath vocational education committee for 1993 showed a deficit of £450,000.  This figure was provided in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 4 on 31 May, 1994.  I pointed out that this was an unaudited figure and that following the audit of the accounts the balance of cash assets and liabilities in the audited accounts could be different from those shown on the financial statement initially submitted by the committee. Until the audit report on the 1993 finances of the committee has been completed by the Local Government auditor and submitted to the Department it is not possible to state the exact level of deficit at the end of 1993.</P>

      <P>The Westmeath vocational education committee was advised on August 1994 that it was no longer possible to continue to support the Athlone School Industry Links Programme from funds allocated for PETRA activities.  The vocational education committee was also advised that steps were being taken to ensure that no additional commitments are entered into which would involve direct Exchequer funding for PETRA activities beyond 31 December 1994.</P>
      <P>In response to a submission from the vocational education committee in respect of expenditure already incurred on the programme, it was decided in December 1994 to make a sum of £12,000 available in 1994 as an exceptional measure.  All correspondence in this matter was with the Acting Chief Executive Officer.</P>
      <P>The PETRA Programme came to an end on 31st December, 1994 and in future related activities in the area of initial vocational education and training will come within the ambit of the new EU programme on vocational education and training known as LEONARDO. This programme was approved by the Council of Ministers for Social Affairs on 6 December, 1994.</P>

      <P>The position with regard to free movement of persons within the European Union is that discussions with our European partners are continuing with a view to ensuring that appropriate compensatory measures are put in place.  The full implementation of free movement requires particular measures with regard to co-operation aimed at combating serious crime, drug trafficking and illegal immigration.</P>
      <P>A number of member states of the European Union are party to the Convention applying the Schengen Agreement which is primarily concerned with the abolition of checks of persons and goods at their common borders.  The Convention also contains extensive compensatory provisions in the areas of immigration controls at the external borders of the States party to the Convention and increased police and judicial co-operation.  Ireland is not party to the Convention and, of course, does not have a common border with any member state which is party thereto.  Any proposal to accede to the Convention would require detailed examination of the Convention having regard to the compensatory provisions mentioned above.  In particular, the implications of such a proposal for Ireland in the matter of free movement of persons between here and the United Kingdom would have to be considered also.</P>

I am informed by the Garda authorities that, while there has been no adjustment in Garda strengths arising from the ceasefires in the North, the changed security situation is being taken into account in ensuring that all available Garda manpower is being used to best advantage.</P>

      <Quest>if she will details of the Garda establishment in all Dublin northside stations compared with that which existed five years ago; her views on the recent crime survey which indicates crime levels are much higher on the northside; if official crime statistics support this view; and if so, the plans, if any, she has to deal with the problem.</Quest>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the total Garda strength in the Dublin North and North Central Divisions is 1,317.  This compares with 1,218 in 1990.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the crime survey carried out by the Trinity College Law and Psychology Departments.  However, the official figures provided in the Garda Commissioner's Annual Report for 1993 do not support the view that crime levels are higher on the northside of Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities report that they will continue to make every effort to ensure that crime is kept to a minimum in all areas of the country, including the northside of Dublin.  For my part, I am proceeding with the recruitment of 1,050 gardaí between now and the end of 1997.  Two hundred clerical civilian staff will also be recruited over the same period which will release an equivalent number of gardaí to perform police duties on the streets of our towns and cities.</P>
      <P>A major information technology plan for the gardaí will be implemented with a view to improving the efficiency of data processing in order to reduce Garda time spent on paper work, to increase crime detection rates by improving access to information and to provide an improved management information system.  This plan is now being finalised for implementation at a cost in excess of £26 million over the period 1994-1998.  Implementation of the plan will serve to release further gardaí for operational duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other measures which are underway to tackle crime include the introduction <Col N="1436" /> of CCTV in the Temple Bar and O'Connell Street areas of Dublin.  I also intend to expand the community-based projects, such as the KEY and GRAFT projects, which have been very successful in diverting young people away from crime.</P>

      <P>Officials of my Department have been in contact with Cork County Council regarding the renovation and refurbishing of Mallow Courthouse.  Sketch plans have been prepared and work is continuing on completion of this planning process.  Definitive costings are not yet available but the project is estimated to cost in excess of £0.5 million.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently finalising a programme of refurbishment works for 1995.  In formulating the programme, it is necessary, obviously, to take account of existing contractual commitments, available resources and the degree of urgency attaching to particular projects.  I am very conscious of the need to proceed with works at Mallow but am not in a position, at this point, to be specific as to the progress that can be made in 1995.</P>
      <P>The proposed refurbishment works will not have any staffing implications but as in all the major courthouse refurbishment projects provision is being made for the possible expansion of staff numbers in the future.  There are no proposals to increase the number of staff in Mallow at this stage.</P>

      <P>In 1991, the Department of Finance issued guidelines for the appointment of full-time cleaners to bring such appointments into line with current practice for the rest of the Civil Service.  The procedures to be implemented involved the holding of competitive interviews for all cleaners on a relief panel, if such existed.  Otherwise, a list of suitable people could be obtained from FÁS, and these, as well as those who personally applied, would be interviewed.</P>
      <P>The relief panel in operation in Garda Headquarters consists of 12 cleaners, who were employed from time to time to fill temporary vacancies created by annual leave and/or sick leave.  Since the introduction of the new appointment procedures, 11 of the present complement of 36 full-time cleaners at Garda Headquarters have been appointed by competitive interview. Interview boards are not obliged to select candidates with the longest service.</P>
      <P>The most recent vacancy for a full-time cleaner in Garda Headquarters was filled following interviews of the relief panel in February 1994.  The person detailed by the Deputy was interviewed and was unsuccessful on that occasion.</P>

      <Col N="1443" /> There is no relief panel of cleaners operating for the Four Courts.

Interviews were held in August 1994 for full-time permanent cleaners in the Four Courts. I am informed that the person detailed did not go forward for interview on that occasion.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for unemployment assistance on 1 September 1994.  Her husband was also a claimant and each of them was entitled to receive unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £68.60 &mdash; that is, half the amount of the maximum rate of long term unemployment assistance payable to a person with an adult dependant and three dependent children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1447" /> When her husband commenced employment under a community employment programme on 12 September 1994 the claimant's individual entitlement was reviewed by a deciding officer.  The value of the benefit she derived from her husband's income became assessable under the Rules for the Calculation of Means contained in the Third Schedule to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993.  The deciding officer estimated the benefit derived from her husband's income at £60 per week.  Where an increase for an adult dependant is not payable the means assessment is halved and accordingly the maximum rate of unemployment assistance in her case, which is £78.70 (personal rate of £58.90 and half rate for her three dependent children amounting to £19.80), was reduced leaving her entitled to £48.70 per week.</P>
    <P>The decision of the deciding officer was conveyed in writing to the claimant. It is open to her to appeal this decision.</P>
    <P>On review it was found that the person concerned was not paid the longterm personal rate of unemployment assistance to which she was entitled.  As a consequence, she was underpaid £45.75 and these arrears have now been paid.  It is understood the person concerned commenced employment under the community employment programme in December last.</P>
    <P>The decision in this case was made in accordance with the terms of the 1993 Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act. The Minister has no function in determining her entitlements.</P>

      <P>Waiting days have been a feature of the disability benefit scheme since its inception and are a feature of similar social security schemes in many countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing provisions in relation to waiting days date from the Social Welfare Act, 1980, but related provisions were in place before that time.  The reason given for their introduction was the need to prevent some workers from benefiting in respect of unnecessarily frequent short absences from work.  In addition to this rationale, the waiting days rule should reduce the overlap <Col N="1449" /> between State and occupational schemes.</P>
    <P>I have no current national statistics available to me as to the numbers of employers who pay occupational sick pay.  However, the most recent national statistics available as to the number of employers who pay occupational sick pay come from a special survey by the ESRI in 1985 on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare.  At that time 44 per cent of the total surveyed workforce of 630,000 were covered by occupational sick schemes.  The surveyed workforce excluded agriculture, the construction sector and the non-commercial public sector.  Of those covered by schemes, 79 per cent were in schemes where benefit is payable from the first day of illness.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that people are not generally left without any financial support during those days.  Where a person has no recourse to occupational sick pay and no other income, Supplementary Welfare Allowance can be paid.</P>
    <P>However, I will arrange for a review of the operation of this feature of Disability Benefit to ensure that there is no hardship arising from it.</P>

      <P>The position has not changed since this question was last asked by the Deputy in November 1994. To qualify for the Old Age Contributory Pension, a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since it was introduced in 1961.  The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to the pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the Social Insurance Fund during the course of a person's career.  This condition applies to self employed persons in the same way as it applies to all insured people.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, self-employed people, including farmers, who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over would not qualify for Old Age Contributory Pension.  They are, of course, covered for Survivors' and Orphans Pensions.</P>
      <P>However self-employed people in that age group who had been insured as employed contributors for any period prior to age 56 could qualify for the Old Age Contributory Pension.  Such insurance can be combined with insurance as a self-employed contributor for old age pension purposes.</P>
      <P>Refunds of the old age pension element of the contribution may be made to those who entered insurance less than ten years before pension age and who fail to qualify for either Old Age Contributory or Non-Contributory Pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1451" /> Detailed consideration has been given by my Department to the possibility of providing for entitlement to the Old Age Contributory Pension to persons who entered insurance for the first time as self employed contributors less than 10 years before pension age.  In this regard costings made in 1989 estimated that the net cost of paying Old Age Contributory Pensions to all self employed contributors, including farmers, who were aged between 56 and 66 in April 1988 would amount to £756 million over the lifetime of the persons concerned.  The extra rate of contribution which would need to be paid by self employed contributors generally to finance such an extension would be 2.4 per cent over a 50 year period.  Allowing self employed persons to buy pension rights by paying the outstanding years contributions in order to qualify for an Old Age (Contributory) pension would also be very costly unless the payments made by the individual self employed contributors were calculated on an actuarial basis.  The cost to an individual contributor buying rights on this basis would be prohibitive.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board in its final report &ldquo;Developing the National Pension System&rdquo; puts forward, inter alia, a number of recommendations relating to eligibility for old age pensions. The report and its recommendations are being studied within my Department at present and I intend, in due course, to bring foward proposals on the issues addressed in the report.</P>

      <P>Unemployment Assistance is paid to unemployed people who have <Col N="1452" /> no entitlement to insurance based benefit. Payments are means-tested to ensure that those most in need receive the payment. Social welfare legislation provides for the assessment of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by an applicant for Unemployment Assistance such as the benefit of board and lodging in the family home.</P>
      <P>The assessment of free board and lodging has been a feature of the Unemployment Assistance scheme since its inception.  Its purpose is to achieve a degree of equity between applicants in different family circumstances e.g. between applicants whose parents are employed and those who are dependent on social welfare payments.  Otherwise, people living in affluent circumstances would become entitled to the same level of assistance as those whose circumstances are poor.</P>
      <P>Any person whose sole means are derived from the benefit of board and lodging in the parental home and is entitled to a payment of less than £10 has his/her weekly payment increased to £10.</P>
      <P>I am committed to improving the present system, where feasible, and having regard to budgetary constraints, in order to extend a greater degree of financial independence to young unemployed people living at home.</P>

      <P>Unemployment Assistance <Col N="1453" /> is subject to a means test and the earnings of a working spouse must be taken into account in determining entitlement. In assessing the means derived from the income of a working spouse, the first £45 is disregarded as well as travel costs. Where the weekly income of the spouse exceeds £60 no adult dependant increase is payable in respect of that spouse.  Depending on the amount of his spouse's income, therefore, a person may not qualify for assistance.</P>
      <P>To be eligible to participate in a community employment scheme, an unemployed person must either be over 21 and in receipt of Unemployment Assistance or in receipt of Unemployment Benefit for a minimum of one year.  The Community Employment Scheme is confined to what are considered to be the priority categories in terms of need. The question of changes in the criteria for access to the scheme is a matter for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  I propose to discuss with the Minister ways in which these criteria can be broadened.</P>

    <P>The Third Level Allowance Scheme <Col N="1454" /> was set up on a non-statutory basis in 1990.  Participants under the scheme receive an amount equivalent to their appropriate rate of Unemployment Benefit/Assistance while pursuing undergraduate studies at a third level institution in Ireland.  The conditions for participation are that a person must be aged 23 years or over and be unemployed and in receipt of an unemployment payment for at least 12 months.  In practice, however, persons who fulfil these criteria within a short time of commencing their studies are allowed to participate in the scheme.  Some 54 persons qualified on this basis in the 1994/95 academic year.  Corresponding figures for 1992/93 and 1993/94 are not available.</P>
    <P>Applications for the allowance are determined by a central section in my Department.  The number of applications approved and disallowed for each of the last three years are as follows:</P>

    <P>I understand that the Deputy has a particular case in mind.  The person concerned applied for participation in the Third Level Allowance Schemes for the academic year 1994-95 but although she had been unemployed for a lengthy period, she failed to qualify on age grounds.

      <P>Ireland's greatest natural tourism strength is our clean and green environment.  We have the lowest population density in Europe with large open spaces, uncrowded roads and areas of great scenic beauty.  This is a legacy of history and nature that I am determined to preserve.</P>
      <P>To this end the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999 which was launched last September acknowledges that a balance must be struck between development and conservation. All developments under the programme will be required to comply with the best environmental standards.</P>
      <P>One of the main instruments used to ensure the maintenance of environmental standards will be the planning process. Recent changes to planning law announced by my colleague the Minister for the Environment will enhance the transparency of compliance.  The planning process will also be used to ensure the application of EU Environment Impact Assessment Directives.</P>
      <P>In the execution of the programme, due account will be taken of the nature conservation objectives contained in the EU Directives on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild flora and fauna.  The programme will also take account of the commitments of the EU and member states to safeguarding species and avoiding or minimising any deterioration of important natural habitats intending for protection by the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats.</P>
      <P>We are not, nor do we wish to be, a mass tourism destination.  In planning for the further development of tourism, while priority will be given to developing new markets and products to improve the seasonal and geographic spread of tourism in Ireland, this will be done in a fashion that is fully sensitive to the need for compatibility with our environmental strengths.  Already Bord Fáilte actively markets eco-tourism under the banner of &ldquo;Ireland Naturally&rdquo; which is published in English, French, Dutch, German and Italian and is available in all our overseas markets.  This brochure covers wetlands, bogs, national parks, nature reserves, bird-watching, etc.  Also, ecology holidays into Ireland are being sold by an increasing number of overseas specialist agents who continue to recognise and market the reality of Ireland's clean environment and natural setting.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the payment of a Christmas bonus to participants on the community employment programme. A Christmas bonus is generally paid by the Department of Social Welfare to persons in receipt of long term social welfare payments.  Community employment is the principal manpower intervention aimed at persons who are long term unemployed and participants retain any secondary and other social welfare benefits to which they were entitled prior to participation. All participants on the programme were paid a Christmas bonus last year by FÁS.</P>

    <P>Teamwork, which is being phased out and replaced by Community Employment, was targeted at young people on <Col N="1460" /> the live register or who had been participating on YOUTHREACH.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 246, 262, 264, 265 and 266 together.</P>
      <P>The Operational Programme for the implementation of Leader II in Ireland has been submitted to the European Commission for approval.  In the meantime, with the assistance of independent consultants, I am evaluating the 48 business plans of applicant groups.  My intention is that Leader II should be available in all rural areas.  I hope to be in a position to announce the successful groups within six to eight weeks.</P>
      <P>As regards funding for Leader II, the position is that the European Commission originally allocated £37 million to Ireland.  This was supplemented by a further £17 million from the reserve of £64 million provided for the implementation of all the Community Initiatives in Ireland.  The £54 million will be topped up with a significant national Exchequer contribution still to be decided.  At the mid-term review I will be pressing for a further allocation for the programme from the reserve still retained by the Commission.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the commencement of the Leader II programme in Ireland and I am confident that we can build on the successes of the first programme not only in creating jobs in our rural areas but also in giving encouragement and support to rural people to help themselves.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to the drawing up of a national land use policy plan to provide guidelines for both national policy decisions and planning authorities in relation to the location of agricultural, industrial, forestry, aquaculture and tourism developments. Overall responsibility for the drawing up of the plan is a matter for the Minister for the Environment.

      <P>Lindane is the active ingredient in many insecticide products used worldwide in crop production. The market for lindane in Ireland is small and has declined as a result of new product introductions.  The main use here continues to be as a cereal seed dressing.</P>
      <P>The pesticide control service of my Department regularly analyses samples of domestic and imported produce for their pesticide residue content including lindane.  This programme shows that residues of lindane are found in samples of fruit and vegetables, cereals, meat and occasionally dairy products.  In general these residues are well below the maximum residue levels (MRLs) prescribed by the European Union.  MRLs are set at a level at which, even where they are occasionally exceeded, a hazard for humans will generally not occur unless this exposure arises from all relevant foods and is continued over a prolonged period.</P>
      <P>Over the years extensive toxicological research has been carried out on lindane by bodies such as the World Health Organisation, the European Union and the MAFF in Great Britain.  This year the EU starts a major review of existing pesticide chemicals.  Lindane has been included on the first review list.  The review should be available in 1996.</P>
      <P>It is clear, however that the current scientific evidence from international bodies responsible for such matters, shows that residues of lindane that occur in Irish food are well within toxicologically acceptable levels.</P>

      <P>Forty-five animals were taken by armed raiders from Abbotstown Farm in the early morning of 7 January 1995.  The animals had been seized and detained at a number of locations in Counties Cork, Monaghan and Roscommon and the potential market value of cattle of the type involved would be about £30,000.  Garda inquiries into this incident are continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1474" /> A review of the security arrangements in place was carried out immediately as a result of which we are looking to the introduction of a number of improvements in those arrangements, such as the installation of video cameras, panic buttons for security staff, the holding of the animals in separate categories and possibly, the use of Spike Island as a holding centre.  Additionally the Garda Síochána have been asked to undertake a security review of the premises &mdash; including the existing arrangements regarding the use of a private security firm &mdash; and provide a report on the necessary improvements required to ensure the safe detention of cattle in the event that Abbotstown Farm is retained as a centre for holding seized animals.  I am also examining the legal alternatives that may be open to me.</P>
    <P>Samples from 27 of the animals had been found positive for the presence of illegal growth promoters but as the animals had been detained for some time the residue level of these substances would have been eliminated or virtually eliminated.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless my Department's staff at meat factories and ports have been alerted to watch out for these animals and if they are detected they will not be passed as fit for human consumption.  I believe that there is no risk of any significance in regard to public health arising out of this incident.  The new arrangements I have in mind should ensure that any risk &mdash; however small &mdash; is essentially eliminated.</P>

      <P>In the proceedings brought by the four litigants in question, judgement in the High Court is awaited concerning an application by British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) to have service of those proceedings on them set aside.  If service of the proceedings on BNFL were to be set aside by the High Court this would effectively put an end to the proceedings against BNFL.  The request that the plaintiffs should be indemnified by the State in respect of their costs of pursuing the proceedings raises some substantial issues in any event, but it is considered appropriate in the circumstances to await the judgment of the High Court before reaching a decision, one way or the other, upon that request.</P>

      <P>The final report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative contains a number of recommendations for improving public transport services throughout the greater Dublin area.  One of the main improvements recommended by the DTI is the implementation of a light rail network. Among the other recommended improvements are extensive quality bus corridors, possible extensions of the DART to Malahide and Greystones and upgrading of the existing DART System including the construction of new stations at Fairview and Barrow Street; improved interchange facilities for buses and other public transport and off-street bus parking facilities in the city centre; provision of secure park-and-ride facilities on the public transport network and an integrated ticketing system for all public transport services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision has been made in the National Development Plan and Operational Programme for Transport, which cover the period from 1994-1999, for EU co-financed expenditure of £200 million in respect of the light rail network and £20 million in respect of the other public transport improvements recommended by the DTI.  Apart from <Col N="1482" /> the proposed light rail expenditure it is not possible to be more specific about the prospects for implementation of the other public transport improvements until a full evaluation of these has been carried out, bearing in mind that the full cost of all of these projects would greatly exceed available funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 279 and 280 together.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to the various matters (including the pensionability of military service allowance) which have been raised with the Department by the Irish United Nations Veterans Association is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  <i>Spouses' and Children's Pensions</i></P>
      <P>Prior to 1978 there was no provision for the payment of pensions by the Department of Defence to the widows and children of deceased soldiers.  Such provision was first made in 1978 when a contributory pension scheme for those dependants was introduced with effect from 1 June 1977.</P>
      <P>Membership of the contributory scheme was compulsory in the case of soldiers enlisting after 31 January 1978 and optional in the case of soldiers who served at any time between 1 June 1977 and 31 January 1978.  Payment of benefits under this scheme is dependent upon the soldier's having become a member of it and having paid the appropriate contributions as required by its terms.</P>
      <P>Concurrently with the introduction of the contributory scheme, a special <i>exgratia</i> scheme was introduced to cover the dependants of soldiers who had either died in service, or had retired on pension prior to 1 June 1977 and to whom the contributory scheme did not apply.  Initially, the rates of benefit under the <i>ex-gratia</i> scheme were half the relevant rates under the contributory scheme but over the years the rates have been brought up to full parity.</P>
      <P>2.  <i>Special increment for service in excess of 21 years.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Defence Forces Pensions Schemes provide for the payment of a special increment (currently £3.58 a <Col N="1486" /> week) in addition to the basic pension to a soldier for each year of pensionable service in excess of 21 years but not exceeding 31 years.  As a general rule, this special increment is payable until the soldier pensioner becomes entitled to a Social Welfare retirement pension (at age 65) or to a contributory old age pension (at age 66).  The personal rate of either Social Welfare pension is considerably greater than the maximum special increment.  Exceptionally, the increment continues to be payable up to 70 years of age in the case of a pensioner who was discharged prior to 1 August 1978, provided he is not in receipt of a Social Welfare retirement pension.</P>
    <P>The arrangements in place are in accordance with the principle of co-ordinating occupational pensions in the public sector with Social Welfare pensions in the case of employees who are fully insured under the Social Welfare Acts.  Soldiers are so insured.</P>
    <P>This matter was examined by the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces (the Gleeson Commission).  The commission did not recommend any change in the present arrangements.</P>
    <P>3.  <i>Pensionability of military service allowance (MSA)</i></P>
    <P>In its report dated 31 July 1990, the Gleeson Commission recommended that military service allowance should be made pensionable.  On foot of this recommendation, an addition to pension in respect of military service allowance was introduced and applies, subject to certain conditions, to personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990, i.e. the day following publication of the Gleeson report.</P>
    <P>Military service allowance has been reckoned in the calculation of the pensions of all qualified retired personnel. The estimated cost of extending this increase to pensioners who retired prior to 1 August 1990 would be in excess of £4 million a year.  Having regard to established practice in other areas of the <Col N="1487" /> public service, and the cost involved, it is regretted that the extension of the increase to other retired personnel cannot be undertaken.</P>
    <P>The number of persons in receipt of pensions under the Defence Forces Pensions Schemes, including the spouses of deceased personnel, is 6,380.  Of these about 5,600 pensioners are not in receipt of an addition to pension in respect of military service allowance.</P>
    <P>4.  <i>Increase in pensions</i></P>
    <P>Agreement was recorded on 29 September 1994 with the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association and on 3 November 1994 with the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers regarding the application to the ranks represented by them of the terms of the pay agreement which forms part of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>. On foot of these agreements, pensions fell to be increased by 2 per cent from the 1 June 1994.  The increased rates of pension, together with the arrears due, were paid in December, 1994.</P>

      <P>Applications from the person concerned have been made for a Fish Culture Licence and a Foreshore <Col N="1489" /> Licence so as to engage in shellfish farming.  Both licence applications are being processed simultanously.</P>
      <P>Applications for licences to engage in shellfish farming are subject to evaluation by the Aquaculture Licence Vetting Committee, a multidisciplinary advisory body, which brings together relevant expertise from within the Department of the Marine and from the Central Fisheries Board.  Applications are assessed from all technical, scientific and other relevant perspectives to determine the suitability of proposals. This evaluation process is further informed by a public consultation process.</P>
      <P>The duration and the outcome of the decision making process in individual cases inevitably varies depending on the technical considerations and particular local circumstances involved.</P>
      <P>The application raised by the Deputy is being progressed through this assessment/evaluation process.  Mapping of the area concerned (there are a number of applications for Killala Bay with the Department) is being undertaken. The consultation procedures are also underway.  I would like to assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to process the application in question as expeditiously as possible.</P>
