      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputy Mary Harney.  I now call on Deputy Harney to state the matter of which she has given notice to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I request leave to adjourn the Dáil under Standing Order 30 for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration, namely, the extensive disclosure of details of the 1995 budget at 12.15 p.m. yesterday by a member of the Cabinet sub-committee on the budget, almost four hours before the official release of that information, and bearing in mind the warning of the Ceann Comhairle against any breaches of budgetary Protocol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Having considered the matter fully I do not consider it to be one contemplated by the Standing Order, therefore, I cannot grant leave to move the motion.  In this instance I should inform the Deputy and the House that I have received a notice from the Minister of State, Deputy Phil <Col N="1990" /> Hogan, that he wishes to give an explanation on the matter.  I would, therefore, ask Deputies to await the Minister's explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I thank the Taoiseach for a letter informing me of that but it did not say &mdash; this is where I seek clarification &mdash; if members of the Opposition would be allowed to put questions to the Minister of State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not normal practice.  A personal explanation of this type should not give rise to question or debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware that a personal statement was to be made.  The Taoiseach did not communicate with me but he should facilitate questions.  When a matter arose some time ago the Minister of State now involved was very keen to have questions and not just statements.  We should provide for questions because it is a very serious matter. The Minister of State is one of four members of the Cabinet sub-committee on the budget.  It is not satisfactory merely to have a statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no problem facilitating the Deputy; I took any amount of questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>You had the privilege of seeing this personal statement.  I hope it will deal with the issue that I have been informed of: that the budget was also given to the Fine Gael press and information office well in advance of the speech by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, for the purpose of having leaflets printed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not seen the statement as yet, Deputies.  I would again submit to you in strict equity and <Col N="1991" /> justice that we leave the matter until we hear the Minister's explanation.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy, you heard me addressing the House.  It is quite disorderly to intervene when the Chair is addressing the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am again asking in strict equity and justice that we await the Minister's explanation before pursuing this matter further.  On a point of order, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>You will recall the last time a somewhat similar matter arose I did not seek to hide behind an explanation to the Dáil.  I took a Special Notice Question and any amount of questions and answers.  If the Minister of State has nothing to hide, as I had nothing to hide, perhaps he will take that course of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am now asking that we await the explanation which I have not seen yet.  It requires my approval.  I will communicate with Members as quickly as possible as to the precise time the statement by the Minister shall be made to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information will you also consider, when examining this explanation, the possibility of conceding to the House questions and answers after the explanation has been given?  Will you consider that in your deliberations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be dealing with the request in strict accord with the procedures of this House and its Standing Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know exactly how you will deliberate on this explanation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach give the House an assurance during the day that the entire budget was not revealed to the Fine Gael Press and Information Office for the purpose of having leaflets printed well in advance of the Budget Statements?</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 4.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the following arrangements shall apply in relation to the resumed debate at No. 4: (i) the speech of the main spokesperson for the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats Party, who shall be called upon to contribute to the debate first, shall not exceed 40 minutes in each case; (ii) the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case; and (iii) Members may share time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the proposal relating to item No. 4 satisfactory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not agreed. The Fianna Fáil Party will not agree to the Order of Business until we get an assurance from the Taoiseach on a number of issues.  First, we would like the <Col N="1993" /> Taoiseach to clarify whether the long-standing practice that Ministers of State do not receive budgetary data until the budget is released in the House has been breached.  We would also like to know, in view of the Government procedural instructions, Rule 19, which provides that no member of the Government or other person attending a meeting should divulge information about Government meetings without specific authority, who gave specific authority to the Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, to divulge information. What is the Attorney General's advice to the Taoiseach on the leaks&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be clear to the Deputy and the House that we cannot debate this matter now.  I have indicated to the House how we should proceed.  We shall hear a statement on the matter shortly and the House may decide how to proceed thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter cannot be debated now.  I have indicated again and again that if serious charges are to be made against a Member of the House there are procedures for pursuing the matter by way of substantive motion.  That is the way to proceed if Members feel strongly about this matter, but a debate on the Order of Business is out of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not seeking a debate.  We sent a letter to the Taoiseach last night, to which he replied.  We will try to avoid putting down a substantive motion but if that is the only way to get information we will follow that course.  We made what we thought was a very reasonable request in the circumstances, because we are dealing with an issue that has arisen for the first time in the history of the State&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is <Col N="1994" /> continuing to make a speech on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We simply asked for a question and answer session on the statement, which seems very reasonable. Will the Taoiseach grant that request?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>We should have openness and transparency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Any questions tabled on this matter that are judged to be in order, whether they be Private Notice Questions or ordinary questions, will be answered in full.  On the question raised by Deputy Ahern about Ministers of State having access to information concerning the budget, the position is different in this case.  It has been known that the Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, is a member of the budgetary and economic sub-committee of the Cabinet and, of course, he had access to budgetary information in that context. There has been no concealment at any time of those facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach take advice on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of divulging information will be dealt with by Deputy Hogan in his personal statement and if that statement is not satisfactory questions may be put in the normal way by the Opposition.  If such questions are judged to be in order they will be answered fully on behalf of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the Attorney General's advice being taken, any relevant advice will be taken.  I want to make it absolutely clear that it is my intention that there will be full accountability to the House in this matter.  The matter is a serious one and the House is entitled to full accountability by all those involved.  I have already apologised to the House on behalf of the Government for what occurred, but I fully understand that Members wish to have more information on the matter <Col N="1995" /> and they are entitled to that.  It is the intention of Deputy Hogan and the Government that that information will be provided in whatever way is in order.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate in the first instance, in view of the fact that Deputy Hogan has been the subject of obvious and foreseeable criticism, that he should be afforded the opportunity to make a personal statement.  Any Member who wishes to table further questions arising from that will be entitled to full answers and will get them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not get them today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the fact that I have already clearly indicated my apologies on behalf of the Government for what has occurred, I would point out that there was no concealment on the face of the press statement issued by Deputy Hogan, either of its time of issue or of its source.  This was quite transparent on the face of the document.</P>

      <P>This is the first budget to be introduced by a Labour Party Minister for Finance.  I pay my compliments to my former colleague, Deputy Ruairi Quinn.  In many respects but, unfortunately, not all he can feel some satisfaction with what he has achieved. As he has to a large extent acknowledged, the positive elements in the budget are largely the fruit of good management of the economy by the Fianna Fáil-Labour partnership Government and successive Governments during the past eight years, since 1987 under Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance and Taoiseach.  The policy choices are the Government's and, in many instances, I am glad that the choice is to continue and extend the strategy contained in my three budgets from 1992 to 1994.</P>
      <P>Compared with previous budgets, there is nothing special or spectacular about the scale of the tax concessions or the welfare package taken as a whole. The Minister is pursuing a gradual path of tax reform, not &ldquo;the big bang&rdquo; approach.  Unfortunately, there is a number of serious strategic mistakes, chief of which is the decision to revive a substantial current budget deficit as well as an astonishing blindness or indifference by supposedly Left Wing Ministers for Finance and Social Welfare to the needs of the old, widows, the single unemployed and many other categories of the neglected poor.  In many respects, given the opportunities, the public are being sold short.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rarely has an incoming Government inherited an economy or public finances in such good order.  For the first time in <Col N="2001" /> almost 30 years we succeeded in eliminating the current budget deficit and creating a small surplus in 1994 which would have been larger but for some end-year financial manoeuvres by the Government.</P>
    <P>When we took over from the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition early in 1987 the deficit for the previous year stood at £1,395 million or 7.9 per cent of GNP. It was that prospect that had caused a crisis of financial confidence the previous autumn and set in train the events which were to lead to the collapse of that Government.  Total borrowing was £2,145 million or 12 per cent of GNP. The debt-GNP ratio was exploding, the national debt, as then defined, having doubled from £12.7 billion to £25 billion in a little over four years.  The unsustainable situation had not been brought under control.</P>
    <P>During the past eight years Fianna Fáil has brought the public finances back on course and, in terms of the deficit, Ireland's position is now one of the strongest in the European Union.  We have reduced public expenditure by 12 per cent of GNP, an unparalleled achievement in the post-war western world.  In 1986 total Government expenditure as a percentage of GNP was 52 per cent.  Last year it was again under 40 per cent reversing the slight upward trend since 1990.  Exchequer borrowing was brought down from 12 per cent of GNP in a two year period between 1987 and 1989 to a little over 2 per cent where it has been maintained since, in good times and bad.  Last year, Ireland and Luxembourg were the only countries to remain within the Maastricht Treaty guidelines and to escape the censure of the EU Commission much to the annoyance of our German partners.  We finally eliminated the current budget deficit last year.  The debt-GDP ratio had come down to 82 per cent of GDP from a peak of 112 per cent in 1987 or, as defined for Maastricht Treaty purposes, to 90 per cent.</P>
    <P>My ambition was to continue reducing it by a further six percentage points each year so that we would achieve the <Col N="2002" /> Maastricht Treaty target of the 60 per cent debt-GDP ratio by 1999 when European Monetary Union is most likely to come into effect.  The absolute level of debt was kept down to a little over £29 billion even though some of what was formerly counted as debt was netted out in 1987.  This year the Government spending and borrowing plans, with an Exchequer borrowing requirement of £813 million, will most likely push the national debt level over the £30 billion mark.  The national debt is far too high, both in absolute and relative terms, and is set to absorb over £2.4 billion in debt servicing, almost £200 million up on last year or almost £250 million if the cary over of National Treasury Management Agency savings is taken into account.  With international interest rates now on a rising trend, a much higher priority should have been given in this budget to keeping borrowing at a minimum instead of adding hundreds of millions of pounds annually to the debt.</P>
    <P>If we really wanted to give taxpayers lasting relief, we should have kept down Government borrowing which is simply deferred taxation.  With high growth rates, we should not be borrowing more than £500 million to £600 million this year, instead of over £800 million.  If taxpayers want substantial, real reductions in their tax burdens, instead of relatively marginal though still welcome relief each year, they should support a more rigorous attitude to borrowing and expenditure.  The real road to &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; tax reform would be the complete elimination of borrowing.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the first act of this new Government is to re-establish a substantial current budget deficit of £310 million.  I am particularly surprised that it should be the act of a Government led by Taoiseach Deputy Bruton, who, 14 years ago as Minister for Finance, dedicated himself to the elimination of the current budget deficit within four years, even though in 1986 he ended up with one of the highest on record.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister for Finance, from <Col N="2003" /> his own political philosophy, does not regard lowering borrowing further as a particular priority, given the high level of unemployment and underutilised capacity.  That is a short-sighted point of view.  We should be making hay while the sun shines, and reducing borrowing when we have strong growth.  The positive effect on confidence, and therefore on investment and employment, would easily outweigh any mild contractionary effects.  The problem with this Government is that despite its rhetoric it lack's the burning ambition to make this country a first class economic performer.  I do not believe, in terms of the opportunities that existed, that the financial markets will be impressed by the borrowing figures this morning.  The best way of protecting ourselves as far as possible from interest rate rises, which would rapidly wipe out for most people the effect of the limited tax concessions, would be to post up a zero current budget deficit as we had achieved.  I am sorry the Minister and the Government decided to pass up this golden opportunity. A 1 per cent interest rise on a £40,000 mortgage will wipe out the budget gains for all but the highest earners, and 1.5 per cent rise will wipe out the gains even further and make most taxpayers net losers as predicted in the papers today.  This should put into context the modest level of the tax and PRSI concessions.</P>
    <P>If I had remained as Minister for Finance, I would have insisted on running a much tighter ship.  The Labour Party know that and perhaps that is why it jumped ship.  With interest rates on the rise, increases in current day to day expenditure can no longer be balanced by the decline in the cost of debt servicing. I regarded it as feasible and highly desirable to limit the headline growth of public expenditure this year to 4.5 per cent or, at most, 5 per cent not 6 per cent, which would still have allowed real growth in the volume of expenditure of about 2 per cent.  Tighter expenditure control would have achieved a saving of between £65 million and £100 million. <Col N="2004" /> We have shown where we would do that in the draft document put forward by the minority outgoing Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>In any comparison of 1994 and 1995, we should not forget that the increase of 6 per cent in day to day Government expenditure is not exclusive of £191 million of the once off amnesty expenditure last year.  The figures have been concealed in this regard and I want to put the true figures on the record about the increase in public expenditure of this Government.  In 1988, the Government presented two sets of accounts, inclusive and exclusive of the amnesty. If this Government had wanted to live up to its promises of openness, transparency and accountability it would have done the same this year.  If the amnesty expenditure were excluded, the rise in current day to day expenditure will be 8.4 per cent this year, which is not reassuring.  By way of comparison, the rise in current day to day spending in 1994, exclusive of the amnesty, was only 6.9 per cent.  Therefore, the underlying level of current public expenditure has gone up this year, not down.  The pinch will come next year as indicated by Minister Quinn.</P>
    <P>A substantial safety margin has been built into the White Paper on Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure which, with greater expenditure restraint, allowed the Minister for Finance to aim high for a zero current budget deficit without sacrificing his income tax concessions. The underlying projected growth of revenue, before budget changes, was 5.6 per cent, if last year's amnesty is netted out.</P>
    <P>Both the Central Bank and the ERSI projected nominal growth of 9.25 per cent.  Even if the nominal growth is only 8.4 per cent as projected by the Government, in other words 5.25 per cent growth plus inflation, that means on the basis of no change that the Minister for Finance should have collected at least another £250 million to £300 million in revenue, enabling him with some economies on expenditure to aim for a zero <Col N="2005" /> current budget deficit.  Last year, revenue was £377 million ahead of target and increased by 10.5 per cent, instead of the 4.6 per cent increase projected at budget time.  In 1993, revenue was £182 million ahead of target.  I know the Minister could put forward various negative special factors to dispute my claim this morning, though his Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald &mdash; the Minister responsible for the property tax &mdash; has already predicted that the budget deficit will be undershot.  I ask him to take a critical look at the situation and distinguish the wood from the trees for the public.</P>
    <P>Officials in the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, conscious of the disastrous impact on confidence of budget overruns &mdash; which were an almost routine occurrence in the 1973 to 1986 period &mdash; have been extremely cautious in their projections in recent years.  Their post budget and mid-year growth forecasts, since 1987, have been exceeded invariably and their borrowing forecasts have almost always been undershot.  They have little reason to trust this Government which contains so many factors with a propensity for spending other people's money.  Labour is a classic tax and spend party that has no real commitment to reducing the level of taxation, which it prefers to spend and present as if it were its own largesse.  Democratic Left, in its policy document &ldquo;Ireland 2000', expressed its fondness for high taxation in the following immortal words: &ldquo;Democratic Left will seek to convince people ... that taxation is not an evil but a positive ....&rdquo;</P>

      <P>A future in which we all come to love paying taxes is not a vision that many people share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there were another potential £250 million to £300 million in the kitty, Department of Finance officials would certainly not be in any great hurry to inform those who merely want to find other ways of spending it.  They would <Col N="2006" /> like to achieve the permanent elimination of the current budget deficit, and we on this side of the House praise them for their sense of national duty and responsibility which is of a very high order.  If the Minister had asked them to help him eliminate the deficit, I am sure they would have done so.  I believe they would have willingly and successfully co-operated, while still finding him the means of funding some of the tax conessions, which are a necessary <i>quid pro quo</i> for maintaining social partnership. Give me the loyal and dedicated officials of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners against the serried ranks of all the political programme managers, the legions of special advisers and additional &ldquo;spare wheel&rdquo; Ministers of State any day.  A Minister of State at the Department of Finance who faxes the budget to an evening newspaper four hours before delivery &mdash; and who then says he was trying to make the morning papers &mdash; and who gives his programme manager's telephone number for further information, is not fit for such a sensitive position.</P>
    <P>Tax rates, even after this budget and in future budgets, will be higher than necessary because Government expenditure has now become a political self service menu under this rainbow coalition. There is a plethora of public expenditure, which is not strictly necessary or of high priority, which is being given preference over the long term health of the economy to satisfy a political constituency dear to the heart of this or that Minister.</P>
    <P>Discipline has broken down in this Government at a very early stage and we are shocked.  I will not refer further to all the unnecessary appointments and political patronage which exists instead of the excellent public service.  Last December, I made it clear to Deputy Spring that I had enough of the political programme manager system and was not prepared to reinstate it.  When Fianna Fáil returns to Government, we shall insist on cleaning out the Augean stables.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2007" /> This has been the most leaked budget ever and the Taoiseach made no obvious attempt to his control it.  It is obviously beyond his control and it reflects poorly on his authority.  He is not really in charge of this Government. The Labour Party has made ethics in Government an issue.  Where are the ethics of briefing the media wholesale on every detail of the budget, allowing skilful business people to save substantial sums of money at the expense of the Exchequer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning I heard the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, say that there was no market-sensitive information.  We on this side of the House cannot confirm it yet, but we are told, and we are sure the Government will confirm or deny it today, that major property deals moved in a number of seaside resorts in recent days.  We will wait to hear whether that is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the concentration of widening the standard rate band.  That was my priority in Government.  What the Government has done this year on tax and PRSI is not quite on the scale of what was achieved in 1994.  In last year's budget, the tax free allowance was increased by £175 for a single person and £350 for a married couple &mdash; which is more than this year, the standard rate band was increased by £525 for a single person, and £1,050 for a married person, and the 1 per cent levy was abolished. Last year I also introduced a new low rate of PRSI on incomes below £9,000. We share the credit with Deputy Harney for what was achieved in 1992, and here I want to dispel another myth that the spin doctors, handlers, programme managers, advisers and family friends have put about in the last few days.  In 1992 the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government widened the standard rate band by £775 for a single person and £1,550 for a married couple, and <Col N="2008" /> reduced the income tax rates at the same time from 29 per cent to 27 per cent, and from 52 per cent to 48 per cent.  That helps to put this year's changes in context, they are not exceptional or out of the ordinary.  Media reports were simply wrong in saying that they were the largest tax and PRSI concessions ever.  We should be thankful, however, that despite caveats etc., we are making gradual progress towards relieving the tax burden because of the underlying soundness of the economy which we built up in the last eight years.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been able to benefit from broadening the tax base which I set in train last year for gradual implementation. He correctly resisted pressures to reverse the tax reforms of last year which would have led nowhere.  I notice that he has also made only minor cosmetic changes in the taxation of unemployment and disability benefit, which have long been recommended by the social partners and the Commissions on Taxation and Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I and my colleagues on this side of the House remember Deputy Yates telling us what Fine Gael would do about taxation when they got into Government. The Minister also tackled the problem of low pay and competitiveness by extending the lower rate of PRSI, which I introduced in last year's budget.  That is what I had planned to do, building up to a ceiling of about £15,000 a year over three budgets.  Without falling unemployment that could have been achieved without unduly affecting the social insurance fund which, last year, was 97 per cent self-financing.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a token PRSI free allowance of £50 which will save someone on £160 a week about £2.70 is a worthwhile innovation to make PRSI more progressive, but it is only a further development and variation of the existing £60 a week exemption which we introduced a few years ago.  It is partly clawed back by halving the PRSI allowance and at higher levels of pay by a raising of the PRSI ceiling.  However, to make a worthwhile difference, it would need to be further increased in future <Col N="2009" /> budgets and made comparable to the tax free allowance.  The £10 allowance for modified PRSI will mean a princely increase of 9p a week for permanent and pensionable civil servants, Army officers and local authority workers &mdash; a tremendous work incentive.</P>
    <P>A low introductory tax rate of 20 per cent would make a bigger difference to a low paid employee.  Eleven years ago, an introductory rate of 25 per cent was abolished in the name of rationalisation by the Fine Gael and Labour Coalition. There is a serious case for considering it as an additional way of reducing the tax wedge and that is our policy, as outlined yesterday by Deputy McCreevy.</P>
    <P>Whatever the limitations of the tax package, I am nevertheless glad that enough has been done to meet the requirements of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and underpin social partnership.  Social partnership has been the key to our success over the last years.  The Taoiseach disagreed with that until six weeks ago, but I am glad that Fine Gael is undergoing a Pauline conversion.</P>
    <P>Residential property tax is one of the failed brainwaves which former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, worked out in 1982 with his daughter-in-law, the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald. Deputy McCreevy has already entertained the House with the account from Dr. FitzGerald's memoirs.  The scene is reminiscent of Gilbert and Sullivan's <i>Mikado.</i> A more humane Taoiseach never did exist.  Helped by his daughter-in-law, his object all sublime he would achieve in time: to let the punishment fit the crime.  In this case the target was the homeowner with a property and matching income above certain thresholds.  It fell almost entirely on Dubliners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is clearly no such thing as a budget secret any more. I am sure I am not revealing anything <Col N="2010" /> when I say that the extension of the residential property tax was worked on with special care by a part of the programme manager system prior to the last budget. Never was more trouble caused for the sake of a miserable few million pounds. I am not the owner of a property of sufficient value to attract the tax either under the new threshold or the old, so I have no personal interest in it. However, since house property prices have risen by about 15 per cent in the last 12 months, the difference in tax liability for most people will be relatively slight.  The tax should now be abolished and put down to experience. It is not in the national interest.  Apart from the impact on hard-pressed homeowners, there is another consideration. We will not encourage wealthy people to live or stay in the country if they are liable to be hit by a massive property tax bill which works like a wealth tax, running into thousands of pounds a year with no ceiling, which they would not encounter elsewhere. The only reason we reluctantly agreed to it last year was that the alternatives would have been far more severe.  Last year Deputy Yates, in two Private Notice Questions, backed by Deputy Bruton, now Taoiseach, stated that Fine Gael would abolish it in its first budget in office.  In his Fine Gael paper for a Partnership Government, Deputy John Bruton called for the abolition of the residential property tax.  He failed to win that argument.  The residential property tax should be abolished or subsumed into a system of local taxation. Virtually none of the Fine Gael policy ideas of the last few years, with one exception which I will come to, appear in this budget.  Either the Taoiseach's Ministers were not present at the meetings when policies were being decided or he failed to get anything out of the budget: there is no tax free allowance of £300 or £400 per child, no tax free allowance of £1,000 for a carer at home, no tax free allowance for the cost of higher education, no job-seekers' tax allowance of £5,000 for new entrants to the workforce up to the age of 23, no <Col N="2011" /> tax breaks for childcare, housing maintenance and home repair.  Fine Gael, as part of this Government, achieved nothing.</P>

      <P>The budget reduces the level of corporation tax from 40 per cent to 38 per cent.  A few budgets ago it was reduced from 43 per cent to 40 per cent.  It might perhaps have been a more sensible priority at this stage to reduce it selectively by much more for a few employment-intensive industries, and that is what I intended to do.  I am afraid the employers' organisations, who represent everyone in their ranks, have got to the Minister, Labour Minister though he is.  IBEC is now saying this measure will have little effect on jobs.  That is the drawback of the scatter-gun approach.  I am even more amazed at the treatment of the banks.  It is interesting that a Labour Minister, who claims to be Socialist, and the Democratic Left, which, at one stage, wanted to nationalise the banks, have now promised that the levy will be phased down and eliminated over three years while there will be an immediate 2 per cent cut in corporation tax at the same time.</P>

I will do the sums for Deputy Rabbitte because obviously neither he nor Deputy De Rossa thought about them when doing the budget.  To have given old aged pensioners and others a 3 per cent increase in social welfare would have cost only £8 million.  Instead they preferred to give that and more to the commercial banks.  That says something about the priorities of a Labour Minister for Finance and the left wing Democratic Left Party.</P>

      <P>I am glad he has taken my advice and is following the precedent in most of the eight budgets since 1987 by not raising excise duty on drink and petrol.  We have, if anything, a slight advantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> the North on the price of petrol, which we should maintain.  The price of petrol is one of the basic factors in competitiveness.  I am glad to see the Minister implementing further measures that will help the business sector, following on the example set by last year's budget, for example the adjustments in capital acquisition tax, but they are too few.</P>
      <P>The concessions I gave last year on vehicle registration tax helped increase sales of new vehicles by 28 per cent up to the end of November, bringing results for the year back for the first time very close to the record figures achieved in the early 1980s.  The Minister's further concession this year to encourage new car sales is a sensible one.</P>

      <Col N="2013" /> Child benefit has been raised significantly in recent years.  A number of studies have suggested that this is one of the best ways to assist families and alleviate poverty, in contrast to conventional wisdom of ten to 15 years ago. Child benefit was increased substantially in 1993 to £20 a week and the higher rate to £23 for the fourth child which in 1994 was increased to £25 for the third and subsequent children. Seven pounds has been added to both rates in 1995 and this will have a beneficial effect on families.  It is one of the good decisions in this budget.</P>

    <P>The absolute minimum increase in social welfare needed this year is 3 per cent and the general increase of 2.5 per cent is the lowest in 30 years.  That is a disgrace.  It is ironic that we should have to wait for a left wing dominated Government, a Democratic Left Minister for Social Welfare and a Labour <Col N="2014" /> Minister for Finance to treat the pensioners and the old people, as well as the widows, the single unemployed or childless unemployed couples so shabbily. What does it say about those catch-words, &ldquo;values, dignity, inclusion, solidarity&rdquo; and the type of society we want that apart from a free colour television licence we are giving the old less than the absolute minimum.  They have worked hard for this country in their time and they deserve better.</P>

      <P>The principle all along has been to try to keep social welfare increases ahead of inflation and also to allow those dependent on social welfare to share in the fruits of growth, otherwise there is growing social division. Inflation for the period covered by this increase is likely at the best estimates to be at least 2.75 per cent.  While the Department of Finance predicts an inflation increase of 2½ per cent, many independent commentators are predicting a higher level of inflation.  I note that in the budget tables consumer prices are shown as rising by 2.4 per cent last year but by 2½ per cent this year, in other words no decimal point is given.  I am suspicious that the figure is a rounded down one, especially as the GNP growth figure is 5.25 per cent and 2.5 per cent do not add up to the nominal growth in the actual figures of 8.4 per cent.  Will the Minister explain the discrepancy and give the Department of Finance's inflation forecast to the nearest decimal point as was done in 1994? I suspect it will be shown to be slightly above 2.5 per cent and that the Government was too embarrassed to show that. The ESRI is predicting a price rise of 2.8 per cent in 1995.  Chris Johns of Group Treasury, Bank of Ireland &mdash; a person whom Deputy Yates would always quote in this House &mdash; is predicting 2.9 per cent.  I have no doubt that the Fine Gael facts sheets after this year's budget will, as they did last year, quote Chris Johns alongside the <Col N="2015" /> increase of 2.5 per cent for the old and the infirm.</P>
      <P>Year after year Deputy Proinsias De Rossa came into this House to complain about the social welfare increases.  On 1 March 1994, speaking on the Social Welfare Bill, he referred to the 3 per cent increase as &ldquo;miserable&rdquo;.  On 23 March 1993 he suggested Dáil Éireann should deplore the inadequacy of the increases, also described as meagre in the Official Report, volume 428, columns 362-375.  On 29 January 1992 he said, as reported in the Official Report, volume 415, column 440:</P>
      <P>The Minister made much of the fact that increases in social welfare will be slightly above the expected rate of inflation, (this year it is ½ per cent below) but a policy of setting social welfare increases on or about the level of inflation would only be satisfactory if the basic social welfare levels were themselves adequate.  This is clearly not the case.</P>
      <P>In 1992 Deputy De Rossa was obviously working off the same word processor as in 1991 when he said virtually the same thing about the &ldquo;miserably&rdquo; 4 per cent increases &mdash; obviously he changed the word processor package this year &mdash; and said it could only be considered adequate if the basic rates were sufficient to protect those in need, but this was clearly not the case.  Speaking on budget day, 31 January 1990, when there was a 5 per cent general increase he said &ldquo;the overall level of social welfare increases is quite inadequate in the context of the scale of poverty facing the country&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In 1989 Deputy De Rossa was particularly savage about a 3 per cent general increase plus a special 9 per cent increase in the long term unemployed. In the Official Report, volume 386, column 330 he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the appalling levels of poverty, which have been widely documented by a wide range of independent groups over the past 12 months, <Col N="2016" /> the failure to provide adequate increases in social welfare payments is particularly cruel.</P>

The not so socialist Labour Party has bought this without obvious qualms.  Democratic Left and its Ministers have suffered a humiliating defeat in this budget, with all their pretensions about protecting the poor and the needy blown to smithereens within a few short weeks of taking office.

      <P>They decided to stay in Government with the State cars even if it is with half the salary.</P>
      <P>I find it curious that the poverty lobby, which used to harangue Fianna Fáil for meanness when we gave the old an increase of 25 per cent or gave the long-term unemployed an increase of 911 per cent in the late 1980s, fell almost completely silent before the budget, despite its well-leaked contents. Obviously many of them, briefly at least, were under the spell of Labour and/or Democratic Left.  Clearly, their acquiescence is now taken for granted, despite some angry noises.  Many of those organisations pull their punches so as not to offend their benefactor.  It costs much less to give a 25 per cent increase to a welfare organisation than an extra half per cent to the old and unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget is an affront to the old-age pensioner and to the long term unemployed without child dependants. When the Social Welfare Bill comes before this House, we will put down an amendment to raise the general increase to 3 per cent.  In a period of high growth, there would be a good case for raising it higher.  It is not so much the amount <Col N="2018" /> involved as the principle that the living standards of the less well off must be fully protected.  Poverty traps should be tackled at the low income, tax and PRSI end and not by depressing or holding down the living standards of the less well-off.  We expect Government backbenchers, especially in Labour and Democratic Left, to see that this change is carried through.  If many of them wish to see the inside of this House after the next election they should vote with us. Let them find the savings elsewhere, even from the banks, and not increase the level of borrowing.</P>
    <P>I accept that the budget does something for families, especially those of the unemployed, by raising further the level of child benefit and that it also finally sorts out the equality issues, something which any Government would have to do and which is no special credit to Democratic Left.  We, too, had been making substantial special equality payments over some years.</P>

      <P>I am very glad that the Minister for Finance adopted my proposal, contained in a number of pre-budget newspaper articles I wrote, to introduce free travel for old age pensioners from Northern Ireland.  I think it will help to widen horizons and improve mutual understanding in conditions of peace.  I am disappointed that no efforts have been made, to tackle double taxation, the problems of residents in this State working in the North.  Perhaps this will be tackled by the Minister in the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>There are two other measures in the budget which I welcome, the tax reliefs on donations to Third World charities and the extension of urban renewal provisons to seaside towns.  Despite the budget increase of £4 million, there is some cut in spending on regional and country roads, from £107 million last year to £100 million this year.  I gave £15 million in the budget last year for country roads and only half that is being given this year.</P>

      <P>The Labour Minister for Education's political priorities border on the bizarre.  On the face of it, the abolition of fees will principally benefit the more privileged sector of education. It does nothing for those students on inadequate maintenance grants or who just fail to qualify for them.  There will be huge pressure on places and on points since most colleges are bursting to capacity.  There is a big question mark over whether we are doing anything to create greater equality of access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget does little for agriculture or to tackle the problem of low incomes <Col N="2020" /> and too little capital.  We need to fundamentally reconsider what is to be done to solve the problem of current flooding. We surely have to do something more to protect people's homes from the effects of repeated flooding.</P>
    <P>For most of the time I was Minister for Finance, the overriding policy had to be returning the public finances to a sustainable path.  By last year, I had certainly achieved that goal.  The budget just presented has given away some of the gains that were achieved.  More importantly though an opportunity has been missed to establish an onward looking economic policy of which budgetary policy is a part.  The establishment of employment creating growth, rising living standards and balanced economic development across the country requires a broader canvas on which to set economic policy than annual budgetary policy is capable of delivering.  The relationship between employment and output growth in Ireland is poor compared with other European economies.  It needs to be improved.  There are many impediments and disincentives to employment and work that fiscal measures alone cannot overcome.  There is reluctance to invest and take risks because the perceived rewards for doing so are inadequate.</P>
    <P>With the public finances restored to balance, this Government had the opportunity to articulate an economic policy framework encompassing budgetary policy that would raise the employment creating potential of the economy. Instead it has decided to return to having a current budget deficit of over £310 million.</P>
    <P>It had an opportunity to set the evolution of the public finances in a medium term framework of, say, three years, setting out how public spending and taxation would evolve, thus lending certainty to households and businesses about the fiscal framework within which they could make decisions to invest, employ and grow.  Instead the Government has decided to return to a current budget deficit.</P>
    <P>I and the Department were moving to <Col N="2021" /> the view that the time horizon of the budget should be extended.  At present, budget measures tend to be evaluated in terms of their costs, impacts in the year in which they are made and their full, 12 month, effects.  Ideally the budget presentation and accounts should have the same multi-annual time frame as the plan.  That was Fianna Fáil policy.  As a first step towards moving to this, the 1995 budget accounts should be presented in a three year multi-annual context, i.e. 1995-1997.  Budget measures, especially those aimed at achieving structural reform, take time for the full effect and consequences to accumulate.  It is important for this reason alone to move from one year accounting practice.  Most business plans are for three to five years.  If greater assurance can be provided of the stance and likely development of public policy and finances to the economy at large, there would be a more certain prospect of raising investment and employment.</P>
    <P>For one thing, the consequences for taxation of changes to expenditure programmes would be more readily apparent. This could assist with establishing clearer determination of priorities as between spending and taxation.  A second benefit would be to allow greater interlinkage and focus between the budgetary and planning processes.  It may not be feasible to introduce three year budgeting comprehensively.  As a start, three year expenditure budgets should be implemented in the areas of health, education, social welfare and manpower training and development.  If we had been in power that is what we would have announced yesterday.</P>

      <P>Over the past eight years, Fianna Fáil played a principal role in creating a flourishing economy, based on three principles: sound Government finances; low inflation and social partnership and consensus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had outstanding results, in stark contrast to the past, where they <Col N="2022" /> were wrecked by mainly Fine Gael/Labour Governments.  We have had the highest growth in the OECD, averaging close to 5 per cent which should continue this year.  We have had a large and growing trade surplus and balance of payments surplus, which should continue this year.  Inflation has been in low single figures.  Industrial production last year was dynamic, growing by 11 per cent.  Thanks to our tax-cutting policies, domestic consumer expenditure is contributing as well as exports to growth.  In six years out of the last eight, agricultural incomes have been rising.  Net employment has risen by 110,000 since 1988 and is due to rise by a further 31,000 this year, on top of 36,000 in 1994 and the fall in unemployment is set to accelerate.  We have a stable current and record low interest rates.</P>
    <P>The new Government is able to build on those achievements, which we wish to see maintained.  We have no serious quarrel with the tax provisions in the budget, though we might have done some things differently.  Many of the measures to help the low paid and business are sensible, but too little.</P>
    <P>The budget falls down principally in two places and that is why the Government blew it yesterday.  The budget is not stringent enough on expenditure borrowing and the elimination of the current budget deficit.  While it addresses some social issues such as equality and child care, it ignores and neglects the old, the long term unemployed and those with young families &mdash; a substantial number &mdash; in a manner that is simply not acceptable.</P>

      <P>In contrast to what would have been decided by the three parties in Government either separately or collectively, the Fianna Fáil Party decided, and a similar responsible approach was taken by our colleagues in Opposition, the Progressive Democrats, that we would not today instantly call for the head of the Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, because we realised he had been instructed by the Taoiseach in respect of the breaching of Rule 19 of media briefings.  It states that a member of the Government is especially designated to provide a Government press secretary with a briefing after each meeting on such matters as the Taoiseach, Tánaiste or other member of the Government chairing the meeting may authorise to be released to the media. The Taoiseach stated this morning that he had given authority to the Minister of State to have all the data and we accept that is the Taoiseach's right. However, Rule 19 provides that no other member of the Government or other person attending a meeting should divulge any information about a Government's discussions without specific authority.  We now understand that what the Taoiseach stated this morning &mdash; this is the only conclusion we can reach &mdash; means he instructed the Minister of State to leak the data, presumably because the Minister for Social <Col N="2024" /> Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, had leaked everything in the social welfare budget and Fine Gael&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to make this point and I acknowledge you have given me an opportunity to do so.  We have asked for a simple question and answer session.  We have no reason to call for the removal of Deputy Hogan as Minister of State.  He is a decent fellow and at any rate he was instructed by the Taoiseach on this occasion.  However, if the Minister has nothing to hide, why does he not want to answer our questions? We want to ask him who told him to do it.  We want to find out if it was the Taoiseach, it seems it must have been having regard to the media briefings <Col N="2025" /> rule.  If we cannot get answers to questions what can we do except put down a motion calling for the Minister's head? We have no reason to do that.  We ask you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Ceann Comhairle, to request the Taoiseach to act in a reasonable and responsible manner and grant a question and answer session to avoid us calling for the head of a Minister of State who was only doing what he was instructed to do to counteract the leaks and the briefings of the handlers, the minders, the programme managers, advisers, family patrons and all those involved.</P>

I wonder will the Minister for Finance be looking for anybody's head later this afternoon. What has happened gives a whole new meaning to the notion of quitting while one is ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said yesterday morning before I became aware of the press release from the Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, the Budget Statement is a total charade. It is a serious matter and I was disappointed with the view taken by the Taoiseach this morning.  He seemed to say that if we were not satisfied we could ask questions.  I wonder if the Taoiseach is satisfied.  Is he not asking <Col N="2028" /> questions?  Is it the case that the Minister acted on instructions from the Taoiseach. If it is a fact, as I understand it is, that at noon yesterday the Fine Gael press office had a full copy of the Budget Statement and was preparing leaflets and fact sheets for its members, it is a very serious matter and one for which the Taoiseach must be accountable in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>I look forward to his statement.  Ireland's national emblem has been the shamrock; perhaps we could adopt the emblem of Wales and have the leek instead.  It might be more appropriate.</P>
      <P>The leaking of this budget is unprecedented. The reason for it is unprecedented internal dissension within this Government. If, in good economic times, when apparently, the Government had good news, members had to engage in such one-up-manship, what on earth will they do in bad economic times when they will not have the same opportunity?   The leaks began over a week ago.  In weekend newspapers we were able to read about the Exchequer borrowing requirement of £813 million.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, said this morning that market-sensitive information was not released but I would dispute that.  For example, the value of shares in banks has been increased resulting from the Government decision to abolish the bank levy. That was known to many people on Monday last, and indeed over the last weekened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bertie Ahern referred to property transfers in seaside resorts over the past few days and if that is fact it is a very serious matter.  It means we <Col N="2029" /> have a new golden circle, a new group of people who will have the inside track.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe the leak was only due to incompetence, merely an occasion for an unfortunate Minister of State to have his party's stamp put on the budget.  It resulted from internal dissention because of the make-up of this Government.  Rather than contend that we have a rainbow Coalition, it would be more appropriate to contend that we have a rainbow colander.</P>
      <P>I will not read into the record all the Taoiseach's quotes about leaks because I want to talk about what he had to say about the budget last year.  He raised on the Order of Business on many occasions the question of leaks when the last Government were in office.  When Northern Ireland business was leaked to a journalist, the Taoiseach, then Leader of the Opposition, almost exclusively here, on the Order of Business, day after day, raised that matter and took a very poor view of it.  What has happened is serious and if the Taoiseach does not take a serious view of this most recent leak it will undermine his authority, his Government and will destroy any capacity of this Government to remain a cohesive unit for the next few years.</P>
      <P>This most recent leak is ironic given all we heard in recent times about the need for high standards, openness and transparency &mdash; perhaps this does give a new meaning to the words &ldquo;openness, transparency and accountability&rdquo;&mdash; since I had some experience of that in a couple of meetings I had before Christmas.  Since memoirs are now being quoted here extensively, I shall leave my conclusions to my memoirs. Perhaps in a number of years, when I am no longer here, they will entertain some people.  Certainly I found my experience not a pleasant one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our dealings with Fianna Fáil in 1989 and again in 1992 we found it to be far more business-like and professional than were the Labour Party just before last Christmas.  One can always argue <Col N="2030" /> one's point of view when somebody is prepared to tell one the truth, but, when one hears different things at successive meetings even when one's associates are briefing the media, it raises questions about &ldquo;openness, transparency and accountability&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach does not deal with this matter now it will destroy his Government because the trust required is dependent on secrecy.  I served for three years as a junior Minister in a Government and I did not have budget details until they were read out in this House.  On one occasion I refused to participate in a discussion panel during the time the Minister would have been reading his Budget Statement because I did not know what the budget contained and felt I would look foolish, as a Minister of State, participating in a discussion panel, not being aware of what would be announced in the Minister's Budget Statement.  I do not make that comment to praise that Government; that was always the norm.  I cannot understand what happened yesterday.  It was not mere incompetence or a casual leak.  It is a very serious matter, one I hope the Taoiseach takes seriously. Unfortunately, his remarks here last evening gave me the impression that he did not take it seriously.</P>
    <P>When responding to the Budget Statement last year the present Taoiseach said as reported at column 1957 of the Official Report of that day, 27 January 1994:</P>
    <P>This budget fails to address Ireland's long term social and economic failure.</P>
    <P>A country that disposes as much resources as we do, and which yet has no work for 300,000 people, is a social and economic failure.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that neither of the Government parties recognises this national failure.  To introduce a tinkering budget when it has so much leeway for radical reform shows how mediocre the thinking of this Government really is.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2031" /> Further down in the same column he said:</P>
    <P>I strongly disagree with the political priorities of this budget.  It will slash mortgage interest relief for all those who pay the top rate of tax, which is most full-time workers.  In that way, it will discourage people from being self-reliant and from borrowing to provide their own homes.</P>
    <P>One might have expected that in the first budget after he became Taoiseach Deputy John Bruton would have done something about mortgage interest and VHI premia relief, which will be slashed under the provisions of this budget.  No, the proposal he found to be so damaging to self-reliance, remains intact in this budget.</P>
    <P>The present Taoiseach last year, when commenting on that budget said that the difference between what his party would do and what the then Government was doing was the difference between serious tax reform and tinkering.  At column 1958 of the Official Report of the same date he went on to say:</P>
    <P>There is no coherent statement on the threats to, or the opportunities for, Ireland in the next ten years.</P>
    <P>He went on to talk glowingly about the role the services sector had to play and said, at columns 1965-66 of the Official Report of the same day:</P>
    <P>We must remove the systematic discrimination against the service sector in the tax code.  It is in private services that the majority of the new jobs can be created, not in manufacturing. To this end, the corporation tax rate for services should be reduced from 40 per cent towards 27 per cent.  It is wrong that the corporation tax rate on a services company should be four times as high as the corporation tax rate on a manufacturing company. The Minister did nothing about this discrimination in the budget.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2032" /> They were very strong words.  Sometimes people in Opposition make strong statements like that but when they get into Government, discover the resources are not there to do all things they might like to do.  However, this was not a year when the resources were not there.  The resources are there.  For example, economic growth is forecast to be between 5 and 6 per cent, to use the Government's own figures.  It is forecast that public spending will grow by 8.6 per cent when the once-off amnesty receipts are taken into account.  The Exchequer borrowing requirement is £813 million and the current budget deficit £310 million. If we do not live within our means in good times like these, when will we ever begin to live within our means?  I agree with what was said earlier by my colleague Deputy Michael McDowell, the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Finance and their Leader this morning &mdash; we must begin to live within our means. I know that traditionaly left-wing politicians love nothing better than spending taxpayers' money.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, always has been good at advocating or suggesting means by which taxpayers' money could be spent.</P>
    <P>I might understand a 9 per cent increase in current Government spending if it was being allocated to social welfare recipients, but I wonder what the non-contributory old age pensioners in Kiltalown in Tallaght, 60 per cent of whom vote for Deputies Rabbitte and Taylor, think of the £1.50 increase when they see Government spending increased by 9 per cent?  I wonder what social welfare recipients generally will think of this budget when they realise that a Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Coalition Government in 1990 gave a 5 per cent increase in social welfare and in 1991 a 4 per cent increase in social welfare, whereas a Labour/Democratic Left &mdash; what young Labour in Trinity called the Labour-dominated Government &mdash; Government gives only a 2.5 per cent increase to social welfare recipients?</P>
    <P>This morning I expected many of <Col N="2033" /> those usually called &ldquo;the proverty commentators&rdquo; to draw attention to that fact.  One such commentator, Pádraigh O Morain, opened his comments on social welfare by saying that, as budgets go, this is a good budget for social welfare recipients.  I found that comment extraordinary.  I find it extraordinary that we live in a society within which for example, a survivor &mdash; after the lifetime of this Government I wonder how many survivors there will be &mdash; will receive £1.60 extra, a non-contributory old age pensioner an extra £1.50 and, if lucky enough to be over 80 years of age, will receive an extra £1.80 per week.  I ask the House: is that a budget attempting to encourage solidarity, as the Minister for Finance said yesterday?  Is that a budget for inclusion?  Is that a budget to empower or encourage people?  Does it show that we have a caring Government at a time when our economic circumstances are so healthy?</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government on what it has done for child benefit.  It is appropriate that in so far as possible the necessary resources are directed at families through increased child benefit. That is the most effective way of helping low income families and families on social welfare.  I hope the Minister for Social Welfare moves quickly towards a single strategy for child allowances under the social welfare code.  I am disappointed he did not do so yesterday. Why is benefit for the child of a prisoner less than that for the child of an unemployed person?  Why are there different rates for different children?  That is not justifiable.  I expected the new Minister, particularly one from Democratic Left, to initiate reform in that respect and introduce a single allowance for all categories of children.  I hope he moves in that direction in the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>While on the social aspects of the budget, I must comment on the failure of the Minister to deal with the question of child care.  Before Christmas we heard a great deal about child abuse and the need for more resources in that area.  For some time Barnardos have been lobbying the Government for <Col N="2034" /> additional resources and promises have been made in that respect, but the Minister did not mention the allocation of additional resources for child care in his Budget Statement.  When talking about increases of approximately 9 per cent in current Government spending, one must wonder about the Government's priorities.</P>
    <P>I must comment also on the Government's sense of priority in terms of education and its strategy for dealing with fees and related matters for children who secure places in third level institutions in Northern Ireland or overseas. The Government's strategy on third level education will do nothing to help underprivileged children secure places in third level institutions or to help their families to maintain them during that time.  This is a mistaken and unfair strategy and will not deal with the priorities in this area.</P>
    <P>The budget failed miserably in terms of strategy.  The Government's programme did not set targets in relation to tax reform, it merely made some loose comments on economic matters.  A few nice phrases were used: we were told the Government would be prudent, it would keep borrowing down and live within the Maastricht guidelines.  The Government has not set itself targets and, therefore, we cannot judge its performance. It certainly has no medium term strategy.</P>
    <P>The budget is a missed opportunity and, contrary to today's newspaper headlines, with the exception of the family of seven from Ballybunion, it will do nothing substantial in terms of tax reform.  Income tax will increase by £300 million this year, it will not be reduced. The front page headline in today's <i>The Irish Times</i> states, &ldquo;Budget benefits lower-paid, employers and small firms&rdquo;. The day after the budget last year that same paper carried the headline, &ldquo;Lower paid to benefit in biggest ever give-away budget&rdquo;.  An appropriate cartoon in that paper stated that the handing over of that money in no way implied guilt or responsibility for past abuse of taxpayers.  The headlines of <Col N="2035" /><i>The Irish Times</i> today and on the day following last year's budget are similar and I am sure the expectations of the electorate, taxpayers in particular, are also similar.  However, when they receive their pay packet in April, when the tax measures will come into effect, taxpayers will know they will not be substantially better off.  While I welcome the removal of PRSI from the first £50 and the extension of reduced rates to additional income, that is not the way to approach the tax and PRSI systems. Simply moving the barrier up the scale will cause enormous problems &mdash; it has been described as a Beecher's Brook &mdash; when people reach the level of income to which the full PRSI rate applies.  It will create huge poverty traps and major disincentives for employers and employees.  I would have preferred the Government to reduce the rates rather than move in that direction.  While it will benefit some categories of workers, we should not underestimate the overall problems it will cause.</P>
    <P>Last week the Progressive Democrats published details of its tax proposals. Given the economic growth we are currently experiencing and the forecasts for the next few years, over four years we could transfrom the tax system.  It is no great academic exercise or hobby horse of mine to talk frequently about tax reform.  It is essential if we want to encourage enterprise, reward initiative, encourage social cohesion and create the solidarity to which the Minister referred yesterday.  Our tax system is the single biggest barrier to taking up and creating employment.  I have yet to meet anybody who will stand over the tax system, justify or defend it.  Perhaps some of those who work in the Department of Finance believe it has advantages because they are familiar with it and so on.  Time and time again we miss the opportunity to do something radically about it.  The Government had that opportunity this year.  I accept it cannot be transformed in one year, but over four years the higher rate of tax could be reduced at 40 per cent and the <Col N="2036" /> lower rate to 20 per cent cent.  The lower tax rate could be extended to average industrial earnings so that a person earning an average industrial wage would never have to pay more than the standard rate of tax.</P>
    <P>Much more could be done.  We could substantially reduce PRSI rates and halve capital acquisition tax.  All that could be achieved in the context of reducing the borrowing requirement, living within our means, having no current budget deficit and increasing public spending by 1 per cent to provide for the cases to which I referred earlier. Because of our fortunate economic circumstances all that could be achieved over a four year period.  Instead, the Government has failed to adopt a strategy or to set targets; it has not sought radically to alter the anti-work and antienterprise tax system.  It has adopted a Santa Clause approach to the budget, the Gay Byrne approach &mdash;&ldquo;something for everyone in the audience&rdquo;.  Given that Fine Gael is the dominant party in Government &mdash; although it has been called a Labour dominated Government &mdash; one would imagine that in this, its first budget, the Government would have used the opportunity radically to transform our tax system.</P>
    <P>Last year Deputy Bruton and other members of his party had a great deal to say about the property tax.  Deputy Yates told us that Fine Gael in its first budget, at the first opportunity, would remove that unfair tax on the family home.  What has happened?  It has further complicated the matter and made it even less meaningful.  It will take in less money but all the bureaucracy will be retained to enforce a property tax that is unfair and discriminates against family home owners, particularly those in certain locations whose houses have a high property value.  It is a silly begrudgers' tax which makes no sense.  At a time when the Government is abolishing the bank levy, it is disgraceful that it should retain the property tax.  By any stretch of the imagination it is not justifiable.  This is <Col N="2037" /> particularly important given that mortgage interest relief will be reduced substantially.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern referred to property values increasing by 15 per cent during the last few years.  Property values at the lower end of the scale may have increased to that extent but, because of the way the property tax is structured, larger properties have not increased to that extent.  The property tax will discriminate against owners of relatively small properties that have a high value because of their location.  It bears no relationship to the ownership of the property because many householders have large mortgages.  They may own only 10 per cent of the property, yet they must pay a tax on its overall market value.  In the context of abolishing a bank levy, how can anyone justify retaining a tax on the family home?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred yesterday to the number of people who will be removed from the tax system.  It has been a traditional feature of budgets during the past number of years that thousands of workers are taken out of the tax net.  So many have been taken out during the past number of years that nobody should be left.  As my colleague, Deputy McDowell, said Seán Barrett, an economist, has done a study and has calculated that between 1980-87 313,000 taxpayers were taken out of the tax net. He goes on to make the point that most of these people come back into the tax net.  One of the ironies of the budget is that before the end of the year in which the budget comes into effect these categories of taxpayers are back in the tax net due to increases in wages and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to debate here the whole idea of central wage bargaining and the various programmes negotiated in recent years but percentage increases and our attitude to rewarding labour by giving across the board percentage increases which obviously gives much more to those on higher salaries is of particular benefit to public sector <Col N="2040" /> workers who got a good deal during the last few years as a result of many of these programmes.  The budget has not concentrated on the real issue, which is take home pay and the cost of employment. It has not concentrated on reducing the tax burden and, therefore, as a result of these small increases people are put back into the tax net very rapidly after the Minister has taken them out.</P>
    <P>Earlier this morning many people probably heard the comments of Lorraine Sweeney the representative of the small business firms association, IBEC. Unlike other commentators she was critical of the Government's proposals for small business.  I agree with many of her comments and many of the comments made by other people in small business.  This country does not encourage entrepreneurs, reward effort and give incentives to those who want to take the risks, establish business and give jobs to others.  There are many ways in which the State could help not only through the tax system for the services sector and the manufacturing sector. The State's attitude to the payment of bills, tolerating long delays by public authorities in meeting their commitments, imposes an enormous burden on small businesses.</P>
    <P>So far as business is concerned, it is not justifiable to have two corporation tax rates apply to the service sectors and to the manufacturing sector &mdash; 10 per cent and 40 per cent, now reduced to 38 per cent.  Last year when the Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, spoke eloquently about the need to reduce corporation profits tax on the services sector from 40 per cent to 27 per cent one would have assumed he would have moved more rapidly in that direction than merely taking off two percentage points.  Radical change in corporation profits tax has to be a Government priority, given the job potential of the services sector, whether in tourism or in many of the other services.</P>
    <P>The 10 per cent tax regime applying to the financial services centre is the main reason it has been successful.  Last <Col N="2041" /> year the Exchequer got £170 million worth of tax from the companies located there.  Lower rates of tax can bring in additional revenue because it leads to more activity, transactions, employment and tax.  The sooner we realise that reasonable levels of tax will encourage people to conduct their business in Ireland and not seek to move abroad to engage in property transfers or to do business deals the better.</P>
    <P>The budget does not have an overall strategy.  It is very much a hotch potch budget.  On the radio this morning it was referred to as a scratch card rather than a lotto.  Given all the hype and the advance billing about this budget, expectations were fuelled but when people have had time to digest it properly, it will be considered disappointing. It is more a camel humped budget than a budget that has a strategy for the economy.  It has all the hallmarks of a budget that was drawn up by the three parties that are not fundamentally in agreement on economic policy.  The budget will not encourage self reliance, effort or reward those at work.  Even the way the Minister delivered the sweeteners yesterday had all the hallmarks of trying to create the impression that this was a handout mentality budget.  Unfortunately, some categories did not get the handout.</P>
    <P>Whether it was the Minister for Education or the Minister for Social Welfare who was affected, we were able to get clear budgetary details well in advance. This was because the different Ministers want to make sure their end was kept up.  If that is what happens in good times when we have good economic opportunities, what will happen when the Government is in crisis, if they deal with matters in the way they have dealt with the publication of the budget?</P>
    <P>The Minister told us yesterday of the decision to end tax relief on covenants. No new covenants will be covered from yesterday except certain categories to do with handicapped children and so <Col N="2042" /> on.  From April next tax relief on existing covenants will cease.  Can the Minister give legal effect to that?  Many taxpayers have entered into agreements to pay out money over a six year period to particular categories of people.  They will be required to honour that agreement for the duration of the covenant. Is it fair to cancel that arrangement given that people enter into those agreements on the basis of a tax regime?  I wonder what the legal implications are? I understand the Taoiseach said last night that 38,000 covenants were in place, about 26,000 of which were in respect of education.  Many of these covenants have been taken out by aunts or uncles to nieces or nephews.  They will want to honour those commitments; the people in respect of whom the commitments were made will insist that they honour them.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the decision to give tax relief in respect of overseas charities it is a pity it was not extended to charities at home.  Many people make donations to worthwhile charities in this jurisdiction and they should not be discriminated against.  I wonder how many taxpayers on the standard rate of tax, payable on gross income up to £12,000, would be able to afford to give £200 to £750 to charities.  The Government should have allowed tax relief at the higher rate of tax also because generally speaking it is those on higher income who will avail of this facility and they will still have to pay the 21 per cent tax difference.  Perhaps the Government will consider extending this measure to charities at home.</P>
    <P>The budget of any new Government is usually the most exciting, the toughest and the one that sends a signal of what to expect for the future.  This country has spent the last ten or 15 years trying to undo the sins of the past.  Great sacrifices had to be made by many people because of the manner in which the State engaged in excessive borrowing in the 1970s and early 1980s.  One would have expected that when we had a budget surplus for the first time in 27 years, the Minister for Finance would <Col N="2043" /> have used the opportunity to ensure we did not fritter away the success we painfully gained in recent years.  It is very disappointing that borrowing will increase by 21 per cent, spending will increase by 8.6 per cent and tax will be increased by £300 million.  That is not a recipe for an economy that wants to encourage enterprise, to be prudent and show discipline.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's statement, when justifying the borrowing requirement and the current budget deficit, he said that there are special once-off factors this year and that these will not be available in 1996.  He said that while the full year costs of the measures concerned will have to be borne at that stage, this will reduce considerably the budgetary room for manoeuvre in future years. Introducing, in the best year possible, such measures in terms of the current budget deficit and public spending, and admitting that he will not have that opportunity again &mdash; very few of the provisions in this budget are once-off measures; they will have ongoing effects on budgetary requirements for future years &mdash; is not an appropriate strategy. It is a mistake that the Government has not been prudent and tough and has not lived up to the expectations outlined recently by the Taoiseach that there would be strong control over public finances and so on.</P>
    <P>When people have the opportunity to digest the effects of this budget they will be disappointed because many of the changes are not those one would expect from a Government with such a left wing influence.  I remember Deputy Rabbitte &mdash; I have the quotes here but I will not waste the time of the House reading them into the record &mdash; talking extensively about farmer taxation and the need to take more from the farming sector.  There is no evidence of Deputy Rabbitte's influence at the Cabinet table and he certainly did not succeed in taking more from the farming sector.</P>

      <P>The Government's image has been seriously tarnished.  The first legislation from this rainbow Government of renewal was to increase the number of Ministers of State from 15 to 17.  Considering the way it has handled the budget and the way it treated many deserving categories, the Government's image has been tarnished beyond repair.  We heard much talk in recent times about the need for a rotating Taoiseach.  We do not need a rotating Taoiseach because we have a Uturning Taoiseach, a Taoiseach who is U-turning so fast that he will be rotating very shortly.  He has U-turned on tax reform, the services sector, mortgage and VHI relief, residential property tax, programme managers and many other issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget from Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left is disappointing, despite the gloss they put on it, despite the leaks in advance, despite the effort for one-up-manship, despite the tension in the Government, as I understand it, of an unprecedented scale and despite the fact they promised so much.  I attended a function before Christmas &mdash; Deputy Rabbitte was also present &mdash; and many people there were very excited in anticipation of the budget because they believed Proinsias De Rossa would look after them.  However social welfare recipients received 1.5 per cent less this <Col N="2045" /> year than they received from a Progressive Democrats-Fianna Fáil Government in 1991 and 2.5 per cent less than they received from a Progressive Democrats-Fianna Fáil Government in 1990.</P>
    <P>Those who believe that putting left wing parties into Government is good for the cause of social welfare recipients or in the fight against poverty only have to examine objectively the details of this budget to see it is not radical and is not about creating a more inclusive society. It is not about empowering people, as Deputy De Rossa has advocated on many occasions.  On the contrary, this is a budget destined to help Ministers to keep up their side in Cabinet.  It is about spin-doctoring and PR.  It does not deal with the reality of today, when almost 300,000 people are unemployed.  There is no incentive for business, particularly small business.  It is a budget that has failed.  It has no overall coherent strategy. It is a hotch-potch, a great disappointment.</P>

      <P>It strikes the correct balance between the sometimes competing demands of social welfare increases and tax reliefs, while the tax and PRSI reforms should help to make significant inroads to our unacceptable level of unemployment.  The increase of approximately one third, 33 per cent, in the level of child benefit will make an unprecedented contribution towards the cost of rearing children and alleviating poverty.  If Deputy Harney reads all the reports on child benefit and poverty in families she will find that they all recommended the strategy I adopted in the budget.</P>

      <P>Although the Government has been in office for only two months and had a short time to prepare for the budget, it has gone a long way towards meeting the key objectives set out in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal.</i> We made a commitment to the employment needs of all our people, especially the long term unemployed; the development of an innovative enterprising economy which meets the demands of international competition and shares the rewards of effort, initiative and success; the reform of the tax system, in particular, to relieve the tax and PRSI burden on those with low incomes and those with families and the implementation of policies to reflect a commitment to the best quality of life for our people in terms of health care, justice, housing, education and protection of children and the family.</P>
      <P>I am particularly pleased with the direction of the tax reforms.  Too often in the past Governments gave the bulk of the tax concessions to relatively high earners while little or nothing was done for the lower earners.  These changes will particularly benefit low paid workers, but the raising of the personal allowances and the widening of the lower band will have a significant positive knock-on impact up the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The predictable criticism from Fianna <Col N="2049" /> Fáil and the Progressive Democrats of the inadequacy of the tax reforms rings hollow.  They must believe that the public has a very short memory.  The same parties came to power in 1989 promising radical tax reform but all they did was pile on the agony, especially on the PAYE sector.  The Progressive Democrats Party, in particular, has managed to portray itself as the champion of tax reform but its record in office was abysmal.</P>
    <P>The tax reforms in this budget are the most significant to have been introduced for many years but they are not by any means the end of the process. The work has begun and must now be completed in the coming years.  Not all sectors are yet paying a fair share of the tax burden and there is a particular need, as the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i> states, to &ldquo;continue the improvements in the collection system and strengthening the Revenue Commissioners' audit capacity in the fight against tax evasion&rdquo;.  I look forward to the support of the Progressive Democrats for our efforts in that regard.</P>
    <P>A number of the reforms in the budget were introduced after lobbying by business and employer organisations. They have secured reductions in the level of employers' PRSI and a reduced corporation tax rate and it is not unreasonable now to expect that business people who sought such reforms will now deliver the extra jobs which they promised would flow from these moves.  In the coming year the Government must set about monitoring and evaluating these reforms to ensure that they are effective as job creators.</P>
    <P>The radical social welfare provisions must be seen in the context of the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> which commits the Government to a radical shift of income and resources in our society, to stimulating enterprise and job creation, to rewarding work in all its forms and to ensuring social solidarity between those who are better off and those who are less so.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare has a crucial role to play in achieving <Col N="2050" /> these aims.  Nowadays that role goes far beyond the safety-net role of seeking to ensure that everyone has a minimal income.  Our objective is to ensure an adequate income and social support for everyone, an objective which has not yet been achieved.  We can and must also play an increasingly pro-active role in relation to work and enterprise of all kinds, paid or unpaid, facilitate employment and experiments with employment, however atypical or unorthodox by traditional standards, and provide the real economic and social security that enables citizens to interact positively with the new forms of work emerging.  We must take account of the labour market as it now is and is becoming, namely more flexible, even volatile, with many changes in the hours people work and in the type of work that is needed.  We must also take account of and plan for the demographic changes that are clearly underway &mdash; falling birth rates, varying family types and more older people &mdash; and address the need for better support for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The changes in the labour market must be paralleled by changes in how we deliver social welfare; greater economic flexibility and the insecurity that may create must be matched by greater social security and flexibility in our support systems.  Gone are the days of hardand-fast distinctions between those who are working and those who are welfare recipients.  Gone also are the days when the 40 hour working week was dominant. Most workers can expect to rely on social welfare at various times in their employment or life cycle, even before reaching pension age, and most welfare recipients hope to enter or reenter the paid workforce as opportunities arise.</P>
    <P>Greater independence and equality for women must also be mirrored in equal rights to income support and social services that facilitate men and women in search of a balanced distribution of work and responsibility within the workforce and the family.  I look forward to the day when no man or woman <Col N="2051" /> in our society is reluctant or afraid to take up any form of work &mdash; be it a few days well-paid freelance work, a few weeks part-time work or a few years unpaid work in the home with children &mdash; because of the fear of losing social welfare benefits or ending up worse off for their pains.</P>
    <P>I have a twofold approach to social welfare: first, to increase social payments to a level that provides an adequate income for those who cannot provide for themselves and, second, to tackle the traps in our system which prevent people from taking up work or education and training or family responsibilities.  I intend to do this in a somewhat different manner from my predecessors, for example, Deputy McCreevy who was in the Department of Social Welfare when Deputy Harney was in Government with Fianna Fáil. Rather than reducing benefits, making it more difficult for people to qualify or complicating the system with new rules each year, as Deputy McCreevy did, my objective is to minimise the obstacles by reducing the extent to which people lose basic income supports as a result of taking up employment, to simplify the system and to iron out the anomalies which arise at the various points where the tax and welfare systems operate at crosspurposes.</P>
    <P>The integration of tax and social welfare is a concept to which I have long been committed; indeed mine was the only political party to have advocated it, in its submissions to both the Commissions on Taxation and on Social Welfare, more than a decade ago.  Since then it has passed into the conventional wisdom and has begun to mean many things to many people.  I am confident that the report of the expert group on this issue, due later this year, will serve to clarify many of the complex issues involved and point the way forward; I will be particularly interested in the group's views on the question of a basic income for all citizens.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, during the life of the <Col N="2052" /> Government, we are committed to providing a form of basic income for children, through the creation of a child benefit supplement.  This will be payable, in addition to the universal child benefit, to all families whose income is below a certain level &mdash; irrespective of whether that income is from social welfare or employment, or a combination of the two.  This will provide a baseline level of support for children, and those who care for them, and will target resources effectively at those in our society who are at greatest risk of poverty &mdash; families with larger numbers of children.  It will also remove one of the worst poverty and unemployment traps in the existing system, which arises from the loss of child support when a person with children takes up employment.  The new child benefit supplement will incorporate the child dependant allowances paid to people on social welfare and the family income supplement payable to people on low income from employment. Having established a good basic child benefit payment this year we are now preparing for the introduction of the supplement in future budgets.</P>
    <P>The other improvements we are introducing have their own significance and I do not wish to downplay them by over-emphasising the importance of the child benefit increase.  However, child benefit accounts for some 38 per cent of total additional social welfare spending this year and almost 50 per cent of the full year cost.  Even so we have succeeded in achieving many other important improvements.</P>
    <P>We are providing a total of over £90 million for social welfare and related improvements in 1995 and £212 million on a full year cost basis.  Contrary to what Deputies Ahern and Harney said, this accounts for one-third of the increased expenditure in the budget. This is a significant increase and is much more, as alleged by Deputy Harney, than a 1.5 per cent increase to social welfare recipients.  These are huge amounts of money by any standards. Their size alone demonstrates this new Government's concern about poverty in <Col N="2053" /> our society.  The way in which the resources are focused demonstrates our commitment to the priorities to which I already referred.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that Deputies Ahern and Harney in one breath complain that &ldquo;goodies&rdquo; are being spread all over the place &mdash; one for every person in the audience &mdash; and that there is no strategy and at the same time decry the fact that a greater proportion of moneys will be spent on children and families in this social welfare budget than on other categories of social welfare recipients: they cannot have it both ways and must make up their minds.</P>
    <P>We are also allocating £60 million for equal treatment payments this year.  Of this, nearly £50 million is coming from the social insurance fund and I would like to explain, especially to Deputy McCreevy who despite having spent nine months at the Department of Social Welfare does not seem to understand it, how the social insurance fund operates.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of Social Welfare Acts expenditure on social insurance payments must be met from the social insurance fund.  Almost all the equality payments are social insurance benefits, principally disability benefit and unemployment benefit.  Therefore, the cost of these payments must be met out of the fund in line with the legal requirement.  A minor element of the costs will relate to unemployment assistance and this expenditure will be met by the Exchequer, not by the social insurance fund.  There is, therefore, no question of us plundering or raiding the social insurance fund as alleged by Deputy McCreevy.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other socal welfare improvements which I have included in an appendix to my speech to save time.</P>
    <P>On top of the other social welfare improvements a 2.5 per cent increase is being given in all weekly social welfare and health board payments.  I emphasise that this increase will be paid six weeks earlier than normal this year.  If anyone cares to do arithmetic they will discover <Col N="2054" /> that this is equivalent to an increase of 3 per cent.  Paying the increase of 2.5 per cent six weeks earlier will be much more useful as people will have the money in their pockets sooner.  In addition it will reduce the liability of those on unemployment benefit to tax and the possibility of pensioners living in local authority houses being exposed to increases in differential rent.  Last year many pensioners approached me to highlight the fact that they had been granted an increase of £2 but that £1.60 of this was taken by the corporation by way of an increase in differential rent.</P>
    <P>The increase which will apply to personal rates and adult dependant allowances is designed to compensate social welfare recipients for the expected increase in prices this year and thereby maintain their real income position.  In so doing a major commitment in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> is being honoured.  However, I am particularly pleased to be able to bring the new rates into effect from mid-June instead of the previous implementation date of late July.  This move has been a long-standing demand by me in Opposition and by many organisations and individuals who were aggrieved at the timelag of up to six months between the announcement of rate increases and their implementation date.  For most people the increased rates will be paid as they fall due from mid-June. However, there will be a group of people who already have order books that go beyond mid-June and clearly separate arrangements will have to be made for them to receive their increase. These people, about 260,000, will be paid the increased amount in arrears the following month.</P>
    <P>I am personally in favour of implementing the increases as close as possible to the budget announcements, at least in line with the changes in personal taxation, to put social welfare recipients on a par with those at work. I will be pressing the question of bringing the payment date back even further in the context of next year's budget.  I am asking my Department to gear itself <Col N="2055" /> up to changing its production schedules to facilitate this to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>Child dependant allowances will, however, be payable up to age 22, instead of age 21, for those in full-time education in the case of recipients of long term social welfare payments to ensure that young people can stay in college to further their studies.</P>
    <P>The general increase in weekly rates is by far the most expensive single item in the social welfare budget improvements. It will cost almost £43 million this year and almost £77 million in a full year.  Bringing forward the payment date by six weeks represents £9 million in 1995.</P>
    <P>Child dependant allowances payable with all weekly social welfare and health board payments are not being increased in this budget.  They are, however, being maintained at their July 1994 rate.  This is consistent with their replacement by our proposed new child benefit supplement. However, the 33p increase which would have accrued for indexing them is incorporated in the £7 per month increase in child benefit.  Deputy McCreevey yesterday made great play out of the fact that this is the first time child dependant allowances have been frozen, but it is also the first time that child benefit has been increased by anything like £7, which more than offsets that 33p loss.</P>
    <P>In addition to the increase in the payments, it is also proposed from next September to pay child benefit for 18 year olds for those in full-time education, including those attending FÁS courses for which no weekly course allowance is payable.  Under present arrangements, child benefit ceases to be payable when a child turns 18, irrespective of whether full-time education is being pursued.  Similarly, child benefit is not currently payable to 18 year olds on FÁS courses without a weekly allowance. These improvements will be welcomed in the context of changes in the <Col N="2056" /> school-leaving age following the introduction of the transition year in second-level schools and also the need to rationalise entitlements where certain FÁS courses are concerned.</P>
    <P>Because time is running out I will move on to the carer's allowance.  A section dealing with PRSI is included in my speech and I ask Deputies, if they are interested, to read the text circulated. I am pleased to be able to continue the trend of previous years in progressively improving the carer's allowance which was introduced in 1990 as an income maintenance payment for those who provide full-time care and attention to social welfare pensioners and certain disabled people.  This is a benefit for pensioners which Deputies Ahern, McCreevy and Harney have ignored.</P>
    <P>This year, I propose to extend the carer's allowance to people looking after pensioners over 66 years who are in receipt of non-social welfare pensions, for example, those in receipt of occupational pensions.  This is a major improvement which will bring another group of pensioners within the ambit of the allowance &mdash; those who are on relatively low pensions from employment.  It will remove the distinction between people whose pensions are from social welfare and those whose pensions, though perhaps similar in money terms, are purely occupational.  Many of those who benefit will be former public servants on fairly low pensions.</P>
    <P>I am also easing yet again the means test for the carer's allowance which has always been criticised as being unduly restrictive.  The earnings disregard of £100 per week announced last year is being increased to £150 per week and will apply not only to earnings from work but to all types of income such as pensions.  Many people who left work and claimed pensions found they did not qualify because it referred to earned income.</P>
    <P>The disabled persons' maintenance allowance is funded at present by the Department of Health.  From later this <Col N="2057" /> year, responsibility for this will be transferred to my Department and an amount of £45 million is being provided in my Department's Estimate for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The new funding arrangement is a necessary first step to my Department taking over direct responsibility for administering the scheme.  It is more appropriate that it be integrated with the income maintenance services of my Department.  This was recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare and in a number of other reports down the years and it is time to act on this.  It will open the way to streamlining and simplifying the income maintenance provisions for sick and disabled people generally and I will be examining these provisions in the light of the forthcoming report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  My Department will be discussing immediately with the Department of Health and the health boards the implications of transferring responsibility for the scheme.</P>
    <P>In response to the concern expressed generally about young people being forced to leave home in order to qualify for unemployment assistance, the minimum payment is now being substantially increased from £10 to £25 per week for those assessed while living at home. Again, that is significantly more than 2.5 per cent, which is being alleged by those who are picking holes in this budget.  In addition, the assessment of the benefit of board and privilege while at home will, in future apply only to those living at home with their parents.  This will remove many people from an assessment which has been criticised over the years as intrusive and sometimes unfair.</P>
    <P>I believe I only have five minutes remaining to me but I would need another two hours to complete my contribution. Before concluding, I want to refer to deserted wife's benefit because some confusion has arisen from misreporting of this particular reform of the social welfare code.  We propose to integrate the existing lone parent's allowance and deserted wife's benefit into a <Col N="2058" /> uniform scheme for parents, men or women, caring for children on their own and to abolish the requirement to prove desertion.  Let me be clear about this. We are not abolishing the payment of deserted wife's benefit; we are abolishing the concept of desertion, the requirement that a woman must prove she has been deserted by her husband before she can receive the benefit.  We want to remove this intrusive and judgmental rule from the system and simply provide income support to people who, for whatever reason, are raising children on their own and need financial assistance.  We also intend to remove the sex discrimination from this scheme because it is a fact that some men find themselves in this situation and they, too, should be eligible for support in future.  Nobody currently in receipt of deserted wife's benefit will lose out as a result of this change and people can and should continue to apply for deserted wife's benefit in the normal way until the change is introduced by legislation in this House.</P>
    <P>At present, deserted wife's benefit begins to be reduced if the woman has earnings in excess of a certain amount of money.  These earnings ceilings are higher for people on the means-tested lone parent's allowance.  Our intention is that the new unified payment for people raising children on their own will not be fully means-tested but will be withdrawn gradually as the recipient achieves relatively high levels of earnings. This will be done in such a way as to avoid creating any poverty or unemployment traps for people in this situation as it is a major priority of this Government to remove such traps.</P>
    <P>There is a range of improvements in the budget in relation to back to school clothing and footwear allowances where we have provided £5 increases.  That is much more than 2.5 per cent.  It is 14 per cent in regard to primary school children and 10 per cent in regard to secondary children and will assist approximately 285,000 children attending school.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2059" /> The free schemes are being extended. A colour licence will now be available to all pensioners who qualified in the past for black and white television licences.  A travel companion pass will be available to people who are being cared for by a recipient of the carer's allowance.  The companion pass will be usable by any person travelling with the person being cared for; it is not confined to the carer.  That is an important advance in the provision we make for those who are being cared for.</P>
    <P>There is also a novel and useful extension of the free travel scheme whereby pensioners who have free travel will be enabled to travel to Northern Ireland free of charge.  In the course of the next few weeks, I hope to reach agreement with my counterpart in Northern Ireland on a similar arrangement for pensioners in Northern Ireland to travel to the Republic.  A sum of £200,000 has been set aside in the budget for that scheme.</P>
    <P>There are many other budget measures relating to the aligning of pension rights, including a significant one relating to homemakers where we are increasing the age of children being cared for from six to 12 years for the purpose of men or women who leave the workforce to care for children and maintain their eligibility for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>I must pass over the section in my speech dealing with employment.  I want to refer to the students' summer jobs scheme which was one of the more significant and controversial programmes introduced by my predecessor.  This programme commenced in 1993 and approximately 9,000 students now participate in it.  That is an indication of its importance to both the students and the various groups who sponsor projects. The Union of Students in Ireland continue to oppose it in principle as workfare. I find workfare also to be repugnant and I am seeking ways to enhance the voluntary nature of the scheme.  I intend to meet members of the USI soon to discuss with them how the <Col N="2060" /> increased funding now available in this budget for the scheme can be used to the best advantage of students who need assistance to remain in education.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I wish to say that the appendices in my speech will be circulated in the Official Report for the information of Deputies.  They contain a summary of all of the social welfare improvements and also some of the grants which the Department of Social Welfare has agreed to allocate.</P>
    <P>My Department will be taking responsibility for the National Social Services Board which provides, among other things, valuable information services. I am providing £250,000 to the National Social Services Board to develop an information project &mdash; the computerisation of integrated information on social services.  It is important that accurate independent information be made available to citizens which would be by way of a second opinion in relation to information they may obtain from Government Departments.  This is an important development in terms of the commitment in our programme that citizens have not only the right to freedom of information but also the right of access to information at the most basic level.  It is important that the NSSB will now be enabled to develop an independent information service which hopefully will also provide an advocacy service necessary for many of our citizens.</P>
    <P>I regret I do not have sufficient time to read the remainder of my speech into the record but I thank the Deputies present for their courtesy in allowing me the extra time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Never in my time in this House since 1977 have I seen so much contempt for the institutions of this State and for this House, or so much disrespect for the statutory position of the Ceann Comhairle, by the leaking to cronies of the present Administration the details of this budget.  I feel personally insulted to have received a copy of the Financial Statement of the Minister for Finance with a note to the effect that it was confidential and that it must not be removed from the Chamber until the Minister for Finance had completed his budget.  I would ask the Ceann Comhairle to take up this matter as a matter of grave concern with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I draw the attention of the Government to the Government procedure instructions currently in force on confidentiality on page 8, paragraph 15.  The reference is S. 78770B, 28 October 1983.</P>
      <P>Each Minister should set up a system which restricts circulation of Government papers in the Department to defined persons and to discuss the higher management in the Department the question of such additional procedures and controls as may be appropriate in the circumstances. In each case in which a breach of security has occurred, a special investigation should be initiated, with the Garda Síochána being called in to assist as necessary.</P>
      <P>I want to know if such an investigation has been initiated.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that modern financial management requires a far greater degree of both long term planning and short term adjustment than was the case in the days of relatively minor year on year changes in fundamental economic realities.  This trend has had the effect of diminishing the once all-important role of the annual budget in setting economic parameters for the year ahead. Despite these observations, the occasion of the budget continues to be a vital one particularly in terms of allowing the incumbent Government show its calibre in two extremely important ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2067" /> First, it is given the opportunity of introducing necessary adjustments to a range of State services, particularly in those areas which attempt to redress social deprivation.  Complementary steps are usually taken with the primary purpose of improving the climate for stimulating economic development and real growth of wealth in our society.</P>
    <P>The second major opportunity afforded to a Government by a budget is to facilitate the introduction of major policy initiatives which are targeted at problems of particular gravity.  My assessment of this budget is largely influenced by the manner in which the Government has taken the opportunity of addressing these key issues.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the specifics of this budget, it is important to consider the context of its presentation.  Since this is the first budget presented by a Fine Gael-led Government since 1987, it is opportune to recall how the last Fine Gael-led Administration left the national finances.  Using any financial indicator &mdash; for example, the national debt, the borrowing requirement, interest rates, the trend in unemployment figures &mdash; the story was the same. The 1982-87 Government left the national finances and economy in a state of profound danger and depression.</P>

      <P>What state did you leave it in in 1977?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite a background of widespread pessimism, little realistic hope and hard-bitten cynicism, each Fianna Fáil-led Government since 1987 has made a substantial contribution to the process of restoring economic sanity and well-being.  Improvements during the two-year period of office of the Fianna Fáil-Labour partnership Government have been especially dramatic and profound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This fact is clearly proven if one considers a range of economic indicators such as the national debt as a proportion of GDP, the balance of payments, the borrowing requirements, <Col N="2068" /> export growth or the average mortgage interest rate.  From being a very compromised patient in the EU's intensive care unit after the last Fine Gael-led Government, we now have one of the most healthy national economic infrastructures in the Community.  Furthermore, EU Structural Funds are about to provide a major boost to an already buoyant economy.</P>
    <P>Finally, the dramatic breakthrough in the political situation in Northern Ireland has added a further advantage of inestimable value which ensures that any Government preparing the 1995 budget has a clear and unequivocal opportunity to tackle what is without doubt our major outstanding national problem, that is, unemployment and the associated poverty and social deprivation. It would take political cynicism of an unprecedented degree for any Government to disagree with the premise that the climate is now ideal to purposefully confront unemployment and poverty in a systematic, determined and effective manner.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, the standard expected of this budget, especially in relation to redressing social deprivation and disadvantage, was extremely high. Expectations have been raised even further by the fact that the Minister responsible for social welfare has a long history of public commitment to those who are most under-privileged in our society.  Therefore, the burning question is how well the rainbow Ministers have done in the first major test of their political credibility which has been so undermined already by a series of U-turns and somersaults rarely seen outside of the professional circus ring.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As spokesman on social welfare, my first unequivocal reaction to the budget is one of dismay.  At a time of major opportunity to provide real increases in the standard of living among those who are most deprived in our society, it is beyond belief that this <Col N="2069" /> rainbow Government should treat their just and urgent needs with cruel indifference. Can anyone seriously defend a paltry increase of £1.50 per week for someone on a basic income of £61?  Yet this is exactly the extent of the consideration given by Minister De Rossa and his Cabinet colleagues to recipients of the old age non-contributory pension, the blind pension, and the basic unemployment benefit and assistance.</P>
      <P>Social welfare increases of 2.5 per cent will at best cover the rate of inflation and can only be interpreted as a studied insult to the poorest members of our society.  There is no excuse, particularly this year, for this callous behaviour.</P>
      <P>As recently as last month, the Combat Poverty Agency published a report entitled &ldquo;Bridging the Divide&rdquo; which outlined a medium-term strategy to tackle poverty and promote economic and social cohesion.  At the outset the report states:</P>
      <P>The sacrifices of recent years are about to be translated into a lengthy period of sustainable economic growth, increased employment and higher living standards.  The signs are that these benefits may by-pass the have-nots of society &mdash; the unemployed and other low income groups &mdash; unless urgent remedial action is taken.  Allowing social exclusion to persist is not alone socially unjust, it is also wasteful and limits the potential for economic development.  Remedying this perverse situation will require the adoption of a new economic paradigm based on maximising job creation, ensuring a fairer distribution of job opportunities and sharing resources in a way that strengthens the capacity of excluded households and communities to engage in the development process. The forecast economic upturn provides an unparalleled opportunity for tackling poverty in a lasting way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is one to make of this budget? There is only one reasonable conclusion that can be drawn from the evidence <Col N="2070" /> before us.  It is my considered opinion that the main thrust of this budget comes from what seems to be the only significant thread unifying the three rainbow partners, namely, the over-riding importance of ensuring electoral advantage at all costs.  It is an established fact that those who are most disadvantaged are also least likely to exercise their electoral prerogative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The only clear signal from the budget is that the unambiguous credo of the rainbow Government is &ldquo;might is right&rdquo;.  The Minister, Deputy De Rossa, and indeed the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, are now only too aware of the reason for the Taoiseach's insistence at all costs that Fine <Col N="2071" /> Gael obtains a majority of Cabinet seats.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Ministers have obviously come to the cynical conclusion that for diverse political reasons its Government partners have little choice but to knuckle under whenever there is a difference of opinion on a substantive issue.  A combination of total ideological separation, and historic distrust and antagonism, unfortunately make this situation only too predictable.</P>
      <P>I will return later to the grave consequences of the fact that our rainbow Government does not even share a common political language not to mind common policy objectives and strategies.  I will return to a more detailed consideration of the principal features of the budget.</P>
      <P>I obtained my copy of the <i>Principal Features of the Budget</i> later than most people in the media and around the country.  The first page provides alarming information, namely the Government's intention to change a current budget surplus of £15 million for 1994 to an estimated deficit of no less than £310 million for 1995, representing a deterioration of £325 million.  For what? The sacrifices made during the past eight years in getting a budget surplus for the first time in 27 years?  There is no doubt that this budget will drive up interest rates and start the spiral of the 1980s, which is regrettable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine what the Minister for Social Welfare is offering to recipients apart from those mentioned earlier in my presentation.  First of all we see a proposal to increase the survivor's pension from £64.50 by just £1.60.  Deserted wives under 80 years are provided with the exact same remuneration.  The personal rate of disability benefit has been increased by just £1.50.  Again the exact same statistics apply to the carer's allowance as to the personal rate of preretirement and infectious diseases maintenance allowances.  An absolutely miserable increase of £1 per week is provided for the orphan's non-contributory <Col N="2072" /> pension.  A nugget worthy of Scrooge himself is seen in the case of the living alone allowance which increased by 10p from £4.80 to £4.90 per week.</P>
    <P>To be fair to the Minister, the increase of £7 in child benefit is both generous and welcome.  Similarly I welcome the proposals in relation to back to school payments, free cross-Border journeys for all pensioners North and South of the Border, increased grants to various community and voluntary services, and the free colour television licence for all social welfare pensioners currently receiving an electricity allowance. While I do not propose to deal in any great detail with budgetary matters outside the social welfare area, I give a guarded welcome to the proposals in relation to PRSI and PAYE reform. While the proposals are undoubtedly in the right direction, I would have definite reservations regarding the balance achieved in the proposals.  In particular, I fear their value in the all-important area of job creation will not approach the level which is absolutely necessary to fuel the rapid economic growth fundamental to major reductions in the number of people unemployed.</P>
    <P>When examining the various social welfare provisions, it is useful to divide them into two main categories, first those which are directly related to unemployment, and second, those such as retirement pensions and children's allowances which are relatively independent of employment status.  When considering the first category of social welfare recipients, one must obviously also take into account factors such as industrial development, educational facilities and health care provisions. These matters impact directly on both the current quality of life and future aspirations of unemployment-related social welfare beneficiaries.  The key associated governmental and in particular budgetary requirements are meticulous integrated policy development and carefully planned policy implementation and subsequent audit.  No matter how carefully one examines the contents of this budget, there is little evidence that <Col N="2073" /> either of these concepts received more than cursory attention in its development. On reflection one could hardly be surprised at this deficiency since perhaps never before in the history of the State have we had a Government comprised of parties with little more than nationality in common.</P>
    <P>The fact that the current budget largely fails to cater for those most vulnerable in society does not, and cannot mean that their cause is not yet comprehensively addressed for at least another 12 months.  Rather an increasing focus must be placed on ensuring that the necessary effective and caring policies are rapidly developed for implementation at the earliest possible time.  In this regard a number of issues must be taken into account.  For example, we may not be fully aware of the degree of social welfare dependency in our society with in excess of 40 per cent of the community in receipt of some such payments. Thus a very high proportion of Government decisions have either a direct or indirect relevance for the social welfare sector.  All too often it is only too easy to ignore this basic but vitally important reality.  Another critical point to keep in mind when attempting to address the issue of poverty is the fact that effective Government action is all important &mdash; aspirations and sympathy are of no value.  I continue to stress the failure of this budget to attack the roots of marked social inequality since nothing less than the future social cohesion of our society is at stake.</P>
    <P>The rate of deposit interest retention tax on special savings accounts is being increased from 10 to 15 per cent with effect from 6 April.  As everybody knows elderly people are concerned about funeral expenses and getting a decent burial and they put aside a few pounds for that purpose.  Undoubtedly the increase in the DIRT tax will affect that section of the community.</P>
    <P>The most generous comment I can make about this budget is that it is good in some isolated patches, it is mediocre in a number of other patches and finally it is inadequate in many instances.  In <Col N="2074" /> summary it seems that the Government was not able to come to terms with the critical need to place the country first, above and beyond all party considerations. The unprecedented opportunity inherited as a legacy from the outgoing Fianna Fáil-Labour Government had to be sacrificed for simple political expediency. The time was ripe to take courageous and innovative steps which would immediately tackle the unemployment and social deprivation problems head-on through a range of interlinking and incremental industrial and social development policies.  Unfortunately, the Government has resorted to a very simplistic form of economic planning which seems to consist mainly of add a few per cent here and take a few per cent there, and hope that it will work out in the end.</P>

      <P>To continue:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not more than 50 days into the life of this Government and the sense of public disappointment and let down has been palpable.  Most people expected a flurry of announcements, policy initiatives and new legislation during the early days of the Government.  Instead we have had a humiliating number of U-turns, a budget that has disappointed virtually everybody, a decision to sell the remaining public shareholding in a <Col N="2076" /> State company and a legislative cup-board that is virtually bare.</P>
    <P>The sense of public disappointment has been compounded by the apparent preoccupation with appointing extra advisers and Ministers.</P>
    <P>The potential annual cost of the special advisers, assistants and programme managers for Ministers and Ministers of State may amount to more than £2.25 million.  Ministers and Ministers of State are, of course, entitled to the support necessary to enable them do their job but the appointment of special advisers and assistants has now got out of hand. Some control will have to be introduced.</P>
    <P>This quotation depends largely on the original efforts of the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, in his address to the Dáil during March 1993.</P>

      <P>These comments by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, during a budget debate in February 1993 are hopefully not appropriate in the aftermath of the 1995 budget.  I sincerely hope that the rainbow Government gets down immediately to serious and effective policymaking.  Anything less will simply not be tolerated by the people who now richly deserve a period of prolonged growth and prosperity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Costello.</P>
      <P>Education is the most pervasive and sustained interaction between the child, the family and the State and I believe that it is the most important such relationship.  The importance of the individual child is central to my vision of education.  My aim is to ensure the provision of a comprehensive, costeffect and accessible education system of the highest quality which will enable individuals to develop to their full potential as persons and to participate fully as citizens in society.</P>
      <P>I have endeavoured to ensure that the provision for education in the 1995 budget reflects my concern for the individual child at all stages of her or his educational development, a concern which is reflected also in the education chapter of the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal.</i></P>
      <P>The importance of the educational development of the individual in early childhood and, in particular, its role in combating disadvantage is now widely recognised by OECD, UNESCO and the Council of Europe.  I share this recognition of the key role of early childhood education.  The programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> contains a commitment to expansion of pre-school facilities with the ultimate aim of an integrated professional national system linked to the primary school system.</P>
      <P>We have provided for eight pre-schools under the Early Start programme last year.  These pre-schools are located in areas of severe disadvantage. They are designed to offer young children an educational experience which will enhance their overall development and lay a foundation for successful educational attainment in future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have put in place a monitoring committee, drawn from a wide range of experts in education and pre-schooling, to advise on the future development of <Col N="2078" /> the Early Start facilities referred to in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal.</i> The progress made last year in initiating the Early Start pre-school projects will be furthered very significantly by the 1995 provision which will enable me to expand the number of such pre-schools from eight to 33.</P>
    <P>A crucial feature of the followthrough from Early Start is the development of the home-school links programme for primary and post-primary schools.  The fostering of effective links between school and home enhances children's participation in education leading to an improvement in retention rates to the end of second level.  The programme also helps increase the transfer rates to third level by children from disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>
    <P>The home-school links scheme is targeted at the adults &mdash; parents and teachers &mdash; whose attitudes and behaviour impinge directly on the lives of children. Its vision is of parents being centrally involved in their children's education and of a collaboration of the skills, knowledge and experience of parents and teachers in partnership for the children's benefit.</P>
    <P>The 1995 budget provision enables me to increase significantly the number of teachers at first and second level involved in the home-school links programmes. A total of 60 new home-school links teachers will be appointed in primary and post primary schools.</P>
    <P>The quality of education which children at primary level receive will be significantly enhanced by the retention of some 340 teaching posts which would otherwise have been lost in primary schools due to falling enrolment.</P>
    <P>Retention of these posts will allow the pupil-teacher ratio for primary schools to be reduced from 23:4 in September 1994 to 22.9:1 in September 1995.  It will also allow the general maximum class size guidelines for schools to be reduced by two in the 1995-96 school year.  Thus no class in any primary school will exceed 35 pupils next year and the <Col N="2079" /> maximum class size in all schools designated disavantaged will not exceed 29 pupils.</P>
    <P>Our education provision must be targeted at the needs of each child, including children with special needs.  The retention of posts will enable me to allocate 55 remedial teachers for children who need to avail of remedial help and additional teachers for travellers will be appointed in addition to the 60 home-school links teachers to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>Children attending special classes in ordinary national schools will benefit from the improved pupil-teacher ratio which will result in a more favourable staffing schedule for 1995-96.  I will appoint additional resource teachers to enrich the education of children with special needs who attend ordinary classes in national schools and further teaching posts will be allocated to schools designated as disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>In special schools, a total of 45 new posts will be created resulting in a significant improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio in these schools; an improvement in line with the recommendations of the Special Education Review Committee report.</P>
    <P>Children at primary level will also benefit from the provision of ten extra psychologists.  These psychologists will work with the ten psychologists already provided for in last year's budget and their appointment represents another important step in meeting the commitment in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i> for increased access by all children to psychological services.</P>
    <P>The learning environment of all children will be improved by an increase in the basic rate primary capitation grant which will be 43 per cent higher in 1995 than when I first took office as Minister for Education.</P>

      <P>This year, I have particularly targeted funding for schools designated as disadvantaged whose <Col N="2080" /> grant per pupil rises from £45 to £55 in the 1995 budget.</P>
      <P>The quality of children's education can be either positively or negatively affected by the kinds of learning environment experienced within the school. An essential ingredient of the school environment is a wide variety of books and attractive printed materials.</P>
      <P>Grants for library services to primary schools are being increased by 90 per cent in 1995.  I am convinced this will contribute greatly in establishing the conditions necessary for the development of a child's literacy skills.  A recent international survey of reading literacy found that the availability of books at home, in the school and in the community was highly correlated with success in reading attainment.</P>
      <P>The quality of education of the student at second-level will be improved by a range of measures in this budget. The 1995 allocation provides for an increase of £7 in the grant per student payable to voluntary secondary schools with <i>pro-rata</i> increases to community, comprehensive and the vocational education committee schools.  Thus a 600student secondary school will receive an increase of £4,200 in funding fo 1995-96.</P>
      <P>Some 700 additional posts at second-level will be allocated.  Some of these posts will be required for the increasing numbers of students at second level due to the availability of the transition year to all schools.</P>
      <P>The allocation of a second vice-principal to larger schools is a first step in recognising the increasing complexity of providing high quality school management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The complexity of school management is mirrored by the complexity of choices facing our young people &mdash; choices of subject areas, of further studies and of alternative programmes within the leaving certificate.  Allied to this is the reliance which we, as a society, place on our schools to foster the overall development of young people, to counsel them and to provide supports at times of difficulty.  The guidance counsellor has a key role to play in both the <Col N="2081" /> pastoral and academic provisions in schools.  I am pleased to be able to provide for an additional 100 guidance counsellors this year; an increase of almost 25 per cent in one year alone.</P>
    <P>A further 76 remedial teachers will be appointed to second-level schools this year to provide support for students who need remedial help.  Additional visiting teachers for travellers will be appointed.</P>
    <P>A specially important initiative in the 1995 budget is the appointment of 60 resource teachers for students with special needs attending ordinary second-level schools&mdash;a move designed to support inclusion of these students in the ordinary school system where appropriate.</P>
    <P>The quality of teaching is central to the education of our students.  This means that we must support our teachers in their work.  Last year I announced a major in-service programme for teachers for the period 1994-99.  This year, I have allocated posts to provide, for the first time, a pilot welfare service for teachers, an initiative which is essential to assist teachers maintain high standards in the educational provisions for all students.</P>
    <P>All students in second-level schools will benefit from an improved environment since the caretaking and clerical services in these schools will be further expanded in 1995.</P>
    <P>For families who have difficulty in meeting the cost of school books, the school books scheme provisons at second-level has been increased by one million pounds.  This will provide a major encouragement to the very successful school books rental scheme I launched last year.</P>
    <P>The curriculum is one of the key instruments which determines the quality of the education which the student receives in the classroom.  Substantial progress has been made with the new junior certificate programme which has deepened the quality of students' educational experience in terms of knowledge, understanding, attitudes, skills and competencies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2082" /> A major restructuring of the senior cycle is under way, involving four main elements: the availability of the transition year programme for all second-level schools; the revision of the established leaving certificate programme; the introduction of a new leaving certificate applied programme and the development and expansion of the leaving certificate vocational programme.</P>
    <P>The 1995 budget ensures that substantial progress will be made in these areas with an increase in the provision for the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment of 17 per cent.</P>
    <P>Certification for the expanding post leaving certificate courses is also an urgent priority and is reflected in an 80 per cent increase in the funding for the National Council for Vocational Awards.</P>
    <P>The thrust of my intervention in this debate has focused mainly on the impact of the budget on the individual child up to the end of second-level education. I would now like to add a few brief comments on the effect of the budget on access to and provision for the young person at third-level.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made for an increase in third-level places by: increasing the grants in respect of the running costs of regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology by 9 per cent; developing the commitment in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> programme to establish an urban college in Dún Laoghaire and the Tipperary Rural Business Development Institute; increasing the vocational education committee scholarship fund by 13 per cent and increasing the provision for ESF student grants by 14 per cent.</P>
    <P>This will provide a significant increase of 2,000 third-level student places.</P>

      <P>I would like to turn finally to the issue of access to education. I am firmly committed to free access to education at first, second and third-level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2083" /> The 1995 budget proposes to improve access to third-level by the phased abolition of fees.  In this way many people on modest incomes, outside the income eligibility limits for higher education grants and who are experiencing growing financial hardship in providing a third-level education for their children, will be helped to overcome an enormous financial and psychological barrier to access.</P>
    <P>We have to see the abolition of third-level fees as part of the overall funding of higher education.  At present the Government pays almost £300 million to third-level colleges through a block grant.  In addition, more than half of all students already obtain fee grants.  Thus, the Government provides three-quarters of all university funding and more than 90 per cent of funding of regional colleges.  Most courses in the regional colleges are funded by the European Social Fund and no fees are charged on those courses.</P>
    <P>In addition, although more than half of all students get fee grants, there is a real problem of lack of public confidence in the higher education grant schemes.  This stems from a perception that certain groups, particularly PAYE taxpayers, fare worse in the means-testing than the non-PAYE sector.  Every Dáil Deputy can cite specific examples of where there seem to be serious inequities in the schemes.</P>
    <P>The weakness of the grant schemes may explain why students from disadvantaged backgrounds have been shown to be more likely to take Europeanfunded courses than courses where fees are payable even though they would be eligible to receive fee grants.</P>
    <P>The commitment in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> policy agreement to free third-level education means that we are pledged to introduce a fairer system of third-level funding for all students.</P>
    <P>I have proposed that the removal of fees will be implemented in two stages in conjunction with changes in the tax relief arrangements for covenants as follows: first, in the 1995-96 academic year <Col N="2084" /> students will pay half fees; second, in the academic year 1996-97 undergraduate fees will be completely abolished; and third, in conjunction with the removal of fees, the Minister for Finance has announced phased changes in the current tax relief arrangements for covenants.</P>
    <P>This means, in effect, that from January 1996, access to third-level education will be free.</P>
    <P>The abolition of undergraduate and post leaving certificate course fees has been achieved through the &ldquo;re-routing&rdquo; of existing students support mechanisms, including the phasing out of income tax covenant relief.</P>
    <P>Through student grants and covenant relief, the Exchequer is already meeting the brunt of the costs of fees for third level but in an inequitable and regressive way.  Covenants benefit the better off disproportionately.</P>
    <P>The restriction of covenant relief will enable the tax foregone to be converted into direct expenditure on the abolition of fees which is fairer to all.</P>
    <P>The expenditure involved will assist those who derived little or no benefit from covenant relief.  It is estimated that when the full year savings from the removal of covenant relief are available to fund the abolition of undergraduate fees, the net additional cost to the Exchequer will be approximately £6 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>In addition, I am providing £2 million to remove any charges for post leaving certificate courses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I emphasise that the abolition of fees is just one part of my overall strategy to encourage all students to remain in and participate fully in the education system.  To assist in this commitment a wide range of initiatives and improvements have been implemented at first and second level, and targeted at areas of greatest need. These include the provision of 60 home link teachers, 131 remedial teachers and <Col N="2085" /> 100 guidance teachers, the tripling of the primary disadvantaged fund, and a major increase in funding for the school books scheme.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, has also extended a number of measures for pupils and students in full-time education.  The school clothing and footwear scheme has been increased by £5 per child benefiting 284,000 school children.</P>
      <P>The Minister has extended child benefit, which was increased by £7 per month in this budget, to include 18 year olds in full time education and on FÁS courses.  The child dependant allowance for long term social welfare recipients has been extended to include 21 year old children at full time education.</P>
      <P>Today's decision to abolish undergraduate fees aims at providing universal access to third level education and will impact in a very real way on the life chances of students and their families. The psychological impact of today's decision will encourage and allow people to consider pursuing a third level education as a very realisable option.</P>
      <P>An education system which will no longer decide on behalf of its students what is a right and what is a privilege is an education system which aspires to include all the needs of the community.</P>
      <P>I would remind the House that the introduction of free secondary education led to a dramatic increase in participation in second level, despite the fact that fees at the time in many schools were not, on objective terms, very high.</P>
      <P>For example, in the six years following the introduction of free post-primary education in 1967-68 student numbers increased by 84,000 or 60 per cent. The abolition of third level fees is a major step forward in improving access to higher education &mdash; fees are no longer a barrier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education will now commence discussion on the detailed operational arrangements for the implementation of the new system for all undergraduate fees, with the relevent authorities.  The Department <Col N="2086" /> has also established a freefone service to assist parents, students and members of the public on the arrangements that will be put in place to implement the budget details on the removal of all undergraduate fees in third level educational institutions from autumn 1995. Details of the freefone service are available in today's national media, and the service will operate from today until next Tuesday, excluding the weekend, during working office hours.</P>
    <P>This budget is a concrete expression of the Government's commitment to the education sector.  Education is the means by which societies and individuals enhance their knowledge and human capital.  Knowledge and skills are increasingly the basis for economic growth and progress and, it may be argued, represent the only durable basis for a country's economic and competitive advantage.</P>
    <P>The provision for education in this budget will enable me together with the many dedicated people in the education sector to maintain and improve the quality of education and to make substantial progress in implementing the education chapter of the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for sharing her time.  I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on the budget. While the Minister outlined a broad sweep of the budgetary changes that will be introduced, and they are impressive, I want to concentrate on a few salient points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an historic budget in terms of education because now there will be free tuition across primary, secondary and third level.  It is important that we address a major anomaly in terms of tuition at third level which affected the middle income wedge of the PAYE sector who had been discriminated against in the past.  That group was caught sandwich-like between farmers on one side and high income earners on the other. Farmers, who through an assessment of their income which does not include an assessment of their assets, had a greatly <Col N="2087" /> disproportionate number of their children attending third level education compared with other groups.  Many high income earners with a large amount of disposable income abused the covenant system, created a golden circle and avoided paying for their children's education. Because of the manner in which covenants operate they also received taxpayers' money.  I am delighted that income tax relief on covenants will be phased out and the money paid by the State in that fashion will now be injected into third level education.  That will benefit the middle income wedge of taxpayers who have been hard pressed and it will bring equity into the system. The fact that the introduction of the new proposals will be virtually Exchequer neutral and will only cost another £6 million is an added bonus. The new proposals honour a commitment in the programme <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to abolish third level education fees.  It is of enormous symbolic significance that every level of education will be free in terms of tuition.  I have no doubt that will have a psychological effect that occurred in the late 1960s when second level education became free and had an enormous impact in terms of access to and an extension of education across the board.</P>
    <P>The proposal in respect of free third level fees is only part of a welcome package for third level education.  It is important to focus on third level because it is the burgeoning area of education. The budgetary proposals include an extension of maintenance grants under the higher education scheme to include Irish students studying abroad in 1996-97.  In terms of current numbers that proposal will benefit approximately 4,000 students.  Access to maintenance grants has been extended to Irish students studying in Northern Ireland and the same eligibility criteria applies there as in the South.  The proposed extension of maintenance grants to students studying abroad in Great Britain and particularly in Europe where Irish students study or may wish <Col N="2088" /> to study will be valuable.  In most cases fees in third level institutions abroad are paid through ESF or other funding. Many European institutions have excess capacity because the birth-rate on mainland Europe began to decline at an earlier stage than did ours.  Many third level institutions, such as polytechnics and universities in Great Britain, and European colleges welcome Irish third level students who wish to study abroad.  The extension of maintenance grants will greatly increase the numbers taking up third level education abroad, which, in turn, will benefit our hard pressed third level institutions.  It will help to lower the overall capital budget by reducing the need to build expensive extensions to third level institutions here.  The blip in the graph in respect of students going abroad to take up third level education should decline early in the next decade. We should make reciprocal arrangements with European countries.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of tax relief to fees for private colleges in respect of approved courses.  This will ensure quality control in such colleges which was not always the case in the past.  It will also place them on a more sound financial footing and provide additional third level places.  I welcome in particular the proposal to abolish fees for post-leaving certificate courses which, up to now, have not been widely recognised.  This measure will come into effect immediately and is only a first step.  As most post-leaving certificate courses are of one year's duration, the extension of child benefit to include 18 year olds will be of great benefit to parents whose children continue in full time education.</P>
    <P>The provision of a second vice-princi-pal to large schools and colleges with 1,000 or more students will benefit colleges which run post-leaving certificate courses, such as those in Ballyfermot and Coolock.  As the NCVA accredits post-leaving certificate courses, the 80 per cent increase in funding for that organisation will be very welcome.  The colleges that run post-leaving certificate courses are the unsung heroes of further <Col N="2089" /> education.  They have been the Cinderellas of the system in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately one third of the students who finish post-primary education take up post-leaving certificate courses.  The universities do not provide an easy pathway for such students to take up higher education. Such courses were developed by the vocational education committees and are an important part of the higher education system.  In the past those courses did not qualify for maintenance grants, free fees, child dependency allowance or child benefit and they have not received national accreditation.  Therefore, I welcome the proposal to abolish all charges, the fact that child benefit will be extended and that national accreditation will be provided by the NCVA.  This is a very welcome development, although it has not received the same recognition as the abolition of third level fees.</P>

      <P>I welcome the extension of the maintenance grant scheme to post-leaving certificate courses.  I hope they will be brought are into the mainstream of further education and that the Dublin Institute of Technology, the regional technical colleges and the universities will provide a pathway in this respect.  In the long term the Minister's proposals will be very beneficial in extending those courses from one to three years and, in turn, taking a great deal of pressure off what is regarded as standard third level institutions, namely, the Dublin Institute of Technology, the regional technical colleges and the universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to the primary, secondary and pre-school levels but time does not permit.  I welcome the budgetary provisions for education and fail to understand how Deputy Martin could criticise the abolition of third level <Col N="2090" /> fees.  He welcomed a similar provision when the Fianna Fáil and Labour parties were in Government, he even welcomed them before they were announced by the Minister.  He also advocated them since the present Government took up office.  I am sure the ASTI, who support the proposal, would consider not renewing his membership if they knew he did not support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the budget, particularly in regard to education.  While we welcome a number of the beneficial measures for the various sectors proposed in the budget I must first deal with the question of accountability to and the lack of respect for the House by the Government.  The concern about Deputy Hogan's pre-budget leak reflects a broader approach and attitude to the House by this Government.  The Ministers have shown a fundamental lack of respect for it.  They should not forget that the Constitution upholds the dignity and independence of the House from the Executive and that the Executive is ultimately answerable and responsible to the Members of the House.  That relates not only to pre-budget leaks, but to the presence of Ministers for Adjournment debates and the necessity for them to give full and frank answers to parliamentary questions. Ministers have failed in that regard.  Only two days ago I tabled a simple question to the Minister for Education about the cost of refurbishment of her office since she was appointed, but I got an evasive reply.  In other words, my question was not answered. There has been a great deal of talk about the early start programme, but the Minister has not answered parliamentary questions as to why Montessori teachers, who have a recognised three year qualification from Sion Hill, have been excluded from the early start programme and are not even given the opportunity to apply for a position on it.  That is a flagrant abuse of equality of opportunity.  The Minister has refused <Col N="2091" /> to meet those teachers, she is on a head-on collision course with them.  The fact that we cannot get full and frank answers to parliamentary questions is evidence of a fundamental lack of respect for the House and its Members. Earlier this week I tabled a question about the availability of Ministers to reply to Adjournment debates and the number of such debates to which this Minister has responded.  When Members table parliamentary questions or seek an Adjournment debate on education it is imperative that the Minister should respond.  The Minister of State, Deputy Allen, has been given that task. He is now the Minister for the Adjournment and other debates on education which are not of major importance.</P>

It is an appalling indictment of the Minister an it indicates a lack of respect for Members that she does not see fit to respond to issues raised on the Adjournment.  It would be an opportunity for her to hear the concerns of Members.  The question was disallowed and I did not get an answer.  I was told the Minister did not have any responsibility for the matter.  She did not choose to attend an Ajournment debate.</P>

      <P>The position of the Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, and that of the Minister for Education, reflect a cavalier approach to this House by the Government.  Take, for example, the present debate on education.  The Minister has commissioned a number of reports, the de Buitléir report on the higher education grants scheme and the most recent interim report of the steering committee, or the technical working group, in relation to third level education and its future.  Those reports have not been debated in the House.  All we have had is a basic ignoring of the recommendations of those reports.  The Minister has made a decision in relation to the provision of a college in Dún Laoghaire, her own constituency &mdash; no doubt for educational reasons only &mdash; and has ignored the recommendation of the working group in relation to the urgent need for the development of a regional technical college in Finglas. Clearly, the Minister's report identifies an area in Dublin where there is a chronic lack of third level places.  We talk about free access to third level education. Who is the Minister codding?</P>

How in the name of God will you have free access to third level education when it is impossible for most university students, particularly those on low incomes, to survive on the basic rate of maintenance grant?  No one disputes that.  The Minister has given a miserable increase in the maintenance grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is meant to be free access for everyone.  The cost of books at third level is phenomenon.  I spoke with a student in Trinity College the other night at an excellent debate, which the Minister did not attend although it was organised by the Labour Party.  The tragedy is that we could not have a similar debate in this House on <Col N="2094" /> the same issue.  I had to go to Trinity College to participate in the debate.  I met a student from UCD who told me the book fund in UCD was £20,000. That is the level of funding for a fundamental facility in any third level institution. When we talk about education provision we are talking about an equitable allocation of existing resources which should be spread as evenly as possible throughout all sectors.</P>
      <P>The Minister could have made choices. Revenues will come from the abolition of covenants.  The Minister could have chosen to appoint more remedial teachers at primary level.  She could have chosen to expand the early start programme.  At the rate we are going with the early start programme we will be a long way into the next century before we have a uniform national pre-school system.  The recommendations of the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women have been totally ignored in relation to the provision of tax incentives for childcare and pre-schools. There has been a refusal to embrace the private sector in the provision of pre-school education, to engage with them to try to broaden the range of provision.  All these reports, which the Minister has commissioned but virtually ignored, stress the importance of early intervention at pre-school and at primary level.  The early start programme is only at the embryonic stage.  Why do such programmes and those targeted at the disadvantaged always have to be three year pilot projects? We need comprehensive provision at pre-school.  The Minister has taken a decision to target funds to different sectors of education rather than the pre-school sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appalling that the Minister has increased the primary capitation grant by a miserable £2 from £38 to £40.  The best quote on this is from the INTO who said: "The Minister has managed to demote, degrade and diminish primary education by raising the capitation grant by only £2&rdquo;.  It was a miserable increase. <Col N="2095" /> I welcome the provision of extra psychologists at primary level but we will need more in the future.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Costello's view in relation to the value of the post leaving certificate courses.  They have been an innovative development in education. Deputy Costello described the PLCs as the Cinderella of the education system.  That status was more than confirmed by the Government refusing to give maintenance grants to PLC students.  Some 17,500 students will not benefit from this budget.  I ask the Minister to stop the con job in trying to persuade people that she is doing something for PLC students by abolishing fees for PLCs.  Many PLCs do not charge fees.  I invite the Minister to go to the PLC colleges today and speak with students.  They will tell her that the fundamental issue for PLC students is maintenance.  They have been neglected and excluded.  The next campaign which will start will be on behalf of those students to ensure they get their rights and their entitlements under this Government in the form of adequate maintenance for PLC students.</P>
    <P>Post graduate research, which is an important sector for the development of the economy, is the most neglected area of third level education.  We have over 7,000 post graduate students who will not benefit from the abolition of fees and who will lose out as a result of the abolition of covenants.  We have had no indication from the Minister or the Government in terms of provision for those students.  So miserable and difficult was their position in University College Cork last year that there was a go slow or a work to rule in terms of tuition to undergraduate students.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the plight of post graduate students in relation to maintenance grants.</P>
    <P>We should clear up the issue of free access to education, which would entail proper provision for the purchase of school books, university literature and so on.  If the Minister speaks with the unions involved she will learn that they <Col N="2096" /> are extremely disappointed with the degree of provision.  In relation to the abolition of fees it is clear that we have not yet received a guarantee from the Minister, or from the Taoiseach that the universities will have an index linked block grant for the next few years to replace the revenue base that has been taken from them.</P>
    <P>A similar position existed with local authorities in 1977 when rates were abolished.  From 1977 to 1983 the Government maintained the block grant in line with inflation but from 1983 onwards the block grant was substantially reduced and since then local authorities have been starved of finance.</P>
    <P>Third level colleges, particularly universities, are concerned that their revenue base is being removed and there is no guarantee that in future the Government will grant the same level of finance as they have now or that the block grant will be index linked.  This measure relates to universities, regional technical colleges and PLCs.  From the Minister's report it is clear that £390 million will be needed to accommodate the demand for increased enrolments at third level between now and the end of the century. At present there is a capital provision of only £120 million.  We are proposing a more equitable provision and a greater spread of the allocation.  There is no indication of a Government strategy to provide for third level education to the end of the century.</P>

      <P>I wish to apologise unreservedly to this House for the circumstances surrounding the issue of budget material in error on 8 February 1995.  As is known by the House, this happened at 12.15 p.m. in advance of the Budget Statement delivered by my colleague, Deputy Quinn, Minister for Finance.  I particularly wish to apologise to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Finance for the embarrassment caused on a day when the focus should have been on the Government's success in implementing many of the major elements outlined in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal.</i></P>
      <P>Before I outline in detail the sequence of events surrounding this genuine error I wish to make a number of important points.  I have never in public life been accused of breaking a confidence.  Second, I did not set out to breach Cabinet confidentiality.  Third, as soon as it was brought to my attention that this breach had occurred immediate steps were taken to rectify the situation. It is therefore a matter of personal regret that I have been accused of being in breach of Cabinet confidentiality and I want to put on record that this was a genuine mistake.  Without detracting from the seriousness of the situation, my colleagues must accept that nobody would attempt to leak a confidential document by faxing it to the press with their name attached.  I will take the House through the sequence of events which led to this genuine error.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A statement was prepared in my office and completed at 11.45 a.m. which I intended for release after the Minister for Finance had concluded his speech.  This one-page statement which was on green coloured paper will show that, as Minister of State at the Department of Finance, I was welcoming the budget and the contribution the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, had <Col N="2098" /> made to this excellent package.  The House will note that details relating to the budget were not contained in this statement.  At the same time a second document containing two white pages had been prepared.  I understood this to be briefing material for members of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party.  This document contains summary elements of the Budget Statement and was due to for release at the conclusion of the Minister's speech.  Earlier in the day I had indicated to the parliamentary party that I would be in a position to brief them at about 6.30 p.m. and that this document was the basis of that briefing.</P>
    <P>A document was presented to me in my office at 11.45 a.m. containing three pages.  I looked at the top page, coloured green, and made some minor changes to it.  I also looked briefly at the second and third pages and approved them.  It is important to point out that these events took place at a time when I had just left the parliamentary party meeting and was rushing to be present in the Dáil Chamber to attend the debate on the flooding crisis. As a result I spent only a brief moment in my office.  I assumed that my special adviser was aware, as I was, that the three pages represented two documents and that they were intended for separate political purposes.  However in my desire to go quickly into the Chamber I regrettably did not leave full instructions that none of the material was to be released until after the budget speech of the Minister for Finance.  This lack of clarity on my part caused confusion and both documents were issued as one in error to the news editors, starting with the two evening papers, at 12.15 p.m.  As I stated earlier, the intention was to circulate only the green coloured single page statement after the Minister for Finance had concluded his speech.</P>
    <P>As soon as I become aware through the Chief Whip at about 12.40 p.m. that budget material had been prematurely released I took immediate action to prevent further circulation.  As a result the news release reached only the two newspapers previously mentioned.  That <Col N="2099" /> is precisely what happened.  I am putting those facts to the House not to excuse the matter but rather to acknowledge that lack of clarity on my part in instructions to my political adviser resulted in this unfortunate incident.  I assure the House I am fully aware of the seriousness of this matter and I take full responsibility for it.</P>
    <P>The circulation of both documents together was entirely a genuine error. The fact that this material carried my name is ample evidence that it was not designed to be leaked or for any malicious intent.  Neither document contained market-sensitive information.  On an issue raised by Deputy McDowell, it is normal practice for Government parties to brief their party colleagues on the implication of budgetary strategy as close as possible to completion of the budget speech.  In order to ensure that these briefings would be comprehensive I followed what I understood was the practice of previous administrations in sending budgetary proposals to the party office on the strict condition that this information would be kept under lock and key until completion of the budget speech.  This information was given personally to the Fine Gael Press Office at lunchtime yesterday, shortly before the Dáil assembled for the budget debate.  Other information had been given on Tuesday night, the night before the budget debate.  This information was not made public and was intended for internal use and distribution to Fine Gael Members of the Oireachtas after the Minister's speech had concluded, and that is exactly what happened.</P>
    <P>I apologise to the Minister for Finance, the Government and the House for this genuine error.  I assure you, a Cheann Comhairle, and the Members of the House that no disrespect was intended.  I am proud to be a member of Fine Gael, a party with the highest ideals and values of honesty and integrity, whose members have always put the country first rather than the individual. To avoid any possibility of damaging a <Col N="2100" /> Government led by the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, a man of the utmost decency and understanding, I have tendered my resignation from Government and it has been accepted. The decision to resign is entirely my own.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on record the generous support given to me not only by my own party colleagues but also by the Tánaiste, Deputy Dick Spring, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Proinsias De Rossa, and my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn.  I hope my decision today will ensure that a Fine Gael led Government will continue to prosper and give prosperity to the people of this country for many years to come under the dynamic leadership of Deputy John Bruton.</P>

      <P>In the few short weeks since he took on the task as Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Phil Hogan, has made an outstanding contribution to the work of the Government.  He showed great political and administrative capacity in mastering so very quickly the details of his brief in the area of public expenditure and budgetary policy and gave invaluable assistance to all of us involved in reaching political agreement on the content of the budget presented yesterday by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ruairí Quinn.  His political and administrative capacity was also displayed in a signal way in the promptness with which he tackled the responsibilities of the Office of Public Works in regard to the recent flooding crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is characteristic of his sense of public duty that he was entirely willing to <Col N="2101" /> accept full personal responsibility for mistakes made in regard to the premature issue of material on the budget.  His actions in all of this were motivated solely by his desire to maximise public and political support for the budget presented by his Minister, Deputy Ruairí Quinn.  Having shown his capacity and character in this difficult personal and political crisis, it is my earnest hope that conditions will soon again exist for Deputy Phil Hogan's return to senior public office.</P>

      <Quest>the measures, if any, he proposes to introduce to encourage Irish residents to holiday in Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Domestic tourism plays a vital role in the tourist industry. The revenue generated by Irish tourists is widely distributed throughout the country and often provides the additional business which determines the profitability of many tourism enterprises.  The domestic market has been performing particularly well in recent years with strong growth evident in short holiday taking particularly in the off-season.  Domestic business in 1993 yielded revenue of £642 million or some 32 per cent of total tourism revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expansion and improvement in the range and quality of tourist facilities over the past six years through investment, estimated at £900 million, has added a dynamic new dimension to Ireland as a tourist centre by improving the range, quality and attractiveness of <Col N="2103" /> the product.  It has not only opened up further opportunities to increase our market share internationally but has contributed extensively to the growing demand for home holidays.</P>
    <P>We are now embarking on an even more ambitious period for the development of the home market.  It is proposed to continue to develop our tourism infrastructure and to sustain the environmental and cultural distinctiveness which forms the basis of our existing industry.  Time of year is no longer a constraint for Irish holiday taking because of new and improved holiday products and facilities and major emphasis will be placed on developing shoulder and off-season business.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance of domestic tourism to the well-being and further development of the industry as a whole, I have asked the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy O'Sullivan, to assume special responsibility for domestic tourism marketing.  The Minister of State's role in this area will include working closely with Bord Fáilte, Shannon Development and the industry to ensure that tourism will continue to be promoted successfully in the domestic market and that more people are encouraged to holiday at home.</P>
    <P>I wish Deputy Andrews well as Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Tourism and Trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to return the compliment to the Minister.  I have known his family for many years and he has the capacity and integrity to serve as a Minister.</P>
      <P>Question Time is like the calm after the storm.  I am very sorry that matters reached the stage where Deputy Hogan had to resign as Minister of State.  It is a terrible thing to happen to a Member of this House and I do not welcome it either on a personal or party basis.  I wish Deputy Hogan well in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the special responsibilites given to his Minister of State for domestic tourism marketing, will the Minister outline the precise functions of his <Col N="2104" /> Minister of State?  The Minister said that the Minister of State will work with Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development to promote Irish tourism.  Will he also ask him to look North in doing this?  A number of questions on this issue are on today's Order Paper.  Will the Minister consider giving tax relief to people who holiday at home, thus giving people a real incentive to holiday in Ireland?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his kind words.  The Minister of State has been assigned special responsibility for domestic tourism.  This will involve him in discussions with national and regional tourism organisations to motivate people to holiday at home.  So far as the six Northern countries are concerned, this is a matter with which I will be dealing.  The Minister of State will have ongoing contact in respect of cross-Border developments.</P>
      <P>The issue of a tax concession for those who holiday at home is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  As we approach the new millennium we will be trying to ensure that a top quality tourism product will be available for all holiday makers and, given the level of competition within the industry, that those who decide to holiday at home will get value for money.  In 1991 revenue from domestic tourism amounted to £514.6 million, a significant amount.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will deal exclusively with the domestic market although he will have contract in respect of cross-Border developments.  I will be dealing with my counterpart in Northern Ireland on an ongoing basis while the question of a tax incentive is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  I will bring it to his attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter that should be examined seriously.  I agree with the Minister that in many instances the holidays on offer in this country are <i>nonpareil.</i> The hotel industry and the tourism organisation are to be congratulated on making a genuine effort to market Ireland as an attractive location. The Minister should however pursue <Col N="2105" /> this issue of a tax incentive with the Minister for Finance as a matter of urgency.  In that regard I am glad he has included a number of tourist resorts in a pilot scheme; this constitutes an urban tax relief.  He could add another string to his bow by asking the Minister for Finance to consider this initiative in next year's budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was never slow off the mark.  The budget announced yesterday has had some unfortunate consequences today.  I will take up the Deputy's suggestion with the Minister for Finance in good time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that people are entitled to expect the accommodation and services on offer to be of a uniformly high standard and that it is in the interest of the tourism industry that this be the case? Would he consider establishing a body, if necessary on a statutory basis, to monitor and enforce standards?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>Last week for the first time, I had the opportunity to meet with Baroness Denton, the Minister for the Economy in Northern Ireland, when she paid a courtesy call to my office.  We agreed that the international perception of the island of Ireland as a place to visit and to invest has been considerably enhanced as a result of the cessation of violence in recent months.  When allied to the favourable economic situation which now exists in many of our important tourism markets, the economic prospects for people throughout the island are at their brightest for a generation.</P>
      <P>Our meeting provided a welcome opportunity to review the developments of recent months and to look ahead to the coming year, which we agreed was full of hope and opportunity.  Specifically, both of us expressed our belief that it was possible for the tourism industry, North and South, to greatly increase its revenue within a short period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the measures already introduced to help generate this new business is the £6.3 million overseas tourism marketing initiative, which represents an entirely additional promotional effort to increase consumer awareness of Ireland.  It is a private sector led consumer marketing campaign, which will promote the island of Ireland as a single destination in our four most important markets, namely the US, Britain, Germany and France.  For the first time, the tourism industry on both sides of the Border, together with Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, are participating in the initiative and are selling the island of Ireland as an <Col N="2107" /> attractive holiday location.  The initiative consists primarily of generic "Visit Ireland" advertising on television and in newspapers and magazines.  Inquirers in each market will receive a joint brochure featuring the participating companies and organisations, together with the Bord Fáilte and Northern Ireland Tourist Board literature.  This common approach to marketing Ireland, North and South, is very welcome, and I have no doubt that this initiative, coupled with the existing promotional work being undertaken by the two tourist boards, will deliver tourism business to the whole island in 1995.</P>
    <P>I am also hopeful that it will be possible in the coming months to announce details of other initiatives which will be aimed at increasing tourism business to the island of Ireland and to the 12 Northern counties in particular. Officials of my Department and their Northern Ireland counterparts are meeting this week to explore these very possibilities, with a view to designing a mutually-agreed and practical menu of further initiatives which can be undertaken in the future.</P>
    <P>President Clinton's US Conference on Trade and Investment in Ireland which will be held in Washington during May next will also be helpful in this context. Exchanges, so far, with the US side have confirmed that tourism in one area which should have a significant presence at the conference, given its clear economic benefits for all parties and for the island as a whole.  My officials propose to work closely with their Northern Ireland colleagues in this regard.</P>
    <P>Baroness Denton and I have also agreed to meet regularly in the future. We both acknowledge the potential which tourism can make to economic regeneration, job creation and reconciliation between the two parts of the island.  The House can be assured that advancing the tourism potential of the island of Ireland will be a very important personal priority during my term as Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It has never ceased to amaze me that we do not have one tourism council on this island.  In this context I would have no problem with the concept of Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board operating within their own regions.  Would the Minister, in the context of the peace process and the peace dividend, consider such a body as a matter of urgency to promote the interests of the island as a whole?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, tourism was one of the first subjects discussed by the Anglo-Irish Secretariat, apart from security and politics. It is recognised that it has phenomenal potential for growth, North and South. It is important to have a closer working relationship with our Northern Ireland counterparts.  Obviously, in the context of ongoing discussions in regard to the production of a framework document, the issue of tourism generating economic growth, without reference to present structures, is of great importance. In terms of efficiency and concentration of selling, one single body would be preferable but it is my personal priority as Minister to work closely with my Northern Ireland counterpart which, undoubtedly, will lead to a closer working relationship between both tourist boards.  When Deputy Andrews and I served on the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body some years ago, there was a great deal of tension between both organisations, North and South.  I am glad there is much greater harmony now in terms of the international marketing of package holidays to the island as a whole.  I hope to continue that relationship and who knows what it might lead to in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that the role of the Foyle Fisheries Commission will be broadened in the near future.  I am not certain whether the framework document includes an all-Ireland tourism organisation, I am not diminishing the role played by Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board in the context of their common approach to <Col N="2109" /> the four areas which the Minister mentioned, but in the interests of efficiency and the immediate needs of the island, surely this is an area that is crying out to be identified.  There is almost a readymade structure in place to have the two organisations involved.  I know they meet on a regular basis but it should be structured and by doing so it would be focused in an all-island context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I empathise with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Andrews.  There are five areas on which I intend to work closely with my Northern counterpart and the tourist organisations. In the next few months I hope to again meet Baroness Denton and the Chairman of the International Fund for Ireland to launch the regional marketing initiatives which will have an impact in the Border areas.  As I said previously, the overseas tourism marketing initiative helps North and South.  The Northern Ireland Tourist Board has a seat on the committee dealing with this and is part of it.  There will also be developments under the tourism package in respect of the INTERREG Programme which are not yet finalised and additional funds were approved following the EU meeting at Essen.  Finally, there will also be cross-Border activity and closer working relationships arising from the Trade and Investment Conference in the United States in May which President Clinton will attend.  I hope that working through these five measures will result in greater trust, harmony and a more concentrated and efficient effort which is what the Deputy and I seek.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give details of tourism growth targets; and the funds being allocated to help achieve targets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 sets a target for growth in incoming tourism over the period of an additional 65 per cent in tourism revenue and 38 per cent in total additional employment.</P>
      <P>In line with these targets, the programme envisages a growth in visitor numbers from a estimated 3.3 million in 1993 to 4.02 million in 1996 and 4.85 million in 1999.  Growth of 6.5 per cent per annum was, therefore, targeted in the medium term.  While final results for 1994 are not yet available, it appears that the target has been substantially exceeded with final figures likely to show growth of between 10 per cent and 11 per cent over 1993.</P>
      <P>This year, a budget of £30 million will be available to Bord Fáilte and the Tourism Promotion and Development Fund to provide for tourism development. Bord Fáilte has set a target of 9 per cent overall growth in total overseas visitor numbers in 1995.</P>
      <P>Included in the total of £30 million is a sum of £4 million for the overseas tourism marketing initiative 1995.  This is a special commercially driven initiative undertaken in co-operation with the private sectors, North and South, to market the island of Ireland as a single destination in our most important markets: Britain, France, Germany and the US.  The individual targets for growth in holiday visitors in the four markets range from 11 per cent to 15 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The year ahead presents an opportunity for us to build on the success which has been achieved to date and to maximise the contribution that tourism makes to our national economy in terms of overseas revenue and employment.  I look forward to working closely with <Col N="2112" /> Bord Fáilte and the tourism industry to ensure that the impressive performance of recent years will continue and that Irish tourism is well placed to increase its share of the world tourism market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify whether his targets are in any way changed from those previously set by Deputy McCreevy when he was Minister for Tourism and Trade?  Will the Minister be more specific as to where the improvements will be made which will help to sustain the high level of growth in the valuable tourism industry? Will he indicate whether the statement in yesterday's budget in relation to the pilot project for traditional seaside resorts is part of the strategy and, if so, explain why some of the major resorts in the country such as Salthill, which has been the premier tourist resort for many years and now urgently in need of refurbishment and investment, were excluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure of the figure set by my predecessor in terms of tourist growth numbers but Bord Fáilte has set down its target of a 9 per cent overall growth between now and the end of 1995.  I will certainly give the Deputy the figure determined by my predecessor.  The administrative and general expenses of Bord Fáilte are dealt with under the headings of pay, administrative costs, advertising, printed publicity, subvention to the regional tourism organisations, and product development.  The overall budget for 1995 is £30.15 million which is slightly in excess of last year's budget.  The targets are to generate foreign exchange earnings of £2.250 billion by 1995, to create 35,000 jobs within the industry, to increase off-peak business by 75 per cent of total visitors by 1999, and improve the general quality of service in the Irish tourism product.  Details of the pilot scheme announced in the budget will be worked out between officials of my Department and the Department of Finance in the coming weeks.  One could <Col N="2113" /> have a substantial list of seaside tourist areas and other traditional areas that have become run down and are in need of incentives and renewal.  If the pilot scheme is successful, consideration can be given to the inclusion of other areas. I am aware of the concerns of Deputy Molloy which have also been expressed by other Deputies.  I hope the communities within the chosen pilot areas will grasp the opportunity presented to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am astonished by the Minister's reply.  Perhaps I would understand it better if the Minister would state the criteria by which the selection was made.  With due respect to the thriving Mayo town of Westport, I fail to see how it comes into the category of a small seaside tourist resort alongside the others that the Minister has mentioned. Surely the Minister recognises that the tourism industry has been based in the Salthill area of Galway for many decades.  It is an important part of the economy and local tourism development interests have taken an initiative to draw up a development plan for Salthill using money they put up with the support of other organisations.  One of the things clearly identified is the need for some tax incentive to attract the level of investment needed to refurbish the tourism product in that resort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The general criteria chosen related to small traditional seaside resorts which have become run <Col N="2114" /> down and are in need of incentives for improvement and renewal.  Westport is not an inclusive town in its own right but is divided into segments.  It is true that Salthill is one of a number of important traditional seaside resorts but there are others that are very much worse off than Salthill &mdash; I do not use that as a general criterion.  I will be happy to talk to Deputy Molly again when we work out how the pilot scheme is to operate.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he intends to take to implement the consultants report on the future of Bord Fáilte; if he intends to implement the recommendations of this report in full; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2585/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already announced in the media and at recent meetings with the Tourism Council and Bord Fáilte staff, that I propose to press ahead with the implementation of the key findings in the Arthur D. Little Review of Bord Fáilte.  It was right to commission a fundamental review of BFE in the light of the growing maturity of the Irish tourist industry.  In the soundings I have taken to date, I have yet to hear any fundamental disagreement with the key findings of the consultants that Bord Fáilte should concentrate, in future, on its core activities of selling Ireland overseas, helping the less mature elements of the industry to develop and providing information to industry decision-makers.</P>
      <P>A high level steering committee, comprising the Secretary of my Department, the chairman and the director general of Bord Fáilte, an Assistant Secretary in the Department of Finance and a senior consultant from A. D. Little, has been established to ensure that the changes are implemented fully and on target. The steering committee has met on six separate occasions and, with the assistance of a number of project teams, has now completed the analytical phase of its work in relation to the divestment of the non-core functions of BFE.  A number of requests for proposals to carry out non-core functions will shortly issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally as important as getting the divestment programme right, is to bring about the internal cultural, organisational and staffing changes required to relaunch Bord Fáilte as a dynamic and vibrant agency for the next millennium. I know that the chairman, board and the director general, with the assistance of <Col N="2116" /> the steering committee, are fully committed to this process and it is receiving their full and urgent attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Arthur D. Little report makes the point that Bord Fáilte provides value for money in Ireland. The report is organised in four main sections &mdash; the current status of BFE and tourism in Ireland, the need to refocus BFE on core activities, the actions required, and the organisational implications. Can the Minister say, in that context, what the future is for the people in Bord Fáilte.  Is it his intention to examine the working practices of Bord Fáilte in the context of those people already employed there or is it his intention to look at the people employed there in the context of prospective redundancies and so on?  There is a genuine air of uncertainty about the future of a number of people within the organisation.  Perhaps the Minister would address that in the interests of the organisation which has been doing, and is generally perceived to be doing, a good job in the interests of Ireland's national image abroad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Andrews has rightly seen that there is a deal of anxiety about the future of Bord Fáilte. I would like to ease that anxiety.  I would like to see Bord Fáilte develop as quickly as possible into a new dynamic organisation concentrating on its core responsibility of marketing this country abroad.  Quite a number of people in Bord Fáilte have given many years of dedicated work and have acquired much experience in the tourism business.  I have already confirmed to the unions that there will not be compulsory redundancies and hope to be in a position to bring a memorandum on a severance package to Government in the next few weeks.  The Deputy will also be aware that it is intended to recruit 20 new marketing consultants with ability to assist in the regenerated work that we hope Bord Fáilte will be able to deal with.  I agree there was a degree of anxiety.  I am very anxious to have this matter <Col N="2117" /> finalised and I am sensitive to the needs and experience of people who have worked in Bord Fáilte for many years. I hope that when we implement these changes everyone will understand it is for the betterment of the tourism industry as a whole.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 13 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's representation in Japan including all the State agencies and the Irish Embassy, is about to be consolidated under one roof in Ireland House, Tokyo, which will be officially opened later this month.  Deputies will be aware that Ireland's representation in New York was brought together in a similar manner some time ago.  The State agencies also share accommodation in London, Paris, Dusseldorf, Milan and Hong Kong.  In addition, some of the State agencies share embassy premises in <Col N="2119" /> Beijing, Seoul, Moscow, Riyadh, Madrid and Helsinki</P>
    <P>The further rationalisation of Ireland's promotional representation abroad will be kept under review to ensure the best possible use of the resources available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that this is a worthwhile initiative and one that should be accelerated as it appears from his reply that the rate of progress does not seem to be very encouraging?  I am sure from the experience to date that it is the correct step and that substantial benefit has been derived from the move to bring them under one roof.  I would have liked to have heard the Minister say it is his intention to seek to have this achieved in other destinations in addition to the ones he mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea behind the &ldquo;Ireland House&rdquo; concept is to maximise the impact of Ireland's promotional representation abroad and obviously a cost is involved.  I support this concept but it cannot be completed overnight.  As I said, many of our State agencies share space with the Irish Embassy and I have also outlined cities in which there is an &ldquo;Ireland House&rdquo;.  I will certainly be supportive of this concept although the Deputy will understand the practical difficulties of acquiring suitable premises, making arrangements in respect of leases and personnel as well as the cost involved.  The overall concept is to develop and maximise our selling power abroad, something I strongly support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would I be right to come to the conclusion that there was a burst of enthusiasm for achieving this objective in the early stages probably due to the urgings of an enthusiastic Minister or Minister of State, but that the impetus seems to have gone out of it?  If the Minister was to read out all those locations where this has not yet happened, it would be a very long list.</P>

      <P>And on a worldwide scale it would be enormous.  In November last year it was agreed that a modest feasibility study of the possibilities of further consolidation of our representation in Madrid would be followed through.  For instance, in Tokyo the &ldquo;Ireland House&rdquo; will accommodate the activities of the Irish Embassy, IDA (Ireland), An Bord Tráchtála, An Bord Bia, Bord Fáilte, Aer Lingus and FÁS (International).  The &ldquo;Ireland House&rdquo; concept is good, it will take time to achieve what we would like but we will press on.</P>

      <P>We will follow it through and study the most recent feasibility study commissioned in respect of Madrid.  In cases where we sponsor international events or international organisations, for instance, the Jordan Grand Prix Formula One Team, I expect that our consular offices and embassies, where relevant, will encourage the promotion of Ireland during major international events.  That is in parallel with the concept of an &ldquo;Ireland House&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>By &ldquo;trade organisations&rdquo;, I take it that the Deputy is referring to the State agencies in the North which have responsibility for trade promotion, namely the Industrial Development Board and the local enterprise development unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their counterpart in the South, An Bord Tráchtála, for which I have responsibility, has developed a good <Col N="2121" /> working relationship, involving regular contact, with the Industrial Development Board and Local Enterprise Development Unit.  In recent years this contact has extended into organising programmes and events with the objective of developing North-South trade and bringing companies from all over the island together to create a stronger impact in overseas markets.</P>
    <P>The Deputy might also wish to be aware that, at ministerial level, the development of cross-Border trade and the joint promotion of Irish products abroad were issues which I discussed with Baroness Denton, the Minister for Economic Development in Northern Ireland, when we met last week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister intends doing is very welcome, nevertheless there is a need in the interests of the island for an all-Ireland council of trade with cross-Border continuation of a response to the joint needs of Ireland in the international context.  Would the Minister not consider this a logical extension of this thinking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>My ambition is to make it easier for the Northern Ireland trade organisations and ABT to continue close working relationships in the promotion of trade on an All Ireland basis.  ABT is involved in a three year promotional programme in the US called &ldquo;The Look is Ireland&rdquo;.  Deputy Andrews was at the recent showcase in the RDS attended by over 1,000 buyers and 60 exhibitors from Northern Ireland.  In conjunction with the closer working relationships in the tourism industry there is welcome co-ordination between trade bodies North and South. With the advent of the peace process it is more feasible for firms in the 26 Counties to do business with firms in the Six Counties and <i>vice versa.</i> The element of competition will increase proportionately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>ABT and IDB are doing a good job in pursuing their organisations' objectives in the North <Col N="2122" /> South context.  I hope the framework document will address this issue in a cross Border context and that we have an all Ireland council for tourism and one for trade.  Such a council is crying out to be set up.  Now that we are enjoying peace would the Minister agree that he should pursue this as a matter of urgency at the Anglo Irish Conference and perhaps seek a special slot from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Sir Patrick Mayhew to address the conference on these issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Details of the conference are being worked out.  The Deputy's suggestion is worthwhile and I would be happy to do that.  The end objective of the Deputy's aspiration is very welcome.  Pending the production of the framework document and the conclusions that will emerge, it is my ambition to continue to foster closer working relationship with both the tourism and trade organisations North and South for everyone concerned.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 28, 56 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>I propose to circulate in the Official Report a schedule setting out the number of premises registered or approved by Bord Fáilte in the different categories requested by the Deputy.  The requirements for such registration or approval are either laid down in Regulations made under the Tourist Traffic Acts 1939-87 or in the relevant official standards set by Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to introduce a system of mandatory registration for all types of tourist accommodation.  Such a system is unnecessary, would do little to improve general standards and could reduce the accommodation bank, in particular, for the low budget tourist.  Moreover, such a system would give rise to endless difficulties as regards policing and enforcement.</P>
      <P>As regards registration, grading and approval of tourism products, in general, the existing standards set by Bord Fáilte are appropriate for our requirements, taking into account our position as a maturing tourist destination and the competitive pressures within the industry to satisfy tourist requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already stated publicly, I have decided to press ahead with implementation of the findings in the A. D. Little review of Bord Fáilte, which <Col N="2125" /> envisages the registration and grading functions being subcontracted to a third party inspector while maintaining the Bord Fáilte brand and standards.  The detailed arrangements to give effect to this decision are being progressed by the steering committee which has been established to oversee implementation of the review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that accommodation for tourists should be subject to some form of control in the interests of maintaining standards?  I take the point that in the case of reasonably priced accommodation it might involve a huge layer of bureaucracy.  However, there should be some form of control over tourist accommodation.  As far as bed and breakfast type accommodation is concerned, there is real value of money.  I have seen bed and breakfasts in Sneem and around Lough Mask where I fish from time to time.  The standards are unparalleled.  Would the Minister not agree that it is necessary to subject such accommodation to control?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy is continuing his travels in Ireland and takes particular note of areas where quality exists.  He is correct when he suggests that there is a diversity of standards within the B &amp; B category.  The service offered in many bed and breakfast accommodations is of a very high standard.  Great credit is due to those who put time, effort and money into keeping the standards so high.  The mandatory licensing of all accommodation is fraught with danger and is a sore point with many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say that services offered <Col N="2126" /> in bed and breakfasts are of a very high standard, for which great credit is due to those people who put so much time, effort and money into maintaining those high standards.</P>
    <P>The matter of the compulsory/ mandatory licensing of all accommodation is one obviously fraught with danger.  While it tends to be a very sore point with a great number of people, to attempt to police such a scheme is, in my view, unrealistic.  The previous Government, in its programme set out clearly that it would introduce a compulsory or mandatory licensing system but my immediate predecessor, Deputy McCreevy, stated publicly on numerous occasions that he had no intention of attempting to introduce a mandatory licensing system.  It is important that we encourage people who, in many instances, are operating in an unapproved arena and offer a very high standard, into the approved one.  It is within that context that the consultants recommended that the product approval and inspection and grading of premises be removed from Bord Fáilte which, of itself, might encourage people to enter the approved arena.</P>
    <P>Members will be all too well aware of circumstances prevailing nationwide when social or other large events take place and invariably there are not sufficient registered beds available in any given area.  People offer their houses/accommodation possibly in an unapproved fashion.  It is very difficult to deal with that.  I would prefer to take the voluntary/encouraging route rather than endeavour to deal with something that I know from my experience in the west would be practically impossible to implement effectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider rendering it more attractive for the operators of accommodation houses to register with Bord Fáilte?  As he will be aware, many people undertake this provision/business during the peak season. For instance, if compulsory registration was to be introduced in the Galway, Salthill area, there would not be <Col N="2127" /> any accommodation for those who come to visit us during the Galway Races week or say, during the August bank holiday weekend, whereas many a student was educated on the proceeds of a couple of weeks' bed and breakfast accommodation during the summer months.  It is a very sensitive issue.  I consider the way to go about it is the manner in which the Minister has outlined, to encourage more people to register but, in order to do so, one must offer some incentive.  Does the Minister have any such proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy is quite accurate in his observation on this, which complies with my own and that of many other Members.  I am examining this matter.  I suppose the first reaction would be, if one is registered with Bord Fáilte, that the business accruing from the official guides is worthwhile, though we must remember that inclusion in those books is also costly.  I will report back to Members in due course but the route of encouragement, without incentive, obviously is one that may not be very attractive.  While I appreciate there are between 4,000 and 7,000 unapproved establishments at present operating, many of which would operate on a very short term basis over a number of weeks, to attempt to rule them by compulsion or licence I predict is a proposal that would not be very attractive to a great number of people.  I respect that.  I am examining the matter very carefully and will ascertain what proposals we can advance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider, on a pilot basis &mdash; which appears to be the route he is taking on other matters &mdash; reducing the registration fee to a nominal sum, say, for a five-year period to ascertain whether that would encourage people to come into the approved system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>Seasonality is a problem not only for the Irish tourist industry but the whole European tourism industry.  Nonetheless, efforts are being made to overcome the problem.  Under the terms of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 expanding the season or improving seasonality is one of the prominent priorities.</P>
      <P>Specific targets have been set in the operational programme for improving the performance of the off-peak season, and moneys are available to promoters with good ideas to expand the season. The rate of support for marketing proposals is weighed towards the off-season &mdash; 50 per cent support &mdash; with 30 per cent support for the shoulder season and 20 per cent for the peak.</P>
      <P>Last year, £1.3 million in Exchequer moneys was approved by my Department to promote off-season business. These funds were largely matched by the industry, for marketing in the United Kingdom and Europe.  Examples of the sort of programmes aimed at getting tourists here in the off-season were week-end/short breaks, shopping tours, direct marketing of Irish festivals, incentive travel and corporate meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although it is too early to give final figures on the number of additional visitors as a result of these efforts, initial pointers are encouraging.  The total number of tourists was up from 3.3 million in 1993 to 3.6 million in 1994.  In addition, a number of sectors within the <Col N="2129" /> tourism industry, like hotel groups and ferries, have reported bumper results in 1994.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the ongoing commitment to construct a national conference centre to cater for up to 2,000 delegates. This would clearly have a major impact on developing an all-year-round tourism product.  I intend to advance this project significantly by the end of this year, in keeping with my general intention to keep seasonality high on my agenda for future decisive action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it constitutes an extravagant waste of valuable resources invested in providing modern tourist products to have them lie idle for a substantial part of the year?  Furthermore, would he agree that part of our difficulty here is tourists experiencing problems gaining access to the Irish market, particularly the high air fares which are a major obstacle to travellers from the Continent, as is the case with people from certain provincial cities in England?  They have to pay very high air fares also as do visitors from North America.  Would he agree that it is crucial to make the maximum use of the new facilities installed at very substantial cost to the investor/entrepreneur, the State, and European Union Structural Funds? Does he agree that gross under-utilisation of the tourist product constitutes a waste of that investment?  Furthermore, does he agree that strenuous efforts must be made to stretch the tourist season, at its shoulders, particularly in the off-peak period, since there are now marvellous facilities nationwide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree absolutely. Many organisations and promoters work very hard to achieve success in installing a facility whereas marketing has not followed through in terms of its usage; therefore, many facilities can run down and become obsolete.  It is precisely within that context that we are giving seasonality priority within my Department.  The matter of access to this country is another problem which <Col N="2130" /> has been clearly identified and on which I am in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, in order to ascertain whether we can improve it.  These are two matters of priority specifically identified by me within the Department and I can assure Deputy Molloy that we are working very actively on them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I can inform Deputy Andrews that the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 contains a sum of £23 million for the provision of a national conference centre.  When this proposal was examined, as a stand-alone conference centre, its analysis showed that it would not be feasible or viable as a stand-alone unit.  It was in that context that the issue of including a casino came into the picture.  No decision has been taken, either in regard to a location for either the proposed national conference centre, alone, or with any other facilities. Indeed, no decision has been taken in regard to effecting an amendment to the Gaming and Lotteries Act in respect of casinos.  A number of proposals have been received in my Department.  A <Col N="2131" /> committee operating under the secretary to the Department of the Taoiseach and my Department is dealing with this.  In due course we will draw the proposals together to decide on the best option.  No decision has been taken either in respect of a location or the development of a conference centre as a stand alone unit with or without other facilities.</P>

      <P>It would be my intention to ensure that any special funds provided for tourism development in the Border region will be additional to the funding available nationally from which the region will of course also benefit proportionately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These special funds are likely to come from the INTERREG II programme, the EU's support programme for the peace process, which was agreed at the Essen Summit, and the International Fund for Ireland.  The specific funds for tourism purposes from each of these <Col N="2135" /> sources is still in the course of negotiation but I am satisfied that, taken in conjunction with other funding and the continuing peace, they will lead to a very significant and valuable growth of tourism in the Border region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  He referred a number of times today to the peace process.  Does he accept that in view of the peace process there is a greater potential for tourism growth in the Border area than in any other part of the country?  Will the Minister confirm that the European Union and the International Fund for Ireland have recognised the special problems in the Border area and that is why additional money was provided and that since 1973 funding specifically provided for Border areas was not always additional and it is important that in the light of the new developments the money provided is additional?  A special tourism fund for the Cavan-Monaghan area was established by Bord Fáilte and by the Department when the former Minister, John Wilson, was in office. Will the Minister consider establishing another fund because the two counties have not been traditionally associated with major tourism here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Hanlon has shown an interest, along with other Deputies, in the development of tourism facilities in the Border region.  Because of the troubles over the past 25 years many of the Border areas were off limits and suffered drastically in terms of their ability to generate economic growth. The figures for allocations to Border areas during the past number of years were higher on average than for many other areas.  For instance, in the Border sub-region the 1989-93 tourism operation programme allocated £17 million, the 1988-93 international fund allocated £19 million and the 1991-93 INTERREG Programme allocated £15 million, a total of £51 million as against an average of £17 million for all other <Col N="2136" /> sub-regions in the 1989-93 tourism operation programme.  I fully understand and appreciate the difficulties suffered by the tourism industry in areas north and south of the Border.  It is projected that the dividend from the ongoing peace process, which we all support, will be additional expenditure of approximately £100 million per annum, most of which will be spent in the North.</P>
      <P>The dividend is worthwhile and I intend to ensure that funds made avilable to Border counties are additional to &mdash; not a substitute for &mdash; Exchequer funding, as was the case in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned I referred to the abolition of fees for third level education and financial provision for third level institutions <Col N="2170" /> in the future.  I referred to what happened to local authorities following the abolition of rates and expressed the hope that the same would not happen in respect of third level institutions.  Rates were abolished in 1977 and Governments promised they would make up the loss in revenue to the local authorities each year by means of an index linked block grant and that, therefore, local authorities would not lose out as a result of their revenue base being taken from them.  That was successful from about 1977 to 1983.  Since then successive Governments, irrespective of party political colour, have not fulfilled their commitments to local authorities and block grants, taking inflation into account, were substantially reduced in subsequent years with the result that most local authorities are in dire financial straits and are finding it extremely difficult to make ends meet.  There is a danger that the same could happen in respect of colleges which provide post leaving certificate courses, universities and third level institutions in general if the Government does not give a cast iron commitment and guarantee that, in line with inflation, it will adequately finance third level institutions to the end of the century.</P>
      <P>As we are about to take away the independent revenue base enjoyed by third level institutions through the payment of fees, it is important that they are provided with an equivalent sum of money in the form of index linked block grants from Governments in future years.  Anybody who knows anything about third level institutions will accept it is crucial that, as a minimum, they should be guaranteed their present level of funding, which they would argue is inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who knows what will happen in four or five years time.  If a Government is in financial crisis, it may penalise third level institutions by asking them do with less money.  Most third level institutions are devoid of many facilities, equipment, books and so on.  There is hardly a third level institution with an adequate supply of library books.  The book fund <Col N="2171" /> alone for UCD this year is approximately £20,000.  That is hopelessly inadequate in terms of a modern university trying to provide library facilities for thousands of students.</P>
    <P>Many colleges providing post leaving certificate courses envolved from second level status and have been very innovative in developing a range of new courses in fashion design, horticulture, auctioneering, estate management and so on, at local level.  They are market related and provide wonderful opportunities for young people who may not secure a place in a regional technical college or university.  Abolishing fees for such students is a con job because their fundamental requirement is maintenance. More important, such colleges and vocational education committees urgently require capital for equipment, additional places and facilities.  They evolved from a second level infrastructure and have had a rapid increase in student numbers, but do not have the facilities or equipment to meet that increase.  There are now 17,500 students participating in post leaving certificate courses.</P>
    <P>Many of the computers used in Cork colleges are obsolete.  Those colleges require capital for the necessary equipment to bring their courses up to date and in line with those provided in private colleges.  I welcome the provision to extend tax relief to students attending private colleges because many of them attend them because of a lack of places in other colleges.  The question of how one should substitute the revenue base that will be lost to third level institutions by this provision is critical in terms of future third level education.</P>
    <P>Many students and parents will welcome the abolition of fees.  As I said last night, I was a victim of the higher education grant scheme.  I am sure no Member would argue that the existing scheme is not inequitable.  I was employed as a bus driver on an average wage, but because of overtime and so on I did not qualify for grant assistance <Col N="2172" /> and there were many more in that category.</P>
    <P>The de Buitléir report suggested a progressive and gradual approach to deal with that issue in terms of substantially increasing the means test thresholds, bringing in marginal relief and ensuring an appeal system.  If we increase the thresholds substantially there will be benefits for the middle income groups.  While I accept that fees have been abolished it is important that third level education and the other sectors of education are adequately provided for.  In providing additional places at third level the Minister has not dealt with that issue.  There appears to be no strategic plan by the Government or the Department of Education for the expected numbers who will attend third level in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Some people have argued that the universities are exaggerating the numbers who will seek to attend third level in the years ahead.  However, the statistics of the Department of Education bear out the reality that thousands of additional students will enrol in future. The Department estimates that an additional 48,000 students will be attending third level by 2005.  Where will they get places?  How can we have free access to third level education if we do not have the physical places to absorb those who wish to attend?</P>
    <P>The Minister drew an analogy between the Donogh O'Malley announcement on free second level education in the mid-60s and hers and made the point that participation increased in the years following the Donogh O'Malley announcement by 84,000 students. The Minister did not draw the logical conclusion from that point.  How in the name of God will we be in a position to absorb an extra 84,000 students in the next three or four years?  Everyone knows the answer.  We will not be in a position to absorb 20,000 students in the next two or three years.  In this budget the Minister has made provision for only 2,000 extra third level places at regional technical college level.  The <Col N="2173" /> Minister will have some assistance in the next year or two because of the introduction of the transitional programme at second level because there will be a fall off in one year.  When that evens out there will be real problems by 1998-99. There is no indication from the Minister's contribution or from Question Time that any serious effort is being made to dramatically increase places at all third level institutions and to give extra funding to the colleges involved, the regional technical colleges and the universities, to enable them to provide the additional places.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that the capital grant assistance per student at third level has been reduced dramatically during the past ten years.  Nobody can dispute the dramatic progress at third level colleges.  I am concerned that we do not have an indication of how we will absorb the increasing numbers.  I am not making this up: the Minister commissioned the steering committee on third level education under the Higher Education Authority to produce a report, which was published last week indicating that we are facing real challenges up to the end of the century in terms of absorbing additional places.  It also agrees that the participation rate at third level will increase dramatically.  To the increased participation rates from second level one has to add mature students whose numbers are increasing dramatically, and part-time students, who also require assistance with fees, maintenance and so on.  Where there are limited resources it is important that they are targeted in the most equitable manner to help as many people as possible but particularly those in the lower socio-economic groupings.  I am not sure the Minister has done this in the budget. There has been a lopsided approach giving too much to one sector and not adequately catering for a number of other sectors such as pre-school, primary, the PLC sector and the post-graduate students.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority report states there will be a capital requirement to the end of the century <Col N="2174" /> of the order of £390 million.  The only capital provision from Structural Funds is of the order of £120 million and that is earmarked for third level institutions. The Minister has not said from where she will get the remainder of that income, we are taking away certain revenue bases and not replacing them. That begs the question whether we genuinely have a policy in relation to future third level expansion.  I fear we are looking at short term electoral politics. Essentially, the Minister is looking beyond the lifetime of this Government and is saying these policies will get her to the next election.  We can worry about additional places or we can let some other Minister worry about future third level education and the need to provide places, facilities, equipment and so on.  Some other person will be left with that headache, and believe me it will be a headache.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to provision for in-service training.  I did not receive a complete reply to a question I asked last week in regard to the lack of planning concerning that announcement.  I would appreciate if the Minister has confirmed that she intends to provide in-service training for her programme on relationships and sexuality.  Teachers have clearly indicated that they require comprehensive in-service training for this programme.  The Minister made the announcement more than two weeks ago yet the schools did not receive the circulars until two weeks later and they did not receive the draft guidelines. There is considerable concern and anxiety among parents and teachers. Teachers want to know if there is financial provision in the budget for that programme and if financial provision will be made for in-service training for the parents.  Representatives of parents' councils made it clear to me that they want to be involved not only in a consultative role at local level but they need training.  The Minister has not clarified that issue.  When she made her announcement I was under the impression that it would be provided <Col N="2175" /> but in subsequent answers to Dáil questions it was unclear whether financial provision would be made available.</P>
    <P>I welcome a number of measures in the budget, particularly the provision of extra psychologists at primary level, the provision of extra career guidance teachers at second level and the decision to expand the higher education grants scheme to students studying abroad in third level colleges.  I would, however, ask the Minister to clarify the term &ldquo;approved courses&rdquo;.  What exactly does that mean?  I hope the term &ldquo;approved courses&rdquo; will not end up as a restrictive clause which will essentially reduce the number of students who will benefit from a laudable initiative.  Last year the Minister said she did not have the resources.  We made a strong case for this in our Private Members' debate two weeks ago when we argued that students studying abroad at third level institutions should benefit from the higher education grants scheme.  I am pleased the Minister listened to the points made in that debate and acted accordingly but it is regrettable that she did not act in regard to the PLCs and the post graduate students.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister said she was retaining 340 posts in the primary education sector.  I tabled a question last week which demanded considerable detail and I got an incomplete reply. Already, the information I have indicates that well over 500 primary teaching posts will be lost by next September. We need clarity in terms of what the position will be in September 1995 and more importantly, its implications for one, two and three teacher schools in rural areas and its implications for rural development and renewal.  That is a question to which I intend to return when I have the complete details and information requested from the Minister. I hope the information I sought will be provided in full by the Minister at the earliest possible opportunity.  I regret she has not been here for the remainder of my contribution.  I expressed my concern this morning that the Minister is <Col N="2176" /> not prepared to make herself available for Adjournment debates and Private Members' debates, which shows very little respect for the House and particularly the Opposition spokespeople.</P>

      <P>I congratulate my colleague, the Minister for Finance, on his first budget which was put together in difficult circumstances in that the Government has been in office for only seven weeks.  He showed imagination, courage, initiative and an overall grasp of tax reform and economic management for the next three budgets.  This budget sets three cornerstones by which it is to be judged, to reward work, promote enterprise and strengthen social solidarity, and we will attempt to make meaningful progress in these three areas.</P>
      <P>While everyone will find a number of items that are welcome, these should not be seen as a series of concessions but considered in the overall context. The prospects for the economy are very good.  Economic growth is buoyant, consumer spending is resurgent and exports are expected to increase by more than 10 per cent this year.  Employment increased by 36,000 last year and will, at a minimum, increase by more than 30,000 this year, while inflation remains at 2.5 per cent.  The Minister for Finance projected that employment would grow by 6.25 per cent.  The balance of payments, from which ultimate income is created, will remain in strong surplus and inflation is not expected to rise this year.  It is expected that unemployment will decline by 16,000 in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point was made by some that more should have been done to control public spending.  As a former Fine Gael spokesman on Finance in Opposition I was one of the most severe critics of the explosion in the growth in public spending in recent years.  In two and a half years public spending increased by 40 per cent.  It increased on average each <Col N="2177" /> year for the last four years by 9.6 per cent.  In this year's budget we have provided for spending at 5.8 per cent.  That is financially prudent and represents sound economic management.</P>
    <P>The Opposition, particularly the Leader of the Opposition, made great play of the fact that a current budget surplus was achieved in 1994, but he did not target for a current budget surplus. It was an accident due to a massive overshoot of revenue well in excess of £200 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It was good financial management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It was an underestimate of revenue buoyancy and growth.  To say it was planned is not true.  The targets in this budget are narrower than was the case a year ago.  Comparing like with like, we are in firm control of economic management and there is the prospect, if an accident were to recur in terms of an overshoot of revenue, of a current budget surplus again this year.</P>
      <P>Included in the economic management principles set out in the Maastricht criteria was that we would live within a 3 per cent Exchequer borrowing requirement.  The 2.4 per cent target, which may be surpassed if there is revenue sbuoyancy, is extremely prudent. This budget meets the requirements and has the support of brokers and economists who are very vigilant in this area.  I strongly endorse this Maastricht criterion and am pleased it is being kept under rigid control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last Government did not succeed in implementing meaningful tax reform. In this budget we have embarked on substantial tax reform which deserves acknowledgement and credit.  Of all taxes, the most regressive is PRSI, which applied heretofore from the first pound in income.  A millionaire paid less in PRSI than a person on a low level of income.  The Minister for Finance has introduced an allowance whereby the first £50 is exempt from PRSI.  That is a very progressive step.  This measure will be introduced without raising the PRSI <Col N="2178" /> ceiling, which would be very unpopular in middle class areas.  For the first time in many years the Minister has reduced the PRSI ceiling for employers PRSI which is a significant step forward.  He has reduced employers PRSI to 9 per cent for a greater number of low paid jobs.  Heretofore if an employer paid an employee £173 or less they benefited not from 12.2 per cent but 9 per cent PRSI.  The figure has been raised for all employees to £12,000.  These two measures amount to the most radical PRSI reform ever.  It is a first step in dealing with the regressive elements of PRSI as it impacts so harshly on low paid people, without in any way diminishing the the benefits of those workers. For full rate contributors that is a meaninful change.</P>
    <P>The big problem, particularly for single people, is that they pay the top level of tax or a low rate of income.  In this budget we have secured the largest ever widening of the standard rate of tax, with allowances of £700 for a single person and £1,400 for a married couple. Many people will be taken out of the top rate of tax and will now pay at the 27 per cent rate.  Two-thirds of all taxpayers will pay tax at the standard rate, with only one-third on the top rate.  That is a significant improvement.</P>
    <P>On income tax exemption, which is another way of targeting money for the low paid, the change in the personal allowance and the exemption limit will take 10,000 taxpayers out of the tax net, another meaningful step forward.  The increase in personal allowance by £150 for a single person and £300 for a married couple compares very favourably with the changes made in the last three budgets.  All in all we have introduced a package of measures on tax and PRSI that are very beneficial.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to my area of responsibility. According to figures released yesterday by the Central Statistics Office, there was healthy growth of 6.4 per cent in agricultural incomes in 1994, the third consecutive year of growth in this area. This means that during the past three years farm incomes have increased by <Col N="2179" /> 30 per cent or, if one takes interest payments into account, by 40 per cent.  It should be remembered that the 1994 performance was achieved despite the appalling bad weather last spring, in which the previous Government provided no support, and which caused so many problems for cereal and tillage farmers and increased livestock feed costs for farmers.</P>
    <P>A number of commentators have pointed out that gross agricultural output from the sector declined last year and that the increase in incomes was as a result of direct income aids provided by my Department and the EU.  This is a direct result of the 1992 CAP reforms which envisaged a decline in commodity prices with producers being compensated through direct income aids, which are commonly known as the cheque in the post.  This has clearly been to the benefit of the agricultural community who have seen a substantial growth in income since the reforms were agreed.</P>
    <P>The improvement in income was also due in no small part to the significant improvements made in our overall competitive position, for example, low inflation, etc.  The agricultural sector is more competitive now than at any time in the past.  Nevertheless, I am determined that more progress will be made in this area.  The recently launched operational programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry, together with the environmental protection, forestry and early retirement schemes which accompanied CAP reform, will go a long way towards improving both farmers' incomes and our competitive position.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal in detail with some of the specific measures which will be of significant benefit to farmers and farm families.  This year expenditure will increase to £556 million, of which £270 million will come directly from the Exchequer after the appropriations-inaid. My Department processes approximately £2 billion each year.  I am glad to say that I was able to secure new funding for An Bord Bia and an extra £3 <Col N="2180" /> million for Teagasc which will create an additional 250 jobs.  Teagasc needs new graduates to carry out research as more than 60 per cent of its research staff are over 55 years of age and less than 15 per cent of them are under 40 years of age. Teagasc has been butchered in recent years &mdash; there has been a 40 per cent reduction in staff numbers since 1987.  I have set out a new programme for the revitalisation and renewal of Teagasc and targeted areas where farm incomes can be improved through the research and advisory service and training schemes.  Teagasc can look forward to a secure future under my Ministry.  I am also glad to say that I secured increased funding for An Bord Glas and the horticultural sector which will enable them to implement their five year development plan.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that there was a number of significant expenditure items in the budget.  Since taking up office I have repeatedly said I am not satisfied with the level of service to clients in terms of the payment of direct income aids.  It is unsatisfactory that it should take so long to process applications, that payments should be delayed, that office opening hours are restricted and that phones are not always manned.  Having visited a number of departmental offices I am very concerned about the working conditions for many of the staff.  I quickly concluded that what was needed was a package of measures which would improve information technology and computerisation, update office accommodation and working conditions for staff, increase the number of staff and ensure necessary training.  I am pleased to say that the Government has recognised this requirement.</P>
    <P>In addition to the 3 per cent increase for administration, I have secured an extra £5 million for the charter of rights for farmers which the Taoiseach will publish.  This charter will transform the delivery of services by my Department which has received more than 620,000 applications for premia and headage <Col N="2181" /> payments.  This is evidence of my commitment to this sector, and I will consult with the farm organisations, staff unions, etc.  An additional 70 staff have already been appointed and I look forward to implementing a programme which will update accommodation and improve technology, thus transforming the delivery of services to farmers.</P>
    <P>The second area of expenditure relates to the damage caused by the recent floods.  Members of the Opposition shed crocodile tears about this matter.  During the flooding in 1993 and 1994, which caused severe damage, the then Government provided no mainline support for farmers.  I have secured approval from the Department of Finance for the introduction of a fodder and livestock scheme of compensation of £2 million.  I want to put this in a proper context.  The total amount made available under the last compensation scheme in 1990 was £700,000.  The sum of £2 million will be more than adequate to meet the needs of farmers, and the scheme will be modelled on the previous one.  Farmers should contact the farm development service and Teagasc which will independently validate their losses.  Obviously this will take time but given that the floods are receding this matter will be given the utmost priority.  We will be working with a number of other Departments in co-ordinating our efforts.  I wish to put on record my appreciation of the prompt response by the Minister for Finance on this issue.</P>
    <P>I inherited enormous difficulties from the previous administration in the area of on-farm development.  The previous Fianna Fáil minority Government signed Estimates for my Department which reduced the money for the farm improvement programme from £22 million last year to £2 million this year.  This meant that no new applications were received between 8-12 December, a few days before I took up office.  This arose as a result of the shrinking billions. There was not enough money in the agricultural envelope of the Structural Funds.  I am glad to say that we have <Col N="2182" /> been able, with the co-operation of the Department of Finance, to allocate funds for the farm improvement programme and that grant payments for all existing plans will be fully honoured. However, it was not possible to maintain the four investment schemes in the on-farm investment area.  I have, therefore, had to endorse the decision of my predecessor to suspend the farm improvement programme.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that the FIP for horticulture will be reintroduced.  I am seeking Commission approval for a topup payment of 25 per cent for the control of farmyard pollution scheme.  In my review of the on-farm investment schemes I found that 95 per cent of people who have farm improvement plans are eligible for aid under the control of farmyard pollution scheme.  The good news is that instead of receiving a 30 per cent grant farmers will be released from FIP plans and will be eligible for a 60 per cent grant on approved expenditure up to £22,500. This means many farmers will be much better off under the new scheme.</P>
    <P>Land reclamation and drainage were effectively abandoned some years ago. Despite the impossible situation which I inherited in terms of the shortfall in Structural Funds, which I cannot increase &mdash; the amount is set in cement &mdash; I have been able to review the schemes for which we are seeking EU approval so as to enable the farmers to carry out important capital works.</P>
    <P>The forestry sector will receive priority during my term of office.  It has been a Cinderella department and having been coupled with the Department of Energy it was joined with the Department of Agriculture and Food two years ago.  In the macro-economy forestry is one of the most important areas with significant potential for development in the years ahead.  By the middle of this year I hope to present to Cabinet a 20 year strategic plan to the year 2015 for this sector.</P>
    <P>We are talking about meeting the demands currently met by imported timber.  There is a serious deficit in <Col N="2183" /> Europe of hardwoods and softwoods. The needs of the building industry, the furniture industry, and, more particularly, the paper milling industry are such that we need to increase planting levels.  I envisage somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 extra jobs being created downstream during the next five years.  I would like to see an increase in planting levels between 25,000 to 30,000 hectares each year to make a meaningful contribution, in terms of job creation, to the economy.  Unlike most other sectors of the agriculture industry, there is no ceiling on production and plenty of scope to eliminate the deficit.</P>
    <P>We have one of the best climates in Europe for forestry production.  Only 7 per cent of Irish land is, however, under afforestation.  I would like to see this figure increased to 10 per cent, given that the European average is 22 per cent.  On the Continent it is quite common on 50 acre farms to have eight to ten acres under forestry.  There is a need for a cultural change and I am seeking to secure it.  In the Estimates forestry development receives a major boost with an injection of almost £50 million, an indication of my commitment to this area.</P>
    <P>I have provided additional funding for horse racing and greyhound racing. When we complete our investment in Shelbourne Park we will have one of the best greyhound stadiums in Europe.  I hope to provide top class night time entertainment facilities so that those who are not particularly interested in dog racing can have a night out in Shelbourne Park.  I hope to complete the project before the year is out.  I look forward to developing fantastic facilities at Mallow racecourse and, in the long term, a new racecourse in Limerick to attract more punters and customers in the province of Munster.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the tax provisions relating to agriculture, which are substantial. I have been lobbied strongly about stock relief.  These provisions were due <Col N="2184" /> to end on 6 April this year but, in conjunction with my Government colleagues, I have secured one of the best packages under this heading.  For the first four years after installation young farmers will be able to avail of stock relief at 100 per cent.  It will mean they will be able to increase their stock levels without attracting large income tax bills. The general provision of stock relief at 25 per cent is being retained.  For the first time those with huge paper profits, who were devastated by the depopulation of their herds as a result of TB or brucellosis, will not have to face a tax bill for two years.  This is a substantial package and I record my appreciation.</P>
    <P>There have been many complaints about the punitive effects of capital acquisitions tax.  We have increased agricultural relief on land and buildings over the threshold of £300,000 from 30 per cent to 50 per cent and relief on other assets from 25 per cent to 50 per cent.  I will give some examples.  A person with total assets worth £420,000 will not pay capital acquisitions tax on a gift. This is a significant step forward.  A person with total assets worth £525,000 will have their tax bill reduced from approximately £12,000 to £100 approximately. A person with total assets in excess of £600,000 will have their tax bill halved.  This is meaningful for family farms in particular with medium to large size quotas.</P>
    <P>In regard to capital gains tax farmers who have had land acquired through a compulsory purchase order by a local authority, the Department of the Environment or the National Roads Authority have encountered problems whereby they have had to pay a penal amount.  We have obtained roll-over relief to ensure that these farmers will not have to face huge tax bills.</P>
    <P>These provisions are on top of the general income tax provisions from which farmers, with all other sectors will benefit.  Apart from the removal of anomalies in a number of areas about which I have spoken, taking the stock relief, capital acquisitions tax, capital gains tax and the general provisions together a <Col N="2185" /> substantial package has been obtained for the farming community.</P>
    <P>I have to take some of the criticism expressed by the Opposition in regard to these provisions with a pinch of salt. I have only been in the Department for seven weeks; they were in Government for seven years.  What did they do to resolve these issues?  The problems did not arise during the past seven weeks.  I have made significant progress in all these areas.  I have no doubt when the farming organisations reflect on the figures of £5 million which I have obtained to launch the new charter, £2 million to alleviate the consequences of the recent flooding and the extra £9 million secured in the Book of Estimates they will see that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is committed to securing a better deal for farmers.  In this regard I appreciate the efforts made by the Minister for Finance and my Government colleagues.</P>
    <P>One of the most progressive elements of the Programme for Government is the proposed reform of child benefit. When I was in Opposition I was critical of the fact that people in employment with large families found themselves in a poverty trap.  If they were on social welfare they would have received more for each child whereas an employer was not in a position to do this.  By switching to a child benefit supplement people will receive payment irrespective of whether they are in employment.  That is a novel way of ensuring that the disincentive to work is removed.  I welcome in particular the increase of £7 per month in child benefit and the decision of the Minister for Social Welfare to pay the increases in social welfare in mid-June. I understand that it is his intention to make further progress in this regard next year.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the increases in the carer's allowance and the back-to-school school clothing allowance.  I also support the changes in relation to third-level fees.  As we are all aware, hard pressed middle income earners in the PAYE sector have been denied grants because they were just above the <Col N="2186" /> income limit.  We are now moving towards the position where there will be free fees.  If parents have two or more children attending third-level it is very costly.  On average people are paying between £1,000 and £1,500.  The introduction of free third-level education is a significant and historic achievement for this Government.</P>
    <P>The decision to provide tax relief for tenants living in private rented accommodation is novel and valuable.  I know of people paying exorbitant rent.  This relief of up to £1,000 for a married couple will be of enormous benefit for those who could never afford to own their own home.  I also know many young people on unemployment assistance who have been means tested on their parents' income.  They will now receive a minimum payment of £25 per week, a significant step forward.</P>
    <P>Apart from the reform of PRSI about which I have spoken, this is the first Government for many years to set about reducing the standard rate of corporation profits tax.  This should be welcomed. The capital acquisitions tax changes must also be supported.  When the Taoiseach was formerly Minister for Finance, he espoused the cause of employee profit sharing.  The massive increase in profit sharing schemes for employers and employees from £2,000 to £10,000 puts into action a tangible commitment to meet the needs of those people.</P>
    <P>This is one of the best budgets in living memory.  It sets out on a serious programme of radical tax reform and simultaneously adopts a prudent approach to economic management.  It seeks also to curtail the worst excesses of expenditure growth and to achieve a balance between meeting the legitimate need to improve public services and to maintain the steady part of economic growth in the context of revenue, output and employment.</P>
    <P>This Government has got off to an excellent start.  It has set out its priorities in the programme and is now giving practical implementation to that.  The Government parties are working well <Col N="2187" /> together and the interaction between them is extremely satisfactory.  I have no doubt that we will serve our full term. The prospects for job seekers, the agricultural economy and those at work is now very positive.  I hope the negative and carping criticism, particularly from Fianna Fáil &mdash; I realise it has a lot of adjusting to do in its present plight &mdash; will be replaced by a recognition that this Government, in an open, transparent and accountable way, is dealing with the real problems of the economy. I look forward to two and a half years of successful Government in the future.</P>

      <P>To talk about the plight of Fianna Fáil on a day when we have had a ministerial resignation is an interesting analysis.  It is an interesting analysis also on a day when the Government has given £12 million to the banks by reducing corporation profits tax on the top 200 companies while giving pensioners an increase that is less than the rate of inflation.  To talk about the plight of Fianna Fáil on this particular day is courageous indeed.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which the Minister will have to sit through next Tuesday. I can do no better than select that focal point which underlines the tensions and divisions inherent in this Government.  I put it to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, on a television programme yesterday evening that it took the arrival of a Democratic Left element in Government for a decision to be made not to give an inflation increase to pensioners, of whom there <Col N="2188" /> are many thousands, and on the same day to allow a 2 per cent cut in corporation tax to our top financial institutions. No doubt Pat the Banker, as he is now being called, will be more popular in the plush corridors of the banking fraternity but I doubt whether Fine Gael will be popular in the areas where pensioners reside.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with a number of items in the budget but that will be difficult in the time remaining to me.  I intended to deal, as I will on Tuesday, with the reckless nature of the financial strategy of the budget.</P>

If the Government had not given that money to the banking institutions today, it could have given it to social welfare. That would have made up the 0.5 per cent.  To have made that simple decision would not have increased public expenditure. The reason I focus on this is that it genuinely underlines the priorities of the Government, particularly of Democratic Left in Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to answer my query on an issue relating to the Irish Wheelchair Association.  As the Minister is aware, the Irish Wheelchair Association has been providing driver assessment and tuition to people with a physical disability since 1968.  The service is currently operating with one full-time instructor in each provincial region, supported by a secretarial service in the Dublin office.  During the past two years, the IWA has sought a <Col N="2189" /> partnership in Northern Ireland where its sister organisation, Disability Action, is funded through the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland and through a series of statutory supports.</P>
      <P>The objective of the IWA is to develop and modernise, on a 32 county basis, co-operating and working closely with Disability Action.  It has great difficulty, however, in getting any Government Department to take responsibility for the service and I hope the Minister will address this problem.  I understand members of the IWA met the Minister for Equality and Law Reform in November 1994 who gave assurances that he would decide who was responsible for this area.  The reply to date has been negative.</P>
      <P>The Irish Wheelchair Association wants a specific Government Department to take responsibility for its service and adequate funding to continue the service and allow it develop on a 32 county basis.  I am aware that the Eastern Health Board pays a block grant of £10,000 to the IWA driving school and some other health boards pay individual contributions of £452 for what they call certain categories of people who pass a driving test.</P>
      <P>The IWA has already decided it cannot continue to fund the service after 1 April this year.  The reason I raise this matter is that I was contacted by a constituent of mine who informed me that the driving school at Blackheath Drive, attended by one of his sons, will soon be closed unless funding can be provided. A large percentage of those using the service are in the lowest income level and cannot afford to pay for lessons.  For some of the more than 30 lessons would be people more than 30 lessons would be required, whereas in the able-bodied world an average of eight to ten lessons would suffice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To allow this school to close would be a severe blow to the independence of the disabled.  This is an important service and it is vital that the independence of the disabled be recognised and promoted. I appeal to the Minister to <Col N="2190" /> respond positively to the request for immediate assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am aware of the difficulties the Irish Wheelchair Association is experiencing in funding its driving assessment/instruction course at its headquarters in Clontarf.  This matter was raised by the association during a meeting with me two weeks ago.  I understand that a friend of Deputy Kitt's was a member of that delegation.</P>
      <P>Public funding for the Irish Wheelchair Association is provided through the health boards for services such as the home care attendants scheme and respite care.  Last year, this funding amounted to nearly £760,000.</P>
      <P>A national driving assessment/ instruction service is provided from the association's driving school in Clontarf to people in their local communities and on site to patients in the National Rehabilitation Centre in Dún Laoghaire.  The association does not charge for this service.</P>
      <P>The cost of running the driving assessment/instruction course was approximately £100,000 in 1994, of which more than £20,000 was provided by the health boards.  Health boards funding for the course is provided on a capitation basis in respect of candidates who pass the regular driving test following completion of the course and who meet certain qualifying criteria.  The grant is increased each year in line with budgetary increases.</P>
      <P>Since it was set up in the late 1960s the demand for the course has been considerable and continues to be so. The Government is anxious that this service, which enables people with mobility disabilities to integrate more fully in social and economic life, should continue to be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I met the association recently, I undertook to explore the possibility of further additional funding and I am currently in discussions on the matter with my colleague, Deputy Howlin, Minister for the Environment.  As the Department of the Environment is responsible <Col N="2191" /> for driver testing generally, there may be some scope within that Department to provide additional help.</P>
    <P>Also, the Deputy will be pleased to learn that since meeting the Irish Wheelchair Association, I have, as promised, made arrangements for the National Rehabilitation Hospital to recoup the association for the cost of providing driving assessment and instruction to clients at the hospital. That money will supplement the resources this year.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Deputy may wish to note that the Disabled Drivers Association of Ireland also provides a driving instruction course for people with disabilities which is based in Ballindine, County Mayo.</P>

      <P>An cheist atá agat uaimse ná an gá atá ann go gcuirfear scéim uisce nua ar fáil i gCloch na Rún i gContae na Gaillimhe agus ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an Aire Stáit as ucht teacht isteach go dtí an Teach agus éisteacht leis an méid atá le rá agam.</P>
      <P>Roundstone is a small village in Connemara. At present it has a severe problem with its water supply.  I understand that a preliminary report has been submitted to the Department and that the estimated cost of providing an adequate water supply in Roundstone is £400,000.</P>
      <P>The Roundstone water supply at present services an area including Cusatrower, Inishnee and along the Ballyconneely Road as far as Founachree.  It is a large scattered area and in summer time particularly it has a vastly expanded population.  Even at this time of year there is a problem with the water which has a bad taste.  In summer time there is no water.  On the bank holiday weekend last August the water scheme ran dry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for a refurbished water scheme in Roundstone, as there is in many other areas in Connemara.  It is <Col N="2192" /> impossible to develop tourism in an area so dependent on that industry if there is no basic infrastructure.  We have enough problems with the roads but if we are consistently having problems with the water supply, it will be impossible to attract people to the area.  Whatever tolerance people might have to bad roads, in the modern world people have no tolerance to lack of a basic facility like water.</P>
    <P>For the local people also the lack of an adequate water supply in their daily lives is a huge inconvenience.  It is therefore necessary that urgent priority be given to this water scheme and the preliminary report be processed speedily. Even after the preliminary report is processed the scheme will have to go back to Galway County Council for the preparation of contract documents after which it is sent to the Department of the Environment where officials vet the documents.  It then goes through the tendering process and, if we have a grant, is sanctioned.  As there is such a long road to be travelled and such urgency in regard to it I ask that urgent consideration be given to approving the preliminary report so that the next phase in the process can be progressed and the contract documents prepared, which I understand involves preparing detailed drawings of the design of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Ó Cuív for raising this matter.  As the Deputy has reminded us, the village of Roundstone is set in an area of great natural beauty. Its rural hinterland also enjoys a rich and distinct cultural heritage and tradition. Roundstone's close proximity to the Connemara National Park and its already well-developed local tourism, craft and fishing industries leave it well <Col N="2193" /> placed to maximise its development potential.</P>
      <P>In line with the Government's commitment to balanced regional development, substantial investment in water and sewerage infrastructure is planned for the west sub-region.  This is needed to underpin economic activity in the areas of tourism and industrial development in particular.  In County Galway alone, work is either under way or about to commence on projects costing over £40 million.  Planning is well advanced for further large scale projects within the county and city area.  Applications for EU Cohesion Fund assistance have been prepared for new schemes costing over £50 million.</P>
      <P>Galway County Council has recently proposed the ugrading of the existing public water supply scheme at Roundstone at a cost of some £450,000.  The proposed works include pump replacement, new filters and reservoir and water main replacement.  Having regard to the substantial cost involved, the high level of existing commitments and the demands of those schemes already prioritised for investment, the Minister is not in a position, at this time, to approve all of the works proposed by Galway County Council.</P>
      <P>However, I do accept that deficiencies in public water supply infrastructure in villages like Roundstone must be addressed.  While my Department's water services programme is mainly directed at major projects, we want to ensure within the budgetary limitations involved, that smaller projects, essential for the development of towns and villages and to improve the lifestyles of rural communities, are also supported. Last year, my Department approved some 54 small water and sewerage schemes costing over £4 million.  We intend to continue to focus on the water supply and sewerage needs of towns and villages in the coming year.  Accordingly, my Department will be writing to all county councils shortly, asking them to submit suitable small schemes proposals for consideration during 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Galway County Council will have an opportunity shortly to submit proposals in relation to urgently needed upgrading <Col N="2194" /> works for town and village water and sewerage schemes.  I can assure Deputy Ó Cuív that if such an application is received in respect of the Roundstone water supply, the Minister will be well disposed towards it.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús buíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire as ucht teacht isteach chun an t-ábhar an-tábh-achtach seo a phlé.  Is ceist an-conspó-ideach í an cheist a ardóidh me.</P>
      <P>The Minister and I were teachers in our previous careers and we understand the depth of feeling that exists in the Blanchardstown area over the threat to the Beech Park pitches which have been used for decades by the local community for sport and other recreations. The depth of feeling among the 70,000 or so people in that area of Dublin 15, and the hinterland, cannot be underesti-mated. I am sure the Minister has been made aware of the huge crowd that even the gymnasium in St. Brigid's GAA Club was unable to accommodate. The Minister's colleagues in Government will have told her how the Government would stand in the area if the Beech Park pitches were to be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to realise that it is not just a GAA issue even though the meeting was held in the clubhouse, 25 juvenile teams and six under 12 camogie teams depend on that land.  No doubt seven schools will contact the Minister in their own right seeking compensatory land as many of them have to tell their pupils not to run in the playground because of limited space.  This area is a vital lung for them, and for the activities of the 350 primary teachers who I am told depend on it.  Scoil Thomáis, Scoil Francis Xavier, St. Patrick's national school, Scoil Oilibhéir, Scoil Bhríde, St. Brigid's national school and Coolmine community school are all very upset at the prospect of losing this precious small area particularly as the substantial green <Col N="2195" /> space that used to be available has been reduced to this small area.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister meet the action group?  Bearing in mind that St. Per-egrine's GAA Club has a very satisfactory arrangement for leasing land from the Department in Blakestown will she consider a similar system for the continuation of leasing at Beech Park?  If you take an average of 30 pupils in each of the 350 teachers' classes that makes a total of 10,500 children who have a great deal to lose from the Minister's short term gain.  Given the budgetary situation, the money could be made up through better use of public moneys rather than depriving many school children of this valuable land.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for giving me this opportunity to clarify once and for all the position concerning the decision to dispose of my Department's land at Beech Park Avenue, Castleknock, Dublin 15.</P>
      <P>Obviously because of the numerous representations received in my Department, I am now extremely aware of the anxieties expressed by the residents of the Castleknock area concerning the loss of the use of this land and I assure the Deputy that this matter was examined thoroughly before I made the decision to dispose of this site. However, I must make it crystal clear that this site at Beech Park Avenue was never intended to remain an open space.  In 1985 a short term letting on a yearly basis was agreed to facilitate the GAA club while the Department was deciding how best to utilise the site.</P>
      <P>To explain the circumstances which gave rise to this contentious issue perhaps it would be helpful if I outlined the background to this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The residents of Castleknock have been pressing vigorously for many years for the provision of a second level school for the area and the matter has been under examination in my Department since 1975.  In 1983 the Department purchased agricultural land at Beech Park Avenue at a cost of <Col N="2196" /> £469,535 and architectural planning for a second level school commenced.</P>
    <P>In 1987, following a review of the needs of the area, the then Minister for Education decided in the light of capital resources then available, to defer the provision of a new school on the basis that adequate pupil spaces existed in schools in adjacent areas.  A further review by consultants in 1993, recommended in the light of continuing housing development in the area and the difficulties some pupils were experiencing in obtaining school places, that the existing school site located at Beech Park Avenue was inadequate and in an unsatisfactory location, that a new site should be acquired in the Diswellstown area and that the construction of a post-primary school should commence at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>I decided in January 1994 to proceed as recommended by the consultants and that the new school would be a community colleage under the aegis of County Dublin Vocational Education Committee which identified a site in Diswellstown at a cost of £1.5 million and I authorised the vocational education committee to purchase this site immediately.  To meet the cost of this expensive site, the Beech Park site was offered in exchange plus a balancing payment to make up the total amount of £1.5 million.</P>
    <P>I regret the upset caused to the residents of the area and the GAA club by the sale of this land.  However, the arrangement with the GAA club was always intended to be temporary pending the construction of the proposed school.  This was made absolutely and emphatically clear to the GAA club in 1988 when it sought a ten year lease for the site.</P>
    <P>The zoning proposed for the lands in question and eventually adopted in the 1993 Development Plan was &ldquo;to protect and/or improve residential amenity&rdquo;.  In addition a specific objective was indicated on these lands &ldquo;to provide for a post-primary school or other institution&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I fully comprehend the anger expressed by the people who have been using this site for recreational purposes. <Col N="2197" /> However, I know the Deputy will appreciate that Exchequer funds allocated for the construction of school buildings were used to purchase this property and I am obliged to recoup the full market value.  Therefore, the course of action I pursued is fully justified.  I would also like to point out that, if the school had proceeded as originally planned the GAA club would still have lost the use of this playing field.  I am sure you now realise that this is neither a short term nor a short-sighted decision as the sale of this site will contribute indirectly to the provision of an urgently needed second level college for the Castleknock area.</P>
    <P>Finally Deputy, there are other mechanisms which have been established to provide open spaces.  Having considered all the factors I am satisfied that the decision I took was the correct one and in the best interests of all the taxpayers, including the residents of the Castleknock area, who will benefit enormously from the provision of a second level school.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for taking this question.  I regret that the matter should have to be brought to the Minister's attention or that an appeal has had to be made to the Minister.  The Minister has probably been provided with a prepared reply but I hope she will have an open mind to what I have to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 71 pupils travelling on the school bus transport service from St. Kieran's comprehensive school in Carraroe to the Lettermore-Lettermullen area of the islands.  On Mondays and Fridays the school closes at 3.5 p.m. and the bus does not arrive at the school until 4.15 p.m. &mdash; approximately an hour and 20 minutes later and if the bus is delayed it may be even later.  The pupils are then transported to the Lettermore-Lettermullen area and the last stop is at Tír an Fhia from where some pupils have to walk a further two miles. A number of them do not get home <Col N="2198" /> until 6 p.m.  Two years ago the designated school bus was taken off the route and CIE substituted a scheduled service which leaves Galway at 3.15 p.m. and arrives at different times in Carraroe.</P>
    <P>The school is closed by the time the bus leaves Galway and this has been done for the convenience of CIE.  The pupils spend one hour and 20 minutes hanging around Carraroe &mdash; we must remember that the school building closes at 3.45 p.m., the teachers all go home and pupils are left without supervision which makes parents very anxious and they feel they are being treated very badly by the Department. The vocational education committee operates the service for the Department and its chief executive officer, Conor Morris is trying to be of assistance.</P>
    <P>The ultimate decision must be made by the Department.  It has claimed that a satisfactory service exists but I appeal to the Minister to judge whether she considers it appropriate that on two days per week this should be allowed happen.  In winter and wet weather it is cruel to leave the children hanging around and getting home so late from school all because of some administrative arrangement.  It would be ideal to go back to the previous position and hire a special school bus to bring the children home in the evening instead of CIE linking it up to a scheduled service.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider the position.  There are 71 pupils involved.  I have attended meetings with the parents who have signed a petition about this.  There has been a problem with the service to Lettermore-Lettermullen from the comprehensive school but the most recent problem arose two years ago when the special school bus was taken off to suit the private bus operator.  I appeal to the Minister to have an open mind about the matter and to consider instructing CIE to enter into a contract with a local bus owner to collect the children from the school at 3.15 p.m. and have them home at a reasonable hour.  She should end the CIE system of linking them into the scheduled service but if the Department or CIE insist on operating this system <Col N="2199" /> CIE should be asked to change the time the scheduled bus leaves Galway to 2 p.m.</P>
    <P>It is a reasonable case.  The parents are upset and frustrated at the lack of concern and reaction from the Department and its refusal to listen to their pleas.  I hope the Minister realises that this is quite an issue in the area and that she will look into the case and come up with a satisfactory solution from the parents' point of view.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Molloy for raising this matter.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education has responsibility to ensure the safe delivery of about 166,000 primary and post-primary pupils throughout the country. The Department also has the responsibility of ensuring that the State gets the best possible value for the money it expends on the provision of this service on which, in the current year, approximately £39 million will be spent.  This figure includes approximately £4 million which Bus Éireann receives in charges from pupils liable for such charges.</P>
      <P>The main policy aim of the school transport scheme is to facilitate equality of access to primary and post-primary education by providing transport to enable children, who might otherwise have difficulty in doing so, attend school regularly.</P>
      <P>The post-primary transport scheme is organised, in the first instance, by the transport liaison officer, who is the chief executive officer of the vocational education committee of the county, in co-operation with the school authorities and Bus Éireann.  The Department does not make detailed arrangements.  This is the responsibility of the transport liaison officers in conjunction with Bus Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the organisation of school transport services, all routes are planned in such a way as to ensure that, as far as possible, every eligible pupil has a reasonable standard of service from the point of view of timetable and distance <Col N="2200" /> from the route while, at the same time, ensuring that all vehicles are fully utilised in the most efficient manner.</P>
    <P>In order to achieve this, individual vehicles are generally required to operate a number of services to both primary and post-primary schools.  This inevitably means that the timetable often requires some pupils to make an early start in the mornings and wait some time in the evenings.  This is and always has been a feature of the transport schemes throughout the country.</P>
    <P>When establishing post-primary services, routes are planned in such a way as to ensure as far as possible that no pupil will have more than three hours travelling and waiting time daily and live no more than three miles from the route of service.</P>
    <P>The position in this case is that as a result of re-organisation of the transport services in the Carraroe area, the service from Lettermore-Lettermullen, formerly operated by a private contractor, is now operated by a scheduled Bus Éireann bus.  This change was effective from 8 November 1993.  The departure time on Friday evenings was changed to 4.15 p.m.  Prior to this the departure time was 4.10 p.m.  However, it appears that when the contractor was operating, he was providing an earlier service not authorised by Bus Éireann.</P>
    <P>I understood the school now closes early on both Monday and Friday evenings.  The pupils in question are accommodated on a public scheduled service.  The service sought by the vocational education committee would require the provision of a special bus.  It is not open to the Department to sanction such a service as the cost would be prohibitive.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, the present arrangement is considered adequate and it is not possible to sanction an earlier departure on Mondays and Fridays as sought.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan 1994-1999 identifies weaknesses that exist in the Irish tourism industry as follows: a growing but, in international terms, still relatively low level of marketing activity resulting in under-utilisation of tourism plant, especially outside the peak periods; a highly seasonal tourism industry &mdash; 30 per cent of visitors to Ireland arrived in the peak July-August period in 1993; the need for competitive, reliable and regular access links to overseas markets; a need for expanded training investment to continue to raise quality and service standards throughout the industry; and a continued need to improve the cost competitiveness of Irish holidays.</P>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99, seeks to address these weaknesses by concentrating on measures such as: a large expansion in marketing activities, with a particular emphasis on off-season business; further product development to meet specific market deficiencies; major improvements in the conference, angling and culture and heritage product; and an expansion in the range and scale of training in order to cater for anticipated employment growth, to improve the quality of service to visitors and to help the industry adapt to Ireland's changing tourism market.</P>
      <P>In addition to the normal marketing activities of Bord Fáilte and the industry, and building on the success of similar campaigns in 1994, a special overseas tourism marketing initiative will take place in our most important tourism markets, US, Britain, France and Germany in 1995.  This initiative is jointly funded by the Exchequer, the industry North and South, and the European Union and will promote the island of Ireland as a single tourism destination. This will help to build on the significant opportunities for growth afforded by the peace process in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fiscal environment in which the tourism industry operates is also vital to <Col N="2138" /> its further development.  Since coming into office, I have had consultations with the industry and the Tourism Council about their concerns in this regard, some of which have been addressed in yesterday's budget.</P>
    <P>I have also decided that the Tourism Council, established by my predecessor, should continue its work and its four specialist working groups will continue to report to me on initiatives relating to access, marketing, product qualitydevelopment and training.  At a recent meeting of the council, I also emphasised as one of my key priorities for this year, the need to achieve continuing improvements in, and liberalisation of, our access links with our main markets and I will maintain constructive dialogue with my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, to achieve this.  I am satisfied that these measures will contribute significantly to continued tourism growth and, in particular, help overcome the constraints I have outlined.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 15 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>Japan is now one of the world's most important tourism markets with well over 13 million overseas visits in 1994, of which 1.6 million were to Europe. Promotion of Ireland in Japan is undertaken jointly by Bord Fáilte and Aer Lingus and results to date have been very impressive with Japanese visitors to Ireland increasing from 14,000 in 1992 to an estimated 22,000 in 1994. Additional funding of £100,000 was provided to Bord Fáilte last year from the tourism promotion and development fund to support increased promotional activity in the market.  Awareness of Ireland in the Japanese market will be further increased when Aer Lingus and Bord Fáilte move to the new Ireland House in Tokyo which will be opened in March 1995.  Bord Fáilte activities in 1995 will include travel trade seminars, trade advertising, media seminars and visits to Ireland and direct consumer advertising.</P>
      <P>Japanese tourists are becoming increasingly open to exploring new destinations and while our current share of the Japanese market is small.  I have no doubt that there is great potential for further significant growth.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>The matter of flights and air fares are a matter in the first instance for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  As part of the liberalisation process of recent years, the role of Governments in controlling and regulating air fares has been progressively reduced.  Under European Union rules and the Ireland-US Air Transport Agreement, which apply to most air services to and from Ireland, airlines serving Ireland are free to determine air fares in accordance with their own commercial judgment, subject to certain safeguards.</P>

    <P>From a tourism perspective I am, of course, concerned that air fares to Ireland should be competitive.  One of the key corporate objectives of my Department, in seeking to contribute to further growth in tourism, is to develop more competitive, regular and good quality access links with our markets. Considerable improvements have taken place in recent years in access to Ireland, particularly from the UK and continental Europe and this is reflected <Col N="2141" /> in the growth in passenger numbers from these markets.  But there is still scope for further improvements, especially from Europe, just as there remains the compelling need to constantly review access capacity on the trans-Atlantic corridor, given the Government's and the tourism sector's heavy marketing investment in the US during 1994 and this year.  The last thing we want to do is to create consumer, that is high-spend, holiday-maker, demand and be unable to service it with adequate direct capacity.</P>
    <P>Bearing these considerations in mind, I intend to maintain an open and constructive dialogue with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications throughout the year.  As I recently highlighted at the Tourism Council, my objective will be to encourage further improvements in, and liberalisation of, our access transport arrangements, particularly those relating to aviation.</P>

      <P>A State export credit insurance scheme has been in operation for several years.  Between 1971 and 1991 the scheme was administered by the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, as agent of the Minister, though there was close liaison between the Department and the company, with some decisions requiring ministerial approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of 1991, the State scheme was restructured and since then the new scheme has been administered directly by my Department without the use of an agent.  Cover is provided for short term political risk and medium-term commercial and political risk.  Shortterm commercial risk cover, provided by the State up to the end of 1991, must now be obtained from the private sector. I have arranged for a copy of the <Col N="2142" /> current handout on the State scheme to be sent to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The recently launched Operational Programme for Industrial Development 1994-99, includes a specific sub-programme for market development. An estimated £450 million, comprising EU, Exchequer and private funding, will be spent over the six year period under the sub-programme, which will be concentrated almost exclusively on developing marketing capability within indigenous small and medium-sized firms.</P>
      <P>Specific targets in the sub programme are to increase indigenous exports by an average of 9 per cent per annum and to increase market share in EU countries by up to 25 per cent, whilst also expanding market share outside the EU.  In order to help Irish firms achieve these objectives, specific assistance will be provided under three complementary measures encompassing the provision of information on market opportunities, advice on exploiting these opportunities and financial assistance.</P>

      <P>The proposed allocation to my Department for 1995, including the provision of £2.3 million announced in yesterday's budget, shows a reduction of approximately £4.2 million on the 1994 net provisional outturn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2145" /> The primary reason for the reduction is the decrease of £5.8 million in the 1995 allocation under subhead D.1 &ldquo;Export Credit Insurance (The Insurance Act, 1953 (as amended)) &mdash; Repayment to the Central Fund&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The provision under this subhead relates to advances made from the Central Fund to meet the actual cost of net liabilities incurred under the export credit insurance scheme.  Therefore, the provisions are actual rather than estimated. The 1994 outturn of £5.916 million relates to net liabilities which were incurred under the scheme between 1 April 1992 and 31 March 1993 while the 1995 allocation of £103,000 relates to net liabilities which were incurred between 1 April 1993 and 31 March 1994.  In simple language, what the 1995 reduction means is that substantially less in the way of liabilities under export credit insurance were met in 1994 than in 1993, which, I am sure the House will fully agree, is a very desirable thing.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the allocation to my Department for 1995 does not narrow my discretion in implementing Government policy in the area of tourism and trade.</P>

The recruitment of employees in the non-officer grades is entirely a matter for local authorities; there are no central controls on such recruitment.

      <P>The destruction of tropical forests is one of today's major environmental issues.  The issue is a complex one, however, and responses must also be multifaceted.</P>
      <P>Trade is not the major cause of damage to tropical forests, as it accounts for only about 20 per cent of felling.  The main cause is clearance for agriculture, aggravated by poverty, unequal land distribution, lack of access to credit and markets, and rising population pressure. Trade in tropical timber is also important to developing countries and is their third most important export commodity after petroleum and coffee.  Unilateral action on restricting trade is also prevented by EU and GATT commitments.</P>
      <P>Forests are a renewable natural resource and can be managed to produce timber and other products on a sustainable basis, but less than 1 per cent of tropical timber producing forests are currently managed on that basis, and many producer countries will not be able to achieve sustainability for some years yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland does not have the resources to make major individual efforts in <Col N="2167" /> relation to the protection of tropical forests, and so we are concentrating on co-operation on an international level and on import substitution in the long term.</P>
    <P>International co-operation has the advantage of its large scale, pooling of resources and expertise, and possibilities for co-operation and consultation with producers.  This is vital if viable forests are to be protected and if trade in tropical timber is to be linked with sustainable management.  The European Union plays an active role in the protection of tropical forests, for example:</P>
    <P>&mdash; within the International Tropical Timber Organisation</P>
    <P>&mdash; in conjunction with the FAO</P>
    <P>&mdash; with the World Bank</P>
    <P>&mdash; within the framework of UN Conference on Environment and Development (Rio 1993), and</P>
    <P>&mdash;through its funding of projects involving tropical forests.</P>
    <P>and we will continue to play our part in future developments.</P>
    <P>Part of our forestry policy is to increase the planting of temperate hardwoods or broadleaves, which will in the long term produce timber which can substitute for tropical imports.  Our current national target for broadleaf planting is 20 per cent of all planting.</P>
