      <Quest>the progress, if any, that been has made in relation to the introduction of a major information technology programme in the Attorney General's office and the appointment of additional staff to the parliamentary draftsman's office.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The systems in the office of the Attorney General have been reviewed by specialist information technology consultants from the Central Information Technology Services of the Department of Finance and an information technology plan covering a two-year period of implementation for the office has been drawn up and agreed. The Government agreed it was desirable that, in addition to the steps recommended in the report of the review group on the office, independent legal technology consultants should be engaged to provide quality assurance in relation to the information technology plan.  These consultants have assessed the plan, visited the Attorney General's office and made a favourable interim <Col N="514" /> report on the plan and the manner in which it is being implemented.</P>
      <P>A case and correspondence tracking system was determined to be a priority in that plan and is now at an advanced stage of planning.  In addition to this tracking function, the new information technology system will cover the storage and keywording of office legal &ldquo;know how&rdquo;, access to external legal databases, a new IT package for drafting legislation, and a new internal and external communications system, with appropriate staff training to assure that these systems will be utilised to the best advantage. Rapid progress is being made on all these fronts with the collaboration of the professional, technical, managerial and administrative staff at all levels.</P>
      <P>As regards the appointment of additional staff to the parliamentary draftsman's office, a competition under the Civil Service Commission Act, 1956, to lead to the recruitment initially of two more draftsmen is being organised and is expected to be advertised later this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach will be aware, the report was published on 21 February.  Has any new equipment, softwear or hardware been acquired since then?  The report recommended that extra accommodation should be provided to facilitate the implementation of the new information technology plan.  Has anything been done about that?  It also recommended training in information technology for the staff in the office of the Attorney General. Has anything been done about that?  On the report's recommendation on the introduction of a system of electronic mail, has anything been done in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Something has been done about all these matters.  They are being dealt with as part of an integrated information technology plan upon which quality assurance has been carried out by independent legal technology consultants.  All those matters which are necessary to give effect in full <Col N="515" /> to the plan over the period involved are being put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>On the date of publication of the report there were 23 people employed in the Attorney General's office, 15 in the advisory section and eight in the parliamentary draftsman's section, as well as three retired draftsmen employed on contract.  Will the Taoiseach confirm there has been no increase in staff in the three months since the report was published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As yet there has not been an increase in staff, but the position on the recruitment of additional staff in the parliamentary draftsmen's section &mdash; I cannot give answers about clerical and other categories of staff &mdash; is that a competition is being organised to recruit two more draftspersons.  On the use of contract drafting, that matter is being actively examined by the Attorney General.  I discussed the matter with him after it was raised by the Deputy and others and he told me he is taking every possible step to recruit people on a contract basis for whom a long training and induction period is not necessary because they already have the skills.  I am aware the Attorney General is pursuing that matter actively, but the number of people available with the necessary skills is not very large.</P>

      <P>In the programme for renewal the Government committed itself to examining the Attorney General's role in terms of his position as legal adviser to the Government and protector of the Constitution for the people.  Has progress been made in that regard?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>The Taoiseach will recall that following the events that brought down the last Government a commitment was given that any letters in relation to the matter raised by Deputy O'Donnell would be brought to the Attorney General's attention.

      <P>That is a matter on which, therefore, I cannot elaborate any further but, as the Deputy stated, I acknowledge that public assurances were given about dealing with correspondence on such matters.  That is one <Col N="517" /> of the factors I will have to take into careful account in assessing the report I have received&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach a direct question.  Does he feel as accountable to this House regarding the internal workings of the Attorney General's office as he sought to make the previous Taoiseach and, if so, will he accept that this House is now entitled to the transparency it received from the then Taoiseach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly believe I am as accountable as the previous Taoiseach was to the House for any decisions I take and for matters relating to the Attorney General's office.  When I have concluded my inquiries into this matter and made a decision on it I will give a full account to the House, which is its entitlement.  The Deputy should recognise that in reaching decisions that could affect the position of individuals I am obliged to act in accordance with fair procedure and not to say anything in response to legitimate questions from the Opposition that could prejudice my <Col N="518" /> ability or freedom to make the appropriate decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I suggest he is not telling us anything.  Will he accept my word that I am not expecting him to draw conclusions on the matter referred to in the question, but does he agree that drawing conclusions and simply giving straight answers to straight questions is a separate matter?  In refusing to answer questions he is concealing information to which the House is entitled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no reason or motive for concealing information from this House on any of these matters other than my solemn obligation to ensure that I act in accordance with fair procedures in any decisions I reach which could conceivably affect the position of individuals.  I hope Members will accept that is my sole motivation in this matter.  If Members wish to suggest otherwise, they may do so but they would not be accurate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the position of individuals, surely it is the right of elected Members to seek information from the Taoiseach on a matter of such importance and have it placed on the record of this House?  Such information should take <Col N="519" /> priority over all other matters around which the Taoiseach is trying to hedge.</P>

Does he see any inconsistency in the support he is receiving from the Tánaiste as opposed to the support the Tánaiste refused to give to the previous Taoiseach?</P>

      <P>A commitment was given in the programme <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to reform the Attorney General's office to ensure that there would be no breakdown in the future in this regard.  Is the Taoiseach asking the Members of the Dáil and the public to accept that by not telling us when this letter was passed over to the Attorney General that he would be in some way prejudicing a person in the Attorney General's office or elsewhere?  I would not accept that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As the report indicated that the lack of information technology was the single greatest barrier to the proper functioning of the Office of the Attorney General, will the Taoiseach state if any new equipment has been installed?  We know there are major plans, but the introduction of technology, which is not remote or extra-ordinary, should not cause difficulty. Have computers and printers been installed?  Central to this development two key posts were to be filled in the <Col N="521" /> office, the head of administration and a systems and services manager and as plenty of people are available to do that type of work there is no need to delay filling those posts.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position, nor would it be relevant, for me to give answers regarding individual items of equipment.  I said that the purchase of equipment with other steps, including training relevantly referred to by Deputy O'Dea, are being put in place together on an integrated basis as part of an information technology plan.  The acquisition of equipment prior to the identification of need and the training of persons to use it would be premature. The important point is that the whole process and every interlocking aspect of it is being dealt with as part of an overall plan.  That is the important and relevant answer to the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues arising in answering this question relate directly to the Fr. Brendan Smyth case.</P>
      <P>Arising, in particular, out of the seven month delay in dealing with the extradition warrants in the Fr. Smyth case, I had, shortly after the conclusion on 26 January 1995 of the hearing of evidence by the Dáil select committee, instituted an inquiry &mdash; including, <i>inter alia</i>, seeking formal and independent legal advice &mdash; as to what action, if any, might appropriately be taken arising from the manner in which the case had been dealt with in the Office of the Attorney General during the seven months in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was in the process, on foot of a study of the advice I had received, of finalising my deliberations on the matter when the information about the way the correspondence referred to in this question was dealt with in the Attorney General's office came to my attention.  This new information, which I regard as serious, required that I institute additional inquiries.  These are ongoing, <Col N="523" /> and as soon as they have been completed and I have considered the outcome, I will inform the House of the action, if any, I am taking.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that this matter is being pursued as expenditiously as possible, but Deputies will understand that there are difficult issues involved including, in particular, the entitlement to fair procedure.  In the light of that, I believe that I cannot give further information to the House at this stage without running the risk of prejudicing my capacity to deal with the matter properly and fully in due course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's procrastinated response, will he indicate who received the letter of 14 November from the solicitors representing the victims of Fr. Brendan Smyth?  Who dealt with it?  Was it the former Attorney General, Mr. Eoghan Fitzsimons, or the original official who dealt with the processing of extradition warrants in the débâcle?  Was the new Attorney General made aware of the contents of the letter when appointed to that office on the formation of the new Government and was the Taoiseach made aware of its contents?  Is it true that a response was only sent to the solicitors representing the victims on foot of a parliamentary question tabled by me to the Minister for Justice two weeks ago?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I instituted inquiries in this matter which may require me to take action on foot of them being concluded.

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the special review group he set up chaired by the secretaries of three Government Departments, including the Department of Justice, resulted directly from the original delay in processing extradition warrants?  Will he also agree that one of the guiding and learning points which emerged from that débâcle was that in future all matters regarding the safety of children and related matters of child sexual abuse should receive the highest priority in the Office of the Attorney General?  I received a letter this morning, posted yesterday from the general office, indicating that the Taoiseach intended to refer this question to the Minister for Justice and that it would be deferred for oral reply until the next time questions to the Minister for Justice are taken. Could it be true that yesterday when the Taoiseach was dispensing accountability within the Cabinet that he was seeking to evade answering this question by transferring it to the Minister for Justice?</P>

As the Deputy said, it is correct that the report on the Attorney General's Office commissioned by the previous Government recommends that extra special care should be taken regarding child abuse cases.  That is certainly true and in assessing this matter I will obviously take that into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of policing falls within the remit of Article 7 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement which, <i>inter alia</i>, records the agreement of the two Governments that there is a need for a programme of special measures in Northern Ireland to improve relations between the security forces and the community.  I and my predecessors have availed fully of the Anglo-Irish machinery to put forward views on policing issues, both general and specific.</P>
      <P>In the post-ceasefire situation, growing attention is being paid to the future of policing in Northern Ireland and discussions on the subject are taking place in various fora, including the consultations initiated by the Police Authority. I believe that the machinery established under the Anglo-Irish Agreement constitutes the most appropriate channel for communicating the views of the Government on this matter.  I had a useful discussion about these matters with the Secretary of State at the most recent meeting of the conference on 28 April, and we agreed that we will continue to keep developments in this area under close review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering possible future <Col N="529" /> arrangements, it is relevant to note, as provided in paragraph 44 of the Joint Framework Document, that issues of law and order in Northern Ireland are closely interwined with the issues of political agreement and consensus. Within that context, the Governmment's approach to the future of policing in Northern Ireland is based on the reality that the Nationalist community must be convinced that policing structures in Northern Ireland are accountable and independent from partisan political control, responsive to the policing needs of all sections of the community, reflective of the communities they serve and that they give equal esteem to the Nationalist identity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Tánaiste's comprehensive reply, for which I thank him, does he agree that notwithstanding the service given by many brave and conscientious police officers in the RUC, reform of policing generally in the North is required if the police are to have the confidence of the entire community, not just in the more well-known Nationalist areas in Belfast, Derry and South Armagh but right across the nationalist community?  Will the Tánaiste agree that major surgery, not just reform, is required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>For a police service to secure and enjoy cross-community support it must be accountable, free from partisan political control and it must reflect, both in its composition and ethos, the communities it serves.  Those are the targets we should be setting out to achieve in relation to the reform of the RUC and the new police structures in Northern Ireland.  It is very important &mdash; and much work must be done in this respect &mdash; to gain the confidence of the nationalist community in regard to the RUC.  It is important also that we examine this in an open manner and I believe the authorities wish to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste referred to his discussions at the Anglo-Irish Conference in relation to bringing to the <Col N="530" /> attention of the British representatives the deficiencies in the RUC.  Has he put forward specific suggestions on behalf of the Government as to how reform should be undertaken and the form civilian policing would take in the post-ceasefire situation in the North?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is well aware that the question of policing probably has been discussed at most if not all Anglo-Irish Conferences since 1986. There is an ongoing widespread debate here, within Northern Ireland and in the UK in relation to the various reforms which are necessary.  I believe, and it is the view of the Government, that the most appropriate forum for us to make our views known is through the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Anglo-Irish Conference and that is what we intend to do.  At various times, different areas of policing have been raised and our concern would be to make our views known in the manner which is most effective.  I believe we are achieving that throughout the Anglo-Irish Conference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos, 7, 9, 25, 26, 35 and 40 together since they all relate to the 1996 intergovenmental conference and because of their link to positions which the Commission and the European Parliament may take at the Reflection Group and at the conference itself.</P>
      <P>The European Council meeting at Corfu in June 1994 agreed to establish a Reflection Group of Personal Representatives of Foreign Ministers to prepare for the 1996 intergovenmental conference. The group will also include a representative of the President of the Commission and two members of the European Parliament.  Ireland's representative on the Reflection Group will be the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Council also agreed that the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament should establish, before the start of the work of the <Col N="532" /> Reflection Group, reports on the functioning of the Treaty on European Union which would provide an input to the work of the group.</P>
    <P>The Reflection Group is mandated in particular to examine those provisions of the Treaty on European Union for which a revision is foreseen, including notably, the common foreign and security policy and the powers of the European Parliament.  It is also mandated to elaborate options in the perspective of future enlargement of the European Union on certain institutional questions including the weighting of votes in the Council and the number of members of the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Reflection Group will have its inaugural meeting in Messina on 3 June. It is envisaged that the Reflection Group will report to the Madrid European Council in December 1995 and that the intergovernmental conference will open during the Italian Presidency of the Union in the first half of 1996.  It will continue throughout the Irish Presidency of the Union.</P>
    <P>The Council's report on the functioning of the treaty was adopted on 10 April.  Copies of the report were lodged in the Oireachtas Library for the information of Deputies and the report was considered by the Joint Committee on European Affairs on 2 May 1995.  The European Commission's report was published on 10 May.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament adopted its position in a resolution based on the reports by two MEPs. Mr. Martin and Mr. Bourlanges, on 17 May.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament's resolution on the functioning of the treaty goes beyond an analysis of the existing treaty provisions and includes ambitious and detailed proposals for the revision of the treaties in the perspective of future enlargement.  Parliament's position reflects careful and detailed consideration of the issues facing the Union and represents an important contribution to the preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>In its vote on the Bourlanges and <Col N="533" /> Martin reports the European Parliament did not take on board the proposal that there should be a Commissioner responsible specifically for defence.  This proposal does not, therefore, feature in the resolution as adopted by the Parliament and, consequently, does not represent a proposal of the Parliament.</P>
    <P>The Parliament's resolution, contrary to some media reports, accepts explicitly that there should continue to be at least one Commissioner from each member state.  I fully agree with this view which is in accordance with the Government's policy approach on the composition of the Commission.</P>
    <P>With regard to the powers of the European Parliament, the resolution suggests that the Parliament should have equal status with the Council in all fields of EU legislative and budgetary competence.</P>
    <P>The extension of the scope of the co-decision procedure which provides for the European Parliament to decide on legislation jointly with the council will be one of the key issues at the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.  The Parliament believes that this procedure should be extended into as many areas as possible.  Our approach is that there is scope for an extension of the legislative areas to which the co-decision procedure applies.  While much detailed work needs to be done, the Government's approach to an enhanced role for the European Parliament will be generally positive while at the same time maintaining the broad inter-institutional balance.</P>
    <P>Another important issue to be discussed by the Intergovernmental Conference, which has been highlighted by President Santer and others, will be the possible extension of qualified majority voting to areas where unanimity is, at present, required.  The Commission's report on the functioning of the treaty mentions that future enlargement has reinforced the need to examine improvements to the decision making process and that, in this context, there should be increased recourse to qualified majority voting.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="534" /> There is a good case for the extension of qualified majority voting to some of the areas in the first pillar of the Maastricht Treaty, that is on European Community business, where a requirement for unanimity exists at present.  We will adopt a broadly positive approach to this discussion at the Intergovernmental Conference.  At the same time, some areas including matters which fall under the second pillar &mdash; the Common Foreign and Security Policy &mdash; and the third pillar &mdash; Justice and Home Affairs &mdash; are particularly sensitive.  We are not convinced of the arguments for a move to majority voting in such areas.</P>
    <P>The Commission's report also touches on the question of what it describes as differentiated rhythms of integration.  The report points out that this concept already exists, for example, in the area of economic and monetary union.  The Commission believes that it is natural to grant certain member states a reasonable period in which to adapt to a particular policy.  At the same time, the report stresses that such a differentiated approach to the implementation of a common policy must take place within the single institutional framework. The commission also points out that a permanent derogation from a common policy suggests a Europe <i>à la carte</i>, a structure which the commission rejects.</P>
    <P>In our approach to the European Union we have consistently opposed the creation of an exclusive inner core of member states.  Ideally we also favour a single speed approach to integration. We have, however, accepted that a differentiated approach to a common objective, such as economic and monetary union, in so far as timing is concerned, is an obvious and sensible approach to the implementation of a common policy in which not all member states are capable of participating fully.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Commission's rejection of any differentiated approach which would, in time, lead to a so-called <i>à la carte</i> European Union.  I also agree with the Commission that any arrangement envisaged for a differentiated <Col N="535" /> approach should ensure the preservation of the single institutional framework.</P>
    <P>The system of the rotating six-monthly Presidency of the Union may also be discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference.  Ireland would oppose any proposals which would have the objective or effect of depriving the smaller member states of their right to hold the Presidency.  The rotating Presidency is important because of the pivotal position the office occupies in the present treaty structure as it enables each member state in its turn to play a central role in the development and implementation of policy.  There is nothing to suggest that the efficiency of a presidency is affected by the size of the member state that holds it.</P>

      <Quest>the current attitude of the Government to arms decommissioning in Northern Ireland; and the reasons for the change in the Government's policy on this topic from that enunciated by him in Dáil Éireann in June 1994.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9442/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has repeatedly made clear the importance it attaches to progress in removing the stocks of weapons held by para-militaries. Dealing with the paramilitary arsenals is clearly an essential element in the peace process and crucial to the achievement of a lasting peace.  As I stated in the House on 4 April, it is impossible to envisage a lasting peace without the objective of the removal of paramilitary arms having been achieved. This approach underlies the position taken by Government representatives, both publicly and in all relevant private contacts on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government welcomes the fact <Col N="538" /> that there is general agreement with its view that this is one of the key issues which must be addressed and that it is now under serious discussion in the meetings which both Sinn Féin and loyalist representatives are having with British Ministers.</P>
    <P>We hope these discussions will be productive and will significantly advance the prospect of a satisfactory solution.  We will be seeking to avail to the fullest extent possible of our contacts and influence to promote this objective.</P>
    <P>However, as the Taoiseach and I have emphasised, the peace process is not a single issue agenda and progress in any one area is more likely in the context of movement on a range of issues.  The objective of permanent peace will be achieved only by a co-ordinated process which involves movement on all sides.</P>
    <P>My own and the Government's position in this regard has been quite consistent. I stated to the Dáil on 1 June 1994 that the definitive abandonment of the use or support of violence for political ends would open the way to participation in political talks and to a role in the shaping of an agreed future for the Irish people and that it was also a pre-condition for participation in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>
    <P>I also stated on 1 June that the manner in which a permanent end to violence could be established and verified and the other practical consequences of a permanent cessation of violence would be matters for decision at a later stage in the light of circumstances.</P>
    <P>Since 1 June there has been an unprecedented change of circumstances.  The ceasefires have changed the situation dramatically.  We must not ignore or undervalue the crucial importance of the continued silence of the guns, even if there is a further stage &mdash; the actual decommissioning of weapons on all sides &mdash; which has yet to be attained.</P>
    <P>It is important to avoid a circular argument whether prior decommissioning is the condition for political progress, or political progress for decommissioning.  As a political reality, <Col N="539" /> neither issue is likely to be fully resolved in isolation from the other.  As the Taoiseach stated in the House on 25 April, &ldquo;Without progress on the arms issue there will not be progress on other issues.  Equally, for there to be progress on the arms issue there are many other issues on which there must be progress&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I hope that the serious discussion which has now begun on decommissioning will be paralleled by serious discussion of the various political issues which are the particular responsibility of political leaders, and which are equally necessary for a resolution of the problem.</P>
    <P>Our task is to build momentum by developing progress across the entire agenda which must be addressed.  We will continue to press for this, both in regard to the overarching goal of launching comprehensive political negotiations and on the specific issue of decommissioning of paramilitary arsenals.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that Deputy McDowell asked him on 1 June 1994 if there could be any talks without the surrender of arms?  The question was asked twice and an unqualified assurance was given that there could not be any talks.  That is different from what the Minister said today.  Does he believe it is a normal political dialogue if one of the several parties to the dialogue has at its disposal, or at the disposal of its close associates, a large amount of arms none of which it has surrendered over the past eight or nine months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the position clear on 1 June last year and stated, as reported at column 1019 of the Official Report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definitive abandonment of the use, or support, of violence for political ends would open the way to participation in political talks and to a role in the shaping of an agreed future for the Irish people.  It is also a <Col N="540" /> precondition for participation in the proposed Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>
    <P>It is important that we maintain momentum in the discussions which must take place.  The Irish and British Governments said on many occasions that they would be generous in their response if there were a permanent cessation of violence.  That has taken place and thankfully has been maintained since 31 August 1994.  It is the Government's aim and intention to see the removal of paramilitary arms from all sides of the divide in Northern Ireland.  We have encouraged Sinn Féin and the British Government to enter into discussions on this crucial issue and other issues central to the peace process. I welcome the discussions and meetings that took place at ministerial level with Sinn Féin in the past number of weeks and the fact that further meetings will be held this week.  Hopefully we can build on that and make progress on the decommissioning of arms and resolving other issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Last June, it was a pre-condition to entry to the forum. Obviously, that condition has been dropped.  Given the Minister's view now, does he support the Sinn Féin demand that all arms be decommissioned in Northern Ireland in which apparently they include the RUC and British Army?</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley is well aware that arms in the possession of the security forces and the police force in Northern Ireland are legally held weapons.

      <P>The United Nations target is one of the subjects which comes up for discussion from time to time at meetings of EU Ministers with responsibility for development co-operation.  The Development Council meets twice a year.  The next Council, which I shall be attending, will take place in Luxembourg on 1 June.</P>
      <P>There are big differences in the level of achievement of the member states of the European Union as regards reaching the United Nations target.  Some member states, such as Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands, comfortably exceed the target and spend more than 0.7 per cent of GNP on official development assistance.  Others have a long way to go before they will reach the target.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, Ireland has been making steady progress in improving our record in this area.  This year, with a total aid budget of £89 million, spending on ODA is likely to reach 0.27 per cent of GNP.  By 1997, we aim to be on a par with the performance of most of our EU partners.</P>
      <P>As well as discussing levels of ODA, the Development Council devotes considerable time to the quality of aid and especially EU aid.  The EU is by far the largest donor in the world and it is essential that this aid be used in the most effective manner.  I assure the Deputy that I shall continue to play an active role in this process.</P>

Will she press this viewpoint at the next Council meeting?</P>

      <P>The target of 0.7 per cent was not plucked out of thin air.  A resolution was adopted at the UN Gerneral Assembly in 1970 which attempted to arrive at what seemed at the time an achievable target.  I am aware that there is ongoing debate in a number of countries, particularly in the UK and US, which would seek to downplay the role and importance of development assistance. In the UK, overall ODA contributions have declined and there have been other cuts in Government expenditure.</P>
      <P>The Irish position at international fora is clear.  Our policy is to meet the UN targets over a period of time.  The Government has been praised for attempting to meet the targets at a time when unfortunately many of the countries are cutting back.  We will continue our policy and will press the argument regarding the quality of aid, that it be directed at those who are poorest in areas such as primary health, education, clean water and sanitation.  We have continued to support the French Presidency in their proposal to expand the eighth round of Lomé and the European Development Fund, which has not been finalised.  Some partners had difficulty meeting the proposal of the French Presidency.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The total aid budget is £89 million and of that £55 million will go towards bilateral aid programmes. Intensive and extensive negotiations are held with the Governments and local authorities in the recipient countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of priority countries within Africa and we have recently added a number of others, in particular Uganda and Ethiopia.  We are examining the question of extending bilateral <Col N="543" /> status to Mozambique.  Human rights are a core element and in countries where there are continuing difficulties all Irish aid is carefully monitored.  We maintain a close working relationship with Irish NGOs who may be working in those countries and continually receive advice and information from them which is of great importance and highly valued by the Government in formulating policy.  All aid is carefully monitored.</P>
    <P>On the figures for next year, I hope we can meet our target, which will represent a substantial increase.  One of the problems is that aid delivery has to be planned over a very long period and it can take some time to implement development programmes.  We are on course to give a further increase next year and I hope the Government will give a commitment to this in next year's budget.</P>

      <P>At the United Nations Ireland has proposed the elaboration of a code of conduct for conventional arms transfers which would encourage states voluntarily to exercise responsibility and restraint in their exports and imports of conventional arms and set out common principles to be observed in this area.  At Ireland's initiative, a draft resolution aimed at putting the work in hand was tabled at the General Assembly last autumn on behalf of the EU and a number of Eastern European countries.  The discussions on this draft resolution demonstrated that, while there is growing acceptance of the need <Col N="544" /> for international action in this area, a number of states, notably certain developing countries, remain to be convinced.</P>
      <P>In accordance with its commitment in the programme.  <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> the Government is now working, together with EU partners and other like-minded countries, to broaden support among UN member states for action in this area.  At the current session of the United Nations Disarmament Commission in New York, Ireland has tabled proposals which it is hoped will become the basis of further more detailed work in the Commission.  Our twin objectives are, on the one hand, to ease the fears of some developing countries that acceptance of the principles contained in the code might interfere with their legitimate right to provide for their self-defence and on the other, to widen the base of support for reducing over-armament through the voluntary exercise of restraint in conventional arms exports and imports.</P>

We have taken that resolution to the United Nations, in the same way Mr. Aiken did in regard to nuclear non-proliferation. I hope that the principles on which we have built that resolution will be accepted.  These include observing relevant UN or European Union sanctions, refraining from exporting arms to certain areas of actual or potential conflict, taking account of respect for human rights in the country of destination and weighing the risk that arms might be re-exported under undesirable conditions.  We have to start somewhere and, while we cannot rewrite the difficult and bitter history of the African <Col N="546" /> continent which has suffered primarily because of colonisation, we are trying to bring it out of this, so to speak.  We have made a start by setting down the criteria.

It is in the interests of all the people of Ireland.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that following much pressure from this side of the House the Taoiseach has extended an invitation to the parties in the North to participate in the Strand II talks.  I hope that these discussions get under way as soon as possible.  However I am concerned at the reluctance of the British Government to indicate its long term thinking on the North and the talks process. Both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have emphasised that the talks cannot deal only with decommissioning. This is a very important item and it must be tackled in the context of the overall <Col N="548" /> solution to the problem, but is there another item on the British agenda?  If so, will the Minister reassure those involved in the peace process that he is pressing to ensure that full democratic participation is part of the British Government's agenda?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously I cannot speak on behalf of the British Government. The Irish Government wants to bring about inclusive negotiations and discussions. I am satisfied from my meetings with the Secretary of State that a broader agenda is being exercised by the British Government &mdash; an agenda based on the Framework Document and on the Downing Street Declaration. There is a determination from Prime Minister level downwards to begin negotiations, discussions and dialogue with all the democratically mandated parties.  Obviously, we want that to happen as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>We should acknowledge that progress has been made in recent weeks.  There is a terrible, and sometimes frustrating, tendency when we resolve an aspect of the problem for people to look for the next problem without allowing for a period in which we can benefit from the progress made.  The moment the metings between Mr. Ancram and Sinn Féin were announced the media looked for the next problem.  When will we move beyond that?  A substantive amount of work has to be done at that level.  I hope the meeting which will take place in Washington this week is yet another positive indicator in this whole process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Tánaiste to take the opportunity to encourage the British to initiate round table talks if for no other reason than to let us see who is prepared to advance the peace process and attend talks and who is afraid of talks.  What is there to be afraid of in talks?  Let us see that the representatives of the Unionist community attend all party talks.  Let them accept the invitation. If they do not accept the invitation they will come under pressure from their own community to be <Col N="549" /> present.  I urge the Tánaiste to encourage the British Government to invite all parties to a session of round table talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Whereas the objective is to get to round table talks and inclusive negotiations it may be desirable to have a round of bilateral discussions between the parties and the Governments initially.  That was the procedure envisaged in the Framework Document and in the Downing Street Declaration.  I would like to see that taking place as soon as possible.  What is most important at this stage is that we do not either lose or give the impression of losing the momentum in this process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the bilateral talks, to which the Tánaiste referred, as being advisable, taken place with each party or only with some parties?  If that is the case, what steps will be taken to encourage every party to become involved in them?  Will he agree that the main constitutional parties in the North and the more moderate parties seem to have been politically marking time over the past nine months and letting the agenda be run from elsewhere?  Will he agree that is undesirable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to get all parties engaged in talks.  There is a responsibility on the parties in Northern Ireland, as there is on both Governments, to engage in bilateral talks and ultimately <Col N="550" /> in round table discussions.  All the parties have been invited.  As the Deputy has said some parties seem to be holding off.  What we need now is a session of bilateral talks to agree on the agenda and prepare for the inclusive negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste accept that nine months into the ceasefire when the marching season, a particularly dangerous time, has begun it is essential that progress be seen to be made rather than just talks?  One area where he could put pressure on the British Government relates to the question of prisoners.  This issue is absolutely vital both from the loyalist point of view and the republican point of view.  The Government has moved forward on this question but the prison regime in the North has become harder and there have been no releases.  An indication of a release policy is essential as the prisoners on both sides of the community played a vital role in bringing about the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to acknowledge there has been a considerable degree of progress since the cessation of military operations, be it in terms of opening cross-Border roads, the withdrawal of British Army patrols and the general policing in Northern Ireland.  We want to build on that progress.  I accept that the issue of prisoners raised by the Deputy is an important one from the point of view of both Governments.  It has a high priority on our agenda and it will remain high because the prisoners have a very important role to play in both communities in terms of the influence they can exercise and in terms of their willingness to participate in democratic politics.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>Although established by the British and Irish Governments, the board of the International Fund for Ireland enjoys autonomous decision making powers within the terms of its mandate and its members act independently from Government.  Over the last nine years the fund has received a cumulative contribution of some $250 million from the United States.</P>
      <P>The US House of Representatives International Relations Committee last week endorsed principles of economic justice which broadly approximate to the McBride Principles.  If enacted, such a provision would require that disbursements from the International Fund should comply with these broad principles. This Bill is expected to be considered by the full House of Representatives either today or tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the beginning, the fund has carefully ensured that all its disbursements are in accordance with the principle of equality of opportunity and non-discrimination in employment.  Its current conditions of offer require recipients of fund assistance in Northern Ireland to formally accept the statutory fair employment code and to explicitly accept the principles of equality of opportunity and non-discrimination in employment.  The question of the fund's application of the proposed new principles of economic justice would be a <Col N="552" /> matter to be considered by its independent board.</P>
    <P>Although only a first step in the legislative process, the decision of the international relations committee to authorise further financial support for the fund is encouraging.  The recent visit to Ireland by the Committee's Chairman, Congressman Gilman, presented a useful opportunity for the Government, and indeed a number of individual Deputies, to emphasise to him the important role of the fund in helping to consolidate the peace process on the ground, and his interest is much appreciated.</P>
    <P>A parallel process of consideration is also under way in the US Senate.  As part of a substantial foreign aid reduction Bill, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, had originally proposed that the Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act, 1986, should be repealed.  This Act provides the legislative basis for US contributions to the fund.  Deputies will be pleased to know that, following representations from the Government, Senator Helms has in recent days decided not to proceed with his proposal to repeal the 1986 Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act.  The Government is most appreciative of Senator Helms' positive response to our representations on this matter.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will appreciate, the question of future US support for the International Fund is both complex and fluid. It is also bound up with the wider debate in the United States on the reduction of the foreign aid bill and the elimination of the Federal deficit.  I do not expect matters to be finally determined until later in the summer, when the House of Representatives and US Senate seek to reconcile their differing approaches to the issue.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the Government will avail of every opportunity to restate the case for continued US support for the International Fund at this critical time and to express its appreciation for the United States assistance over the last nine years.  Indeed, over the next <Col N="553" /> few days in Washington, I will be emphasising the need for continued Congressional support for the International Fund for Ireland.</P>

I would like also to take the opportunity of thanking the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  Senator Helms, <Col N="554" /> for his agreement to withdraw his proposal. I will also be taking the opportunity, with the Leader of my party, to encourage continuing support of the IFI in the US.</P>
      <P>Although the Tánaiste does not have direct responsibility for it, will he take the opportunity, with the board of the IFI, to encourage the board to be flexible in regard to applications before it from both sides of the community. There is concern about the procedures relating to applications, particularly among the representatives of the community associations on the loyalist side in east Belfast and in the Shankill and, in many cases, they would benefit from assistance in completing application forms.  There is much to be said for giving the greatest possible assistance to overcome the bureaucracy.  I understand the fund is helpful in that area but I would encourage the Tánaiste to make even greater efforts in regard to it.</P>

      <P>The suggestion that copies of a New Framework for Agreement were not made available through libraries and post offices is incorrect.  The position is that 120,000 copies of the document were printed for distribution free to the public through public libraries, post offices, schools and citizen advice bureaus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of these, approximately 80,000 were distributed through post offices <Col N="555" /> throughout the State, while 11,000 copies were distributed through public libraries.  Copies were also distributed through schools and citizen advice bureaus.  In addition, copies were made available to the public from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Copies of the Irish language version of the document have also been distributed widely.  It is understood that 120,000 copies of the Framework Document have also been distributed in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>To make A New Framework for Agreement available to the largest possible audience the Department of Foreign Affairs, in co-operation with Dublin City University, also arranged to distribute the document via the World Wide Web.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 24, 32, 42, 52, 58, 72, 73 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>Before doing so, I wish to take this opportunity to convey my condolences to the family of Sergeant Paul Reid of the Garda Síochána who was tragically killed in Sarajevo on 18 May while working with the United Nations in the cause of peace.  I also wish Garda Philip Carr a speedy recovery from his injuries.</P>
      <P>The conflict in former Yugoslavia is now entering its fifth year since the outbreak of hostilities in Slovenia in the middle of 1991.  Since then, Ireland has been involved in the efforts of all the bodies which have been promoting negotiated settlements &mdash; the United Nations, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the European Union and the Western European Union.  Ireland is a member of the International Conference on Former Yugoslavia which, since August 1992, has provided a framework for the collective effort to establish a comprehensive settlement for the region.  The Contact Group &mdash; UK, France and Germany for the EU, Russia and the United States, works under the auspices of the International Conference.</P>
      <P>All these organisations are engaged in a major and substained political, diplomatic, peacekeeping operation which is pursued not only through contacts with the Governments of Bosnia, Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and those who have influence and control in the region, but also through dialogue with a wide range of peace groups and non-governmental organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, the Government is seriously concerned at the deteriorating situation in former Yugoslavia.  Following the expiry of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement in Bosnia there has been a dramatic increase in fighting in and around Sarajevo and some of the <Col N="558" /> other designated safe areas.  Zagreb's military actions in Western Slavonia have jeopardised the progress towards peace and reconciliation in Croatia.  The continuing widespread abuses of human rights of the ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province of Kosovo remains a cause for very serious concern.</P>
    <P>These developments underline the imperative need for political solutions, most immediately in Bosnia and Croatia, but also for a comprehensive settlement for the range of problems of former Yugoslavia based on two key objectives &mdash; the mutual recognition of the States in the region within their internationally recognised borders, and full protection of the rights of minorities.</P>
    <P>As to Bosnia the Government recognises and supports the commitment of the Bosnian government to pluralistic and democratic society.  We, with our European Union partners, wish to see an end to the policy of ethnic cleansing and agreement on a settlement under which all the displaced peoples of Bosnia will be able to return to their homes. These objectives constitute an essential element of the contact group's approach, which has been fully endorsed by the Bosnian government.</P>
    <P>The prospects for political solutions will not be advanced by further fighting, in which the civilian population of the region will continue to be the principal victim.  Further military activities run the risk of precipitating a withdrawal of UNPROFOR from Bosnia, with disastrous consequences for the civilian population as a whole and, in particular, for the beleaguered communities in the safe areas.  The attacks on UNPROFOR personnel, which are of the gravest concern to the troop contributing countries, must be brought to an end if the continuing presence of that peacekeeping force is to be assured.  Withdrawal of the UN peace-keeping presence would increase dramatically the possibility of a wider and more deadly war in the Balkan region.</P>
    <P>An intolerable situation exists for the inhabitants of the designated safe areas <Col N="559" /> in Bosnia and for the UN personnel stationed in these towns, because of Bosnian Serb shelling and sniping in reprisal for government military actions initiated from within the safe areas and government offensives elsewhere in Bosnia.  The Secretary General has prepared a detailed report which is to be considered shortly by the Security Council on the options for the UN peacekeeping presence in Bosnia.  While I understand the grave concerns of troop contributing countries because of the high level of casualties which they are sustaining, I earnestly hope that the Security Council's review will not lead to a UN withdrawal from the safe areas or, indeed, from Bosnia generally.</P>
    <P>It is vital, therefore, that we continue to make clear to the Bosnian government and the Bosnian Serbs that military operations should cease and that negotiations should begin on the basis of the contact group's plan.  The proposed territorial arrangements outlined in the plan have been accepted by the Bosnian government, by Bosnia's Croats and by Belgrade on behalf of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, but not by the Bosnian Serbs.  Pressure must be intensified on the Bosnian Serbs to accept the contact group's plan and the international community must continue the process of isolating the Bosnian Serbs politically, diplomatically and militarily until they do so.</P>
    <P>In the light of the reports that unauthorised and highly suspicious flights which may have carried arms have taken place from Serbia into Bosnian Serb-held territories, we with our EU partners are working to reinforce the Mission of the International Conference on Former Yugoslavia which is monitoring the closure of Belgrade's border with Bosnia.  Ireland is contributing four personnel to this mission.</P>
    <P>In Croatia, the authorities in Zagreb recently took military action in the Western Slavonia sector.  We deplore this.  They have compromised the efforts currently being made under the auspices <Col N="560" /> of the International Conference on Former Yugoslavia, which is co-chaired by the European Union and the United Nations, to promote a peaceful solution which would preserve Croatia's sovereignty within its internationally recognised borders, while taking account of the rights of its Serbian minorities.  We are urging the Croatian authorities and the Croatian Serbs to honour their responsibilities under the March 1994 Ceasefire Agreement, to resume work on implementing the December 1994 Economic Agreement on the restoration of Croatia's war damaged infrastructure, and to begin negotiations on a political solution on the basis of the plan put forward by the International Conference in January 1995.</P>
    <P>At the wider level, the European Union and the international community generally are working to advance the peace process, by promoting the mutual recognition of the former Yugoslav States.  If achieved, this would be a major contribution to peace as it would demonstrate to the Bosnian and Croatian Serbs that the objective of a &ldquo;greater Serbia&rdquo;, is not attainable.  Mutual recognition would also improve the prospects for political settlements in Bosnia and Croatia.  There have been encouraging indications that Belgrade, having declared an end to its support for the Bosnian Serbs in August 1994, is now prepared to recognise Bosnia.</P>
    <P>The restoration of genuine autonomy in Kosovo and an end to the flagrant violation of human rights there by the Serbian authorities is essential to a global solution in former Yugoslavia.  The European Union continues to urge the authorities in Belgrade to permit the redeployment of the OSCE's Long-Term Mission in Kosovo, which was expelled in July 1993.  This mission is an essential instrument for the restoration of respect for human rights and the prevention of the spill-over of conflict in the region.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, peace and full respect for the rights of minorities, including the fundamental rights of all refugees and displaced persons to return to their <Col N="561" /> homes in safety, can only be brought to the region when the parties themselves demonstrate clearly that this also is their objective.</P>

      <P>I join the Tánaiste in expressing my condolences to the relatives of the late Sergeant Reid who, unfortunately, died in the last few days in Sarajevo, one of the so-called safe areas referred to in Question No. 15 &mdash; this shows how unsafe it is.  Are recent reports, as of this morning, that either Sergeant Reid or his vehicle may have been struck by a sniper's bullet and that this contributed to the accident which caused his death correct and, if so, will the Minister and the Government make a strong protest to the representatives of those who are likely to have fired the bullet?  Does the Minister agree that Sarajevo and the other so-called safe areas are extremely vulnerable if they are only being defended by troops on the ground who, in the particular configuration of the land, cannot defend them effectively?  Would he recommend the use of air power to ensure that the hills around these safe areas are not used for the purpose of attacking civilians, UN troops and police within them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I only became aware this morning of the information the Deputy has given relating to the tragic circumstances surrounding the death of Sergeant Reid.  I have discussed the matter with the Minister for Justice who I am sure will present the Government with a full report as soon as all the information is available.  If, as the Deputy suggests, a sniper's bullet hit the wheel of the car the Government will take the appropriate action, in terms of the condemnation that is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The safe areas are in a tragic state at present.  I am sure that UNPROFOR and the United Nations, in the context of the report to be made by the Secretary General, will be assessing the matter to see what is necessary to protect citizens and UN personnel who have been under <Col N="562" /> continuous fire for many weeks within the safe areas.  When the Secretary General reports to the United Nations it may be necessary to review the methods and equipment used by military personnel in recent months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the Minister's response he made the point that it should be the aim of the United Nations and the European Union to return refugees and displaced persons to their own areas.  This is a direct contradiction of the policy of the Contact Group which, as the Minister correctly said, the Bosnian Government has accepted but under duress as it would result in the partitioning of the country. Many hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced persons will not be able to return to their own areas if the policy of the Contact Group is implemented.  Given our experience of partition as a long term solution to any problem the last thing we should do is lend our voice to the partitioning of the independent state of Bosnia-Hercegovina which is recognised by the United Nations and whose citizens have been subject to the activities of the war criminals on the Serbian side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Contact Group's proposals in relation to territorial delimitation involve the preservation of Bosnia as a single union within its internationally recognised borders.  As I am sure the Deputy is aware, it was agreed earlier that the territorial division would be 51 per cent for the Croat and Muslim communities and 49 per cent for the Bosnian Serbs.  Agreement was also reached on the continuation of Bosnia's international legal personality and the right of refugees and displaced persons to return freely to their homes of origin.  A meeting took place recently between the European Union and the Bosnian Government which underlined its view that the plan was not partitionist, that it addressed the internal arrangements within Bosnia's internationally recognised borders.  This plan has the full support of the UN Security <Col N="563" /> Council and has been accepted by three of the four key participants to the conflict &mdash; the Bosnian Government, the Bosnian Croats and the authorities in Belgrade who represent the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.  Unfortunately, it has not been accepted by the Serbs in Bosnia.  It is a key objective of the international effort to obtain their agreement.  It is important that the European Union supports the Contact Group's plans which have been accepted by the Bosnian Government which has to contend with the realities of the horrors of war in the region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It has accepted them reluctantly with its back to the wall.  The Serbs in Krajina, Bosnia and the rump state of Yugoslavia are attempting to put together a Greater Serbia.  Will the Minister reassure the House that the European Union will not allow the war criminals to succeed in their objectives? At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on Friday I raised the question of overflights.  In Srebenica, for example, 15 to 20 helicopters at a time, bringing armaments from Serbia to the Serb warlords in the Bosnian region, have been seen by the Dutch contingent. What action is the European Union taking in this regard?  Will the Minister assure the House that every step that can be taken will be taken to prevent the formation of a Greater Serbia? This also applies to Kosovo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the European Union and the wider international community work to promote and advance the peace process and mutual recognition of the former Yugoslav states.  This would be a major contribution to our efforts to convince the Serbs that the objective of a Greater Serbia is unattainable.  There also has to be a restoration of genuine autonomy in Kosovo to bring about an end to the violation of human rights by the Serbian authorities.  As the Deputy said, they are the short term goals that must be attained.  Overall, the parties to the conflict have to reach agreement.</P>

      <P>On Question No. 32, while the Minister is apparently aware that the border between Serbia and Bosnia is not closed and that regular supplies of weapons pass from Serbia to the Bosnian Serbs he does not appear to have indicated any determination to stop this.  Will he seek to ensure, through the European Union and the United Nations, that it is effectively stopped since it is a breach of the arrangements made and demonstrates how hypocritical Serbia is in agreeing to the plan put to them while apparently flagrantly breaching it almost daily and contributing to the continuation and intensification of the war in Bosnia?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is essential that the border monitoring mission should increase its capacity to monitor more effectively the closure of the air border.  Along with our European Union partners we are working to increase the size of that border mission to 400 personnel, more than double its current strength.  These concerns have been raised at the committee and other concerns in relation to the supplying of weapons from Serbia to Bosnia.  The overall assessment of the international border monitoring mission has led to the authorities in Belgrade effectively closing the border with Bosnia, but there are concerns which have been investigated on the tracking of air flight patterns between Belgrade and Bosnia.  If we can double the size of the international border monitoring mission it may go some way to addressing the problem to which Deputy O'Malley referred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the financing of operational expenditure for actions taken under the common foreign and security policy has been discussed at the General Affairs Council of the European Union on a number of occasions, most recently on 22 January last.  Under the Maastricht Treaty, such expenditure may be financed from the budget of the European Communities or in whole or in part by national countributions by member states.  Where the option of national contributions is used, the shares payable by each member state are normally calculated by reference to a key related to their respective gross national products.  On this basis, Ireland's share is currently 0.65 per cent of total expenditure financed by national contributions.</P>
      <P>Member states, including Ireland, have generally indicated their willingness to agree to Community financing for actions arising from the CFSP. However, this is on the understanding that the Council's responsibility for decision-making under CFSP, as provided for in the Maastricht Treaty, is respected and that the European Parliament's scrutiny role in the Community budget procedure is exercised in a manner consistent with the Council's prerogatives in relation to CFSP expenditure. Discussions are continuing with the Parliament with a view to reaching a general understanding in this regard. In the meantime, the Council is deciding on the source of financing of common foreign and security policy measures on a case-by-case basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending the conclusion of discussions with the Parliament and bearing in mind <Col N="566" /> that CFSP measures may need to be formulated in response to international situations and events not yet foreseen, it is not possible to predict accurately the cost of national contributions that Ireland may be required to pay.  Against this background, an allocation of £500,000 has been provided in Subhead A1 of the 1995 Vote for International Co-operation for expenditure which may arise out of our commitments under the common foreign and security policy.</P>
    <P>Ireland has contributed £19,300 and £200,000 to election monitoring in Russia and South Africa in 1993 and 1994 respectively.  We also contributed £118,345 to the cost of the European Union administration of Mostar.  Ireland is committed to a contribution of £34,809 to the restoration of the Sarajevo-Mostar-Ploce railway line as part of the Bosnia-Hercegovina joint action. It is also possible that some expenditure arising from the joint action in support of the Middle East peace process may be partially financed by contributions from member states.</P>

      <P>There is a serious problem in terms of our vulnerability to the illegal drugs trade.  The Government is examining possible initiatives to be taken in the course of our presidency of the European Union in 1996.  All Government Departments with an interest and involvement, ranging from Justice, Health, Education, and Foreign Affairs to the Taoiseach's Office, are examining what needs to be done by the interdepartmental committee to draw up proposals our Government can put to our European Union partners on the drugs issue.  The matter has been raised by the Taoiseach at international level and has been on the agenda of a number of European Union Council meetings in recent years.  It is a matter on which we would find a lot of common ground with our European partners because of the scourge of the drugs threat all over Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to announce for the information of the Dáil that the Commission constituted as provided in section 2 of Article 14 of the Constitution acting on my advice, have accepted the resignation of Deputy Hugh Coveney as a member of the Government.</P>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approve the nomination by the Taoiseach of Deputy Seán Barrett, Minister of State at the Department of the Taoisech and Minister of State at the Department of Defence, for appointment by the Commission constituted as provided in section 2 of Article 14 of the Constitution to be a member of the Government.</P>
      <P>Subject to the motion which I have put to the House being approved, Deputy Barrett will cease to be Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and Minister of State at the Department of Defence on his appointment as a member of the Government.  Accordingly, I intend to recommend to the Government that Deputy Jim Higgins be appointed as Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and Minister of State at the Department of Defence.  I also propose to recommend to the Govenment that Deputy Hugh Coveney be appointed as Minister of State at the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, the Government stated clearly that the relationship between Government and the people it serves had been damaged by a lack of openness.  We committed ourselves to renewing the relationship, so that the <Col N="700" /> people of Ireland would have total confidence in Government, and we pledged ourselves to the reform of our institutions at national and local level to provide service, accountability, transparency and freedom of information.</P>
    <P>Let me set out the background to this case.  On last Saturday morning Deputy Coveney phoned me from Cork to tell me of a report he believed might be published in the following day's <i>Sunday Business Post</i> concerning a conversation between the chairman of Bord Gáis Éireann, Michael Conlon, and himself. Deputy Coveney told me he had spoken to a journalist from that paper the previous day and had responded fully and openly to queries from the journalist about this.</P>
    <P>Before continuing, I want to refer here to very misleading statements in today's <i>Irish Independent.</i>  The columnist Sam Smyth claimed that I, like many in Cork, had known of Deputy Coveney's phone call to Mr. Conlon since last week.  Mr. Smyth did not bother to check the facts.  He did not contact me or the Government Press Secretary about this inaccurate assertion.  Another report in the paper says I was alerted about the matter late on Friday night.  The first time I became aware of Deputy Coveney's phone conversation with Michael Conlon was 10.00 a.m. on Saturday morning.  Deputy Coveney told me then that he had telephoned Michael Conlon about five or six weeks previously about an entirely unrelated matter and in the course of the conversation referred to the publicly announced proposal to relocate the headquarters of Bord Gáis Éireann from Little Island to Gasworks Road in the centre of Cork city.</P>
    <P>In the event of Bord Gáis Éireann deciding to invite a list of consultants to make proposals and bid for the reconstruction of these premises, Deputy Coveney told me that he had inquired if the quantity surveying firm of PF Coveney Partnership, of which he had previously been the managing partner, could be included on the list.  He told me that he emphatically did not ask for <Col N="701" /> the commission for PF Coveney.  His conversation related only to an opportunity being given to it to compete with others if a list was being compiled.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coveney told me that the chairman of BGE had readily acknowledged that he did not regard this inquiry as an attempt to influence him.  This has since been publicly confirmed by Mr. Conlon.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coveney's bona fides are underlined by the fact that, when approached by the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> journalist, he was fully satisfied to make a complete and immediate disclosure of what had transpired.  He did not attempt to postpone his answers or hide anything from the journalist.  I can confirm that he was similarly totally open with me when we discussed what had taken place.</P>
    <P>In the event BGE decided to appoint the same group of consultants which had been engaged on the earlier project at BGE's Little Island premises and the project did not go to tender.  As evidence of his contention that he saw this as &ldquo;a very innocuous inquiry&rdquo; the BGE Chairman, Michael Conlon, said he did not raise it at the board meeting of BGE and did not return to Deputy Coveney about the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coveney had resigned as managing partner of the firm PF Coveney on 31 December last, shortly after his appointment to the Government. He no longer has any day to day involvement in the running of the practice, although he retains a significant share in the ownership of the firm. There are no members of his family working in the firm.</P>
    <P>The firm of PF Coveney is one of the larger quantity surveying practices in the country and since its establishment in 1930 has undertaken commissions for many Government Departments and State agencies on a regular basis.  It has worked intermittently for BGE over the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>I told Deputy Coveney when he telephoned me on Saturday morning that I regarded his actions as serious and I invited him to come to see me at my <Col N="702" /> home the following day, Sunday.  Following discussions with him on Sunday, Deputy Coveney tendered his resignation as Minister for Defence and the Marine.  I accepted his resignation, but decided that I would appoint him to a lesser post as Minister of State at the Department of Finance.  This decision was announced on Sunday night.</P>
    <P>Some have argued that if Deputy Coveney merited demotion he also merited removal from all ministerial office. I do not accept that.  I believe Deputy Coveney will perform effectively and honourably as a Minister of State.  I am demoting him, not because I do not believe he is fit for office, but because he made a single mistake for which he must be held accountable in this way.  In doing this I am showing that I expect the highest standards both from Ministers and Ministers of State.  I am convinced that Deputy Coveney, especially in the light of this experience, will live up to these standards in his new role.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it was right, in any circumstances, for Deputy Coveney to have approached the chairman of a State board about a matter that could potentially have benefited the firm in which he had an interest.  I fully accept that the approach involved no pressure, but it should not have been made.</P>
    <P>This Government, and I as Taoiseach, have made clear our commitment to high standards in political life and accountability in the application of those standards.  Standards and accountability operate together in practice, especially since standards without accountability are meaningless.</P>
    <P>People may argue that in the case of Deputy Coveney's resignation the penalty was not sufficiently severe.  Others could argue the converse.  Whatever view is taken, it is abundantly clear that this Government has a practical commitment to high standards and consequent accountability and acted on that commitment in this case.  Furthermore, it acted promptly.</P>
    <P>The Opposition has a job to do.  It always has a right and an obligation to criticise Government decisions and to <Col N="703" /> demand high standards.  However, as far as the Government is concerned, it is the Taoiseach's job to make the careful judgment as to exactly how accountability should apply in each case.</P>
    <P>This Government, and its Ministers, will make mistakes from time to time. We will not seek to cover those mistakes. We will exercise accountability for those mistakes in an open way, and we are doing that on this occasion.  We will also deal with such matters promptly.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the judgment made in Deputy Coveney's case on Sunday is correct.  It would have been too harsh, on balance, to bring to a complete end a ministerial career, that had only just commenced, for this error of judgment. As the option of demotion was available, it was the appropriate way to exercise accountability in this case.</P>
    <P>There is no book of mandatory penalties in the matter of ministerial accountability. The Taoiseach of the day must, in the public interest, balance the need for accountability with the need for fair and proportionate treatment of individuals who have made mistakes.  I have made the right judgment in this case.</P>
    <P>It may be claimed in this debate that Deputy Coveney will have difficulties in dealing with the Office of Public Works given that that office deals with a substantial number of construction contracts.</P>
    <P>In making a declaration of interests to me after his appointment as Minister for Defence and the Marine, Deputy Coveney was completely open in saying that the firm of PF Coveney did not hold any commission from the Department of the Marine, but that it did have one commission from the Department of Defence, which it had received several years ago, for the transport facility in Collins Barracks, Cork, and that that project was at an advanced stage of design and planning.  He stated in his declaration that &ldquo;the practice will receive no new commissions from the Department of the Marine or Department of Defence during my tenure as <Col N="704" /> Minister.&rdquo;  He has now made a similar declaration that PF Coveney will receive no new commission from the Office of Public Works during his tenure as Minister at that office.</P>
    <P>His practice has worked on numerous state projects over many years and this may be expected to continue, with the exception of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>I am convinced this Government has faced up to what happened in this case, that Deputy Coveney has acted openly and honourably in dealing with an error of judgment, that the principle of the sanction fitting the transgression was correctly followed here, and that Deputy Coveney will do a good job as Minister of State at the Department of Finance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make it clear that I have no objection, indeed I congratulate Deputy Sean Barrett on his appointment to the Cabinet as Minister for Defence and the Marine.  He has long and relevant experience at the Government table as Minister of State and Government Chief Whip.  He is a respected Member of this House and I wish him well.  What we require to discuss today are the circumstances, which led to his appointment and the resignation of his predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like most if not all Members of this House, I have a high personal regard for the former Minister for Defence and the Marine, Deputy Coveney.  As a leading businessman and politician, he has contributed much over the years to his native Cork.  In the few months he has been a Minister he has shown signs of considerable capability and I understand the <Col N="705" /> regrets expressed over his resignation and sympathise with him, his family and friends.  His resignation as a Cabinet Minister, after only a few months in office, will be a major loss to Cork, where he was regarded unofficially as the Minister for Cork &mdash; Cork always takes special pride in the success of its sons and daughters.  As a result, Cork city and county is left once more without a Cabinet Minister, something it has had since the appointment of Deputy Joe Walsh as Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in February 1992.</P>
    <P>It would be difficult to defend the actions revealed by the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> and subsequently confirmed by Deputy Coveney.  While he may have resigned his directorship, he still retains a financial stake in his firm of quantity surveyors.  He, therefore, stood &mdash; and stands &mdash; to benefit from any contracts awarded.  While it is true that Bord Gáis Éireann was not within the former Minister's direct remit, it is a State company based in Cork, and Cork was the core of his sphere of influence.  The fact that the conversation was revealed by the chairman to the chief executive and another director of the company means that it was regarded as important.  It was originally planned to build the new headquarters for Bord Gáis at Inisheera in Little Island.  I understand a firm of design consultants and quantity surveyors had already been appointed to do the work, but plans for this site fell through.</P>
    <P>When Bord Gáis selected the new location for its headquarters, it was not a matter of the company starting from scratch with selecting firms or requesting tenders.  I understand the Executive intended recommending a second ratification of that same company to the board for a new site.  It appears, therefore, that there was no new tendering process, no new short list. This was some time ago, and it was well known in Cork that design consultants and quantity surveyors had been <Col N="706" /> appointed for the Bord Gáis headquarters project.  This, I understand, was well known in Cork professional circles. Deputy Coveney's phone call was an attempt to influence the process.  Unfortunately, the conclusion could be drawn that he wanted the firm of surveyors originally selected to be dropped and replaced by his firm.  It does not really matter why Deputy Coveney rang the chairman of Bord Gáis.  What matters is what he asked him to do in the course of the conversation.  Clearly the Taoiseach does not consider this a trivial and inconsequential matter.</P>
    <P>It is my understanding that at a subsequent board meeting the directors of Bord Gáis had to vote to stay with the quantity surveyors appointed originally to do the headquarters' work.  I am sure the Taoiseach or the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications can confirm that the board voted by seven to zero to do this and that the chairman abstained.  On the face of it there is a clear conflict of interest in a Minister with influence in Government regarding Cork matters, suggesting to the head of a State body based in the Cork area that he should consider his firm when awarding contracts relating to the gas company's new Cork headquarters.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach assured this House on 25 January 1995 that all members of the Government, where applicable, &ldquo;have resigned their company directorships and withdrawn from other business interests&rdquo;.  The behaviour of Deputy Coveney in seeking to have a rival firm set aside in favour of his is hardly a withdrawal.  The withdrawal was clearly not complete on Deputy Coveney's part, because he was acting on behalf of other directors of his company, who did not personally know Mr. Conlon.  Was his action not a breach of undertakings sought and given on foot of Government procedures?  Is this the real reason for his resignation?  The House should be aware incidentally that Government procedure instructions apply equally to Ministers and Ministers of State without <Col N="707" /> qualification.  Does the Taoiseach consider that a Minister seeking to influence a State company to award his private firm a public contract, from which he will derive a financial gain, is engaged in a form of acceptable behaviour? If we are engaged in the business of ensuring high standards in public life we have to be prepared to answer difficult questions.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a few comments on the punishment fitting the crime.  There is much confusion in people's minds, compounded by the decision to demote the Minister, as to whether we are dealing with a serious breach of Government ethics or a minor misdemeanour. Is the Government clear in its own mind?  The removal from Cabinet suggests it was a serious matter, but the reappointment to a junior post suggests it was just a little error.  The argument of some Ministers is that it would take a major breach of ethics to remove Deputy Coveney from office.  I do not really understand this halfway house approach; the Taoiseach will have an opportunity later to explain this.  A new phrase, &ldquo;serious demotion&rdquo;, has been coined by the Minister for Health.  How serious can one regard a demotion, which puts Deputy Coveney in charge of Government construction worth more than £200 million in 1995, in place of the combined capital budgets for the Departments of Defence and the Marine of some £57 million?  The public will surely wonder at a Deputy being punished for seeking one tender by being put in charge of total Government contracts. This leads to the question as to whether the Taoiseach has sincere regard for high public standards or whether he is merely posturing for the sake of appearances and political correctness.</P>
    <P>I would be more inclined to accept the Taoiseach's humane approach if I felt that was the standard applied by some of the former Opposition parties last autumn.  Everybody accepted that Deputy Cowen did not stand to gain in <Col N="708" /> any significant way from decisions relating to a mining company, in which he had only a token holding, and that his actions were not motivated by prospects of financial gain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not recall suggestions from the then Opposition that he ought to be subjected to &ldquo;serious demotion&rdquo; to Minister of State.  The significant difference between this and other controversies last year was that Deputy Coveney made a personal intervention on behalf of his company, potentially involving large sums of money, whereas the former Minister, Deputy Cowen, did not take any action for his benefit or that of his associates. There was no attempted interference in the management of the project.</P>
      <P>Essentially, so far two Fine Gael Ministers in this Government have been caught out by a vigilant press.  I note that decisions were not taken until the Taoiseach and the Minister saw what was published in the paper, even though the Taoiseach knew of the matter earlier. Why did he not act on Saturday morning when he said he knew about it? In other words, the determining consideration was not what had been done, but what might have been seen to be done.  This is hardly a principled stand. I am sure nobody would argue that the press is less vigilant in regard to Fianna Fáil.  The last Government fell because the former Attorney General was deemed to have been insufficiently careful in ensuring that the extradition warrant for Fr. Smyth was dealt with quickly, even though there still appears to be continuing problems regarding the matter in the Attorney General's office. On that basis a Government fell and three weeks later a new one was aborted at the last minute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has been hoist with its own petard.  I will not be surprised if, in the course of the present Administration, further episodes of this type occur, with similar embarrassing results. People will realise that taking up high <Col N="709" /> moral positions involves a price and that, as the two resignations have shown, the claims of some parties to moral superiority, on which the Government is essentially founded, in reality have no basis.  It is not a question of how these matters are handled, the real cause for public concern is that they should have happened in the first place. Two Fine Gael Ministers, by their admission, have failed to live up to high standards of conduct in public life.  Once again we are holding a debate relating to a Minister's behaviour in a highly charged atmosphere created for many years past by those now on the Government benches.  There is a real danger that in this atmosphere there might be a witch-hunt which could result in the downfall of a Minister over quite trivial matters.  Perhaps we are seeing that today.  My view, at the time of Deputy Hogan's resignation, was that there was no need for his resignation, and I said so in this House.  This case is different because of what I have outlined.</P>
    <P>The Minister's firm, we have been told, will not be seeking, any Government contracts for the duration.  I would like confirmation of that from the Taoiseach. Is this not unfair to a commercial firm in which the Minister or his family are not involved?  In normal circumstances, should Deputy Coveney's firm be debarred from applying for contracts using normal procedures?  Is it the case that his firm is being ruled out because of Deputy Coveney's conduct and is that what the Taoiseach is really getting at?</P>
    <P>There is also the consideration that Deputy Coveney will have been the third Minister of State in this office since last December.  I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that is totally unsatisfactory, particularly as he will be responsible in the first instance for the control of public expenditure, the level of which has risen out of all proportion in recent months, by an underlying 11 per cent since the Book of Estimates was published last week.</P>
    <P>This sums up what is principally wrong with this Government.  It has <Col N="710" /> taken its eye off the ball regarding expenditure and many other issues for which we will all pay later.  The Government has no clear grasp of the difference between serious and trivial matters. Unfortunately, the Taoiseach has not yet addressed any of the issues today but I acknowledge that we have an opportunity to do that now, having fought for it through our Whips.  In this regard I thank Deputy Barrett for his assistance in getting time, in his final act as Chief Whip.  We had been refused this for 24 hours.</P>
    <P>This whole affair has created much confusion.  The ethics and standards which the Taoiseach is trying to set are confused in people's minds.  The rules by which his own Ministers must stand are not clear and the rules they have breached are also unclear.  It is not clear what the Taoiseach expects of them.  It is not clear whether he made sure that they had dissociated themselves from their businesses when he appointed them or that they had subsequently done so.  This affair has been handled badly by the Taoiseach and the matter, as he knows, is not over yet.</P>

Déanaim comhbhrón leis agus lena chlann agus a chairde mar gheall ar an méid atá tar éis titim amach.</P>
      <P>The circumstances which led to the tendering by Deputy Hugh Coveney of his resignation as Minister for Defence and the Marine give no joy or reason for satisfaction to any Member of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="711" /> I want to emphasise the high esteem in which Deputy Coveney is held by myself, by my party and by nearly everyone in this House.  No one in my party makes the argument that Deputy Coveney is other than an honourable and trustworthy man, the kind of man that most parties in this House would seek to attract into politics and have within their ranks.</P>
    <P>Nobody knows precisely how the content of a telephone conversation between him and the chief executive of Bord Gáis entered the public domain.  It seems that only a small handful of people were privy to its contents, and that one of them may have divulged the information to those who made it public. Nor are we clear as to what motivated the revelation of the conversation. It may have been politically motivated, and this should be vigorously investigated and exposed, if true.</P>
    <P>Members of the Government and Ministers of State are all bound by certain rules, one of which is that a Minister or Minister of State, on appointment to office, must divest himself or herself of any involvement in any private business, and must not use his or her office or position in a way that may be perceived as beneficial to themselves, their families or associates.</P>
    <P>Each Minister, on appointment to office, is acquainted with the contents of a green booklet which sets out the correct procedures with which office holders must comply.  There is also a written communication sent by the Taoiseach to each of the newly appointed Cabinet members and Ministers of State.  It is the Taoiseach's duty to ensure that appropriate action is taken if these procedures are transgressed.  These procedures are clear and are along the following lines: &ldquo;In so far as business interests or membership of other organisations are concerned, the underlying principle is that no Minister or Minister of State should engage in any activities that could reasonably be regarded as interfering, or being incompatible, with the full and <Col N="712" /> proper discharge by him of the duties of his office&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that Deputy Coveney breached these rules in the telephone conversation with the chief executive of Bord Gáis.  Nobody has suggested that it was proper for him to act as he did, not even himself.  I suggest, however, that the impropriety with which we are dealing now &mdash; for that is what it was &mdash; while serious, was of far less gravity than other matters which have been revealed in this House in recent years and which led neither to resignation, admission, censure nor apology.  The House will know what I am talking about; the record is there to be read.  The honourable course was not taken by any of the people concerned.</P>
    <P>Once it was admitted by Deputy Coveney that a serious breach of the rule had occurred, the Taoiseach had a clear duty to decide what action he should appropriately take.  The Progressive Democrats believe that the matter must be judged as falling into one of two categories: first, as serious but as capable of being dealt with by a reprimand or censure or, second, as so serious as to require the removal from office of the offender.</P>
    <P>Without knowing all the facts and circumstances, it is impossible to come to a conclusion as to whether the first option was reasonably open to the Taoiseach. Perhaps in the course of this debate it will emerge that the Taoiseach had no option but to remove Deputy Coveney from his office as a Cabinet member. On the other hand, perhaps it will appear that it should have been dealt with more leniently.  However, it is clear that the rule infringed by Deputy Coveney applied equally to Ministers and Ministers of State, and no legitimate distinction can be drawn in this context between the standards required of either category of office holder.</P>
    <P>Members of the Government have repeatedly used the phrase &ldquo;the punishment must fit the crime&rdquo; in public to justify the demotion of Deputy Coveney from full Cabinet member to Minister <Col N="713" /> of State.  We find the words &ldquo;punishment&rdquo; and &ldquo;crime&rdquo; objectionable when used to justify an appointment to ministerial office.  There are two reasons it should never have been used.  First, to say of an office that it is held as a punishment is to demean it in the public eye.  Second, to be perceived or said to hold office as a punishment robs any office holder of dignity and moral authority.</P>
    <P>People are entitled to expect that every ministerial office holder, senior or junior, holds office wholeheartedly and without any cloud or qualification on their appointment.  It has also been suggested that, in some sense, responsibility for the Office of Public Works would not entail involvement in the tendering process for the award of contracts.  That proposition is clearly wrong.</P>
    <P>We are driven to the conclusion that the Taoiseach's judgment in seeking to temper justice with mercy was well intentioned, but politically flawed.  The Taoiseach concluded that Deputy Coveney was either guilty of a serious transgression of Cabinet procedures or he was not.  If he was, then his appointment as a Minister of State makes no sense.  If not, justice could have been met by a reprimand or censure.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason that our immediate reaction to Deputy Coveney's resignation and demotion remains unaffected by subsequent events.  The real explanation that this House requires is a justification by the Taoiseach of what appears, on the face of it, to be neither logical nor wise.  The route chosen of the halfway house, or the ministerial sin bin, is neither defensible in principle nor in practice and, in the last analysis, may prove less just to Deputy Coveney than a reprimand or simple dismissal.  It bears all the hallmarks of a rushed decision, made as a panic reaction to the publication last Sunday of the details of the telephone conversation.</P>
    <P>It transpires, having listened to the Taoiseach's earlier remarks, that he had more advance notice of Deputy Coveney's embarrassment than a matter <Col N="714" /> of hours on Sunday last, but it would appear that the matter was only dealt with as a matter of urgency once it became public in the <i>Sunday Business Post.</i>  It would be a different matter if it transpired that the Taoiseach had concluded that the matter only needed to be dealt with if and when it became public.</P>

      <P>It may indeed transpire in the next few weeks and months that the motivation to disclose Deputy Coveney's conversation to a newspaper was such as to suggest that he was being targeted as part of a wide agenda.</P>
      <P>Turning to the motion before us to nominate Deputy Barrett as a member of the Government, let me state on behalf of my party that if a vacancy requires to be filled there are few as well qualified in the Government ranks to fill it as Deputy Barrett.  If he is nominated to succeed Deputy Coveney this evening, we wish him the best in his new office and congratulate him on a well merited appointment.  However, the Progressive Democrats Party intends to vote against his nomination as a Minister in order to register its unhappiness with the political judgment of the Taoiseach in his handling of this affair.</P>

      <P>I have known Deputy Barrett for many years and regard it as my good fortune that I have been able to work with him in two Governments.  He is a problem solver and a most accessible politician.  I have no hesitation whatever in commending him to this House for appointment as a member of the Government, and I have every confidence that he will fill the difficult role he is undertaking with considerable distinction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have known Deputy Coveney for most, if not all, the years he has been in public life.  I regard him as a friend, and I very much hope that he can see me in the same light.  More than that, he is an honourable and decent man, who in the short time I have worked with him in <Col N="715" /> Government has shown himself to have outstanding qualities.</P>
    <P>There have been many debates of this kind in this House in recent years &mdash; far too many, some would say.  I believe I have participated, in one way or another, in all of them.  In some ways, I find this the saddest, an honourable and decent politician has fallen, punished as he has to be for a breach of the rules that are clear to, and willingly accepted by, every member of the Government.</P>
    <P>There are points that need to be made about the circumstances in which this debate has occurred.  They are important because they ought to transform the nature of this debate from some of the more distasteful confrontations we have had to face in the past. They are factors that deserve not to be overlooked.</P>
    <P>The first is the honesty of Deputy Coveney himself, when confronted with his transgression.  There was no attempt by him to deny, fudge or cover-up, no need for investigation or pressure. Unlike some recent incidents, both here and elsewhere, Deputy Coveney reacted with immediate and total frankness.  He hid behind nobody and enabled his mistake to be brought into the open.</P>
    <P>The second factor was the reaction of the Taoiseach.  Deputy Bruton informed me about the affair as soon as he found out himself.  There was no need whatever, as I knew there would be no need, for me to prompt or encourage him to regard the issue with appropriate seriousness.  Without any intervention from anyone else, the Taoiseach knew that a serious response would be necessary, and he initiated that response immediately.  Again, that response was in marked contrast to some of the ways in which issues of this kind have been approached in the past.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation whatever in saying that I support unequivocally the way in which the Taoiseach approached this issue and the decisions he took.  I know too that it was a painful and difficult course for him, as of course it was for Deputy Coveney and his family.  I <Col N="716" /> believe that they both deserve the support of this House for the speed with which action was taken, and for the fact that it was taken without any pressure from any third party.</P>
    <P>Questions have been raised about whether demotion, as opposed to dismissal, was the appropriate course of action.  Let me say where I stand on this issue.  Deputy Coveney has been dealt with fairly by the Taoiseach, and a strong message has been sent about standards in public life.  The telephone conversation should not have taken place &mdash; it was a clear breach of standards and procedures &mdash; and Deputy Coveney has paid a heavy price for it. Deputy Coveney has much to contribute, and that one mistake should not be allowed to wipe out the past contribution and the potential that lies ahead. Of course, had there been material profit from the incident, or had there been the remotest evidence that any untoward pressure had been exerted on behalf of his former business, the Taoiseach would undoubtedly have had to take a different view.  I believe he would have taken that view without pressure from anybody.</P>
    <P>There are, I believe, lessons to be learned from this incident.  In the first place, there is a lesson for all of us in this House in the dignified way in which Deputy Coveney has responded to this situation.  There is a lesson in the blend of firmness and fairness that the Taoiseach's response has demonstrated, but there are wider lessons too.</P>
    <P>The most crucial lesson is that the rules set for us &mdash; rules which, I repeat, are willingly accepted by every Member of this House who aspires to serve in Government &mdash; have to be obeyed.  The public we serve expect that from us, and they are entitled to nothing less.  Public office in this country is not without its challenges and stresses, but neither is it without its rewards and status.  No one who willingly embarks on a career in public office can expect to be fully understood if he or she is perceived to use that career, however inadvertently, <Col N="717" /> to further any private material interest of his or her own.</P>
    <P>All I will say is that there are basic rules and standards which must be observed, and when they are not, action must be commensurate with the transgression. In this case, I believe justice has been done, and been seen to be done.  The public interest has been served and has been seen to be served.</P>
    <P>May I conclude, therefore, by commending Deputy Barrett wholeheartedly to this House, and wishing him the best of luck in a difficult and challenging position.  I know he would wish that this appointment had not come to him in this way, but I know too that he will rise to the occasion.  I look forward to working with Deputy Coveney in his new and equally challenging position.  He will, I know, put this incident behind him, and carry on with the grace and style with which we are all familiar.</P>

I join other speakers in wishing Deputy Barrett well should his new appointment be ratified this evening.  It is well merited and I congratulate him on it.</P>
      <P>Today's debate is not a witch hunt and should not become a witch hunt.  It is about getting straight answers to straight questions.  It is not about whether there was a breach of ministerial rules, for that has been clearly admitted by the person involved. Rather it is about judgment, in particular the Taoiseach's judgment.  The key question in this debate is whether the Taoiseach acted properly as befits the head of Government.  This House is entitled to hear plainly and unambiguously from the Taoiseach answers to some questions, one or two of which he has answered already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When precisely did the Taoiseach know about the telephone call?  Was it <Col N="718" /> on Saturday when Deputy Coveney told him?  Obviously we take the Taoiseach at his word in what he says today.  He has denied he knew last week, as suggested by some newspapers and, if the Taoiseach says that, of course, I accept it.  What was discussed during the three hours last Sunday in what the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, described as a long and amicable conversation?  Did he say anything other than what is on the record already?  Did he mention the number of board members who knew about the incident?  What precisely was the Taoiseach told?  Was he told the call was about getting on a tender list or that there was no tendering procedure and it was about setting aside the existing firm and having another firm appointed?</P>
    <P>This House is entitled to know whether the Taoiseach had that information on Sunday from the then Minister Deputy Coveney.  Why did the Taoiseach decide to take no action when he was informed about the story? Would he not have taken action if the article did not appear in a newspaper and would he have concealed the matter? We can only speculate.  Why did he wait for some time?  Would he have taken action if the article had not been published?  Would he have concealed the matter?  We can only speculate on that.  Does the Taoiseach think that, being the jury in this case, he should have either brought in a guilty or a not guilty verdict?  If found guilty of breaching Government procedures which apply to Ministers and Ministers of State then the Minister should leave office.  If he is not guilty, the Taoiseach should have stood four square behind his Minister.  Was it not a clear decision for the head of the Government, if he was convinced that the rules were breached, to act and have the office vacated?  If the rules were not breached he should stand courageously behind his Minister.</P>
    <P>Why introduce the Bruton scale of political offences for which the punishment is to become a Minister of State? I add to the warning given by my party leader that the Richter scale introduced <Col N="719" /> by the Taoiseach into Irish politics will haunt the Government before it finally leaves office.  Is it not double thinking, bungling fudge of which Machiavelli would have been proud?  Does the Taoiseach consider that one admitted error of judgment should not be followed by another error of judgment in proposing the junior ministerial Irish solution? The author, Arthur Clarke, wrote that for every problem there is a solution which is simple, attractive and wrong.  In this case it is the wrong solution.</P>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach tell the House what transpired in the frantic telephone conversations on Saturday between him, the leader of the Labour Party and the leader of Democratic Left.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are legitimate questions.  Was the Taoiseach aware that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, would give the very strange and ominous commitment yesterday, which was mentioned by the leader of Fianna Fáil, that the firm in question would neither seek nor accept Office of Public Works' contracts? Why was this silly, insulting and transparently childish promise given in this way?  Why is there need for such a statement from a Cabinet member? Does the Taoiseach consider it fair to those who work in this very good firm to suggest that the firm will not be able to seek work in the ordinary way on the open market with the Office of Public Works?  Does he consider that the Minister, Deputy Yates, should withdraw this statement publicly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does the Taoiseach say to the leader of Democratic Left who stated &mdash; I trust I quote correctly from this morning's newspaper &mdash;&ldquo;it is unheard of that a Minister should resign over a phone call&rdquo;.  Does the Taoiseach think being a Minister of State is a punishment?  Does he not realise that the job has changed over the years from that of being an assistant to a Cabinet Minister to one with full legal delegated powers, with <Col N="720" /> direct control over major policy and budgetary matters in designated areas of Government?</P>
    <P>What does the Taoiseach know of the lunch-time panic announcement today by the Government hit man, the Minister Deputy Lowry, that he will issue a statement on Bord Gáis in a few days? Why will he not issue that statement today?  Why is he threatening to issue a statement in a few days when he hears what the House has to say?  Coming hot on the heels of the statement made by Deputy Yates yesterday, surely we are witnessing a concerted Cabinet salvage exercise.</P>

The issue is not about Deputy Coveney's integrity or honour which I do not question.  He is one of the most admired and respected Members.  This debate is about the Taoiseach's judgment in dealing with an admitted breach of Government rules which apply to Ministers and Ministers of State alike.  If the Taoiseach wants to make the punishment fit the crime perhaps he should step down one rung and be a Minister instead of Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>The resignation of Deputy Hugh Coveney from the office of Minister for Defence and the Marine is both a tragedy and a watershed in Irish politics. It is a personal tragedy for Deputy Hugh Coveney, a man whose inherent honesty and decency has not been questioned by anyone in any party and whose political career has now received a major setback for what was a serious error of political judgment on his part.  It represents a watershed in Irish politics because it demonstrates that we now have &mdash; possibly for the first time in our political history &mdash; an Administration <Col N="721" /> that demands the highest possible standards of public accountability from office holders right up to the highest level and will impose the appropriate sanction whenever anyone breaches them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hugh Coveney comes from a different background from me and holds views on many political and social issues which would be at odds with mine.  Since the new Government was formed he has won my respect and admiration not just for the way in which he carried out his duties as Minister for Defence and the Marine but also for the valuable contribution he has made to the collective work of the Government. Nobody can disguise the fact that the events of the weekend represent an embarrassment for the Government, but whatever short term difficulties we may face are a small price to pay for the strengthening of the principles of democratic accountability which will flow from the Government's handling of this affair and which will be to the long term advantage of political life in this country.</P>
      <P>In my years in the Dáil I have stressed that the public interest requires that office holders should place an impenetrable cordon between their political positions and their commercial interests. The public perception of the existence of a small golden circle of political and prominent business people, working hand in glove, which was reinforced by a series of still largely unexplained political and business scandals during the course of various recent Administrations in which Fianna Fáil was the senior partner, did untold damage to the political process.  One of the reasons my party agreed to enter into coalition with Fine Gael and the Labour Party was because we believed that such an Administration would set standards of compliance and public accountability and set about restoring the integrity of the political system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the members of the Cabinet were appointed all Ministers were required to make a declaration of their commercial interests to the Taoiseach <Col N="722" /> and were issued with guidelines regarding commercial activities.  The action of Deputy Coveney in raising with the chairman of Bord Gáis the question of whether his company would be invited to tender for pending business was a clear breach of these principles and ministerial guidelines.</P>
    <P>Regardless of whether it was simply a temporary lapse of judgment on the part of Deputy Coveney or an inability to depart from the commercial habits of a lifetime, it represented an error which left the Taoiseach with no alternative but to take action quickly.  The question then facing the Taoiseach was: what was the appropriate level of sanction to impose?</P>
    <P>In virtually all walks of life there are different degrees of penalty for different levels of offence.  The legal system recognises a difference between a misdemeanour and a felony.  Careless driving has a lesser penalty than dangerous driving.  In sport, offenders can be cautioned or sent off.  In the public service, for instance, employees can be dismissed for exceptionally serious offences, but they can also be suspended, transferred to another position or denied a salary increment.  The demotion or transfer is the punishment and no-one would suggest it was the position to which the person was transferred.</P>
    <P>I do not see any reason this principle should not apply also to the political system. If, as Fianna Fáil and particularly the Progressive Democrats are now saying, banishment from public office is to be the appropriate penalty for an error of judgment from which no financial, commercial or political advantage flowed, what sanction should be imposed where a Minister is found to be manifestly dishonest or corrupt?  If Fianna Fáil believes that Deputy Coveney should not now hold any public office, what punishment does it believe should be imposed if a Minister were, for instance, found to be selling passports in return for investment in a family firm?</P>
    <P>The sanction imposed on Deputy Coveney struck the right balance <Col N="723" /> between the need to ensure the highest possible standards among office holders and the requirement that offences should be dealt with in a just and humane way.  Deputy Coveney has suffered heavily for his transgression.  He has lost his place at the Cabinet table and forfeited the prestige which goes with that.  He has lost out financially and suffered considerable public embarrassment. He has paid a sufficiently high price and should not be denied the opportunity to make a further contribution to public life through the new position of Minister of State to which he will be appointed.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach discussed the matter with me on a number of occasions during the weekend and I fully endorse the decisions taken with regard to the resignation of Deputy Coveney as Minister for Defence and the Marine and his appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Finance.  It is to the Taoiseach's credit that he did not wait to test the political waters or to see if there would be a hue and cry about the story before taking action.  As soon as his attention was drawn to the matter by Deputy Coveney on Saturday morning he set about dealing with it and set in train the process which led to the Minister's resignation on Sunday evening.</P>
    <P>Although a procession of media commentators and Opposition politicians is queuing up to denounce the Government for what it claims is the soft treatment of Deputy Coveney, this is in stark contrast to the initial media and political reaction to the story.  The story regarding Deputy Coveney was in the public domain from early on Saturday evening when <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> became available.  Yet none of the other Sunday newspapers regarded it as of sufficient importance to follow it up in their later editions, although this is a fairly normal procedure.  RTE did not carry the story on any of its bulletins throughout the day on Sunday.  It was not an issue at the Progressive Democrat conference in Galway and Deputy Mary Harney did not even mention it during her lengthy <Col N="724" /> interview on the &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; programme on Sunday.</P>

I congratulate Deputy Coveney on his work in his Defence portfolio.  On all occasions I found him practical and sensible, attributes not often found among senior political figures.  He brought his wider business experience to bear on his ministerial responsibilities.  I genuinely regret that his career at top ministerial level has been brought to a halt in this way.  Like all politicians, I have lived through difficult political times.  All of us who have fallen in one way or another have learned to live with it, cope with it and come out better at the other end, and I am sure Deputy Coveney will do the same.  He has the strength of character and purpose to do this.</P>

When I became a Minister of State I received from the then Taoiseach the customary letter and famous green book which clearly stated that Ministers and Ministers of State have the same obligations in terms of probity and accountability.  There is no differentiation in the rules laid down as to how business is done at whatever level one is appointed.  The conclusion arrived at by the Taoiseach &mdash;&ldquo;demotion&rdquo; of Deputy Coveney from a senior to a junior position &mdash; is odd in the extreme bearing in mind his Mary Whitehouse approach to politics that he is to be the rock of probity to which we must all cling and under which we must all take shelter.  He is to epitomise all that is right and proper.  As you live by the sword so too you die by the sword.  It is very difficult, for anyone in this House &mdash; or in any area of life &mdash; to say with hand on heart and forever and a day that we will be good and proper and always right.  Neither is it possible for any one political party to put hand on heart and say it will always be good, better, proper and more accountable than any other party.  That is the road the Taoiseach took&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We gave him a full hearing when he spoke today.  I would thank him if he did not give his silly laugh when people on this side of the House are trying to put forward a case.  I am entitled to be heard.  The Taoiseach spoke and he was heard.</P>
      <P>Earlier today Deputy O'Donnell asked a very serious question about the Office of the Attorney General.  In reply the Taoiseach ducked and weaved but did not answer.  In regard to that issue I checked the Official Report of 15 November 1994 in which the former Taoiseach Deputy Reynolds, said: &ldquo;Give us an adjournment for one hour and in that hour we will come back with some information which will be relevant to the case in hand&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach, acting on behalf of his party in Opposition, as he saw fit, said he would not give one hour but would call a vote.</P>
      <P>How quickly he changed his mind, how quickly he altered his persona, how quickly he denies us legitimate answers to legitimate questions which the Opposition has a right to put forward?  The Taoiseach does not answer questions: they are transferred to alternative Ministers, he gives brusque one liners or convoluted 40 liners in which there is neither rhyme nor reason.  Today was a proven case in the way in which he did not answer any question relating to the Attorney General's Office but sought&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="730" /> Perhaps in the questions and answer session we will elucidate more information from the Taoiseach which we have been unable to obtain in this debate.  I have found the Taoiseach's handling of this debate inept, hamfisted and entirely inappropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for its kind remarks which I very much appreciate.  I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this matter and to attempt to set the record straight.</P>
      <P>I propose in the course of my statement to outline my relationship with the professional practice which I formerly managed in the context of the relevant Government guidelines.  I will deal comprehensively with the telephone conversation which I had with Mr. Michael Conlon, the Chairperson of Bord Gáis Éireann.  I will then deal with the events leading to my resignation.  I will also make it clear that I intend to continue to serve in public office as long as the Taoiseach, whose judgment in this affair I fully support and endorse, wishes me to do so.</P>
      <P>Shortly after taking up office last December I submitted a comprehensive written statement of all my business interests and family assets to the Taoiseach, at his request, just as every other Minister had done.  In relation to the quantity surveying firm which I had previously managed I submitted the following statement:</P>
      <P>Patrick F. Coveney Partnership, Chartered Quantity Surveyors.  Hugh Coveney has been the majority partner and managing partner for many years.  He retired as managing partner on the 31st of December, 1994 and will have no day to day involvement in the practice while remaining a member of the Government.  He retains his stake in the partnership but receives no salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practice does not hold any commissions from the Department of the Marine.  It has one commission from the Department of Defence which it received several years ago <Col N="731" /> (Transport facility, Collins Barracks, Cork).  The project is at an advanced stage of design and planning and construction may commence in 1995.  The practice will receive no new commissions from the Department of the Marine or Department of Defence during my tenure as Minister.</P>
    <P>The practice has worked on numerous state projects over many years and this may be expected to continue (with the exception of Marine and Defence).</P>
    <P>In formulating these statements of interest I was conscious in particular of the contents of paragraphs 28 and 26 of the Government Procedure Instructions which state:</P>
    <P>28.  A Minister or Minister of State should not carry on a professional practice while holding office but there would be no objection to making arrangements for the maintenance of a practice while holding public office and for return to the practice on ceasing to hold office.</P>
    <P>26.  In so far as business interests or membership of other organisations are concerned, the underlying principle is that no Minister or Minister of State should engage in any activities that could reasonably be regarded as interfering, or being incompatible, with the full and proper discharge by him of the duties of his Office.</P>
    <P>I have tried, to the best of my ability, to work by these demanding, and rightly demanding, principles and I honestly believe that I have lived up to them in spirit and intent.</P>
    <P>I have not carried on with my professional practice since taking office.  I resigned as my firm's managing partner last December and I have not used my office as Minister for Defence and Minister for the Marine, or my position as a member of the Government, to in any way seek advantage for the practice which I previously managed.  I no longer have any day to day involvement in the running of the practice, although I <Col N="732" /> retain a significant share in the ownership of the firm.  There are no members of my family working in the firm or studying the profession of quantity surveying. I regret the latter.  For the information of the House the firm of P.F. Coveney is one of the larger quantity surveying practices in the country and since its establishment in 1930 has undertaken commissions for many Government departments and State agencies on a regular basis.  It has worked intermittently for Bord Gáis Éireann over the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the telephone conversation I had with the Chairman of Bord Gáis Éireann, Michael Conlon, approximately five or six weeks ago.  I have no written record either of the date or content of that conversation.  It was a casual contact ranging over a number of matters, only one of which had any bearing on the events leading to my resignation.  The phone call was not made from any office of the State or during normal working hours, but late in the evening from my rented apartment in Dublin to Mr. Conlon's home in Cork.  I only mention this to emphasise the personal and casual background to the conversation.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of our conversation I referred to the publicly-announced proposal to relocate the BGE offices from Little Island to Gasworks Road in Cork.  I inquired if it was intended to invite proposals and tenders from a list of architectural, engineering and quantity surveying firms for any renovations to the Gasworks Road premises. Michael Conlon said he thought that would be the case.  I then inquired if the quantity surveying firm, of which I had previously been the managing partner, could be included on the list, from which competitive proposals would be sought and evaluated by BGE.  In truth it was probably a superfluous inquiry as having worked intermittently for BGE over the past 20 years the practice would almost certainly have been <Col N="733" /> included on any such list.  Here I emphasise again that the telephone conversation was personal and casual in tone and content.</P>
    <P>I emphatically did not ask for the commission for P.F. Coveney.  There was no question whatsoever of that.  I simply inquired if it was intended to invite proposals from a list of suitable firms who would then compete for the commission in accordance with the normal procedures and regulations governing public contracts.</P>
    <P>Michael Conlon said he would inquire and revert directly to the firm.  He did not contact me nor the firm again about the matter and I did not subsequently contact him seeking any further information about it.  Indeed I had forgotten the conversation until some weeks later I heard a rumour that a journalist from a Sunday newspaper was inquiring about a contact I had with the chairman of BGE allegedly seeking to have my former firm appointed for a project in Cork.  Naturally I was very surprised and concerned and telephoned Michael Conlon to ask if he had any knowledge of this rumour.  He said he had also heard such a rumour and was extremely annoyed about it.  He confirmed then and has done so publicly on several occasions since that he did not regard my original telephone call to him as anything more than a simple inquiry made in the course of a personal telephone call.</P>
    <P>He has reiterated again and again that he did not regard that inquiry as an attempt to influence him in any way; nor was it.  At the conclusion of this second conversation he proffered the information to me that BGE had decided to entrust the consultancy work on the Gasworks Road project to the group of consultants who had been appointed some years ago for an extension to BGE's previous headquarters at Little Island.  That project had subsequently been abandoned and the building sold. As far as I was concerned that was the end of the matter and I heard no further rumours or mention of the project until <Col N="734" /> Mr. Ted Harding of the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> telephoned me last Friday afternoon.</P>
    <P>I answered all of Mr. Harding's questions in a straightforward and accurate manner.  When he asked me if I had discussed this matter with Michael Conlon I replied that I had and gave him my best recollection of the conversation just as I have now given this House.</P>
    <P>I informed the Taoiseach of Mr. Harding's inquiries early on Saturday morning and provided him with a full account of the whole matter.</P>
    <P>At this point I have to emphasise that I stand over my good name and reputation. I am satisfied in conscience that I did not deliberately do anything wrong nor betray the high public trust placed in me.  Nevertheless if we set high standards in public life, then we must live by them.  If what I did is capable of being perceived as transgressing those standards, inevitable consequences follow.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that I should not have made any mention in my telephone conversation with Michael Conlon of the firm's possible inclusion in the list of consultants for BGE's offices and that in doing so I inadvertently transgressed the high standards which this Government has set for itself.</P>
    <P>I stand fully behind the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton.  I fully accept his advice and judgment in this matter.  He has decided that a price has to be paid in the interests of public accountability. It is a heavy price but I accept it without reservation.</P>
    <P>I greatly regret any concern or embarrassment occasioned to the Taoiseach, to my colleagues in Government, to the Members of the Oireachtas, to the Fine Gael Party, to the electorate at large and to my family, and I apologise to all of them.</P>
    <P>I discussed this matter with the Taoiseach last Sunday afternoon.  He and I agree on the necessity for the highest possible standards in public life and the need to pay and be seen to pay some price for any lapse in that regard. Accordingly, I tendered my resignation as Minister for Defence and Minister for <Col N="735" /> the Marine and accepted the Taoiseach's offer of nomination for the position of Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for public expenditure and the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The practice which I formerly managed will receive no commissions from the Office of Public Works during my tenure as Minister there, just as it has received no commissions from the Department of the Marine or the Department of Defence during my tenure in those Departments.  Furthermore, the practice is not currently or recently engaged on any work for the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I repeat that I stand over my good name and reputation.  I have dedicated a large part of my life to public service and I intend to continue to do so.</P>

      <P>I join my colleagues in the House in warmly congratulating Deputy Barrett on his forthcoming appointment to the Departments of Defence and the Marine and wish him well in that office.  I have known Deputy Barrett for many years.  He was Opposition spokesperson on the Environment for at least two years when I was Minister and we had a number of debating bouts.  Occasionally he might lose his cool but, apart from that, he is a very fine fellow.  It is unusual, however, that the Minister for the Departments of the Marine and Defence should be from the same constituency as the junior Minister.  I hope the tensions and developments in that constituency will not widen the rift in this already shaky Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> The second matter under discussion today is one in which no Member takes any pleasure.  I have known Deputy Coveney for many years.  He is extremely popular and has few political enemies.  He took over at the Department of the Marine from a high profile Minister, Deputy Andrews and readily admitted that he found the Department in good shape.  He quickly built on the achievements of Deputy Andrews and was always courteous and co-operative in the House.  I am very sad for him and for his family that these circumstances have arisen.  I wish him well in his political future.  As Deputy O'Rourke said, many Members suffer setbacks from time to time, but they must take them on the chin.  It is difficult when it happens but, in the course of time, one can come through and pick up the pieces.</P>
    <P>Knights in shining armour on the high moral ground are in an extremely dangerous position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has just had a five or six month honeymoon and during that time two Ministers have had to resign.  The plot might even be thickening and the intricate web of interdependence between three parties trying to survive might be made more difficult as another Minister desperately tries to cover his tracks and at least two Ministers of State make frantic telephone calls.  We may not have reached the end of this story.</P>
      <P>Earlier today the Taoiseach replied to questions in a way that reminded me of the note, &ldquo;if pursued on this question keep repeating the above&rdquo;.  On at least seven different occasions the Taoiseach chose to give the same answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party has tried to make a virtue out of this resignation which took place following a book of revelations, and that book of revelations is filling up.  In the context of consistency.  Deputy Phil Hogan time be asking himself serious questions. When he was Minister of State at the Department of Finance with special <Col N="737" /> responsibility for the Office of Public Works he leaked information about the budget although he had nothing to gain from it.  He was considered unsuitable to hold that office.  While he had to leave that office the Taoiseach considers that Deputy Coveney should assume responsibility for the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>In the space of five or six months a third Minister of State is being asked to assume responsibility for the Office of Public Works which has a huge budget. The Taoiseach will have to accept that this will make it extremely difficult, given the range of activities there, to manage the office efficiently and coherently, not to mention the question of management of the public finances. Only this week it has been disclosed that public expenditure will increase by 11 per cent this year, 5 per cent above the figure provided for in the budget. This is an extremely serious matter.  It is essential that there be continuity in the Office of Public Works to ensure that the right decisions are made.</P>
    <P>When did the Taoiseach first know about this matter?  It has been suggested that he could have known about it for considerably longer than has been claimed in this House.  It is ironic that many members of the Fine Gael Party want an inquiry to discover who leaked the information.  It seems that many people in Cork knew about it for at least three weeks.  It is unbelievable therefore that the Taoiseach did not know about it.  When did he discuss the matter with the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, and the High Priest, Deputy Pat &ldquo;Rocking the Country to its Foundations, Quiet as a Mouse&rdquo; Rabbitte who admitted on radio on Sunday last what he would do if a Fianna Fáil Minister was involved in trying to obtain special concessions for a private company with which he was associated from a State company?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="738" /> These are the questions which the Taoiseach must answer when replying. What criteria were used in deciding that Deputy Hogan should be sent to the back benches in circumstances in which he had nothing to gain and that Deputy Coveney should be appointed to the position held by Deputy Hogan?</P>

      <P>Although I knew about Deputy Coveney's political and business reputation I did not meet him until the evening of the by-election count in Cork last November.  For the past five months I have worked as his Minister of State at the Department of the Marine.  In that time I have come to regard him as a man of the strongest commitment and highest integrity, a good colleague, always open and honest in his approach and a man with whom I enjoyed a particularly good working relationship.</P>
      <P>The unfortunate events of the past couple of days have not diminished the high regard I have for Deputy Coveney. I regret his resignation; this is a loss to his Department and his colleagues.  I wish him well in his new appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coveney and I share a conviction about the enormous potential of the sea.  To give effect to this we embarked on a programme of work to revitalise the marine sector.  I pay tribute to him for his energetic contribution and leadership in that effort.  Deputy Coveney had announced an overhaul of national marine policy, something which was widely welcomed throughout the fishing industry.  He had announced a review of the services provided to the industry and recently appointed a firm of consultants to carry it out.  He published the Harbours Bill and approved an investment of £140 million in commercial harbours.  He launched a £134 million investment in the fishing industry through the operational programme, <Col N="739" /> strengthened the country's marine research network and had begun drafting new legislation on aquaculture.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coveney has already left his mark on sea fisheries in particular.  During his first week in office last December he took on the challenging brief at the Fisheries Council in Brussels. The agreements he reached on a package of control measures for the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets were rightly hailed by the industry at home.  He also secured recognition from the Council of the heavy financial burden which fisheries surveillance places on Ireland.  Deputy Coveney was to present in Brussels next month the package of measures finalised between the Departments of the Defence and the Marine.  I am sure this House will join me in thanking him for his determined pursuit of this important issue and his success which will stand as his landmark in the Department of the Marine for many a year to come.</P>
    <P>Despite his busy schedule Deputy Coveney took the time to learn at first hand about the concerns of the fishing industry during his visits to the ports of Killybegs, Burtonport, Castletownbere, Crosshaven, Kilmore Quay, Duncannon, Howth, Dingle which he visited last Saturday and many smaller ports.  The people in those ports and those engaged in the fishing industry will want this House to thank Deputy Coveney for the enormous contribution he made to the industry, the work he has done over a short period and the many initiatives he has taken which I expect to be continued.</P>
    <P>I warmly congratulate my constituency colleague, Deputy Barrett, on his appointment as Minister for Defence and the Marine.  I look forward to working with him in the Department of the Marine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, and the former Minister, Deputy Coveney, formed the best partnership in fisheries in any Government since the foundation of the State <Col N="740" /> although they worked together for as little as five months.  This is widely acknowledged throughout the fishing industry and the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>Between the Dáil and Seanad I have been a Member of the Oireachtas for 22 years during wich time we have had in fisheries a succession of mediocre primarily midland county individuals who did not have a knowledge of the sea. This does not necessarily mean that they were not good Ministers but in this instance we had an exceptional individual in charge of one of our most important indigenous industries.  It is a tragedy that he had to leave this post before achieving all he could for the fishing industry.  He will be sadly missed. This has been the reaction among fishermen around the coast.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coveney should not have resigned.  As he pointed out, the comments were made in a casual way during a casual conversation.  In my view, they did not constitute a breach of senior ministerial rules.  I do not believe it was a resigning matter.  I predict we will live to regret the day it happened because his departure from the ministries of Defence and the Marine is a tremendous loss to the Government and the country.  He is a man with a nice, easy, relaxed style, with poise; certainly he is not a &ldquo;poser&rdquo;.  He has a very definite personality, is intelligent and a very strong character.  His likes are needed in Irish politics.  One need only think of all the successful businessmen mentioned as potential Members of Dáil Éireann and or Cabinet Ministers.  We are being told constantly we need a higher calibre of Member in this House, yet look what happens when we get a person of that calibre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my estimation, Deputy Coveney stands way above most Members I have seen elected to this House.  He is a very successful businessman, has given it everything but, at the end of the day, has suffered.  It is not fair, I do not think it was a resigning matter.  I wish him every good fortune in the future and <Col N="741" /> congratulate his successor, Deputy Barrett.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Opposition parties for allowing me to make a brief contribution.</P>
      <P>I wish I could claim the credit the press has been heaping on me recently of being the person responsible for encouraging Deputy Coveney to enter politics.  That is not so; he entered politics through a sense of public service.  I do not think anybody in this party, indeed in this House or in Cork who has had occasion to deal with him over the almost 14 years of his intermittent membership of this House will have any doubt about the sense of public service he feels and was determined to make available to the people of Cork and the electorate generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coveney is an extremely competent, able businessman.  I do not consider there are nearly sufficient competent, able businessmen Members of this House.  There never have been. Those who were elected were treated with suspicion by other Members, as though they were here merely to line their pockets which was very seldom the case.  Indeed, the whole atmosphere of Dáil Éireann is not conducive to encouraging business people to put themselves forward as candidates, to <Col N="742" /> place their experience before the electorate and so participate in debates here. I very much regret that.  I also regret very much that, when one of them does, and makes great sacrifice in doing so, an unfortunate set of circumstances should mean that he has to resign from the Cabinet, which position has been the fulfilment of an ambition I knew he held for a long time and which I encouraged him to keep alive.  Indeed I was very pleased when the Taoiseach offered him the post of Minister for Defence and the Marine.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coveney will be missed in the Department of the Marine.  He will be missed by coastal communities from the tip of County Donegal to Dunmore East.  We should not lose sight of the fact that he will also be missed by the Army.  A very difficult task faces any Minister for Defence in redesigning our Army, almost from scratch, reinterpreting its role in Ireland and the Europe of the future and deciding on its future role and what resources should be put at its disposal by the taxpayer to adequately fulfil it.  Deputy Coveney tackled both difficult, demanding roles, with their huge attendant problems, with flair, intelligence, dedication, energy and commitment which certainly would have brought renown to him, the Government and country generally had he been allowed to retain that post. That is not to be.  He is handing on both batons to another very able Member, Deputy Séan Barrett, with whom I have been friendly since he was first elected to this House; in fact I think both he and Deputy Coveney were elected in the same election.  It is no secret that I would have hoped to have seen Deputy Séan Barrett a full Cabinet Minister before now.  However belated and unfortunate the circumstances in which he now attains that position, I congratulate him.  I have every confidence, and the Taoiseach can also feel likewise, that Deputy Barrett will do an extremely good job in the post to which he is being assigned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> It is ironic that the telephone call that Deputy Coveney made was to the chairman of Bord Gáis Éireann, the only semi-State company with its headquarters outside Dublin.  A further irony is that I was the Minister who established that board.  Therefore, it is my regret that it should be the cause, some 20 years later, of a friend, coming to a halfway house in his political career who for the moment must step down from the post he deserves to hold.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that that telephone call was made, it should not have been made, Deputy Coveney realises that. His forthrightness in going immediately to the Taoiseach, acquainting him of the circumstances in which it was made and offering his resignation &mdash; I do not want to retrace the history of similar misdemeanours which were more grave than that committed by Deputy Coveney and the action taken by those responsible for them &mdash; is testimony to that fact.  He has paid a very heavy, personal price, as have his family.  Naturally, the Taoiseach must wish this was a decision he did not have to take.  That said, I have no doubt that the integrity, an integral part of this Government, which prompted Deputy Coveney's resignation, and which prompted the Taoiseach, without hesitation, to accept it, remains intact.  Equally I am certain that Deputy Coveney will do as good a job in his new post as he has done for the past six months in his two former senior ones.</P>

      <P>First, may I express my warmest congratulations to Deputy Seán Barrett on his elevation to membership of the Cabinet.  There are few more popular Members than he.  I sincerely wish him a very successful term <Col N="744" /> of office.  I also warmly congratulate the new Government Chief Whip, Deputy Jim Higgins, who I have no doubt will perform his duties with great efficiency.</P>
      <P>I should like to express my personal regret to the outgoing Cabinet Minister, Deputy Coveney.  It goes without saying that he is one of the finest Members to have been elected, respected on all sides for his honour and integrity.  Unfortunately, on this occasion it would appear the Taoiseach was left with no alternative but to take the action he did and which Deputy Coveney has accepted.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind the way in which Irish politics has been going in recent years I am not in the least surprised that it should have come to this because, it became obvious that, as the bar was set even higher, it would become ever more difficult for even decent, honest people to clear it.  In recent years Members have thrown allegations around like snuff at a wake, or confetti at a wedding. They did not withstand examination by tribunals or High Court judges.  At the time they were made the Members responsible may have known them to be untrue.  When one starts down that road in any democracy, irrespective of the individuals with whom one is dealing, one does not serve democracy and ends up in the circumstances in which we find ourselves today.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has had a large part to play in all of that.  I recall last November that he came into this House as Leader of the main Opposition party, waving his arms around about the Office of the Attorney General, accountability, openness and transparency.  That openness, accountability and transparency was not evident in answers to questions on the Attorney General's office this afternoon. It suddenly seems to have disappeared. It appears the trappings of power put a new perspective on the Taoiseach's view of political correctness. If Deputy Coveney was sacrificed on the altar of political correctness, those in this House who erected that altar would do well to look into their own hearts and question whether that was the right thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="745" /> The position is quite clear.  Mr. Conlon unfortunately told Deputy Coveney he would inquire about the matter and revert directly to the firm.  As Deputy Barry stated, that phone call should not have been made.  Mr. Conlon should not have become involved in that kind of activity.  The crunch issue is whether the Taoiseach, having decided that Deputy Coveney should not be Minister for the Defence and the Marine, is correct in appointing him Minister of State at the Department of Finance.  Is there an inconsistency there?</P>
    <P>A number of speakers suggested today that if it was a Fianna Fáil Minister who was involved, the Minister would not have resigned, but some people have very short memories.  I recall Deputy McDaid, who ironically was also appointed Minister for Defence, resigning in this House after a barrage of insulting and personal attacks because he was seen in a photograph outside the Four Courts in this city.</P>

      <P>The justice that is sometimes meted out in this House may seem extremely rough and certainly on a personal level can be extremely difficult &mdash; for example, the former Tánaiste, Deputy Lenihan, was hounded and harried not only in this House but throughout the country. What kind of standards do we want to apply?  This is a fundamental question that must be addressed by every politician. When Fianna Fáil was in power it did not matter who was the target.  On the Opposition side of the House there were people who had very little interest in integrity and in people's reputations but who destroyed them on the basis that it would assist them in getting into power.  That is no way to run your business and it certainly does not serve democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of Cork will be greatly disappointed because they have lost a Minister of the highest calibre.  In his brief period in office Deputy Coveney <Col N="746" /> served his people extraordinarily well. They will be genuinely disappointed the Taoiseach did not take the opportunity of appointing somebody in his place from the city of Cork, and they will express that disappointment.  In the final analysis the question the Taoiseach must answer is whether he is trying to make a virtue of what he did to Deputy Coveney.  Is he saying Deputy Coveney was wrong or is he saying he was half wrong?  The people deserve an answer to those questions and certainly the people of Cork will insist on one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I had choices as to how I would approach this matter.  As some people have implied, I could have asked for Deputy Coveney's resignation and not reappointed him to a Government office, but that would have constituted the end of his political career.  It would have deprived Irish public life of an outstanding public servant, a person who has a lot to contribute to public life, and that would be done for an admitted error of judgment but one which I am <Col N="747" /> convinced was not in any way illintended. It was the lack of any ill-intent rather than the form of what happened that gave me the ability to come to the conclusion that the penalty of resignation from Government without any continued role in Government was not the right approach to the problem.</P>
      <P>Equally, I had the choice of deciding that no action would be taken other than inviting Deputy Coveney to make an apology to the House and allowing him to continue in office as if nothing had happened, but I did not take that course of action because something had happened.  A phone call had been made that should not have been made.  While there was no intention to exercise undue or improper pressure, the call was open to the construction that pressure was being exercised, even though it was not, and in any event a Minister should in no circumstances discuss with the chairman of a State board the affairs of a business in which he has an interest.</P>
      <P>It would only make sense to speak in terms of the standards to which I have just referred if, when they are transgressed, some penalty is sought, and a mere apology would not have represented in this circumstance a sufficient measure of accountability.  I therefore chose the third option, not dismissal and not brazening it out but demotion to an important but lesser position.  I believe that is the fair and appropriate approach to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting that virtually every speaker in this debate was unwilling, even when they are in possession of all the facts, to say what they would have done.  They said that I must answer this question and that question, that maybe the matter should have been dealt with this way but maybe on the other hand it should have been dealt with the other way.  That is the luxury those on the Opposition are entitled to enjoy because they do not have to make the decision.  I made it and I did so quickly. I could see no merit whatever in allowing this matter to drag on until the Dáil met today.  I could see no benefit <Col N="748" /> for anybody in postponing a decision, and the decision was therefore taken quickly.</P>
    <P>The way in which Deputy Coveney dealt with this matter from the time he received the call from the journalist with the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> shows what an honourable person he is.  It is fair to say that the temptation that would occur to most of us if we were asked about something awkward would be to say, &ldquo;I will get back to you&rdquo;, &ldquo;Let me think about that&rdquo; or &ldquo;I want to check something&rdquo;. We would find some way to avoid answering the question fully and frankly.  Quite unusually in this House. Deputy Coveney chose to answer the questions fully and frankly to the best of his recollection immediately the journalist put them to him.  That, more than anything else, convinced me that Deputy Coveney had acted honourably throughout in this matter.  He made a mistake, but he had acted with exemplary honour as he did in the way he spoke in this House.  For those reasons I chose the approach I outlined in dealing with the issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Smith questioned my truthfulness in suggesting that perhaps I did know about this matter before 10 a.m. on Saturday.  Let me reiterate, for the benefit of Deputy Smith, that I did not know anything about this matter before then.  Some other Members questioned why I did not deal with the matter on Saturday but waited until Sunday and sought to imply that I was waiting to see what was in the newspaper. When Deputy Coveney telephoned me about this matter at 10 a.m. on Saturday morning he had to leave his home to undertake a programme of official and political engagements in Kerry which lasted until 10 p.m. that night.</P>
    <P>Those were publicised engagements and it would have been impractical for him to come to talk to me about the matter without breaking those engagements in a fashion that would have caused problems for those involved which would not have been proper.  He rightly proceeded with the engagements <Col N="749" /> and I agreed that he should come to see me at my home at 11 a.m. the following day, Sunday.  He did so and that was the first occasion I had an opportunity to have a face to face discussion with him about the matter.  I heard what he had to say.  He undertook to prepare a more detailed written statement about the matter during that afternoon and I arranged to see him again at 6 p.m. in my home.  We reached the decisions we made quite quickly after that second meeting.  There was no long or agonised discussion about the matter.  It was clear what had to be done and it was done. There were some logistical problems in arranging the final issue and wording of the statement announcing the decision which prevented Deputy Coveney being in a position to leave my home until shortly after 9 o'clock but that is the only reason for the duration in question.</P>
    <P>As I said already, I believe this matter was dealt with in a fair, compassionate &mdash; and yet firm &mdash; way.  I know comparisons have been made in this debate and that matter caused me some concern and worry over the weekend.  Comparisons have been made between Deputy Coveney's position and that of the former Minister of State, Deputy Hogan. Deputy Hogan decided voluntarily that in the interests of the Government as much as on the merits of the case, because of the nature of the timing of the controversy, he would stand down as Minister of State.  The option of moving him to a lesser post did not exist at that level, but it applies at Deputy Coveney's level.</P>

Will he explain to the House why Deputy Coveney's recent conduct was regarded less seriously than that of Deputy Hogan in January?

How does he differentiate between the two?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not fire Deputy Hogan or Deputy Coveney, both resigned.  That term should not be used in either case.  It has been accepted in Deputy Hogan's case that no persuasion was necessary, it was a decision he made that should be respected.  In Deputy Hogan's case the option of demotion did not exist.  There is no office to which a person in that position can be moved that is not at the same level.  As the option did not exist I could not use it.  I am not in a position &mdash; and I do not think it is appropriate &mdash; to set up some type of measure, statistical or mathematical system outlining the degrees of culpability in cases.  That is impossible. There are too many complex and varied factors to be taken into account in a decision of this nature for it to be susceptible to that sort of simplistic measurement.  The Taoiseach of the day must make the judgment taking into account the circumstances of a particular case in terms of what happened, the intention or lack of it of the person in question to create a situation open to criticism and the need to exercise justice, fairness and compassion in dealing with any individual whether he or she be a Minister or a person holding any other office in the public service.  The three requirements, what happened, the motive and the circumstances of the individual must be taken into account. Only one person has responsibility for doing that and that person is elected by the Dáil as Taoiseach.  Those who criticise the judgment I made can do so, but I made it and it is my job to do so.  There is no mathematical system under which I can make it.  I made it in a balanced way and I am entirely at ease with my judgment.</P>

In fairness to his colleague if the Taoiseach is trying to set a higher standard which he said he would do six months ago, he must work to some set of guidelines.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The same high standards should apply to Ministers and Ministers of State.  No Minister or Minister of State should do anything in office to directly assist a business in which he or she has a financial interest.  If either a Minister or Minister of State does that, he or she should pay a penalty. Deputy Coveney is paying a penalty for an error of judgment and in that regard the need for accountability is being satisfied.  As no ill intent was involved in this case I do not believe the penalty of total removal from office should apply.  I have absolute confidence in Deputy Coveney's ability to do an excellent job as Minister of State at the Department of Finance where his general business experience will be useful to the Government, not only in regard to the operations of the Office of Public Works, but also in regard to his functions on public expenditure control into <Col N="754" /> which he will be able to provide a practical insight.</P>

Will the Taoiseach accept that was not a good decision and that he should ask all his Ministers to publish their interests?  The Taoiseach said at the time that he did not have a problem with them publishing that information on an individual basis.  I put it to the Taoiseach that it is time for him to exhort all of his Ministers to do so. In that debate the Taoiseach also said that all the Ministers had withdrawn from their business interests.  Yet, in his contribution today, Deputy Coveney indicated that at the time he made a declaration to the Taoiseach, he said he retained a share in his family firm.  He also reiterated in this House that he had a significant share in this firm.  He said that he was not in receipt of a salary and that he was not taking any part in the day to day running of the firm, but if Deputy Coveney is in receipt of a share of profits or has the potential to receive a share of profits, will the Taoiseach accept that perhaps that also should be divested at this stage?</P>

I am not sure whether any declarations were sought by my predecessors but this is a very comprehensive declaration.  Second, when I was asked a question about the publication of these declarations, I outlined in the Dáil that my reason for not doing so was the need to protect the legitimate privacy of third parties such as spouses, children and others.  I indicated that some of the declarations would involve joint holdings <Col N="756" /> and, therefore, these declarations would involve disclosing information that was private to the other joint holder. Obviously, the Government will comply fully with the disclosure requirements of the ethics Bill, once passed.  As the Deputy has rightly said, any Member who wished to make a full declaration of their own accord was free to do so.</P>
      <P>I do not think this is in any way relevant in this particular case.  Everybody knew that Deputy Coveney had a continuing interest in this quantity surveying partnership.  It is not a matter that was concealed in any way and members of the public would not have been any wiser about the matter than they already were if the declarations had been published.  It is true that Deputy Coveney, as a shareholder in the company but as someone who is not involved on a day to day basis with its activities, would stand to gain from any enhancement of the business performance of that company, and that is why I regarded the matter as sufficiently serious to agree with him that a resignation would be appropriate.  It is precisely for that reason that this situation arose.  If he had divested himself entirely of all shares in the company, the call would have been almost irrelevant. The implication of Deputy Ahern's question, if it were carried to its ultimate conclusion, would be that all persons, on becoming Ministers, would be required to divest themselves of all financial interests.</P>

We are dealing here with serious matters and there is an onus on the Taoiseach, and the people on this side of the House, to establish the facts.  Will the Taoiseach be a little more accurate about the dates and times?  Deputy Coveney said he telephoned the chairman of Bord Gáis about five or six weeks ago.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that date?  Will he establish the date on which Bord Gáis made its decision?  These two dates are relevant in that the question was to be decided by Bord Gáis at a particular time.  If the Minister did not have any day to day contact with this firm, as required under the regulations which applied in previous Governments, why did he make representations to the chairman of Bord Gáis, effectively acting as a public relations agent for the company?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Barret on his appointment as Minister for Defence and the Marine.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil put down this motion to express its dismay at the disarray in the Government's environmental and farm policies.  The motion highlights the chasm between Ministers' rhetoric and the growing pollution problem, the outright contradictions in the policies being pursued by the Departments of the Environment and Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the cost to the economy of inept, ill considered and uncoordinated policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The confetti-like disbursal of £1 billion on pollution control is no substitute for a sound policy of prevention. The abandonment of the control of farm pollution scheme marks the death-knell of sustainability in agriculture and food policy and leaves the Government's environmental policy in shreds. Environmental policy must have prevention at its core.  The rainbow Coalition Government proposes to spend £1.2 billion on &ldquo;end of pipe&rdquo; clean up technology over the next ten years yet it refuses to spend a fraction of that sum on prevention.  By turning its back on a credible policy of pollution prevention <Col N="763" /> the Government is undermining its policy aims.  Tackling pollution at source is not only good farm policy, it is also fiscally shrewd.</P>
    <P>Condemning agriculture to the status of a dirty industry &mdash; which is what the Government is threatening &mdash; is bad for the environment and disastrous for the economy.  Environmental problems will not go away by ignoring them.  The economic consequences of pollution are multiplied the further down stream they go.  The control of farm pollution scheme was the central plank in a co-ordinated onslaught on farm pollution. Like other on-farm investment schemes it is a grant-aid scheme for capital projects and yields no direct income to farmers.  On the contrary, it requires a considerable investment by farmers who want to participate.  Grant-aid of between 30-60 per cent on pollution control works to a maximum value of £22,500 and is available to most farmers while on larger farms the maximum grant is 30 per cent on a maximum investment of £45,000.</P>
    <P>Modern intensive agriculture is a significant contributor to the growing pollution problem.  Farmers recognised this and have been to the fore in seeking a solution.  This should be appreciated and welcomed.  Credit is also due to farming organisations which have given leadership on this issue, which they could easily have avoided.  Heightened awareness of farm pollution comes against the background of a lessening tolerance for anything which degrades the environment. The control of farm pollution scheme, with the rural environmental protection scheme, REPS, represented a serious and integrated solution to a complex problem.  These schemes were judged to be vital to the sustainable development of the agriculture and food industries.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Yates, who has not listened to any of the points I made&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFoxe" hpid="Mr. T. Foxe Mr. T. Foxe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Foxe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Col N="764" />
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;has abandoned a strategy of sustainable development for the agriculture and food industries against the background of a growing awareness of the problem of pollution. His giant step backwards defies the quality revolution in the marketplace. His refusal to take the necessary political decisions now in terms of his Department's expenditure will give rise to serious fiscal and economic problems down the road.  Against this background the contradictory and confusing explanations he has given for his decisions are especially galling.</P>
      <P>In spite of having responsibility for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry since 15 December last, it took the Minister until 17 April last to abandon the scheme he now says he never had adequate money to fund. During that time approximately 10,000 farmers applied in good faith for the scheme and made plans and financial commitments on the basis that they would qualify.  Why did the Minister delay for so long a decision which he now says was inevitable?  His explanations lack credibility.  In reality, he played ducks and drakes with the control of farm pollution scheme while he tried and abjectly failed to elicit support in Cabinet or the EU Commission.  Did he mention this matter to Commissioner Fischler this morning?</P>
      <P>This predicament could be understood if the Minister had not compounded his lack of clout by a complete lack of inclination to take the necessary political action.  If funding is not forthcoming elsewhere he should and could find the money within the totality of his resources.  His failure to take the tough decisions required highlight the chasm between his rhetoric and reality.  The Minister has chosen instead to devote his energies to a farmers' charter which was waste paper before the ink was dry. The frantic chase for photo opportunities does not substitute for leadership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The control of farm pollution scheme which was designed for 30,000 farmers <Col N="765" /> was shut down with barely 6,000 applicants managing to avail of it.  Another 3,000 applicants have been granted the almost theological status of conditional approval.  The Minister wants farmers to undertake major works on the basis of a promise from him.  He is asking them to ask bank managers for bridging finance. Who does he propose will pay the interest?  The agricultural community has a book of broken promises from the Minister, called the farmers' charter.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that at the same time the Minister was moonlighting as a salesman for the banks he and the Government refused to do the one practical thing which might have improved the situation.  The Government should allow in the Finance Bill for an accelerated capital allowance of 50 per cent in the first year for pollution control works.  Against a background of a general abolition of accelerated capital allowances, in 1991 Fianna Fáil made an exception for pollution control work on farms.  That facility coincided with the previous CFP scheme.  Fianna Fáil brought forward a similar proposal on Committee Stage of this year's Finance Bill but the Government, including the Minister and Deputy opposite, voted it down.  I reiterate and underline the necessity for such a provision.  Because of the Minister's incapacity to fund the CFP scheme, £500,000 for the rural environmental protection scheme is now at risk.  This EU fund is designed to enable farmers to adopt environmentally compatible farming methods.</P>
    <P>It is the next logical step after the CFP.  By the Minister's own admission, 40 per cent of REPS applicants require CFP to be eligible for participation. Administrative chaos has added to a very low take up of this vital scheme. On 12 May last only £7.6 million of a possible £240 million in the present round of funding for REPS has been taken up.  The Government is risking hundreds of millions of pounds by its incompetence.  Unspent money must be returned to Brussels, and Irish agriculture and the Irish environment will be losers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> The rainbow Coalition's environmental policy is schizophrenic.  The Minister, Deputy Yates, is content to allow hundreds of millions of pounds of EU funding for pollution control to go down the Swanee.  Alternatively his Cabinet and constituency colleague at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Howlin, promises the panacea of Cohesion Funds to finance his pipe-dream of a sewage treatment plant at every crossroads.  If the Minister, Deputy Yates, has his way we will certainly need them all.</P>
    <P>The contradiction between spending £1.2 billion on end of pipe technology while refusing to tackle the problem at source is absolute.  There has been a significant increase in what is inappropriately termed moderate pollution.  The figures will be updated later this year for the first time since 1990 and those figures will outline an increasingly intolerable problem.  The public will rightly demand action.  The likelihood this year of a dry summer succeeding two very wet ones &mdash; and hopefully we will have that &mdash; will hugely heighten the likelihood of large fish kills.</P>
    <P>There is also the scandal at Ballycroy. People have a right to drink water free from animal effluent.  They have a right to immediate access to information.  It has been a particularly unhelpful feature of this episode that the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, has refused to answer questions in the Dáil on this matter on the grounds that responsibility lies elsewhere.  It is unacceptable that his Department has refused to reveal the terms of an inquiry from the EU Commission on this matter received on Monday, 1 May 1995.</P>
    <P>The situation at Lough Sheelin is worse, and I am sure this subject will be developed as the debate goes on.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, has in his possession an unpublished report from the Environmental Protection Agency.  That report from an agency of the Minister's Department says that the loss of phosphorous from agricultural activities and from sewage <Col N="767" /> discharge from Ballyjamesduff is a huge threat to fish stocks. A separate report from Greenpeace showed that domestic water in Granard contained a carcinogenic substance.  The Environmental Protection Agency has recommended the export of pig slurry from the area.  It has also asked for by-laws to control the amount of phosphorous-containing fertiliser used on the land.  The report further insists that local authorities insist on the control of farm waste.  Clearly the solution is to control farm pollution at source.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, is unwilling to be open and transparent with the information in his possession.  He is adamant, however, that it would not be appropriate or possible for local authorities to undertake works in substitution for those proper to the CFP &mdash; in other words, the Minister's Department.  They were the Minister's words to Dáil Éireann on 9 May. Government Ministers are not prepared to be open with the public about vital information.  The policy of openness and transparency ends at the gates of Government Buildings.</P>
    <P>There is mounting concern and anger in communities all over Ireland about the cavalier treatment of their environment. In not appreciating that groundswell of public opinion the Government has made a fatal political mistake.  People realise they have only one environment and are not prepared to take chances with it.</P>
    <P>The Government's abandonment of an effective pollution policy comes against the background of a worldwide quality revolution.  Consumers increasingly demand not only quality in the finished product but quality and integrity in the production process.  This, in turn, comes against the background of GATT.  World trade has become significantly freer.  The quality revolution is not only consumer-driven, it is also the new protectionism.  If the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry were more interested or more aware, he would know of the eloquent portrayal <Col N="768" /> of his party colleague, Mr. Peter Sutherland, of the danger of quality standards being used as this new protectionism.  It is in our vital economic interests that we guarantee the integrity of our production process.  If we cannot, we will not be allowed to bring our goods into the marketplace.  The consequences for our main industries, food processing and tourism, would be disastrous.</P>
    <P>I have pointed out some of the more obvious consequences of abandoning the CFP.  The effects on REPS of abandoning CFP are more immediate. Money spent on the CFP-funded scheme is pumped back into the local economies through small businesses. Requiring a tax certificate, as such businesses do, the Revenue Commissioners would also be a significant beneficiary. As I have detailed already, an appreciable amount, and sometimes most, of the money must be put up by farmers. Additionally, there is the pending catastrophe of the loss of hundreds of millions of pounds in EU money for REPS. Farm income from REPS is taxable.</P>
    <P>There is no calculation that demonstrates that it does not make environmental and economic sense to fund the CFP.  Farmers have proven themselves genuinely committed to improving their environment.  In the brief time allowed, 18,000 asked to be allowed to put their money where their mouths are and to take part in CFP.  They probably recognise that not just their future viability but that of entire communities depends on a pristine environment.  In a quality focused market the integrity of our production process is vital to the value and acceptability of our product.</P>
    <P>The foolishness and short-sightedness of the Government's <i>laissez faire</i> policy is underlined by the inadequacy of the alternative.  The billions hoped for by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, to fund his empire of sewage treatment works will not be nearly adequate.  Furthermore the vision behind the project is gravely misplaced.</P>
    <P>Ministers Yates and Howlin and I share a common constituency, that of Wexford.  Wexford County Council has <Col N="769" /> estimated that it would cost £190 million to fund all necessary works.  Considering that the new sewage treatment works planned for Ringsend will cost well in excess of £200 million we can begin to appreciate how thinly spread the Minister's solution will be.  Pollution problems do not neatly rank according to population density.  The Department of the Environment's priorities, however, do.  Nothing that is planned in Government expenditure will do anything for many pollution black spots.  There will not be even an attempt at prevention.</P>
    <P>The problem with the Minister's proposed solution does not end here.  It will be the responsibility of the local authorities to fund the running costs of those sewage treatment works.  The annual running costs of the Ringsend works will be in excess of £10 million.  In County Wexford, if works planned for the towns of New Ross, Wexford and Enniscorthy were in operation the local authority would have to find an additional £250,000 per year.  These proposals from a Government that will not enforce collection of local authority charges and refuses to bring forward proposals for local government funding are ludicrous. The one immediate step that would be of definite help &mdash; prevention at source &mdash; is being ignored.</P>
    <P>A pristine environment is what we have been repeatedly promised by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin. Tackling farm pollution was to be the special remit of his constituency colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates.  That Minister has neither the clout, the inclination nor the capacity to deliver.  Because agriculture has, in Deputy Yates view, drawn the short straw, it is to be condemned to the status of a dirty industry.</P>
    <P>Money abounds for other projects.  A sum of £60 million was found for Irish Steel; £12 million was found for Shannon Aerospace; £10 million was found for community employment schemes; and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, could command hundreds of millions of pounds upfront for <Col N="770" /> special social welfare payments.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry cannot deliver.</P>
    <P>By shutting down control of farm pollution, the Minister is setting his face against the co-ordinated pollution control policy endorsed by previous Governments.  He is undermining the ability of farmers to benefit from hundreds of millions of pounds in EU funding for sustainable development under REPS.  He is planning his Department's policy in opposition to the Department of the Environment's attempt to curb pollution.  The <i>laissez faire</i> policy of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is outdated and outrageous.  It defies every lesson we have learned in our development over the last 30 years. Environmental costs are real costs.  Sustainable development based on an integrated approach to economic and environmental factors is simple business sense.</P>
    <P>If the contradictory and ineffective environmental policy of this Government was applied worldwide, we would get deforestation, global warming and a bigger hole in the ozone layer.  In abandoning control of farm pollution, the Government has changed sides.  It has opted to be part of the problem, not part of the solution.</P>
    <P>How many cases like Lough Sheelin and Lough Derg, how many poisoned water schemes, how much damage to our environment and our economy must be done before the lunacy of this decision is realised?  We have only one environment.  We cannot afford to take second chances.</P>
    <P>I commend this motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to support this Fianna Fáil motion, which is of crucial importance to the agricultural industry.  This motion is timely and addresses an issue of serious concern in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of agriculture and the control of pollution at source will be seriously hindered by the Minister's and Government's decision.  The seriousness <Col N="771" /> of this issue in County Cavan is demonstrated very clearly by the figures given by the Minister to the House recently. In County Cavan there were 1,048 applications under the control of farm pollution scheme and only 86 approvals have issued.  There were 311 applications for the dairy hygiene scheme and only 17 approvals have issued. There were 234 applications for the REPS scheme and only 63 approvals have issued.  It is scandalous and totally unacceptable that only 8.2 per cent of the applications received under the control of farm pollution scheme since 1 September 1994 have been approved. To compound this serious situation the Minister suspended the scheme and stated that formal approval of existing applications will cease for the time being.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise the gravity of the situation facing the farming community in County Cavan from a number of points of view, arising from the Minister's disastrous decision to suspend this scheme.  The vast majority of farmers want to control farm waste that contributes to pollution.  It is eminently sensible from a farming point of view, from an environmental point of view and from a financial point of view.  The scheme is not a hand-out for farmers, it is a scheme that provides necessary assistance towards large-scale expenditure. The majority of farmers cannot develop the necessary pollution control facilities without financial support.  A large number of those farmers could be forced out of farming as a result of pollution problems.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer again to the position in County Cavan.  I mentioned earlier that only 86 approvals issued out of a total of 1,048 applications.  Let us bear in mind that this is a deplorable situation in a county where there are heavy retentive soils and 70 per cent of the land is classified as difficult.  The high rainfall and the heavy drumlin soils extend the winter period up to seven months.  Grass growth only begins in mid-April.  West Cavan, in particular, has very heavy <Col N="772" /> rainfall in keeping with the trend in the west, and Clones, which has the nearest meteorological station, records this area as the coldest in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Due to the work ethic, the diligence and hard work of the farming community we have an intensive agricultural industry, mainly dairying, pigs and poultry. The stocking density is well above the national average.  The longer winter results in the need to provide more fodder, predominantly silage, resulting in more effluent.  All these factors combined necessitate the need to provide 50 per cent more storage than would be required in other areas of the country with free draining soils.</P>
    <P>There is substantial interest in the REPS scheme in the Cavan area.  Due to the factors outlined already, many of the applicants wishing to participate in this scheme would need to carry out farm improvements first, with assistance under the control of farm pollution scheme.  Again, the position with this scheme is totally unsatisfactory, only 63 approvals have issued in respect of 234 applications.  The very existence of this scheme in areas such as Cavan is threatened by the decision to suspend the control of farm pollution scheme.</P>
    <P>I wish also to bring to the Minister's attention the very clear message from a survey carried out by Lakeland Dairies. This survey of 3,000 Lakeland producers, with quotas of less than 20,000 gallons, revealed that 56 per cent of those producers were at very high risk of ceasing milk production.  The major reason for this was the poor state of development of on-farm facilities.  Some 90 per cent of those farmers surveyed have poorly developed on-farm facilities. There is an absolute need to maintain the milk quota in the north west and north east area and every practical assistance must be made available to ensure that the small-scale dairy farmer has a real future.  Obviously the Government and the Minister do not share this viewpoint.  Unless corrective action is taken, the Minister's policy will help to accelerate the flight from the land.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that the position <Col N="773" /> as it pertains to the REPS scheme, the dairy hygiene scheme and the control of farm pollution scheme in County Cavan is not acceptable.  The fact that there are almost 1,000 applicants anxiously awaiting approval clearly shows that corrective action is needed as a priority. Will the Minister indicate why the rate of approvals in the Cavan office is so low?  What is the staffing position in the Cavan office?  What steps will he take immediately to allay the anger and concerns of the farming community?  Those farmers will not accept the present position. I fully support their request to have the backlog of applications approved and new applications accepted.</P>
    <P>The farming community in County Cavan wants to tackle pollution problems. We need to develop our tourism industry.  In a county that has at least 365 lakes and other major waterways, it is essential that the farming community who want to invest heavily in on-farm facilities be given the necessary financial assistance.  Such work generates substantial employment and practically all the inputs are sourced locally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Fianna Fáil motion and everything that has been said by my colleagues, Deputies Hugh Byrne and Brendan Smith.  In County Galway there has been great interest in the control of farm pollution scheme, so much so that up to 27 April 2,630 farmers had made application but only 1,056 were approved.  Similarly under the rural environmental protection scheme only 139 applications were approved of a total of 221.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the control of farm pollution scheme designed to cater for 30,000 farms has been suspended although less than one third of applicants have received approval.  This is a source of great disappointment.  The rural environment protection scheme has also been suspended except in where an applicant has received approval in writing.  These two schemes go hand in hand and their suspension raises major questions.  Under the REPS <Col N="774" /> farmers have one year in which to implement pollution measures.  Will the Minister change the regulations to give them more time to implement these measures?</P>
    <P>The Farm Development Service office in Loughrea has received 700 applications and the office in Tuam 500. The majority of applicants are still awaiting their first visit.  It has been suggested in the <i>Farmers Journal</i> that farmers who submitted applications before December 1994 and have received provisional approval will not receive any payment until 1997.  This news has shocked smallholders in particular who are prepared to make an investment under the scheme.  As Deputy Byrne said, since farmers are being advised to borrow money they should be allowed relief on any interest payable.  As they will not receive any payment until 1997 the Minister should ponder the question of whether small farmers will be able to obtain money from financial institutions to make the investment.</P>
    <P>The sum of money involved is not enormous.  The maximum grant payable is approximately £13,000.  As well as protecting the environment the scheme is also sustaining farmers' incomes and creating jobs in the construction industry in the production of tanks, sheds, slates for slatted houses and so on, but because it has been suspended the contractors engaged by farmers will find that there is no work to be done.  The State obtains a good return from these contractors and farmers in the form of income tax.  Farmers have been told that no further applications will be accepted and that the applications already received will not be processed but kept on file.</P>
    <P>Which schemes have not been suspended by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry?  If a farmer has not had a plan devised by Teagasc he will not be able to commence work under the farm improvement programme and there is also a question mark over the hygiene regulations.  It appears that the only scheme which has not been suspended is the alternative <Col N="775" /> farm enterprises scheme.  If one is involved in the business of rearing horses, goats, deer or ostriches one may get the go ahead.  Smallholders in my constituency are anxious to proceed but they need the money first.</P>
    <P>While other Ministers have been able to secure money for FÁS schemes, Shannon Aerospace, TEAM Aer Lingus and equality payments, the Minister has not delivered and is not fighting on behalf of the farming community at the Cabinet table.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion.  I am amazed that the amendment reads as follows: &ldquo;Dáil Éireann supports the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in his efforts to ensure the effective operation of the on farm investment schemes, particularly the control of farm pollution scheme&rdquo;.  The best way of ensuring the effective operation of these schemes is by providing grants to those entitled to receive them.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,048 applications were received from County Cavan of which 9 per cent were approved while 690 applications were received from County Monaghan of which approximately one-third were approved.  Last night I attended a meeting in Cootehill which was attended by two thirds of the 1,400 people who have been left on the sidelines in counties Cavan and Monaghan. They were very angry.  Despite the commitment in the farmers' charter that payments would be made within two months farmers who have received approval are now being told that they will not receive any payment for at least two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, spoke about priorities.  What are the Minister's priorities?  Will priority be given to areas where there is extensive pollution or to small farmers who will be unable to obtain £20,000 from the banks during the next two years to enable work to proceed?  There are 12,000 farmers still awaiting approval who will be compelled to spend between <Col N="776" /> £20,000 and £40,000 because of the pollution problems being encountered.</P>
    <P>In 1993 Monaghan County Council secured £100,000 for a study by Teagasc. The study found that surface water quality in the county had continued to deteriorate over a 20 year period.  A study carried out in 1971 showed that 83 per cent of the Monaghan river channel surveyed was unpolluted &mdash; this was comparable to the national average at the time.  However, by 1990 this figure had declined to 29.5 per cent while the national average was 77.5 per cent.  This highlights the need to continue the scheme in that county.</P>
    <P>The report on the 1993 study stated that investment was considered necessary for environmental improvements to facilities for housing wastes and effluents on 65 per cent or 3,500 farms in the county.  An investment of £45.8 million was required for slatted sheds, slurry storage facilities, new slurry tanks, repairs to existing sheds and tanks etc. This was a significant requirement not least when it was considered that farmers in County Monaghan had already invested £25 million, £11.7 million of which was provided in grant aid under the farm improvement programmes and the previous control of farm pollution scheme.</P>
    <P>The report further stated under the heading &ldquo;Recommendations&rdquo; that the county had reached a cross-roads in the sense that too many activities were having a negative impact on the county's environmental resources but that at the same time the continuation and expansion of some of these activities was critical in sustaining the economy of the county.  The dilemma for Monaghan County Council was to balance environmental sustainability with economic progress and any solution to this environmental-economic problem had to accommodate certain technical, social and economic realities.  The report then pinpointed the incentives to improve waste facilities on farms.</P>
    <P>In 1983 not alone were schemes suspended but excise duties were imposed. This wrecked the economy of the area. <Col N="777" /> The poultry and mushroom sectors account for 47 per cent and 12 per cent respectively of the county's gross agricultural output as compared with 4 per cent and 2 per cent of gross national agricultural output.  We cannot sustain our present level of development, never mind improve it.  Bearing in mind that there are 1,700 people employed in the food industry, which has enormous potential for improvement, this latest proposal constitutes a body blow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann supports the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in his efforts to ensure the effective operation of the on farm investment schemes, particularly the control of farm pollution scheme.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, approved by the Commission in December 1994 during the term of office of my predecessor provides for total public funding of over £1,122 million &mdash; of which £764 million will come from the European Union in the agriculture, rural development and forestry areas in the period to 1999.  When investment in the food sector, provided for under the Operational Programme for Industrial Development is added, total public funding under the Structural Funds in these areas amounts to £1,405 million including £969 million in EU aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On-farm investment is one of the priority areas for funding under the operational programme.  Other priority areas include general improvements in <Col N="778" /> agricultural structures, compensatory headage allowances in less favoured areas, forestry, farm diversification and research advisory and human resources requirements in all these areas.</P>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan it was anticipated that a sum of £245 million would be required for the on-farm investment measures in the programme.  However, the actual figure agreed by the previous Government was £195 million with about half of this earmarked for the control of farm pollution scheme.  My analysis of the situation at this stage is that there is an under-funding of at least £60 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is in office.  These excuses are not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>A further complication in this round of Structural Funds is that the overall financial plan is broken down into annual allocations, unlike the previous round, where the total allocation could be committed at an early stage. The net effect is that funding of the various schemes is subject to review throughout the period rather than in the final years only.  The only advantage the new system has is that it enables funds released from cancellation of works to be reallocated at an earlier stage.</P>
      <P>A feature of the last scheme was a stop-go element; the scheme was suspended in April 1992 and reopened in April 1993 for outstanding applications. A fairly high drop-out was another feature of the last CFP scheme.  Of a total of 37,000 applications received, some 6,500 farmers did not proceed with their applications and a further 7,500 whose applications had been approved failed to undertake necessary works.  The Department found it necessary to reallocate funds at a very late stage.  I will be constantly reviewing the progress of work under the present scheme to ensure funds are not tied to approvals for work which does not go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="779" /> The on-farm investment measures in the programme provide for two new schemes.  A dairy hygiene scheme, introduced on 1 September 1994, will assist farmers under 40,000 gallons quota to bring their dairy facilities up to the standards set by the new EU milk hygiene directive.  The second scheme, which will be launched during this year, will be a scheme for improvement of animal housing welfare standards in the pigs and poultry area related to maximum stocking densities, building requirements and banning of particular confinement systems.  These schemes will make an important contribution to improvement of hygiene and welfare standards on farms.  The other schemes, both of which operated in the previous round, are the control of farm pollution and farm improvement programme.</P>
    <P>Turning to the farm improvement programme, when I came into office I found it necessary to review the funding allocations for the on-farm investment measures, including FIP.  As I already indicated above, the amount allocated fell far short of requirements.  In the circumstances I had no option but to narrow the eligibility conditions for participation in FIP and to confine its scope in future to investment in horticulture, an area where capital investment is essential for expansion and which was not catered for elsewhere.  The amendment of the operation programme to enable the FIP to apply to the horticulture area only was submitted to the Commission in early April for approval.  I expect to receive their agreement to introduce the new scheme shortly.  I emphasise that all outstanding commitments on farm plans under the old FIP will be fully met.</P>
    <P>There has been unprecedented demand from farmers for aid under the control of farm pollution scheme since its launch in September.  In the light of this level of demand and the level of funding set aside for the scheme under the Structural Funds, I was left with no choice but to suspend it on 27 April. From that date no further CFP applications are being accepted until further <Col N="780" /> notice.  Similarly, formal approval of existing applicants also ceased on that date.</P>
    <P>Since the launch of the scheme last September, until its suspension on 27 April, about 18,600 applications were received.  This demand was driven by: the fact that a CFP scheme had not been available to new applications since April 1992; the need for some participants in the rural environment protection scheme to have pollution control work done under the CFP; pressures from local authorities and fisheries boards to address pollution problems and the fear that funds would run out.</P>
    <P>By 27 April about 6,000 of the CFP applications received had been approved to commence work.  Payments in respect of these applications will be made following completion and validation of the works.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned about the impact the suspension of the scheme will have on my efforts to build a modern, environment-friendly agriculture industry.  I have, therefore been anxious to establish procedures which would enable as many as possible of the 12,600 unapproved applications currently on hands to proceed with essential work. To deal with unapproved applications, I envisaged granting &ldquo;conditional approval&rdquo; to facilitate farmers proceeding with their works on the understanding that payment would be guaranteed but deferred until funds become available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister believe they will?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, I set up a consultative group involving officials of my Department, farm organisations and other interested parties with a view to establishing priority categories for processing unapproved applications.  The group reported to me recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the views of the group, I decided to give full approval to processing approximately 220 CFP applications from farmers who had already received the first year's payment under <Col N="781" /> the rural environment protection scheme and who are required, as a condition of REPS, to carry out pollution control works within 12 months.  I have decided to give full approval also to applications on hands from farmers who have had section 12 notices served on them by local authorities under the Water Pollution Acts prior to 27 April 1995 and which require capital investment in waste storage.  Finally, I have accepted the group's recommendation that the fairest and most transparent approach with regard to the unapproved applications currently on hand is to deal with them on the basis of date of receipt.  I am arranging, therefore, for the processing, firstly, of all remaining applications &mdash; approximately 3,000 &mdash; received up to 31 December 1994.  Subject to meeting the conditions of the scheme, such applicants will be given conditional approval in writing to proceed with specified works.  The approval will be given on the understanding that payment will be made in 1997.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied to give an assurance of payment in 1997, following consultation with the Minister for Finance on bringing forward funds from later years.  The conditional approvals will issue on a month by month basis in order of receipt.  This will enable my Department to bring into line applications from counties where progress was particularly affected by staffing difficulties in my Department.  I should add that good progress with regard to resolution of these difficulties has been made in recent months.  The position regarding the balance of the unapproved CFP applications will be considered as part of a further review of the scheme to be carried out by next September.  In addition, I will be making a strong case for additional funding under the review of the Community Support Framework which will be carried out by the Commission next year.  If additional funding is secured, it will be possible to reopen the scheme to new applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="782" /> I wish to make some final points on the unapproved applications.  It will be clear from experience with earlier schemes that the balance of unapproved applications is probably a fair degree higher than the number of farmers who wish to proceed with work.  This is obviously a factor we will be taking into account.  Moreover, I understand that farm building contractors throughout the country already have full order books and they would not have the capacity to undertake now all the work which would be involved if all the unapproved applications in the Department received the green light at this stage.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned to ensure that the suspension of the CFP will have minimal impact on the participation in the REPS.  It is for this reason that I have given the go-ahead for approval of the 220 REPS participants I referred to earlier.  I am also making every effort with the European Commission with a view to relaxing the provision regarding the 12 months' deadline for carrying out pollution control works as a condition of REPs.  Officials of my Department will discuss the matter with the Commission in Brussels this week and I also raised the matter today with Commissioner Fischler.</P>
    <P>However, I must emphasise that the success of the REPs scheme is not solely dependent on the current CFP scheme.  For example, the overall situation on grant aid is that, over the last five years alone, some £170 million has been paid to over 30,000 farmers for pollution control works on their farms under the old control of farmyard pollution scheme and the farm improvement programme. Moreover, on the basis of approvals in recent years, a further 3,000 FIP applicants can carry out pollution control works in 1995 working on their existing plans.  In addition, considerable numbers have already been farming in accordance with the REPS standards for many years, for example, sheep farmers who do not require CFP work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="783" /> It is quite clear, therefore, that there are many farmers with adequate pollution facilities who could now participate in REPS.  Surprisingly enough, the overall level of participation in REPS does not reflect the large numbers of farmers who do not have pollution problems.  There is no reason, therefore, the take-up of REPS should be significantly affected.</P>
    <P>To sum up I believe that the resources available will enable farmers to carry out a substantial amount of pollution control work in the next few years.  I am also taking the following action: giving full grant approval to all CFP applications on hands at 27 April from REPS participants and those with section 12 notices who are required to carry out pollution control works; giving conditional approval of an extra 3,000 applications by bringing funds forward into 1997 from 1998 and 1999&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a weak response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;confirming to the banks the fact that these conditional approvals will be fully honoured in 1997; launching a communications initiative to clarify the position for all farmers; reviewing the position with regard to remaining unapproved applications in September; at the mid-term review making a strong case for extra funds.  In advance of that, I am carrying out a detailed examination of all other measures in the operational programme to see if any savings can be directed to on-farm investment; and keeping a critical eye on the extent to which approvals already granted &mdash; over 6,000 &mdash; translate into actual investment.  I have already drawn Members' attention to the fact that over 14,000 farmers who made application under the 1989-93 scheme did not proceed for various reasons.  We have to be realistic in assessing the actual amount of funding we will need up to 1999 rather than an amount based on what may be an exaggerated estimate.</P>

      <P>A number of points were raised in the debate to which I would like to refer.  The position in Cavan-Monaghan was raised by a number of Deputies.  I acknowledge that people there were badly affected because one district superintendent out of two had been sick for some time.  The conditional approvals approach is designed to help counties from which early applications were made but not approved, and Cavan should catch up substantially in this respect.  The existing schemes greatly benefited Cavan and Monaghan heretofore in that 870 farmers in Cavan were paid £5.4 million and in Monaghan 1,050 farmers received grants worth £5.3 million.  Staffing in the Cavan office was recently improved.  The clerical staff have been taken on, and that position will be considered further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy raised that point.  At the launch of the charter I specifically said there was a problem with the on-farm investment scheme.  If the Deputy reads the charter <Col N="785" /> he will see that it states &ldquo;when operational&rdquo;. The day the charter was launched I knew there were horrendous problems with on-farm investment and no quick administrative procedures would overcome the fundamental problem which is a shortage of money.  Anyone present that day knew that a suspension of the CFP was imminent &mdash; I made that absolutely clear at the time.</P>
      <P>On whether I should have suspended the scheme earlier, I would argue it was best to suspend it at a time when I knew all applications on hand could be paid. Perhaps I should not have suspended it but how can any responsible Minister continue to receive applications in the full knowledge that the requisite money is not available?</P>

      <P>Commissioner Fischler queried my raising the issue today in terms of whether I knew that the only questions to arise are lateral movements of money for some schemes that do not have a draw-down.  I welcome all positive proposals to take money from forestry, FEOGA grants, headage, the animal welfare scheme or any other area.  I have an open mind on this, I am happy to establish priorities and have ordered a full financial review of the matter. People in the real world must understand there will be no more money except in the limited circumstances of the mid-term review if and when Spain, Greece or Portugal do not draw down their nationally agreed Structural <Col N="786" /> Funds.  Those countries have no prospect of getting more money in a given area.</P>
      <P>There is a shortfall of EU money in all areas and we have to live within the revised amounts set out in the National Plan.  I am very willing to deal with suggestions and constructive proposals. I share the points raised by Deputy Byrne and others about environmentally friendly agricultural production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I stayed quiet for the Deputy's diatribe.  Perhaps Deputy Byrne is not aware that the amount allocated by my predecessor for the CFP was £3.7 million whereas I succeeded in getting the £40 million required.  How did the then Minister realistically think that would work?  He must have known it was impossible.  If ever there was a case of live horse, get grass, that was it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked to deal with the position in the context of the money available.  What I have done &mdash; this is the only fair way to proceed &mdash; is to <Col N="788" /> withdraw further full approvals because the maximum amount of money for 1995 and 1996 will be exhausted with existing approvals.  I decided to deal with the remaining applications on the fairest basis which is to give conditional approval to those who applied first, those who were discriminated against due to lack of staff in certain counties. We are meeting the banks &mdash; I am surprised at Deputy Byrne's disparaging remarks about the efforts of the banks &mdash; and we will explain to them that bridging finance will be required for a maximum of 18 months. I have a guarantee from the Minister for Finance that the money will be paid in 1997.  We intend to proceed with the conditional approvals.</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate, any constructive measures to deal with the matter and any proposal for lateral movement. I will not mislead farmers by pretending there is a crock of gold when there is none.  At all times I will act in a transparent way and ensure that farmers have a choice as to whether they want to proceed with the works.  I will maximise the number of approvals on that basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for sharing his time with me.  This debate is relevant because of the serious difficulties facing many farmers.  It is an opportunity to put on record the reasons those difficulties have arisen. Like my colleagues, Deputies Smith, Leonard and Boylan.  I attended a meeting of hundreds of farmers from Cavan and Monaghan last night.  They were extremely worried about their position. As stated, 1,048 applications were submitted to the Cavan office but only 86 were dealt with.  In all 890 applications were submitted to the Monaghan office, but only 82 were dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the staff of the Monaghan office on the manner in which <Col N="789" /> they dealt with the matter in a reasonably short time.  That is proof of the need for a charter of rights for farmers as announced by the Minister some weeks ago.  Every farmer, irrespective of which county he or she lives in, is entitled to the same standard of service. Farmers in County Cavan face a serious problem due to a lack of organisation, staff and the need for a review of the entire scheme.</P>
    <P>There is still a great need for pollution control in Cavan and Monaghan. As previous speakers said, those counties have drumlin soil and heavy stock rates.  I want to ensure that money is found, from whatever source to deal with the problem.  I was amazed to hear some Opposition speakers say this scheme was planned for 30,000 farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand 18,500 farmers have applied, and the average grant is £8,000 per farm.  There is a deficit of £50 million.  A sum of £100 million, or something less, was provided out of a so-called EU bonanza of £8.8 billion.  Those facts are not encouraging. We must realise that the then Minister failed to secure any allocation near the amount he required to fund the proposal put forward last September.</P>

      <P>The Minister also looked after the poultry farmers.  I want to assure the farmers of Cavan and Monaghan that I will work with Deputies opposite provided they are prepared to put forward realistic proposals. I am not saying we can find £50 million by simply waving our hands.  For many months I listened to Deputies opposite tell us how reckless is the Government how it is not controlling its finances and yet some of them who speak at public meetings find it opportune to claim that £50 million or £100 million can be easily found.  I will support the Minister to ensure that farmers throughout the country get the opportunity to do their work and this debate is useful towards that end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister, Deputy Yates, and Deputy Crawford for sharing their time with me.  I welcome this important debate and I support the Minister's amendment.  I fully support the Minister and have every confidence that he will lead the farmers out of this difficult problem and the trauma they experienced under the previous Administration.  This problem did not arise overnight, it was handed to the Minister, Deputy Yates, by the previous <Col N="791" /> Minister, Deputy Walsh, who negotiated the Structural Funds last October through his officials and advisers.  This was the card dealt to the Minister, Deputy Yates, who when he realised how little had been provided, had no alternative but to stop approving applications on 27 April.  They are the facts.</P>
      <P>I attended the meeting in Cootehill last night.  The debate was good, but many farmers were confused.  I had no difficulty going to Cootehill and meeting IFA delegates.  The large turnout indicated that farmers are interested and extremely concerned about their positions.  Misinformation will not benefit anybody and we must ensure farmers are given the facts so that they will know where they stand and we can then deal with the problem.  If we do not go to the root of the problem farmers will be further confused.</P>
      <P>Following a good meeting and much discussion I was amazed that in some instances the picture painted was bleaker than it is.  Farmers were told that they would not be paid for another three years, but that is out of line with the commitment given by the Minister that approvals will be issued up until 31 December and farmers will be paid by 1997.  That shows that some people add two and two and get five if it suits them, but they are not fooling anyone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>From 1995 to 1997 is not three years.  Farmers will be paid within two years at maximum and on average within 18 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the problems facing farmers in Cavan and Monaghan and I acknowledge that the Minister's knows them.  He has details of the number of applications and the interest in that scheme because of the problems and intensity of agriculture in those counties. He is also aware of the ability of Cavan farmers to do their work.  They do not sit around moaning that there is <Col N="792" /> not somebody else to do it for them as may be the case with farmers in other parts of the country.  That is the style of the Cavan people.  They have the get up and go mentality and get the job done. They want to know the facts.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the Minister's concern about dealing with the serious problems in the Cavan office which I brought to his attention early in the year.  It was then I became aware that a senior official was absent due to ill-health and applications were mounting up in the office.  It is unfair that Cavan farmers who had inspections of their farms and were awaiting written approval should be penalised.  As they submitted their applications on time and junior officials carried out inspections of their farms they should not be penalised because a senior person was not present to sanction their applications.  Had that senior official been in his office those farmers would have received their written approvals, would have been able to carry on with their work and be paid in the usual way.  I hope the Minister will consider their position.</P>
    <P>Following the meeting last night and the general confusion about this matter, many farmers who submitted applications in October and November asked me if they would be included in the scheme and I told them that they would. They asked if their REPS application would be included and I told them it would be, but that they would have to wait until 1997 to be paid.  I told them that was a guaranteed payment and that they could bring that approval to their banks to raise money.  They were quite happy with that because they realised that was a good option.  Many farmers who do not have the opportunity to apply under the scheme would be pleased to have the option to apply for a 60 per cent grant.  I am sure the Minister will consider giving those farmers an opportunity to participate in this scheme as that would be in everybody's interest.  No amount of criticism from Fianna Fáil will solve this problem, we want a constructive approach.</P>

      <P>The Minister has reneged on farmers by suspending the control of farmyard pollution grants scheme.  Does he not recognise that his approach to agricultural matters is completely inconsistent?  On the one hand, he stresses the importance of a green image of Ireland for the promotion of our food industry and, on the other, he suspends the control of farmyard pollution grants thereby preventing pollution control work demanded by Irish and European Union consumers.  The Minister is obviously not serious about promoting Ireland as environmentally green and does not accept that pollution control brings reward in the marketplace.</P>
      <P>The control of farmyard pollution scheme has had unparalleled support among farmers who are prepared to make genuine attempts to upgrade their farms.  As I am sure the Minister is aware, such improvements can cost £30,000 or more and delay in grant payments will raise the cost through interest payments.  There have been 1,190 applications for the scheme in County Clare with only 245 approvals to date.  The suspension of the scheme will also slow down the uptake of the REP scheme; it has been estimated that approximately one-third of applicants intend joining the REP scheme in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suspension of the control of farmyard pollution scheme will have major consequences for the environment, jobs and the REPS scheme.  The IFA and the ICMSA view its suspension, a mere six months into what was supposed to be a six year period, was regrettable; farmers who submitted applications were geared <Col N="794" /> towards dealing with the scourge of pollution. The Government has ignored the need to prevent pollution which can have only a major detrimental effect on the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister intend suspending the EU backed agri-tourism and dairy hygiene schemes or the alternative enterprise and farm development programmes? It is ironic that we are debating this tonight following the publication of the Waste Bill.  Does that not demonstrate the piecemeal and inconsistent approach to Government policy by a Fine Gael Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and a Labour Minister for the Environment?</P>
    <P>It could be said that the control of farmyard pollution grants scheme has been the victim of its success, but the real victims of its suspension will be the farmers, the food sector, its potential markets and our tourism industry.  Will the Minister convince his Cabinet colleagues of the need to release funds for the scheme thereby demonstrating his commitment to the farming community? I cannot accept his defeatist attitude of referring to the lack of money.  Surely in such an important industry as agriculture he has a major obligation to fight to secure funds from his Cabinet colleagues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am getting a second bite of the cherry on this matter because I raised it on the Adjournment approximately three weeks ago when the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, replied.</P>
      <P>The Minister must convince his Cabinet colleagues of the need to give him more money for this scheme.  I have no doubt he has similar clout to that of the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, and others who were able to secure funding for matters they believed required priority in their Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister suggested that it will be 18 months before farmers approved under the scheme will be paid.  Unless the Department is prepared to pay the interest that accrues on money borrowed by farmers over that period, they will lose up to 20 per cent of their <Col N="795" /> grants.  As the Minister sought positive suggestions on the matter, perhaps the Department would consider underwriting the interest paid by farmers over the period.  Are there funds remaining under the old scheme which could be reallocated to this scheme?  It has been suggested that up to £4 million was not drawn down under the previous scheme. As some grant approvals under that scheme will not be paid out, that matter should be investigated.</P>
    <P>The reason for the large uptake of the control of farmyard pollution scheme is obvious.  For the past two or three winters weather conditions have been very poor and farmers who traditionally out-wintered cattle can no longer do so.  The Minister must approach this matter at two levels.  I welcome the fact that today he requested the EU Commissioner with responsibility for agriculture to do something about this matter.  There is a commitment at European Union level to solving this problem.  The Minister's main problem lies with his Cabinet colleagues, some of whom do not share his interest in rural life, something which has been proven already.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, committed the Government to spending £200 million this year, probably without his Cabinet colleagues being aware of it. This Minister must let his Cabinet colleagues know he is determined to ensure the necessary money will be provided for this scheme.  Expenditure in other Departments is way out of line and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry should not carry the can for colleagues who are not as prudent as he appears to be regarding available funding.  If this matter related to TEAM Aer Lingus or other such issues which have arisen in the past six months, the necessary funding would be found.</P>
    <P>A total of 18,000 farmers applied for grants under this scheme, only 6,000 have been approved and it is questionable how many of those 6,000 will be able to carry out the necessary work this year.  I am sure the Minister is aware there are not enough contractors to <Col N="796" /> carry out the necessary work this year for the number of applicants approved under the scheme and in October or November he will discover he has more funds available than he thought possible.</P>
    <P>It is pointless asking people to control pollution and then informing them that to obtain funding under the REP scheme they must erect the necessary buildings without providing the required funding which, if the Minister puts pressure on his Cabinet colleagues, he could secure.  Despite what the Minister may say, many farmers who are in the process of preparing their REP scheme applications will not have the work carried out.  I appeal to the Minister to inform his Cabinet colleagues that this issue is as important as other issues for which money was provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said nothing that would signal hope to the many farmers awaiting approval under this scheme, and many more, mainly in the west, who have not yet applied.  In County Mayo, because of satisfactory staffing levels, there has been a high level of application and approval in respect of the control of farmyard pollution scheme, but there has been a low level of take-up in respect of the REP scheme.  The farm development services are encouraging farmers to apply for the REP scheme.  There are large areas of commonage in most western seaboard counties and it is desirable that farmers stock them sensibly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>For some time I have been requesting an additional bus in the Lawrencetown/Clontuskert/Kiltormer area, which <Col N="797" /> serves the Ballinasloe post-primary centre. I received a letter from the Minister of State on 11 May, for which I thank him, in which he stated:</P>
    <P>In order to facilitate the operation of these services, children are often required to wait some time, both morning and evening, for their service. This is a feature of the school transport scheme as operated throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the sentiments expressed in the Minister's letter but if a second bus were in operation, which was the case in the past, students attending the Ballinasloe post-primary centre would have a better quality service.  The letter goes on to state: &ldquo;The routes are operated on a first in, first home basis and they rotate on a weekly basis&rdquo;.  In fact, the routes do not rotate, but that is not the issue here.  The parents, children and boards of management in the schools in question are asking for a reasonable service. They are not interested in a rotating service.</P>
    <P>Previously an additional bus &mdash; a minibus &mdash; was available which served the Lawrencetown area.  I will give an example of the present situation.  There is one large bus.  The children in the Kiltormer area are collected at 7.10 a.m. and are in school at 7.50 a.m. &mdash; that is very early.  I have been informed by the parents that these children often eat their lunches before school begins; the bus does not arrive back at Lawrencetown until 5.40 p.m.  This late arrival home often results in children being collected by their parents and, in many cases, children thumb a lift home, a most dangerous practice.</P>
    <P>I understand a major study was to be undertaken by Bus Éireann to see if there was a need for a second bus which, hopefully, would be approved by the Department.  There are approximately 58 children in the Lawrencetown area and 58 children in the Kiltormer area. With such a large number of children there is an urgent need for an additional bus.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="798" /> It is fair to point out that the decision to have one large bus serving this area affects the students' choice of schools. In fact, they would have a much better service to Banagher in County Offaly, where there is also a second level school.  It is obvious that the boards of management of the second level schools in Ballinasloe are concerned about this issue.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State can give me some indication of the Department's thinking in relation to this matter.  Has the major study been carried out by Bus Éireann?  Will we see the return of the minibus, which served this area, as well as the larger bus?  I do not lay any blame on the bus driver, who has a difficult job trying to provide a service previously provided by two buses.  I ask the Minister to take these points on board and to tell the House that an additional bus will be provided for this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kitt for raising this matter.</P>
      <P>One of my areas of responsibility is to ensure the safe delivery of about 166,000 primary and post-primary pupils throughout the country.  I also have the responsibility of ensuring that the State gets the best possible value for the money it spends on the provision of this service on which, in the current year, approximately £39 million will be spent.  This figure includes approximately £4 million which Bus Éireann receives in charges from those pupils liable for such charges.</P>
      <P>The main policy aim of the school transport scheme is to facilitate equality of access to primary and post-primary education by providing transport to enable children, who might otherwise have difficulty in doing so, attend school regularly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The post-primary transport scheme is organised, in the first instance, by the transport liaison officer, who is the chief executive officer of the vocational education committee of the county, in co-operation with the school authorities and Bus Éireann.  My Department does <Col N="799" /> not make detailed arrangements.  This is the responsibility of the transport liaison officers in conjunction with Bus Éireann.</P>
    <P>In the organisation of school transport services, all routes are planned in such a way as to ensure that, as far as possible, every eligible pupil has a reasonable standard of service from the point of view of timetable and distance from the route while, at the same time, ensuring that all vehicles are fully utilised in the most efficient manner.</P>
    <P>In order to achieve this, individual vehicles are generally required to operate a number of services to both priamry and post-primary schools.  This inevitably means that the timetable often requires some pupils to make an early start in the mornings and wait some time in the evenings.  This is, and always has been a feature of the transport schemes throughout the country.</P>
    <P>When establishing post-primary services, routes are planned in such a way as to ensure as far as possible that no pupil will have more than three hours travelling and waiting time daily and live no more than three miles from the route of service.</P>
    <P>In planning routes, Bus Éireann generally operates a policy of first in, first home.  The result is that the waiting and travelling times are shared almost evenly between the two groups of children.</P>
    <P>The position in this case is that the service to Ballinasloe post-primary centre was operated by a contractor's vehicle and a Bus Éireann vehicle until June 1994.  As a result of a routine reorganisation of services, it was found that Bus Éireann was in a position to operate both the primary and post-primary runs.  The contractor's vehicle was no longer required and the service has been operated solely by the Bus Éireann vehicle since September 1994.</P>
    <P>A rotating service is now in operation to this post-primary centre.  This involves the rotation of Bus Éireann routes 230 and 231, which cater for children from several areas, including those <Col N="800" /> travelling from Lawrencetown and Kiltomer to Ballinasloe.  The post-primary service is also dependent upon the completion of an afternoon primary school run by the same vehicle.  In this way, maximum utilisation of the vehicle is ensured, together with the earliest possible set-down time for younger primary pupils.  The rotation of the service means that the post-primary pupils who have an earlier collection time on week one of the rotation have a later collection time on week two, and <i>vice versa.</i> There is a similar arrangement in the evenings.</P>
    <P>I understand that Bus Éireann met a deputation from the Kiltormer/ Clontuskert/Lawrencetown Parents Action Committee on 30 September last.  When the committee was offered the rotation of routes 230 and 231, which is currently in operation, it considered it unacceptable.</P>
    <P>However, the current travelling and waiting times for these pupils are well within the Department's guidelines. They are availing of a reasonable level of service in the context of the general operation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>It is not open to the Department to sanction the provision of an extra bus to cater for the children in the Lawrencetown and Kiltomer areas as they already enjoy a reasonable level of service, and the cost of providing a second bus would be prohibitive.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, the present arrangement is considered adequate, and is the most that can be offered.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for responding to my invitation to clarify the Government's intention in respect of the proposal to develop a second campus at University College Cork on the site of the former Our Lady's Hospital on the Lee Road.</P>
      <P>Conditions on the existing campus are intolerable.  The library facilities are abysmal with inadequate space for students who want to read and study after lecture time.  The position in the medical faculty is even worse.  There are plans to expand the range of courses provided by that faculty &mdash; such as degree courses for nurses &mdash; but they cannot be put in place within the existing space available.  I could give a dozen other examples but time does not permit. The key point is that there is no further room for exapansion within the perimeter walls.  The residents in the neighbourhood of the universities are being put under severe strain because of increased traffic congestion created by the population in the college.</P>
      <P>As there is no further room for expansion, UCC drew up a major development plan to purchase from the Southern Health Board the hospital building and grounds at the Lee Road. This plan was contingent on the provision of public funding for the development. The outgoing Coalition Government of which the then Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach's party was a partner, pledged £10 million to this development.  Very strong and sustainable arguments on educational, social and economic grounds have been advanced in support of this plan.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Minister for Education &mdash; who was also the Minister for Education during the previous Government &mdash; is not present but I am asking her spokesperson to state clearly and categorically that the undertaking entered into by a former Taoiseach will be honoured.</P>

      <P>University College Cork urgently needs extra accommodation for its rapidly expanding student numbers.  As well as meeting the college's space requirements for many years to come, the proposed extension of University College Cork on the site of Our Lady's Hospital on the Lee Road has two further advantages; first, it represents the first development of third level education facilities on the north side &mdash; in recent years the north side has suffered most from the closure of major industries such as Fords, Dunlops and Verolme and as a consequence certain streets in the area have unemployment rates in excess of 70 per cent.  The location of a major extension of University College Cork at the site of Our Lady's Hospital will mark a major turning point for the area.  The development would generate a large number of short term jobs during the building phase and a number of permanent positions in the long term.  The extension of University College Cork on the north side will act as a much needed safety valve for the college which is now overcrowded.</P>
      <P>I urge the Government to follow the example set by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, by Deputy Bertie Ahern and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, when they offered their support to the project in April 1994.  It is vital that the necessary finances are provided to ensure this development on the north side and I look forward to a positive response.</P>

      <P>Consideration was first given by University College Cork to acquiring the site of Our Lady's Hospital as an international college of health and social sciences in early 1994.  Subsequently the governing body of the college decided to commission a study on the feasibility of the hospital site being developed as part of the university campus.  The study, prepared by consultants appointed by the <Col N="803" /> university, addressed issues such a student numbers by faculty and the current and capital cost implications of the proposed development, was submitted by the university to the Higher Education Authority in late 1994.  The authority has the statutory responsibility for advising the Minister for Education in respect of third level projects.  In accordance with this responsibility the authority is carrying out a full evaluation of all aspects of the proposals.  It has confirmed to the Department of Education that it is now in the process of finalising its examination of the proposal for the acquisition and development of what was formerly Our Lady's Hospital as a second campus of University College Cork.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that the examination by the Higher Education Authority of the proposed acquisition and development by University College Cork of Our Lady's Hospital is a separate exercise and did not form part of the specific remit of the Steering Commitee on the Future Development of Higher Education.  As Deputies will be aware, the Minister for Education established this steering committee under the chairmanship of the Higher Education Authority to examine future education needs.  The focus of this committee's work is on the overall needs for future higher education provision.  The report of the committee has not yet been finalised; when it is, the report will be considered by the Higher Education Authority which will advise the Minister on future policy options.  However, future developments in the higher education sector will be set in the context of overall Government policy and the needs of the sector generally.</P>
      <P>When the recommendations and advice of the Higher Education Authority on Our Lady's Hospital are received the proposal will be given full consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In raising my concerns and those of the Garda Síochana regarding the proposed performance, development and review system I wish to offer positive criticism.  This is a new Garda management proposal which requires close critical consideration.  A similar system was tried in the UK.  The scheme introduced there was pay related but, thankfully, the one proposed by the Garda management is not. However, it is goal related.  The review documentation stresses that goals are at the heart of the scheme.  It states that goals, which can be translated to mean prosecutions, can be quantified and must be set at a higher level than usual. The performance of each garda will be reviewed every six months to determine whether he or she had achieved his or her goals.  It will also be used to set new goals at a higher level.</P>
      <P>It would be a most unhealthy development if members of the Garda Síochana felt they must prosecute in order to advance in their careers.  With these points in mind gardaí have, understandably, claimed in recent months that the proposed PDR gives them targets for convictions and could lead to the abandonment of investigations into serious crime in favour of seeking and achieving easier convictions for minor offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are well aware that over the last two decades the level of violent crime has more than doubled.  For the first time the number of indictable offences is set to exceed 100,000.  That is a mammoth figure.  By any criteria this level of crime is unacceptable and requires immediate action.  This new proposal will not aid the smooth running of the force.  In a recent address to the Garda Commissioner the President of the <Col N="806" /> Garda Representative Association expressed grave concern at what his organisation sees as an attempt to introduce factory floor techniques into a caring profession.  He stated:</P>
    <P>We do not manufacture ball bearings, nuts and bolts or even motor cars.  You cannot measure, by way of a time and motion study, what we create.  We provide a service.  We do not have an end product unless the collection of prosecutions, charges and summons are to become an end in themselves.</P>
    <P>I accept, as do my colleagues in Fianna Fáil, that in many cases a review system is valuable.  There are many arguments in favour of the Garda management proposal, for example, to evaluate performance against expectations and objectives, to discuss problems and find solutions, to receive appropriate praise or recognition, to assess training needs and to provide an opportunity to discuss development, job change and promotion prospects.  However, there are many factors which require considerable critical evaluation.  For example, senior Garda management has adopted too simplistic an approach in the development and implementation of the PDR system; it is too narrow and limited in its approach and was developed without the input of all members.</P>
    <P>Clear pitfalls which should be avoided and which beset many review systems include staff hostility, conflict of objectives, complex paper work, subjectivity and no review of the proposed system. In order to avoid some of these pitfalls I echo the suggestions already put forward by some members of the Garda Síochána.  Possible solutions to the questionable PDR system include a professional review of the various jobs within the force, a constant review of the jobs in question, identification of career paths and a commitment to a continuous learning programme among others.  Time and experience inform us that two key elements are essential pre-requisites in the successful functioning of any performance review system.  They <Col N="807" /> are inter-personal skills and appropriate systems and forms.  There should be close critical consideration of the PDR system.  We must ensure that the two key elements are central to it otherwise individual gardaí will feel alienated from the public.</P>

      <P>I apologise for the Minister's absence.  I am sorry Deputy O'Donoghue has to put up with me.  The Minister set out the position regarding the system of performance, development and review in the Garda Síochána in her reply to Parliamentary Question No. 103 on 27 April.  She outlined that the Garda Commissioner commenced a process of performance, development and review in the Garda Síochána early in 1993.  This system forms part of the Garda Síochána corporate strategy plan.  Its objectives are to improve individual performance and thereby the overall performance of the service to the public and also to provide for individual development.</P>
      <P>As stated in the reply to the parliamentary question, the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors raised this matter at conciliation; the Minister is precluded by the conciliation and arbitration scheme from commenting on matters before it.  I am sure the Deputy will understand that she is not in a position to say any more about the scheme at this stage.</P>

      <P>The so-called extension of the free travel scheme is another miserable effort by him to promote himself. I wish to share time with Deputy Walsh.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance indicated in his budget speech that it was intended to extend the free travel scheme to those in the North.  We welcomed that as it was an issue which we would have brought forward had we introduced the budget this year.  The Minister for Social Welfare stated that this scheme will operate from 1 July.  I welcomed that as did many of those who live in my constituency. However, my inquiries indicate that the Northern authorities refused to increase the subvention to Ulster Bus and the Northern Ireland Railway Board to enable pensioners travel from the South to the North.  It would appear that both Ministers either announced this scheme without consulting with the Northern authorities or that the Northern authorities told them they did not intend to increase the subvention or participate in the scheme.  If my information is correct, that is an appalling reaction from the Northern and UK authorities, particularly in light of the peace process.</P>
      <P>Apart from consulting the Northern authorities, did the Department consult with any of the pensioner groups?  I do not believe it did.  The pensioner groups wonder what is happening.  Apparently a pensioner from the North can travel to only one destination in the Republic. They do not enjoy unlimited travel as do our pensioners, subject to a few conditions. A pensioner from the south can travel only to one destination in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I thank Deputy Ahern for sharing his time with me.  It was with some alarm that I read the Minister for Social Welfare's press release in which he stated that this scheme did not amount to very much.  This came as a great disappointment to many people who regard the free travel scheme introduced by Mr. Haughey in 1967 as generous and imaginative.  It gave elderly people mobility and enhanced their quality of life.  For example, pensioners living on off-shore islands were entitled to six free trips per annum on the ferries and aeroplanes travelling to and from the mainland.</P>
      <P>The scheme is now being confined to one trip to a specific destination, in other words, a person from the North who wishes to spend a day in Killarney while visiting Glengarriff in west Cork will have to hitch into Killarney and back to Glengarriff.  This is a mean-spirited and badly thought out decision and there has been no consultation with the Northern authorities.  If there is to be one benefit from the peace process it should be that elderly people can travel freely throughout the island.  Elderly people in the North should be able to avail of the unlimited free access to travel available to pensioners in the South. I call on the Minister to extend the scheme so that elderly people living in the North can enjoy the same concessions under the free travel scheme as those enjoyed by pensioners in the South.</P>

      <P>The Government decided, in the context of the 1995 budget, to extend free travel to cover pensioners in Northern Ireland and the Republic undertaking cross-Border journeys.  I am very pleased that it has fallen to me, as Minister for Social Welfare, to implement this very important development at a very opportune time in our history.  It is my firm wish, and that of the Government, that this initiative will encourage cross-Border travel and will make a worthwhile contribution to the further development of the peace and reconciliation process on this island by bringing people from both sides of the Border together on a much more frequent, open and friendly basis.</P>
      <P>Speaking in this House on the day following the budget I expressed my hope that we could reach agreement with our Northern Ireland counterparts on the implementation of this initiative.

      <P>Since the initiative was announced, much hard work has gone on North and South to get this initiative up and running as quickly as possible.  Key personnel with the major transport operators responded magnificently to the challenge.  Officials of my <Col N="811" /> Department are currently finalising the administrative and operational arrangements which will underpin the new scheme with the operators who will participate in it.  They are also liaising closely with their colleagues in the Department of the Environment in Belfast.  I would like to take this opportunity to put on record my appreciation of the valuable advice, assistance and other facilities which the Northern Department has provided.  I would also like to thank the transport operators who have spared no effort to ensure that the new arrangements can be implemented by the 1 July target date.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are well in hand to enable the cross-Border travel scheme to commence on 1 July next.  This means that free cross-Border travel will be available to more than 650,000 people, North and South, from that date.  The scheme will apply to some 467,000 holders of free travel passes issued by my Department and their accompanying spouses.  In the case of people holding a companion free travel pass, it will also cover the companion's travel when travelling with the passholder.</P>
      <P>In the case of residents of Northern Ireland, the scheme will apply to some 192,000 people who hold concession travel passes under a scheme operated by the Department of the Environment there.  All of these will be entitled to undertake cross-Border journeys free of charge by bus or rail.  When the final details are settled the scheme will be fully publicised.</P>
      <P>The arrangements now being put in place are fully in line with the Government decision on this matter.  The intention was to facilitate cross-Border travel and this is being achieved under the new scheme.  It is intended that this will be achieved by &ldquo;through-ticketing&rdquo; arrangements which will enable those qualified to complete a journey from any point in one jurisdiction to any point in the other free of charge.</P>

      <P>The scheme will be funded in full by my Department.

      <P>In my reply to the House of 4 April I expressed the Government's deep concern about the escalation in violence in Burundi and the further displacement of thousands of refugees.  I also outlined the continuing efforts of the EU, UN and OAU to mediate in the crisis and bring about a return to stable democratic government in Burundi.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government considers that all political parties and other forces should implement the terms of the Convention of Government which was agreed by the parties in Burundi on 10 September. The provisions of the Convention provide the institutional framework for national reconciliation in Burundi.  Both <Col N="570" /> the President and Prime Minister, who belong to the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups respectively, signed a joint declaration on 30 March.  In it they committed themselves to the priority objectives of peace, reconciliation and reconstruction to be implemented over a three-year period.  Ireland and the international community see the Convention process as the optimum internal solution based on consensus.</P>
    <P>In March 1994 the United Nations sent a fact-finding mission to Burundi to investigate the attempted coup and atrocities of October 1993 and the means of UN support for a return to civil peace.  A further Security Council Mission visited Burundi on 10-11 February this year.</P>
    <P>The February 1995 Mission recommended that an international Commission of Inquiry be established to investigate the 1993 coup and its after-math and that the UNHCHR deploy human rights monitors throughout the country.  It also called for the implementation of the Convention of Government by all parties and an increase in the OAU presence in Burundi.</P>
    <P>The question of a peacekeeping force did not form part of the recommendations of either Security Council mission.</P>
    <P>More recently, the United Nations Special Representative to Burundi, Mr. Abdallah, who has played on important role in sustaining dialogue between the conflicting parties, has publicly stated that he does not consider foreign intervention appropriate at this time.  He has underscored the fact that Burundi has a functioning President and Government. The President of Burundi expressed his opposition to foreign military intervention on similar grounds during his visit to Rome on 11 May.</P>
    <P>In its Declaration of 19 March at Carcassonne, the European Union has confirmed its determination to give strong backing to the process of the Convention of Government and is actively engaged in urging all political parties, military forces and sectors of civilian society to respect and implement it in a <Col N="571" /> spirit of dialogue, moderation and compromise.  In its Common Position of 24 March, the EU committed itself to assisting the Burundi Government in organising a national debate to consolidate national reconciliation and to reconstruct democracy.</P>
    <P>The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) has had a contingent of military and civilian observers deployed in Berundi for over a year and the Burundi authorities have recently agreed that its presence be increased.  The EU will support the OAU operation in accordance with its common position of 24 March which Ireland strongly supports.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 46 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have consistently stressed to the British Government the need to give careful consideration to the range of issues relating to prisoners in the context of the new situation created by the paramilitary ceasefires.  I am aware that for many prisoners in Britain, and their families, the provision for transfer to Northern Ireland is of particular importance. I have urged the British Government to ensure that the arrangement is <Col N="572" /> operated flexibly, and that as many as possible of those wishing to transfer are facilitated.  I understand that over the past year approximately one dozen prisoners have been moved to Northern Ireland, while in recent weeks a further group have been informed that their requests for transfers have been approved.</P>
    <P>As regards the particular prisoner to whom the Deputy refers, as soon as I became aware of the case I instructed the Embassy in London to make urgent contact with the relevant authorities about this matter.  I also asked the Embassy to arrange an early consular visit to the prisoner at Full Sutton.  This took place on 15 May.  I am informed that the authorities have taken steps to ensure that the prisoner is receiving necessary medical attention, including outside medical advice which had been requested on his behalf.  His condition is said to have improved, although it remains a matter of concern.  I am, therefore, keeping the case under very close review.  Meanwhile we have urged the British authorities to give favourable consideration to his request for a transfer to a prison nearer his family as soon as his condition allows.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>The clear evidence of a continuing repressive campaign by the Iraqi Government against the Marsh Arab people is a matter of grave concern.</P>
      <P>Iraq's treatment of the Marsh Arabs violates Security Council Resolution 688 of 5 April 1991 which called for an end to the repression of the Iraqi civilian population.  This resolution also insists that Iraq should co-operate with humanitarian organisations to ensure that the human and political rights of all Iraqi citizens are respected.</P>
      <P>The situation of the Marsh Arabs was addressed in the report on the situation of human rights in Iraq presented in February last to the UN Commission on Human Rights by its Special Rapporteur, Mr. Max van der Stoel.  The Special Rapporteur reports continuing destruction of the southern Marsh area of Iraq which has resulted in the destruction of economic resources including arable land through flooding by the Iraqi authorities and also the destruction of the habitat and traditional lifestyle of the Marsh Arab people.  The Special Rapporteur concludes that there is indisputable evidence of widespread destruction and human suffering which have resulted in massive displacement and the loss of a way of life for the Marsh Arab people.</P>
      <P>The Government support the Special Rapporteur's call for an immediate halting and reversal of the draining of the marshes by the Iraqi Government and the cessation of its military activities against the civilian population of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To this end, Ireland again co-sponsored a Resolution on the human rights situation in Iraq which was adopted at the recent session of the UN Commission on Human Rights.  This Resolution, <i>inter alia</i>, addressed the situation of the Marsh Arabs and urged the Government of Iraq to implement in <Col N="574" /> particular the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur which refer to the Marsh Arabs.</P>
    <P>As regards the provision of UN financial resources, the UN has operated a humanitarian assistance programme in Iraq since 1992 which concentrates on vulnerable groups in that country. Ireland recently decided to provide a grant of £100,000 for UNICEF programmes in Iraq in response to a consolidated UN inter-agency appeal for humanitarian assistance launched on 21 March.  However, I understand that the difficulty of access to the Marsh Arab areas has hampered the UN aid effort in Southern Iraq.</P>
    <P>In addition to UN humanitarian operations in Iraq the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees since 1994 has provided food and shelter for Marsh Arabs who have crossed into Iran.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 28, 30, 33, 34, 36 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with Ireland's Observer status in the Western European Union, I attended the six-monthly Western European Union Ministerial Council in Lisbon on 15 May 1995.  I was accompanied by my colleague, Deputy Seán Barrett, in his capacity at that time as Minister of State at the Department of Defence.  It will be recalled that Ireland took up Observer status in the Western European Union on the basis of the relationship established between the European Union and the Western European Union in the Maastricht Treaty.  Ireland has attended, as an observer, all ministerial meetings of the Western European Union since ratification of the Maastricht Treaty</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Western European Union Lisbon Ministerial meeting took place as preparations for the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference (EGC) are beginning to gather momentum.  The main items discussed at the Lisbon meeting were EU-WEU relations; the development of <Col N="576" /> Western European Union's operational capacity; and the Common Reflection on the new European security conditions. All these reflect both the ongoing development of the EU-WEU relationship and the Western European Union's preparation for its input into the discussions within the EU at the Intergovernmental Conference in 1996 on a possible common defence policy for the European Union.</P>
    <P>The meeting was also noteworthy in that Austria, Finland and Sweden, represented by their Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministers, were attending their first Western European Union Ministerial Council since becoming Western European Union Observers following their accession to the EU at the beginning of 1995.</P>
    <P>For the Government, the importance of the Lisbon meeting and similar meetings is that our attendance, in an Observer capacity, ensures that we are fully informed of developments in the Western European Union that may have a bearing on the options that will arise for Ireland and our EU partners in the security and defence context.  It is essential that we be fully informed of all the relevant factors, both to enable the Government to prepare their own position for the Intergovernmental Conference and to prepare for Ireland's role as Chairman of the Intergovernmental Conference in the second half of 1996.</P>
    <P>Among the other issues noted at the Lisbon meeting was the announcement by France, Spain and Italy of the creation of two joint military forces &mdash; a land force called EUROFOR, and a maritime force called EUROMARFOR. Portugal has announced that it is going to participate in both forces. The countries concerned have announced that these forces would be available upon request to both NATO and Western European Union and are open to participation by other Western European Union member states.  As Ireland is not a member of the Western European Union, the question of membership by Ireland in EUROFOR or EUROMARFOR does not arise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> With regard to the question about a proposed EU White Paper on security, I am not aware of such a proposal at this time.  I am aware that there is a French proposal for a Western European Union White Paper on European Security, which is under consideration in the Western European Union in conjunction with the ongoing work on a Common Reflection on the new European security conditions.  The Common Reflection is an important exercise, in that all 27 countries involved in the Western European Union, including members, Associate members, Observers, and the nine Associate partners from Central and Eastern Europe, are participating.  The purpose of the exercise is to review the evolving security situation in Europe, and on the basis of that review, to consider appropriate policies.</P>
    <P>In so far as the views of the Dáil parties are concerned I understand that the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs is now completing a report on these important matters for submission to the Government as part of the consultation process in advance of the Government's White Paper on Foreign Policy.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in his Robert Schuman lecture in UCC on 6 April, and I, in my speech at the White Paper seminar in UCD on 16 February, set out some of the options that may face Ireland in the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations on the question of the framing of a common defence policy for the EU.  Copies of both speeches are available in the Dáil Library.  At this stage, the Government's intention is to encourage and facilitate a full debate on the possible options which we may face. This process will be taken a stage further with the publication in the near future of the Government White Paper on Foreign Policy.</P>
    <P>Finally, in reply to Deputy Bertie Ahern, the Government has given a clear and unambiguous commitment in the <i>Programme for a Government of Renewal</i>&mdash; and I am happy to confirm that commitment to the Dáil again <Col N="578" /> today &mdash; that we will put the outcome of any future negotiations that would involve Ireland's participation in a common defence policy to the people in a referendum.  This will ensure that Ireland's policy of military neutrality remains unchanged, unless the people themselves decide otherwise.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>Since the outbreak of the Ebola epidemic my Department has been in contact with those Irish aid agencies which have emergency relief programmes in the refugee camps in Zaire.  There are at present 35 Irish aid personnel working in these camps which are located 1,400 kilometres to the North East of Kitwit where the Ebola outbreak has occurred.  The Ebola virus represents a new risk for the aid workers who already have to face health and security risks on a daily basis as they courageously carry out their essential humanitarian work.</P>
      <P>The aid agencies are monitoring the situation closely and at present have no plans to evacuate their aid staff from the camps in the Rwandan/Zairian border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is receiving regular briefings on the Ebola epidemic from the World Health Organisation in Geneva.  While there is no doubt that this is a deadly and frightening disease, the WHO assessment is that the Ebola <Col N="579" /> epidemic is not a general health emergency. Only those in direct contact with the virus are at risk of infection and air borne transmission of the virus is not effective.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, having regard to the assessment of the aid agencies themselves and of the World Health Organisation, the Government see no reason at present to call for an evacuation of Irish aid personnel who are engaged in essential humanitarian work.  However, the Department of Foreign Affairs is of the view that non-essential travel to Zaire should be avoided at present because of the fragile security situation in the country and the recent outbreak of the Ebola virus.  As a further precaution, the Departments of Health and Justice have agreed that travellers from Zaire should be required to produce a certificate of good health before visas of entry into Ireland are issued.</P>
    <P>Last week the WHO launched an appeal for US$250,000 for an emergency programme to contain the disease and to treat victims.  The Government has allocated US$30,000 to the WHO appeal and the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) has allocated a grant of 250,000 ECU for a three month emergency programme.</P>
    <P>The Ebola epidemic serves to remind us of the acute health problems facing many countries in Africa.  Children are especially vulnerable and there is an ongoing need for funding to meet health needs and to carry out research for new, effective vaccines.  Primary health care programmes are a key element of Irish funded development programmes in the priority countries in Africa and I intend to place emphasis on this vital work in the context of the expanding programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 37 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that about 85,000 people from Southern Bhutan have left the area and are how housed in refugee camps in Nepal, which are being serviced by the UN High Commission for Refugees.</P>
      <P>Ireland has raised the problem of the southern Bhutanese refugees with partners in the European Union.  We also took up the issue last month during the annual meeting between senior officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Indian Ministry of External Affairs.</P>
      <P>Talks are in progress between the Governments of Bhutan and Nepal but to date it has not been possible for them to reach agreement on the return of refugees.  The Nepal-Bhutanese Joint Ministerial Committee has held two rounds of talks since the beginning of this year, from 27 February to 2 March and from 17 to 20 April.  Since then there has been a meeting at the highest level.  The King of Bhutan and the Prime Minister of Nepal met in New Delhi on 3 May and discussed the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> Since 1992, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has managed an emergency relief programme for refugees and asylum seekers who have come from Bhutan to the camps in Nepal.  In 1994, 1.5 million ECUs was provided by the European Union to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees for their relief programme in the refugee camps. Irish Government funding has been made available, via the Agency for Personal Service Overseas, to assist five Irish aid workers who are working with the UNHCR to provide primary education to the large number of refugee children in the camps.  The UNHCR intends to expand its relief assistance to the refugees and is working to find more permanent solutions to the problems of shelter and sanitation in the camps.  The Government will sympathetically consider contributing to the UNHCR's relief programme for refugees.</P>
    <P>At Ireland's request, the European Union is closely following the refugees' situation and the continuing talks between the two Governments.</P>

      <Quest>the number of official receptions hosted since the change of Government on 15 December 1994; the number planned for the remainder of 1995; the events or meetings these receptions mark; and the number and purpose of such receptions during 1994.</Quest>

      <P>I and the Ministers of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs have hosted a total of 41 official receptions and other functions such as lunches since 15 December 1994. Counting on a similar basis, there were some 73 official receptions and other functions in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment there are plans for the Ministers of State and myself to host 7 official functions during the remainder <Col N="582" /> of 1995.  The actual number will probably be greater than this in the event since there are likely to be a substantially greater number of official visits between now and the end of the year than we can foresee at present.</P>
    <P>Since the details of the individual functions are voluminous I propose to circulate them in tabular form in the Official Report.</P>

      <P>The lastest storms in the Bay of Bengal, which began on May 15, have caused loss of life and severe flood damage along the southern coastline of Bangladesh.  According to reports received by my Department, it is estimated that some 10 people have died and over 40,000 people have been affected by the recent storms.  Many of the deaths were apparently caused by contaminated water and inadequate sanitary conditions following the heavy rainfall.</P>
      <P>The Government of Bangladesh are co-ordinating the damage assessment and the relief operation following the latest storms.  To date they have not declared an emergency situation and have not requested any international assistance.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has not received appeals from Irish or international aid agencies.  If an appeal for assistance is received, it will be considered sympathetically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="593" /> Bangladesh is one of the countries in the world most prone to natural disasters. Since 1991 the Department of Foreign Affairs has allocated over £425,000 to Irish and international relief for emergency and rehabilitation projects to assist flood victims in Bangladesh.  In addition, my Department is at present evaluating a proposal by Concern to co-fund a five year poverty alleviation programme which would focus on the needs of women living in slums in Bangladesh's main cities.</P>

      <P>There are no negotiations taking place over the ownership of Rockall, nor are there negotiations planned.</P>
      <P>Following a temporary landing on the rock in 1955, the United Kingdom laid claim to Rockall by occupation.  By Act of Parliament in 1972 it declared Rockall to be part of Scotland.  Ireland did not recognise this claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> In the early 1970s there was a possibility that the UN Conference on the Law of the Sea which was then working to agree on a new legal regime for the oceans, might decide that even islands such as Rockall &mdash; that is to say, barren, uninhabitable rocks &mdash; should be allowed their own continental shelves and 200 miles exclusive economic zones. One of the principal Irish objectives at the Conference was to ensure that this would not be the case.</P>
    <P>In the event, that objective was achieved.  Under the Law of the Sea Convention which resulted from the Conference, sovereignty over an uninhabitable rock such as Rockall does not give rise to a right either to a continental shelf or to a 200 mile exclusive economic zone although it does create a right to a 12 mile territorial sea around it.</P>
    <P>In the case of Rockall, as I have said, Ireland did not recognise the British claim to sovereignty, deriving from the temporary landing of an individual on the rock in 1955, which would be the basis for a claim to a 12 mile territorial sea.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that it would be useful to ask an independent arbitrator to resolve this issue.</P>

      <P>The range of issues relating to prisoners is of central importance in the development of the peace process, and in light of the clearly reduced risk of reoffence in the new situation brought about by the ceasefires. I have devoted particular attention to these matters including the question of release and prison conditions in the <Col N="596" /> discussions which I have had with the Secretary of State in the framework of the Anglo-Irish Conference.  The Taoiseach also raised the issues in his recent discussions with Prime Minister Major in Moscow.  In addition, both the Taoiseach and I have availed of recent visits to London to brief the British Opposition parties fully on our concerns.</P>
      <P>There are a number of areas where I see scope for rapid progress towards early and orderly releases from prisons in Northern Ireland: an increased rate of remission for long term determinate sentence paramilitary prisoners is one obvious step which would, I believe, have an immediate and positive effect. The rate of remission for such prisoners convicted since 1989 is currently 33 per cent.  It was reduced from 50 per cent in 1989.  I see an urgent case for a reversion at least to the <i>status quo ante.</i>  Another area where I would hope to see movement is in the review arrangements for life sentence prisoners.</P>
      <P>I attach importance also to greater flexibility in the Summer Home Leave parole scheme which applies to long term prisoners in Northern Ireland. Equally, I have argued for a more flexible approach to compassionate parole arrangements, which govern visits by prisoners to ill or dying relatives.</P>

    <P>In general, I have long been concerned about legislative restrictions on freedom of expression in Turkey and I have availed of all appropriate opportunities to make my views on the issue known to the Turkish authorities.

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a keen awareness among the international community of the importance of reform in the United Nations if it is to succeed in achieving its fundamental Charter objectives &mdash; to maintain international peace and security, to protect human rights, to uphold international law and to promote socio-economic development. This is particularly true given the new challenges of the post-Cold War world and the growing regional tensions to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>The UN's fiftieth anniversary which we are celebrating this year has added impetus to the reform debate.  However, any substantial reform of UN structures will require widespread support from member states, of whom there are now 185.  It is therefore inevitable that securing agreement on reform across a broad range of issues will take some time.</P>
      <P>The Government is contributing very actively in co-operation with our European Union partners to the current reform debate in the General Assembly and its Working Groups.  I propose to set out briefly recent initiatives which the Government has undertaken on a number of the most important issues relating to United Nations reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reform of the Security Council is crucial in ensuring the effectiveness of the <Col N="599" /> United Nations.  Ireland is an active participant in the General Assembly Working Group examining this issue, and we are also co-operating on the issue with like-minded smaller member states.  We support a balanced enlargement of the Council which would include a modest expansion in its membership.  Such an enlargement should improve the Council's representative character, transparency and effectiveness.  We are also concerned to address the current under-representation of developing countries and to retain the opportunity for smaller states to serve on the Council periodically.</P>
    <P>In the field of preventive diplomacy, I have called for the creation of a UN Mediation Body to which the Security Council or the General Assembly could refer difficult issues.  If properly resourced I believe that this body could act very effectively to resolve disputes before they lead to serious conflict. Ireland has also been prominent in supporting the creation of a permanent International Criminal Court to deal with serious violations of international humanitarian law.  We have in addition called for the expansion of human rights monitoring activities.</P>
    <P>Ireland is also participating in the General Assembly Working Group established last December to examine the UN's difficult financial situation, a situation which clearly poses a fundamental threat to the Organisation's activities.  The Taoiseach and I have raised the issue of the proposed unilateral reduction in US contributions to UN Peacekeeping in the course of recent meetings with President Clinton and Secretary of State Christopher. Ireland is also co-operating closely in this area with our European partners; it is worth noting in this context that the member states of the European Union contribute 34.4 per cent of the UN's Regular Budget and 36.8 per cent of Peacekeeping costs.</P>
    <P>Ireland is continuing to contribute to discussions on the Secretary-General's Agenda for Peace and his Agenda for <Col N="600" /> Development.  We have suggested an increased role for the Economic and Social Council in reporting to the Security Council on socio-economic conditions which could pose a threat to international peace and security.</P>
    <P>As a member state which contributes a significant number of Military and Garda personnel to UN Peacekeeping Operations, Ireland welcomed the introduction last November of improved mechanisms for consultation between the Security Council and Troop-Contributing States.  I believe that further improvements are possible in this area and we will continue to work with other Troop Contributors to this end.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the bank envisaged by Mr. Hevesi would be to supply capital, either in the form of low interest loans or as equity, to small and medium enterprises in both parts of Ireland, with special emphasis in this jurisdiction on the six Border counties.  The proposal envisages that the bank would have four major constituent members &mdash; the Irish <Col N="601" /> and British Governments, the European Commission and the United States Government.  The constituent members would be represented on the board of directors.  Capital resources would be obtained by the sale of peace bonds in the United States and on international markets to institutions and individuals.</P>
    <P>The proposal outlined by Mr. Hevesi is being examined by the Government. Once this examination process has been completed, we look forward to entering into more detailed discussion with Mr. Hevesi about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49, 51, 53, 55 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is gravely concerned at the report that the People's Republic of China carried out a nuclear test explosion on 15 May.  This concern was expressed in the press statement which I issued on the following day.  On instructions, the Irish representative at the United Nations Disarmament Commission, which is currently in session in New York, made a similar statement.</P>
      <P>The Chinese authorities are aware of the Irish Government's concerns about Chinese nuclear tests.  I raised this matter with the Chinese Government during my official visit to China last Autumn. In my statement of 18 April to the NPT Review and Extension Conference, I called on China to join the other nuclear weapon States in implementing a unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing.</P>
      <P>It is particularly discouraging that China should have conducted a nuclear test at this time.  As recently as 11 May, the NPT Review and Extension Conference agreed that, pending the entry into force of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the utmost restraint should be exercised in the area of nuclear testing. Ireland has pointed out that China's action is not in keeping with the spirit of this agreement or with the principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament which accompanied the decision to extend the NPT indefinitely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to emphasise once again, as I did at the NPT Conference and in my statement on the reported Chinese test, <Col N="603" /> the great importance of securing a successful conclusion of the negotiations for a comprehensive test ban, no later than 1996.  I also reiterate my hope that, in the meantime, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States will maintain their current unilateral ban on nuclear testing and I call on China to join them.</P>
    <P>The approach of the Government to the NPT was set out in a Resolution adopted by Dáil Éireann on 22 March and in my statement at the beginning of the NPT Conference on 18 April.</P>
    <P>I am happy to report that the results of the NPT Review and Extension Conference correspond closely with Ireland's objectives.  On 11 May, the states party to the NPT agreed that the Treaty shall continue in force indefinitely; that the process for review of implementation of the Treaty shall be strengthened; and a set of principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.  The decision to extend indefinitely the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is in full accord with a major objective of the Irish Government for the conference, and it secures the future of the international non-proliferation regime.</P>
    <P>The Irish delegation was active, during the conference, in urging the adoption of enhanced review procedures. The conference confirmed that review conferences should continue to be held every five years and decided that the next should take place in the year 2000. In addition, meetings to prepare the review conferences will be held in three out of four of the intervening years of the cycle.  It was also decided that review conferences should both evaluate the results of the review period and look forward, identifying the areas in which, and the means through which, further progress might be sought.</P>
    <P>The set of principles for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament adopted by the conference corresponds well with the objectives of Irish policy.  It states that the undertakings with regard to nuclear disarmament set out in the <Col N="604" /> Treaty should be fulfilled with determination, and identifies three specific measures as constituting a programme of action for the full realization and effective implementation of Article VI of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>These measures are completion, no later than 1996, of a universal, and internationally and effectively verifiable, Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; immediate commencement, and early conclusion, of negotiations for a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices and the determined pursuit by the nuclear weapon states of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally, with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons.</P>
    <P>It is most significant that all parties to the NPT reaffirmed their commitment, for all time, to prevent nuclear proliferation and to work on a programme of action for nuclear disarmament with the ultimate goal of a world free of nuclear weapons.  With the Treaty extended indefinitely, there is a corresponding continuing obligation on all states, particularly the nuclear weapon states, to pursue nuclear disarmament and they will have to answer for this at each future five year review.  It is my sincere hope and expectation that the set of principles and objectives adopted by the conference will consolidate progress to date and promote accelerated progress in nuclear disarmament</P>
    <P>Of the 178 states party to the Treaty, 175 participated in the Review and Extension Conference.  Only 12 countries now remain outside the international nuclear non-proliferation norm, the cornerstone of which is the NPT and this number is shrinking.  This brings us close to achieving universal adherence to the Treaty, which Ireland has always advocated.</P>
    <P>The agreements reached in New York which I have just outlined correspond with the elements of the joint action <Col N="605" /> agreed by the European Union and constitute a most significant and comprehensive advance on the Dublin Declaration of 1990.</P>

      <P>The situation in Chechnya continues to be a matter of grave concern.  The order preclaiming a &ldquo;moratorium&rdquo; on Russian military activities in Chechnya from 27 April to 12 May, over the period of the World War II ceremonies in Moscow, has now lapsed.  Earlier this month heavy fighting broke out again in and around the capital Grozny.  More recently, there are reports that concentrated mortar and artillery bombardment of the mountainous southern region of the Republic is taking place.</P>
      <P>As he reported to the Dáil on 16 May, the Taoiseach expressed the Government's grave concern about the continuing conflict in Chechnya to Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev in Moscow on 9 May.  The Taoiseach urged an end to the fighting in the region without further delay and the opening of constructive negotiations towards a political solution, with the active assistance of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).  Subsequently, our Ambassador to the OSCE raised the question of the continuing hostilities in Chechnya and the appalling consequences for the civilian population with the head of the Russian OSCE delegation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An OSCE assistance group was deployed in Grozny in late April.  It is working constructively on the ground to promote respect for human rights and <Col N="606" /> the development of democratic institutions; to facilitate the return of refugees and the distribution of humanitarian aid and to encourage a lasting ceasefire and peaceful resolution of the conflict.  Ireland considers that Russia's co-operation with the deployment in Grozny of the OSCE assistance group was an important development.</P>
    <P>Ireland also welcomes the agreement which has been reached between the Chechen separatist leader, General Dudayev, and the Russian authorities to hold talks aimed at halting the fighting in Chechnya.  It is understood that the talks will be held on Thursday, 25 May under the auspices of the OSCE.  A constructive effort is now required by both sides to put an end to the fighting, to open serious negotiations for a political solution and to improve access for the local population to humanitarian aid.  The Government will continue to work actively towards these objectives, both bilaterally and in co-operation with our EU partners, as well as within the framework of the OSCE.</P>

      <P>The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) is an informal arrangement of nuclear supplier countries whose objective is to ensure that civilian nuclear trade does not contribute directly or indirectly to the proliferation of nuclear weapons.  Issues of nuclear safety are not dealt with in the NSG.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NSG functions as a nuclear export control regime.  It has elaborated guidelines to which its members adhere in applying export controls at the national level to transfers of nuclear <Col N="607" /> items and nuclear-related dual use equipment, material and technology.  In this way, NSG members give effect to the non-proliferation commitments enshrined in Articles I, II and III of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).</P>
    <P>The Nuclear Suppliers Group includes, in addition to all the major suppliers of nuclear technology, several members which, like Ireland, have no nuclear industry themselves but which take very seriously their responsibility to avoid contributing indirectly to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Applying the NSG guidelines is an effective way of discharging that responsibility.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the commitment in the <i>Programme for a Government of Renewal</i>, the Government is determined to ensure that Irish public concern about the safety aspects of the Sellafield THORP plant is raised in all appropriate fora and using all suitable occasions. I wish to assure the Deputy that the officials of my Department are fully aware of the strength of the Government's commitment on this issue and that they will use all opportunities, formal and informal, to raise it internationally.</P>

      <P>Ireland's expenditure on Official Development Assistance amounted to £70 million in 1994, which was equivalent to 0.23 per cent of GNP (provisional figure).  Expenditure in 1995 is expected to amount to £89 million which would be equivalent to 0.27 per cent of forecast GNP.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="608" /> In 1994, 70 per cent of ODA came from the Vote for International Co-operation. The rest was made up of expenditure from central funds and from Votes of other Departments.  Of the total expenditure of £70 million, £31.4 million went to multilateral assistance and £37.3 million to bilateral assistance.</P>
    <P>Full details of expenditure on Official Development Assistance including details of individual projects are set out in the Annual Report on the Aid Programme which is published by my Department.

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken a number of steps which I am confident will help to avoid the delays experienced by passport applicants in recent years.  To put the situation in context, I would point out that within the past few years there has been a huge volume increase in passport applications, a total of 213,000 in 1994, representing a 32 per cent increase on 1991.  Demand so far this year is 4 per cent ahead of last year. Measures taken to respond to this increased demand include a reduced fee for low-season applications, staff increases, upgrading of computer and telephone systems, and the addition of a new waiting area in the Dublin office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To further improve the service to the public I launched passport express jointly with An Post on 14 March 1995. This new service is aimed at making passports available more quickly and conveniently through the extensive post office network.  Passport application <Col N="609" /> forms and special passport express envelopes are now stocked at participating post offices, of which there are over three hundred at present, and a fee of £3 is charged by An Post to cover postal and administrative costs.  The service is based on next day delivery and a commitment that a passport will be returned within ten working days when the application is properly completed.  I am very happy about the positive response to passport express.</P>
    <P>With the busy season now well under way, the numbers calling to the public office in Molesworth Street have fallen off significantly.  Applicants who have found it necessary to transact their business in person have not experienced any delays or inordinate queuing.  I attribute this largely to the success of passport express which is now accounting for almost 60 per cent of all applications received.  It is clear that applicants have been attracted by the local nature of the service and the fact that the commitment to having passports issued within ten working days, where the application has been properly completed, is being met.  I believe that this new service to the public, together with the other measures already mentioned, should ensure that undue delays and lengthy queuing at the Passport Office do not recur.</P>
    <P>I intend that the Passport Office will continue to give the best possible service to the public.  The next development is the upgrading of the Passport Office in Cork to a full issuing office. Work on this is currently under way and the office will soon be ready to provide a full passport service for the people of Munster.</P>

      <P>The Common Foreign and Security Policy provisions of the Maastricht Treaty, provide for the EU to &ldquo;request the Western European Union, which is an integral part of the Union, to elaborate and implement decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications &ldquo;, Article J. 4.  In this context, the Western European Union has committed itself to develop its operational capacity so that it could respond to such requests from the EU.</P>
      <P>In its Petersberg Declaration of June 1992, the Western European Union decided that it should develop its operational capacity, particularly with a view to humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and crisis management &mdash; what have become known as the &ldquo;Petersberg tasks&rdquo;.  It is generally accepted that, in the new security situation in Europe, the Petersberg tasks would usually be conducted at the request of the UN, the OSCE, or the EU, in accordance with Title V of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
      <P>Since the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty one such request has been made by the EU to the Western European Union, namely to provide the police element for the EU's Administration of Mostar.  Members of the Western European Union are providing police contingents for the Mostar operation. Recently, Austria, Finland and Sweden as Western European Union observers, announced their intention of providing police for the operation, and they have expressed their general interest in involvement in Western European Union Petersberg tasks, based on their long UN peacekeeping and humanitarian experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question for Ireland is whether we too might consider participation in such humanitarian and peacekeeping <Col N="611" /> tasks in a way that would be consistent with the priority that Ireland attaches to peacekeeping and humanitarian involvement in the UN context, and that draws on our experience in this area. The question is under consideration at the moment and I anticipate that it will be taken up in the forthcoming White Paper on foreign policy.</P>

      <P>I would like to express my congratulations to President Chirac on his election as President of <Col N="613" /> France and to my colleague, Mr. Alain Juppé, on his recent appointment as Prime Minister.  I look forward to fruitful co-operation between our two Governments on the many challenging issues which will face us over the coming years.  I expect that as with any change of Gvoernment, there will, of course, be issues which the new Government will approach differently to the previous administration but I would not wish to speculate on such matters until the programme and policy of the new Government is clear.  Ireland and France have many areas of common interest and we will seek to build on the existing good relationship in our historical relations and in working together in the European Union, in particular in preparation for our Presidency of the Council and of the Inter-Governmental Conference in 1996.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the 1994 Finance Act provides for a substantial relief from stamp duty on the transfer of agricultural land buildings to young farmers who meet certain training requirements. To be eligible for this relief, the transferee must have acquired a Teagasc certificate in farming or an equivalent educational qualification; or, if born before <Col N="616" /> 1 January 1968, have three years' experience in farming together with satisfactory completion of Teagasc farm management training courses of not less than 180 hours' duration.</P>
      <P>The training conditions are important to ensure that the relief is focused on transfers to suitably skilled farmers with a commitment to the practice of farming. Accordingly, there are no provisions whereby a person who does not meet either of the conditions outlined above may benefit from the stamp duty relief.</P>

These reliefs are designed to benefit permanently disabled persons with severe mobility restrictions who satisfy one or more of the specific medical criteria laid down in the regulations and who have their vehicles suitably constructed or adapted for driver or passenger use, as appropriate. Medical certification is undertaken by the local health board or, on appeal, by a special board of appeal.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, which was established in December 1993, is currently examining how people with disabilities could participate more fully in the economic, cultural and social life of the community. The commission is assessing existing services for people with disability, including income support and will recommend initiatives in legislation, policy and organisation so that the needs of people with a disability are met in a more comprehensive way.  It is not my intention to revise the mobility allowance pending the publication of the commission's report.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): My Department is responsible for a number of schemes to assist people with disabilities which are administered by the health boards and the National Rehabilitation Board, or NRB, as follows.</P>
      <P>The disabled person's maintenance allowance (DPMA) is paid by health boards to disabled people who, because of a disability, are unable to work; the recipients would include disabled people in training centres and workshops. The current rate of this allowance is £61 per week and the total expenditure on this scheme in 1994 was £95,918,050.</P>
      <P>The disabled person's rehabilitation allowance (DPRA) is paid by health boards to disabled people undergoing training and who, by virtue of their training, are required to live away from home.  The current rate of this allowance is £74.50 per week and the total expenditure on this scheme in 1994 was £6,583,568.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The infectious diseases maintenance allowances (IDMA) are paid by health boards under section 44 of the Health <Col N="625" /> Act, 1947 to a person who is unable to make reasonable and proper provision for his-her own maintenance or the maintenance of his-her dependants because he-she is undergoing treatment for one of the infectious diseases specified in the IDMA regulations.  The current rate of this allowance is £61 per week and the total expenditure on this scheme in 1994 was £113,155.</P>
    <P>The domiciliary care allowance (DCA) is paid by health boards to parents of children with disabilities who require constant care and attention.  The current rate of this allowance is £95.30 per month and the total expenditure on this scheme in 1994 was £9,269,984.</P>
    <P>The mobility allowance is paid by health boards to persons with a disability who are unable to walk.  The current rate of this allowance is £37.10 per month and the total expenditure on this scheme in 1994 was £967,679.</P>
    <P>The blind welfare allowance is paid by health boards to blind people in addition to the blind pension which is paid by the Department of Social Welfare. The current rate for this allowance is £19.60 per week and the total expenditure in 1994 was £1,202,446.</P>
    <P>The Motorised Transport Grant is paid by health boards to assist people with a disability with the purchase of a car.  The maximum grant payable is £2,575 and the total expenditure under this scheme in 1994 was £115,760.</P>
    <P>There is ESF Funded Training for People with Disabilities.  The National Rehabilitation Board, which is an executive agency of my Department, administers the European Social Fund (ESF) training budget on behalf of my Department.  A total of 3,504 wholetime equivalent training places for people with disabilities were funded in 1994 at a total cost of £49.803 million of which £28.466 million was from ESF.</P>
    <P>The European Regional Development Fund Capital Development Programme is part of the 1994-1999 human resources operational programme under the EU Structural Funds which provides for a total capital allocation of £33.58 million for vocational training centres <Col N="626" /> for the period 1994-1999.  European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) funding assistance of £18.2 million is being provided under the OP with the balance being provided by the Exchequer.  Funding of £4.2 million has been allocated to training agencies in 1995 under this programme.</P>
    <P>Under the employment support scheme, which is administered by the NRB, employers receive a subsidy to compensate for the loss of productivity of the employee with a disability.  The total expenditure on this scheme in 1994 was £584,000.</P>
    <P>The pilot programme for the employment of people with disabilities is administered by the NRB and provides employment opportunities for people with disabilities in viable business enterprises.  The programme is to run from 1994 to 1996 with funding of £1.2 million, £2 million and £2 million being provided for each year respectively.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Cluain Mhuire, St. John of God's provides a community-based mental health service located in the south-east of Dublin-Dún Laoghaire on an agency basis for the Eastern Health Board which is responsible for the provision of psychiatric services in the area. The service is supported by the purchase of acute in-patient beds in St. John of God's Hospital, Stillorgan, which is a private psychiatric hospital. The budget for the Cluain Mhuire service in the current year is approximately £4.7 million which on a <i>per capita</i> basis <Col N="628" /> compares favourably with other psychiatric services in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
      <P>I am aware that in the first quarter of 1995 there was an increase in admissions to the hospital from the Cluain Mhuire service.  However, discussions have taken place between the Order and the Eastern Health Board and I understand that admissions have since declined.</P>

      <P>The Grand Canal corridor study identified a strategy and proposals for the development of the canal corridor from the Grand Canal Dock to the Lucan Road Bridge. The study did not include a cost-benefit analysis and therefore the details requested by the Deputy are not available. Implementation of the strategy and proposals contained in the report will involve State, local authority, community and private sector input.  The costs arising will depend on the type of development actually undertaken. Based on the experience in other countries, the benefits arising from a successful development of the canal corridor will include the integration of the canal into the local environment and community as part of our living heritage while developing the corridor through mixed development &mdash; residential, leisure and business uses &mdash; carefully planned side by side, all taking advantage of a waterside setting, and with substantial job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report did recommend the establishment of a task force, to be co-ordinated by my Department, and which would include representatives of the public sector agencies involved in the canal corridor.  I am delighted to advise the Deputy that in January of this year, I established the Grand Canal corridor task force under the chairmanship of Senator Pat Magner.  The role of this task force is to co-ordinate and monitor the activities of the various agencies responsible for the development of the corridor, and to provide the necessary <Col N="630" /> impetus for the implementation of the strategy and proposals.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will recall that I assured her in my reply that I appreciate the fact that arts, culture and heritage can provide a way in which to help integrate, in a non-discriminatory way, people with disabilities into the wider community and that my own Department and the bodies under its aegis remain committed to assisting in this regard in any way possible.</P>
      <P>One example of this commitment which I referred to is contained in the three year arts plan of An Chomhairle Ealaíon, where one of the strategic objectives aims to encourage real participation in the arts in terms of availability and access to, <i>inter alia</i>, people with disabilities.  While An Chomhairle has been operating a small number of schemes specifically aimed at people with disabilities and expects to spend some £45,000 on such projects in the current year, the arts plan proposes the carrying out over two years of a joint action research project, involving people with disabilities, with the National Rehabilitation Board to establish means to enable people with disabilities to participate in the arts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further example of developments in hand, which I also referred to in my <Col N="631" /> reply of 4 May, is the provision of fishing facilities on the Grand Canal at Ballyteigue to include fishing for people with disabilities, integrated into the general facility, with similar facilities planned for other waterways.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the cases made for designation of many towns throughout the country, including Tuam, under the urban renewal scheme.  However, to be effective, the scheme must be limited in its application and I do not intend to extend it to any further towns.  In these circumstances, the question of a visit to Tuam in connection with the scheme does not arise.</P>

      <P>The cost of designing and printing 15,000 copies of each of the seven information leaflets on the electoral system amounted to £15,639, or approximately £1 per set of seven leaflets. The leaflets were written by Departmental staff as part of their day to day work.  No separate costings are available for this.  Copies of the leaflets have been circulated to a wide range of persons and organisations, including Deputies, Senators and local councillors, and all second and third level schools and colleges.  Further copies can be obtained on request from my Department.</P>

      <P>Neither I nor the Minister for the Environment have received such correspondence. However, I understand that in response to a telephone inquiry some information on the urban and village renewal sub-programme of the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development was sent by my Department to an individual inquiring on behalf of Chapelizod.  Under this sub-programme, grants will be made available for improvement works in urban areas throughout the country.  In the case of the county boroughs, grants are available only in respect of a single major initiative in an area selected by <Col N="639" /> the local authority.

      <P>Under the disabled persons grant scheme, administered by county councils and county borough corporations, assistance is provided for the adaptation or extension of, or provision of additional facilities in existing houses specifically to meet the needs of disabled persons.  My Department recoups <Col N="640" /> 50 per cent of the costs, up to a maximum of £4,000, incurred by local authorities in the payment of individual grants.  A provision of £3.1 million is included for this purpose in my Department's Estimates for 1995.</P>
      <P>The access for persons with disabilities grants scheme, administered by county councils and county borough corporations, is a once-off scheme aimed at improving access for people with disabilities, especially those in wheelchairs, to public parks and other outdoor recreational amenities which lack such access at present.  The maximum allowable grant under the scheme is £10,000 in any individual case and a provision of £500,000 has been made for it in the 1995 Estimates.</P>
      <P>Expenditure is incurred by local authorities from their housing capital allocations on the provision of accommodation for disabled persons, but details of the precise amounts involved are not available in my Department.  However, returns submitted by local authorities indicate that a total of 30 houses were constructed or acquired by them for disabled persons in 1994.  The total number of disabled persons' dwellings in the local authority housing stock, at 31 December 1994 was 2,689, and a further 39 were at construction stage at that date.</P>
      <P>Under the grant scheme for traffic management measures in the area covered by the Dublin Transportation Initiative, funding can be provided for the implementation of projects designed to improve facilities for people with disabilities. In 1994, grants totalling almost £300,000 were allocated to the local authorities in the area for improved pedestrian facilities &mdash; including dished footpaths and special facilities for visually impaired people.</P>

    <P>* Data refer to leavers without an intermediate or day vocational certificate.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that approximately 6 per cent of the age cohort leave school without a junior certificate.</P>
    <P>My Department has a range of measures in place to help prevent early <Col N="649" /> school leaving including; early intervention measures to provide additional support for young people at risk including initiatives in areas such as pre-schooling, remedial and home-school-community links, co-ordination with other agencies, guidance and psychological services, special services for travellers and Youth Encounter Projects; curricular reform to adapt second level curricular to the needs of a wider spread of ability levels and backgrounds; second chance education and training through the provision of Youthreach for unqualified early school leavers; and improved quality of education through investment in in-career development of staff, including school management, and strategies to cope with learning difficulties and disadvantage, counselling skills etc.</P>
    <P>In keeping with its commitment to address the problems of truancy and early drop-out, the Government has appointed Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Currie, with special responsibility for this area.  The Minister of State has established a task force to address these and other related issues.</P>

      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have attached particular priority to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those with hearing impairment, are adequately catered for.  In the case of children with hearing impairment, I have implemented a range of measures to improve educational services. The measures in question include: the introduction of a very substantial increase in the special capitation rates payable to pupils attending special schools and classes; the introduction of a one unit improvement in the pupil teacher ratio for special schools and classes from September next; the upgrading of specialist equipment required in special schools and classes; the introduction of a scheme for the provision of escorts and safety harnesses on certain school transport services to assist pupils with special needs in this area.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the measures I outlined will contribute to a significant improvement in the level of service available to the children in question.  I will also be keeping the question of further measures in this area under ongoing review in the context of the recommendations of the Special Education Review Committee.</P>

      <P>Following an investigation by an Assistant Chief Inspector in my Department into serious allegations made by parents and pupils <Col N="654" /> in St. Mary's national school, Ardara, County Donegal, I set up the inquiry referred to by the Deputy.  There is no legislation providing for statutory sworn inquiries in the case of primary schools. The capacity of the Ardara inquiry to investigate the allegations depended, therefore, on the willingness of all parties concerned to co-operate with its proceedings.  To this extent, the inquiry was constituted along similar lines to the Kilkenny incest inquiry which carried out its investigation effectively and reported speedily.  Unfortunately, the parents and pupils who made allegations in this case were not willing to co-operate with the inquiry as constituted. Accordingly, my legal advice was that the inquiry could not proceed as there would be no allegations to investigate. Reluctantly, therefore, I had to end the inquiry.  The question of the fitness to teach in respect of a teacher is primarily a matter for the board of management and patron of the school concerned, as his employers.  Any action now to be taken in respect of the teacher in this case is, therefore, a matter for the board of management and the patron.  The matters of concern at St. Mary's national school in Ardara are currently before the board of management of the school.  I understand that the board meeting convened on 18 May to consider the issues, was adjourned until 1 June next.  In the interim I do not believe it is appropriate for me to comment further.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the issues referred to by the Deputy.  The Deputy will be aware from the content of the recently published White Paper of my intention to ensure the integrity of the school year in order to maximise the tuition time available to students.  At present my Department pays for substitution to cover the absences of teachers who are employed as oral examiners. With a view to minimising any disruption of either tuition time or school management, my Department is also engaged in a review of all the options available in the scheduling of the oral and practical tests for the certificate examinations in consultation with the other interested parties.  In autumn 1994 an implementation group representative of the teacher unions, the managerial bodies, the National Parents Council (Postprimary), the NCCA and my Department considered this matter in the course of considering the arrangements needed for the introduction, in 1995, of the new leaving certificate syllabuses. For 1995, the group recommended that the oral tests, together with the leaving certificate music practical and the new junior certificate practical examinations in home economics and music, should be conducted in the 2-week period immediately prior to Easter.  This has been put into effect and has been generally welcomed.</P>
      <P>It is also planned in 1996 to have project work in engineering, construction studies, agricultural science and agricultural economics examined in June, in parallel with the written examinations. In 1995 and earlier years this work was examined in the March-May period. The feasibility of holding the oral examinations outside normal class time will form part of the continuing review.</P>

It also introduces a formal appeal system.  Circular S.14/95, issued to schools on 31 January 1995, outlines further details of the appeal arrangements.  Additional copies of these circulars were sent to schools for the information of parents and teachers.

      <P>The terms of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress provided for a six-year cycle of post-primary education, which has made available a three-year senior cycle for pupils entering the senior cycle from September 1994.  The senior cycle is being restructured to provide the option of a transition year programme and a two year leaving certificate with three orientations &mdash; the established leaving certificate programme; a revised and expanded leaving certificate vocational programme; and a new leaving certificate applies to be introduced, on a pilot basis, in September 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aims of the senior cycle, as structured, are to encourage and facilitate <Col N="657" /> students to continue in full-time education during the post-compulsory period by providing a stimulating range of programmes suited to their abilities, aptitudes and interests.  The objectives are to develop each student's potential to the full, and equip them for work or further education.</P>
    <P>Pupils following the established leaving certificate programme must take at least five subjects, including Irish.</P>
    <P>The subject syllabuses of this programme are being revised at present to give them a greater vocational orientation. The revision is taking place on a phased basis.  In phase 1, it is proposed that revised syllabuses, at higher and ordinary levels, for Irish, French, German, Spanish, Italian and accounting, and a new syllabus for mathematics &mdash; foundation level, will be introduced in September 1995 for examination in 1997 and after.  The other leaving certificate subjects will be revised in future phases.</P>
    <P>The leaving certificate vocational programme (LCVP) is the normal leaving certificate programme with a concentration on technical subjects and some additions.  Because of its high vocational content, it attracts funding from the European Social Fund.  It was first introduced in 1989.  In 1994, it was expanded to broaden the choice of subjects and to strengthen the vocational content of the programme by including three link modules on enterprise education, preparation for work and work experience.</P>
    <P>Pupils following the leaving certificate vocational programme in its redesigned form take: five leaving certificate subjects, including Irish and including two subjects to be chosen from a set of vocational subjects; a recognised course in a modern European language; the three mandatory link modules.</P>
    <P>The leaving certificate applied, which it is proposed to introduce in September 1995 will be a self-contained two year programme replacing and expanding on the existing senior certificate and <Col N="658" /> vocational preparation and training programme. It is a person-centred programme involving a cross-curricular approach rather than a subject-based structure.  It has as its primary objective the preparation of participants for adult and working life through relevant learning experiences which develop the following areas of human endeavour; spiritual, intellectual, social, emotional, aesthetic and physical.  The framework of the leaving certificate applied consists of a number of modules grouped under three general headings:</P>
    <P>(i)  General Education (at least 30 per cent of the time)</P>
    <P>(ii)  Vocational Education (at least 30 per cent of the time)</P>
    <P>(iii)  Vocational Preparation (at least 25 per cent of the time).</P>
    <P>The leaving certificate applied is intended to meet the needs of those students who either choose not to opt for other leaving certificate programmes or who are not adequately catered for by other leaving certificate programmes.</P>

However a schedule of travel and subsistence expenses paid to members of each vocational education committee while on committee business and the cost as a percentage of the main scheme non-pay expenditure follows.  The details refer to 1993.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137, 138 and 139 together.</P>
      <P>Radon tests have been carried out in primary schools in counties Clare, Galway, Mayo and Sligo by the Radiological Institute of Ireland.  The necessary mitigation works have been carried out in almost all of the 54 schools identified as having radon levels above 150 becquerels per cubic metre.  The remaining cases will be completed in the near future.</P>
      <P>The normal grant level appropriate to the individual school is being paid in respect of the necessary mitigation works.</P>
      <P>The Radiological Institute of Ireland is currently assessing the radon levels in domestic properties in County Donegal. When the results of these tests are to hand a decision will be made on whether or not it will be necessary to assess the radon levels in primary schools in the county.  This procedure will be followed in the other counties throughout the country as they are assessed by the Radiological Institute of Ireland.</P>

    <P>However, my Department is prepared to consider allowing the child avail of concessionary fare-paying transport. This concession may be granted provided that the written agreement of the board of management of the nearest <Col N="663" /> school to the provision of such transport is secured.</P>
    <P>The granting of the fare-paying concession is also subject to there being room on the bus after all eligible children have been accommodated, and to no extra State cost being incurred in facilitating the child.</P>

      <P>Both University College Dublin and the Dublin Institute of Technology run five year courses for the training of architectural students.</P>
      <P>In UCD students are required to prepare designs for new buildings, or for the conversion of existing buildings, and it is a requirement that all such designs must take into account the aspect of access for disabled people.  From time to time, also, students take part in architectural competitions which focus on access for disabled people.</P>
      <P>In the Dublin Institute of Technology students are introduced to the issue of designing for the disabled in year two of the course.  From then on all building design projects must include provision for the disabled as a matter of course.  In addition some projects have the specific objective of accommodating the needs of the disabled.</P>
      <P>All design projects undertaken by students of architecture have to comply with the current building regulations which contain specific requirements dealing with access for disabled people.</P>

      <P>My Department provides a range of special support services <Col N="665" /> directed at addressing the special educational needs of children with disabilities. The supports in question in the primary and second-level school sectors can take the form of special teaching and other resources.  The nature of the supports delivered is determined by the particular needs of the children in question.</P>
      <P>In the case of pupils in the primary school sector, the following range of supports were provided and funded by my Department in 1994: 1,526 special teachers employed in 607 special schools and special classes dedicated to the needs of particular groups of children with disabilities; 37 visiting teachers delivering a special support service for children with disabilities attending ordinary schools; 26 resource teachers delivering special back-up support to ordinary teaching staff in meeting the special needs of children with disabilities attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis; 123 child care assistants who assist teaching staff in dealing with the special needs of children with disabilities.</P>
      <P>At second level, a total of 78 resource teachers are in place to provide special educational support to children with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The total annual salary costs for the above posts is estimated at £33.4 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the above extra staffing supports, the following special measures are funded by my Department: £3,100,000 to cover the cost of part-time teaching schemes which provide supplementary education services to certain children with disabilities; £2.413 million in special capitation funding for pupils attending special schools and special classes; £8 million approximately on special transport services for children with disabilities attending special schools and special classes; £100,000 in grant aid to facilitate the appointment of escorts to accompany certain categories of children on school transport services; £547,000 in grants for the purchase of special equipment to assist children with disabilities; and £452,000 <Col N="666" /> to meet the travel and other costs of the visiting teacher service and the remedial teacher service.</P>
    <P>At third level a special fund exists to assist students suffering from physical disabilities.  The amount allocated out of this fund in 1994 was £80,000.</P>

In addition a sergeant has recently been assigned to the community policing unit with a view to enhancing the liaison between the Garda Síochána and the local community.</P>
      <P>The areas mentioned are patrolled on a 24 hour basis and, if necessary, the divisional task force based at Crumlin can be called on for assistance.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of manpower and resources, have informed me that they are satisfied that the policing strengths of the areas are adequate at the present time.  However, the situation will be kept under constant review and when manpower next becomes available, the allocation of additional resources to the Rathfarnham area will be considered in the context of the overall requirements in the Dublin Metropolitan Area.</P>

A number of issues were raised and concern was expressed about youths congregating in the vicinity late at night.  Also, it was indicated that the residents were in the process of forming their own residents' association and they were assured of complete co-operation from the gardaí in this worthwhile venture.  A garda has been appointed from the neighbourhood police unit to liaise with this group of residents and to continue to have ongoing meetings to discuss various issues of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>Night patrols have been instructed to pay special attention to the area and to use their powers under the Public Order Act to disperse the youths in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 152, 153, 154 and 155 together.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána (Compensation) Acts, 1941 and 1945 provide for a system of compensation to members of the Garda Síochána maliciously injured as a result of their membership of the Force.</P>
      <P>Applications under the Acts are made to the Minister for Justice on the relevant forms as prescribed in Statutory Order No. 413 of 1941 &mdash; Garda Síochána (Application for Compensation) Regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a completed application form is received &mdash; almost invariably via a solicitor on the applicant's behalf &mdash; the Garda Commissioner is notified and a report is sought from him on the circumstances of the injury: this report incorporates a final prognosis by the Garda surgeon on the injury sustained. <Col N="672" /> An applicant is listed for examination by the surgeon only after the applicant's attending doctors have submitted their final medical reports on injuries sustained. As things stand, it can take an average of 2 years between the application being received and the Commissioner's report, including the surgeon's final prognosis, being submitted to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Once the Commissioner's report is received the Minister for Justice must then make a decision, under the terms of section 6 of the 1941 Act, as to the issuing of an authorisation allowing the applicant to apply to the High Court for compensation under the Acts.</P>
    <P>Under this section of the Act, the Minister for Justice, in deciding on the question of the issue of an authorisation must, <i>inter alia</i>, have regard to the character of the injury sustained.  It is necessary for me to be advised by the Garda surgeon as to the nature of the injury sustained and, in particular, how the injury affects the member in relation to the performance of his or her duties. Thus, medical reports from claimants are accepted by me as a basis in coming to a decision under section 6 of the 1941 Act in relation to the issue of an authorisation. However, such reports must be considered by the Garda surgeon, usually in conjunction with a medical examination of the applicant, prior to his advice being given to me.  The surgeon's report, along with all other medical reports, is made available to the High Court and is taken into account by the Court in deciding the seriousness of the injury and hence the amount of compensation to be awarded.</P>
    <P>Following are details of the operation of the above Acts for each of the years 1989 to 1994 inclusive.</P>
    <P>The cases shown in column (2) are not necessarily represented also in column (3) because of the delay which can sometimes occur between the actual application and subsequent court hearing.</P>

      <P>The free telephone rental allowance is available to people who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments and who are either living alone or only with children or persons who, because they are so permanently incapacitated, could not get help in an emergency. People in those circumstances are vulnerable in certain respects and, <Col N="680" /> accordingly, the main purpose of the allowance is to ensure that they have some way of summoning help when it is needed.</P>
      <P>The living alone condition was eased with effect from July 1994 for pensioners aged 75 or over.  From that date, those aged 75 or over and entitled to the free telephone rental allowance retain the allowance where another person comes to live with them.  Similarly, this concession is also available to couples as soon as the pensioner in receipt of the qualifying payment reaches age 75.  In the case of the spouse of the pensioner reaching age 75 before the pensioner, the free telephone rental allowance may be awarded to the spouse subject to satisfying the usual conditions in his or her own right.  This requires the spouse being in receipt of a qualifying payment and having the telephone registered in his or her own name.  On the basis of the details supplied, it is unlikely that the person concerned would qualify in her own right.</P>
      <P>The concession in relation to the living alone condition is age related in respect of either one of a couple who meets the conditions of the scheme.  In that regard, men and women are treated equally.  The proposal put forward in the context of the case referred to by the Deputy is that the free telephone rental allowance should be available to a pensioner under 75 when his or her spouse reaches 75.  This would clearly have cost implications and could be considered only in the context of available resources and I will have the matter examined in that regard.  I should mention that the free telephone rental allowance currently serves about 132,000 people at an annual cost of £23 million.</P>

    <P>I stress that many of these programmes would apply to persons with short term illnesses who would not be persons with disabilities as this is commonly understood.  In the absence of a practical definition of disability, it is not possible to provide a breakdown of these numbers.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for disabled person's maintenance allowance is being transferred to my Department.  Expenditure on this programme in 1994 was over £100 million in respect of some 31,000 recipients.</P>

      <P>Bord Fáilte's survey on overseas tourists, SOT, has been conducted annually on a continuous basis since 1972.  The objective of the survey is to collect information on the most important traveller and trip characteristics of overseas tourists to Ireland. Each year up to 10,000 overseas tourists are interviewed at the major air and sea ports as they leave the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to information on routing, purpose of visit, accommodation usage, places visited, activities engaged in, expenditure, etc., tourists are asked whether there were particular aspects <Col N="683" /> about their visit which were unsatisfactory and whether they have any particular suggestions as to how a visit to Ireland could be improved.</P>
    <P>In addition to the survey of overseas tourists, Bord Fáilte has also commissioned the visitor attitude survey, a survey of overseas tourists attitudes to Ireland as a holiday destination.  This survey has been conducted every three to five years, most recently in 1993.  In this survey departing overseas tourists are given a self-completion questionnaire, in addition to a reply paid envelope, and are asked to comment on their motivations and experiences, and in particular their satisfaction with the Irish tourism product.</P>
    <P>In 1993 more than 3,000 completed questionnaires were returned.  Respondents were asked to comment directly on the quality and price of accommodation, food, including food in pubs and bars, internal transport, tourist shipping, and activities/pastimes.  Suggestions were also invited as to how the quality of these products could be improved.</P>
    <P>Overall, respondents were asked to detail how their experience of Ireland either exceeded, or failed to live up to, their expectations.  To date neither the survey of overseas tourists or the visitor attitude survey has registered any measurable reference to problems associated with smoking in bars or lounges.</P>

      <P>My Department is the national authority for all matters related to the European Social Fund, which promotes the development of human resources across a broad range of statutory training agencies.  Under the Operational Programme for Human Resources Development, 1994-99, £281.71 million has been allocated in Exchequer and EU funds to promote the activities specifically in favour of people with a disability.  Activity related to this expenditure is administered directly by the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department has direct responsibility for the administration of the HORIZON-DISABLED strand of the EU Human Resources EMPLOYMENT Initiative. Projects funded under HORIZON-DISABLED promote innovative transnational actions in favour of those with a disability.  During the period 1992-94, EU funding of £8.5 million was made available.  An allocation of £16 million in EU funding has been made for the period 1995-99.</P>

    <P>In general, apart from HORIZON-DISABLED, the programmes and schemes relating to employment or training which are administered by my Department or its related agencies are not specifically directed towards meeting the needs of the disabled.  Nevertheless, disabled persons who meet normal eligibility criteria may benefit from them, for example, the community <Col N="685" /> employment programme and the county enterprise programme.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for managing the export refund system in the cattle and beef sector, including the fixing of refund rates, rests with the EU Commission in consultation with the beef management committee.  Refund rates are not differentiated according to member state.</P>
      <P>I have, on a number of occasions, made known my views in regard to the importance of slaughtering and processing as many cattle as possible within the country in order to provide maximum benefit to the national economy. For this reason, my policy is to ensure that the refund levels for live cattle do not provide any advantage to live exports over exports of beef and, in so far as possible, that the export refund system favours the export of beef. However, I do not consider that it would be appropriate to suggest the complete withdrawal of export refunds on live animals and in any event such a suggestion would not be acceptable to the European Commission or other member states.</P>

      <P>The exportation of greyhounds from Ireland to Spain is a legitimate trade within the Internal Market.  In so far as transport is concerned, it is governed by the Diseases of Animals (Protection of Animals during Transport) Order, 1995, which I introduced recently.  Most greyhound exports were in the past organised by Bord na gCon.  I understand that, in 1991, following allegations of ill-treatment of dogs at Spanish greyhound tracks, the board decided to suspend its sales/export agency in relation to the Spanish market. The World Greyhound Racing Federation, WGRF, also carried out an investigation into conditions within Spanish greyhound racing at that time and, while concluding that no deliberate acts of cruelty were observed, made certain recommendations, mainly in relation to kennelling facilities and the training of personnel.</P>
      <P>Since the suspension of Bord na gCon's involvement, some export activity between Ireland and Spain has been taking place, but the trade is small. I have written to, and discussed with, my Spanish counterpart the allegations about Spanish greyhound racing and have been assured that the WGRF recommendations are being observed and that the situation there is much improved.</P>

      <P>Departmental records indicate that two persons have been in contact with the Department &mdash; in 1989 and 1993 &mdash; in the matter of the effect of sheep dip on their health.  In relation to the 1993 case, my Department arranged with the relevant local authority that the flockowner in question would be issued a certificate of exemption from diping under Article 12 of the Sheep Dipping Order, 1965, on account of his medical condition.  In the 1989 case the person concerned was contemplating litigation against a third <Col N="688" /> party without Derpartmental involvement and, accordingly, no further action was taken.  My Department keeps in close contact with the Department of Health and other relevant agencies on aspects of the agricultural industry which would have implications for human health.  Following consultation with the National Drugs Advisory Board in 1994, my Department reduced the number of approved sheep dips from 17 to six.  Additionally, the National Drugs Advisory Board recently authorised an injectable product for the treatment of sheep scab and is currently considering an application for authorisation for a further injectable product on which successful trials were carried out by my Department in consultation with the manufacturer concerned. These products are substitutes for dips.</P>

      <P>The Irish Aviation Authority informs me that the regulatory fee levels set out in the recent Air Navigation Fees Order (S.I. No. 74 of 1995), made by the authority, were designed to ensure that the costs incurred by the authority in each of the regulatory functions discharged by the authority are recovered from the companies, organisations and persons who benefit from them.  This is in accordance with the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993, (No. 29 of 1993), which obliges the authority to conduct its affairs so that its revenues are sufficient to meet its costs.</P>
      <P>In the case of the fees for flight tests, the authority informs me that, prior to the recent increase, the fees had not been changed for a number of years, with the result that serious disparities had arisen between the cost of discharging the regulatory service and the fees being charged.  It was necessary, therefore, for the authority to increase these fees in order to cover the costs incurred by the authority.</P>
      <P>The fees order was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 3 May 1995, in accordance with section 6 of the Act.  Under this section, the order shall be annulled if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either House of the Oireachtas, within 21 sitting days, from the date the order was laid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 177, 178 and 179 together.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy and the House of my commitment to securing improved access to public transport for people with mobility handicaps, including wheelchair users.  There is at present an Inter-Departmental Transport Accessibility Committee which is chaired by my Department.  Its primary objective is to secure such improvements in accessibility to all modes of public transport as can be implemented within the existing resources of public transport providers and other relevant bodies.  Irish Rail, Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath are represented on the committee and participate fully in its work.</P>
      <P>As a result of initiatives taken by my Department through the committee, there have been considerable improvements in public transport access facilities for people with mobility handicaps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as rail services are concerned, it is now Iarnród Éireann's policy that all new rail vehicles will be accessible to people with disabilities.  DART trains are wheelchair-accessible as are the new Arrow railcars, which also have wheelchair-accessible toilets.  The new carriages for the Dublin-Belfast service will also have this facility, while the existing Intercity trains all have at least one dedicated area for wheelchair users in the dining cars.  All major railway terminals and the majority of mainline and <Col N="692" /> DART stations are wheelchair-accessible and it is company policy that all new stations and any major refurbishment of existing stations should make provision for the disabled.  In addition, particular attention is being given to the needs of people with mobility handicaps in the design of the proposed light rail system for Dublin.</P>
    <P>As regards bus services, investments by CIE in bus replacement is a matter for the day to day management of the CIE Group.  Both Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann endeavour to obtain the most accessible and user-friendly vehicles available on a cost-effective basis.  Both companies in replacing their urban fleets are guided by the recommended specifications of the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee, a UK statutory body which advises on the needs and requirements of the mobility impaired.  Bus Éireann has also acquired 130 improved coaches for their expressway network, which include a facility whereby the front of the coach may be lowered to facilitate access.</P>
    <P>Wheelchair users present the greatest accessibility challenge to bus operators, the main problem being the lack of affordable, operationally-proven and cost-effective wheelchair-accessible buses.  In this connection, the introduction of more than 90 wheelchair-accessible taxis in the Dublin area represents a significant step towards providing a flexible, door-to-door facility corresponding to the particular needs of wheelchair users.  At the same time, Bus Átha Cliath, with EU funding under the Horizon programme, has purchased 5 wheelchair accessible minibuses and these will operate a new service to be introduced shortly.  The operation of the service will be monitored and assessed by the inter-Departmental committee as part of its ongoing programme to maximise the accessibility of public transport infrastructure and services.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the new service to be introduced by Bus Átha Cliath under the Horizon Programme, there are no other public transport projects specifically for the disabled funded from <Col N="693" /> EU funds.  Investment in new buses is funded by CIE from within its own resources.  No EU financial assistance is available for bus fleet replacement.</P>

      <P>The Department does not operate specific schemes directed towards meeting the needs of people with disabilities and therefore the question of expenditure does not arise.  Facilities for employees with disabilities are provided for as required and are not specifically costed.</P>
      <P>With regard to expenditure on such schemes by State bodies under the aegis of my Department, I have been informed by these bodies of various measures and programmes for people with disability.  The associated cost of these initiatives is not easily identified as it is subsumed into the overall costs of the bodies concerned.</P>
      <P>However, I can specify expenditure of about £400,000 by the CIE Group during 1994, including a once-off expenditure by Dublin Bus on five wheelchair accessible mini-buses.  I can also indicate financial support by Telecom Éireann for the National Relay Service for the deaf to the amount of £416,000 and a free directory inquiry service for the visual impaired at a cost of some £68,000 per annum.</P>

      <P>While the playing area referred to is still subject to very substantial use by the military, it may be possible to provide local football clubs limited use under certain conditions.  The Department will, in the meantime, consider applications for such use.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the Army Pensions Acts, a disability pension or gratuity may, subject to certain conditions, be paid to a former member of the Defence Forces in respect of permanent disablement due to a wound or injury received on duty or otherwise attributable to service or in respect of a disease attributable to or aggravated by service overseas with the United Nations.  There is a provision of £3.615 million in the 1995 Army Pensions Vote for the payment of these pensions/gratuities.</P>
      <P>At present, personnel with disabilities comprise 4.6 per cent of the Civil Service staff at the Department.  The salary cost in respect of these personnel is approximately £230,000 per annum. Some 2 per cent of civilian employees engaged with the Defence Forces have disabilities.  The annual salary cost in their case is approximately £320,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="695" /> In accordance with Government policy, arrangements are being made to improve the access facilities for persons with a disability who call to the Department's main office.  The cost is estimated at £2,000.</P>
